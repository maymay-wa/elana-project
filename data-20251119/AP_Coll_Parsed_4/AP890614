the charismatic country lawyer who 
restored democracy to argentina looked miserable when he admitted on 
national television that the economic crisis was forcing him out of 
office early 
president raul alfonsin had often said that his fondest wish was 
to finish his sixyear term and complete the countrys first 
transfer of power between elected presidents since 1928 
instead he found himself telling the nation monday evening no 
president has the right to ask people to continue to sacrifice if 
his conscience tells him he can temper it by an action of his own 
a few minutes later after several nervous coughs and sips of 
water he said he would step down on june 30 instead of on dec 10 
when his term ends 
presidentelect carlos menem whose peronist party swept national 
elections on may 14 said tuesday he would take over 
i would say alfonsin is a bitter man juan manuel casella an 
adviser and friend said in an interview 
he feels he has been treated unjustly said casella the 
governing radical civic unions losing candidate for vice president 
in the elections i think he will get over it quickly but thats 
how he feels now 
hopes were high when alfonsin 62 was elected in october 1983 to 
replace a brutal military dictatorship his campaign theme was 
with democracy there will be food health and education 
more than five years later inflation has soared beyond 1000 
percent and the local currency has lost 94 percent of its value 
against the dollar since february the decline in real wages 
prompted hungry people earlier this month to loot supermarkets in 
this huge fertile country that has more cattle and sheep than 
people at least 14 people died in the rioting 
the worst thing alfonsin did was destroy morale said diana 
mondino a 30yearold economist and teacher young people think 
they have no future and they have reason to think that 
alfonsin opened university enrollment to anyone without admission 
requirements and destroyed public education in the process she 
said noting also that teachers pay has been cut to the point where 
many of the best have left the field 
human rights environmental and religious groups say alfonsin has 
been indifferent to their concerns the peronists citing scandals 
in the customs office and national mortgage bank claim his 
administration is rife with corruption 
alfonsin privately admits he made mistakes he should have tried 
to sell off moneylosing staterun businesses earlier than he did 
he has told colleagues and put a higher priority on balancing the 
budget 
supporters say alfonsin consolidated democracy but was confronted 
by factors beyond his control 
world prices for argentinas farm exports nosedived in the 
mid1980s and restricted the countrys ability to raise money for 
investment and make payments on its 60 billion foreign debt 
right from the start the peronists controlled a majority of 
provincial legislatures and seats in the national senate and 
alfonsin rarely was able to forge a truly bipartisian policy 
the 4millionmember general labor confederation mounted 13 
general strikes factions of the armed forces seeking an end to 
trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during the 197683 
dictatorship staged three barracks revolts 
these things explain why we werent allowed to finish things as 
we liked said deputy cesar jaroslavsky of alfonsins party we 
couldnt do more we lacked the power to do more 
if alfonsin is going out under a cloud rather than a rainbow he 
is not moving far from center stage he will remain president of 
argentinas secondbiggest party and a fixture on the political 
scene 
you cant count him out said a foreign political observer on 
condition of anonoymity hes intelligent dedicated principled 
hes a brilliant public speaker who touches peoples hearts by no 
means have we seen the last of raul alfonsin

the federal government has approved two routes for 
joint uscanadian lowlevel bomber training flights over 
northwestern canada defense minister bill mcknight said wednesday 
mcknight told the house of commons the flights will begin this 
fall over northern saskatchewan alberta british columbia and over 
part of the northwest territories 
he said the flights were approved at the request of north 
american aerospace defense command the joint uscanada air 
defense network known as norad and are necessary for the defense of 
north america 
talking to reporters outside the commons he said the training 
will not be on a scale comparable to that in labrador where 
lowlevel flights have generated a bitter battle with the innu 
indians who say their way of life is being destroyed by noise 
the flights in western canada will involve up to 25 planes per 
day four days a year with the first flights this fall the planes 
would be unarmed and will not fly faster than the speed of sound 
however a spokesman for the assembly of first nations said he 
was not aware of any consultation with natives about the flights 
its news to us to say theres been consultation i dont know 
who hes been consulting said harry allen vicechief for the 
northwest territories in an interview 
allen said native americans oppose military training flights in 
western canada for the same reasons they oppose them in labrador 
its disruption of the way of life it has an impact on wild 
game and those issues are common right across the northern 
regions he said 
mcknight said an environmental impact study of the flights had 
been conducted by a private firm and the study has been reviewed by 
a branch of the federal environmental assessment review office 
which approved the plan

china eagerly awaits them but foreign businessmen 
who return in coming weeks will bring a new wariness about their 
prospects 
a lot of people really believed in the china dream a western 
economic specialist said tuesday but since the government sent 
soldiers to crush prodemocracy protests the vision of the future 
is harder to believe in 
thousands of businessmen fled beijing after the military 
crackdown june 34 and days of random shooting that followed 
most americans left and some joint ventures with us companies 
closed either totally or partially immediately after the military 
assault on the students in tiananmen square 
a chinese employee at the babcock and wilcox machinery plant said 
it was closed for five days and still was not in full operation all 
the americans left the country 
americans involved in all but four of about 200 joint operations 
were evacuated nearly all the approximately 3000 japanese 
businessmen and their families left china 
china hopes all the foreigners will return i expect all will 
be back very soon since security is now no problem for them said 
zheng tuobin minister of foreign economic relations and trade 
he said the foreigners had suffered in the past month because of 
sabotage from ruffians and apologized for inconvenience 
caused by domestic unrest 
zheng and other chinese officials including senior leader deng 
xiaoping gave assurances china would continue the active promotion 
of foreign investment 
us officials said they expected many businessmen to return next 
week barring further shooting or ugly antiamerican 
demonstrations 
japanese sources said trading companies were eager to resume 
operations but were being restrained by their government which 
sought to avoid giving the impression of business as usual at a time 
of political repression 
the foreign economic expert speaking privately said business as 
usual was impossible while soldiers were in the streets and 
protesters were being arrested 
few companies will leave china he said but some will reduce 
their staff and new investment will be postponed 
because they viewed future prospects as bright foreign companies 
in the past endured timeconsuming contract talks arbitrary 
regulations complex customs procedures communist party 
interference and excessive foreign exchange controls 
according to the foreign expert theres a lot to suggest it 
might get worse under the new government 
some analysts say the violent crackdown may have shattered 
confidence in chinas stability and commitment to reform for years 
to come 
among businessmen the perception is that china has the 
potential to have even more violent incidents down the road said 
robert c broadfoot managing director in hong kong of risk 
consultancy ltd 
we have been harboring illusions with regard to china said 
miron mushkat director and chief economist of baring securities 
ltd in hong kong this will be a sobering reminder that doing 
business in china can be a hazardous business 
hong kong a british colony is scheduled to revert to china in 
1997 
since china opened its doors to economic modernization in 1979 
companies from about 40 countries have invested the equivalent of 
12 billion and established 10000 joint operations 
in the first four months of 1989 china approved 2000 new 
operations with pledged investment of 245 billion 
mushkat said the leadership probably would neglect the economy in 
coming weeks to focus on cementing political power 
even before the turmoil potential investors were being dissuaded 
by a government austerity program meant to curb 30 percent annual 
inflation and excessive growth the economic slowdown dried up 
credit and halted price reforms and other measures needed to make 
the economy more efficient 
at the government level the european economic community and 
canada are considering economic sanctions if china continues 
reprisals against protesters japanese dailies have said japan the 
main source of development aid for china is reluctant to resume 
assistance to a repressive government 
malaysia which inaugurated flights to china only last week has 
abruptly suspended the new route and prime minister lee kuan yew of 
singapore whose small nation has actively invested in china warned 
of people resentful reforms stalled and the economy stagnant 
because of her size such a china could create problems for 
herself and her neighbors in asia lee said 
wu ganmei executive director of the nongovernmental china 
association of science and technology said the open door will be 
affected temporarily im concerned but expressed hope the 
businessmen would return 
we dont want to talk about politics she said were doing 
business her association organizes joint business seminars for 
foreigners and chinese

every time budapest residents pass a 
kiosk or street stall these days a new book or article about imre 
nagy and the failed revolt he led against stalinism in 1956 seems to 
have hit the stands 
the outpouring of literature accompanied by lapel pins 
postcards and large photographs showing the bespectacled face of 
nagy represents a national catharsis over the shortlived revolt 
it was crushed by soviet tanks and rarely discussed in public for 
almost 33 years 
its as if more than 32 years of collective amnesia have 
suddenly lifted a western diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity even the people who were on the side of putting down 
the revolt now suddenly remember where they were and what they did 
and are speaking about it 
the ruling communist party which under former general secretary 
janos kadar executed nagy and his associates in 1958 has 
rehabilitated nagy in all but name 
the party praised him in a may 31 statement as a symbol of 
communist reform and a significant figure in hungarian history 
ten days later the supreme prosecutor applied for the legal 
rehabilitation of nagy and nine of his associates saying they were 
unjustly imprisoned unfairly tried and illegally executed 
nagy and his associates were buried in unmarked graves in a 
corner of a budapest cemetery but they will be reburied on june 16 
in an elaborate nationally televised ceremony 
tens of thousands of hungarians including emigres returning for 
the occasion are expected to jam budapests heroes square for 
ceremonies 
in a move much joked about by budapests increasingly outspoken 
media authorities have even removed a giant nearby statue of soviet 
founder vladimir i lenin but insist this is only because it 
urgently needs repair 
some hungarians are tempted to see parallels between nagys 
reburial and the reburial early in october 1956 of former foreign 
minister laszlo rajk executed in a communist party purge in 1949 
then as now upheaval in poland and a revision of stalinist 
history in the soviet union helped unsettle hungary the crowds at 
rajks funeral on oct 6 1956 became the emotional force behind 
the uprising from oct 23 to nov 4 
historian ferenc toekei a member of the partys central 
committee and one of four people investigating the events of 1956 
for the party said in an interview that history never repeats 
itself 
it is simply unimaginable that in the foreseeable future we 
could expect an armed uprising he said 
emotions over 1956 clearly play a part in todays politics 
however 
they began rising to the surface in january when radical 
politburo reformer imre pozsgay said on national radio that the 1956 
revolt was a popular uprising not a counterrevolution as the 
party had branded it for 32 years 
the startling announcement led to a flood of reminiscences about 
the revolt and its leaders by historians and surviving relatives 
the growing number of newspaper articles journals and books 
about 1956 and its unsung heroes culminated this month in the first 
officially sanctioned edition of the memoirs of cardinal joszef 
mindszenty he was freed from prison in the revolt but forced to 
take refuge in the us legation for years afterward 
popular feeling over 1956 is behind reformers such as pozsgay 
helping them bend the communist partys policies in the direction of 
more change and undermining centrists such as communist leader 
karoly grosz 
in may the party signaled how far it had moved in the 12 months 
since grosz succeeded kadar as general secretary 
kadar who took power as the soviet tanks rolled into hungary in 
1956 was unceremoniously stripped of the honorary party presidency 
he was given last year and lost his seat on the central committee 
which criticized mistakes during his long rule 
kadars departure left unanswered questions about his exact role 
in ending the 1956 revolt 
toekei says the facts will emerge now that historians rather than 
politicians are examining archives and interpreting their materials 
a similar process is under way in the soviet union where the 
sheer scale of stalinist terror and the weight of 70 years of 
silence add to the emotion of new discoveries 
toekei said it had nonetheless proved difficult to get all the 
necessary documents about 1956 from the soviets perhaps because of 
moscows current preoccupation with its own history and problems 
papers from kremlin archives are only trickling in he said

for engineers who dream of graceful steel and 
concrete bridges from here to there plenty of rivers are still to 
be crossed as well as many interesting bays creeks and even 
gullies 
little boys and girls play with toys and hope to grow up to 
build bridges and we do it now can you feel the selfsatisfaction 
here said herbert m mandel a bridge designer who is chairman of 
the sixth annual international bridge conference 
nearly 1000 of the worlds bridge engineers are meeting for 
three days to catch up on the latest in bridge design construction 
techniques and materials 
engineers at the conference readily admitted they often dream of 
designing one bridge that will inspire travelers and stand the test 
of time 
were always looking for that next bridge and hope to make 
something special we put up monuments even a small bridge is a 
monument said mandel a pittsburgharea engineer who designed the 
newport suspension bridge across rhode islands narragansett bay 
they also fretted that computers are being used to turn out 
identical dull bridges instead of helping designers with 
innumerable technical calculations on beautiful bridges 
the typical highway crossing doesnt have to be unique but it 
shouldnt be ugly either mandell said it needs to be 
pleasing 
as for standing the test of time mandell said most designers 
expect an average bridge to last 50 years much more with proper 
maintenance 
as a general principle a bridge cannot last forever mandell 
said but we dont know how long theyll last 
participants at the conference advanced their study of modern 
cablestayed bridges pioneered in europe in the 1950s but 
relatively new to the united states cablestayed bridges are 
shorter variations of suspension bridges with cables emanating like 
an inverted fan from single center towers 
aesthetically theyre just outstanding mandel said 
theyre a work of art and we have to look at our bridges as works 
of art we have to have bridges were proud to look at 
americas most spectacular cablestayed bridge is the 2yearold 
sunshine skyway across the shipping channel of tampa bay 
surely cablestayed bridges are here to stay said blair 
birdsall a renowned senior bridge engineer from allendale nj 
but the suspension bridge will always reign over very long spans 
birdsall predicted suspension bridges with 10000foot main 
spans the humber bridge at hull england is the worlds longest 
with a main span of 4626 feet second is the verrazanonarrows 
bridge across lower new york bay at 4260 feet and third is san 
franciscos golden gate bridge 60 feet shorter 
engineers at the meeting talked excitedly about the latest in 
bigbridge building the massive honshushikoku bridge project 
which is to link the japanese islands of honshu and shikoku with 
three separate causeways of multiple bridges 
the first causeway the kojimasakaide route opened 14 months 
ago with three suspension bridges the longest is the worlds 
fifthlongest two cablestayed bridges a truss bridge a land 
tunnel and viaducts over more than 8 miles 
the engineers honored the projects designer tsutumu yamane of 
tokyo yamane in turn remembered john a roebling the 
19thcentury american engineer who designed the brooklyn bridge 
which opened in 1883 and was the first modern suspension bridge 
our work is in many ways based on established work of mr 
roebling and his brooklyn bridge yamane said its amazing that 
a bridge built more than 100 years ago is still standing with all 
that traffic

calling the arrests of hundreds of 
prodemocracy demonstrators in china very disturbing the state 
department said tuesday it will begin granting visas for temporary 
visits to the united states for chinese who want to leave the 
country 
it wasnt immediately clear whether the officials who have been 
cracking down on dissenters and other prodemocracy forces in china 
will permit those who apply for the us visas to leave 
nonetheless department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
us embassy in beijing and the consulate in shanghai will begin 
issuing socalled nonimmigrant visas which would permit short 
visits to the united states 
students sought by the police were unlikely to apply because they 
would expose themselves to arrest also they would need the 
approval of their schools to get the temporary visas 
the detention or arrest of people for exercising their basic 
human rights of freedom of expression and free association is 
contrary to internationally recognized standards the spokeswoman 
said 
noting that chinese news media have reported the arrests of 
hundreds of sons in its continued crackdown of the prodemocracy 
movement ms tutwiler said these arrests are very disturbing 
she called on the authorities to respond to the dissidents with 
dialogue instead of repression 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile was presented 
with a list of possible sanctions that could be imposed against 
china 
baker also held his second session with chinese ambassador han xu 
in three days apparently to discuss the touchy case of chinese 
dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian who have taken refuge 
in the us embassy in beijing 
the us action has enraged chinese officials who have issued an 
arrest warrant for fang and his wife 
ms tutwiler refused to provide details or to characterize the 
session which took place monday she said the meeting was requested 
by the chinese envoy 
baker was believed to be exploring ways to arrange safe passage 
from china for fang the countrys best known dissident and his 
wife but us officials concerned about the couples welfare 
declined to discuss the case 
baker according to a report tuesday in hearst newspapers on 
saturday proposed to the ambassador that fang and his wife be 
permitted to leave the embassy and china for a third country a 
department spokeswoman tuesday night declined to comment on the 
report 
asked about the options presented to baker ms tutwiler called 
them a laundry list of possible options should the need arise 
the secretary had not discussed the options with president bush she 
said 
the president imposed military aid and sales to china for the 
bloody massacre of prodemocracy protestors and said he reserved the 
option of taking other punitive steps 
chinese troops have been posted near the us embassy in beijing 
apparently an effort to prevent anyone from following fangs example 
however ms tutwiler said she was not aware of any harassment 
of people standing in line 
meanwhile aflcio president lane kirkland denounced a 
governmentcontrolled labor organization in china for its support of 
the violent crackdown on student and other prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
by all accounts the allchina federation of labor has sided 
with the government against the workers who took to the streets 
kirkland said the aflcio has long refused contacts with this 
statecontrolled labor front 
its shameful behavior in the current crisis vindicates our 
contention that like its counterparts in other communist countries 
it does not represent the interests of workers but serves as an 
instrument of the communist party and the government 
kirkland also called on american businesses to halt all 
operations in china until the government makes progress toward the 
democratic principles that inspired hundreds of thousands of workers 
and students to risk their lives

state and federal prisons already straining to 
meet the courtordered medical needs of record numbers of inmates 
face the costly new problem of geriatrics the growing population of 
those graying behind bars requires longterm care special diets and 
treatment for failing eyes and teeth some prisons have geriatric 
units but as one new jersey corrections official says we know 
how to run prisons we dont know how to run oldage homes the 
last of a threepart series medicine behind bars looks at 
elderly care in prisons

augustus bass has had seven heart attacks and 
a stroke he has arthritis high blood pressure and recurring chest 
pains the 67yearold man is also locked up in prison serving 515 
years for manslaughter 
this is a good place to bring you to let you die said bass 
his closecropped beard and thinning hair flecked with gray if 
you have a heart attack in prison youre up the creek without a 
paddle 
its pretty depressing to be old and in prison said bass 
who limps about with a cane every time you get a pain in your 
chest you dont know if its the last time i just dont want to 
die in here youd just be another number gone 
bass is 2 years into his sentence at kansas norton correctional 
facility where prison officials are building a geriatric unit to 
care for the special medical needs of elderly inmates 
nationwide the number of graying prisoners is growing due to a 
rising prison population and the introduction of nonparole and 
mandatory sentences in the mid1970s and they are beginning to pose 
costly health care problems 
as of last summer 18801 prisoners were older than 55 a 50 
percent increase in four years according to a tally by the american 
correctional association florida expects its elderly population to 
grow by 129 percent in 11 years 
these elderly inmates still a fraction of the 627402 total 
prisoners may have chronic heart liver lung and kidney 
conditions some suffer from cancer diabetes strokes alzheimers 
disease high blood pressure arthritis and the effects of years of 
alcohol and drug abuse 
they may need foods free of salt and sugar not the starchy fare 
served in mess halls now they require hearing aids eye glasses and 
dentures they may need ramps and elevators for their canes and 
wheelchairs or they may need an extra blanket in winter or a firmer 
mattress for their frail backs 
prisons were not designed for older people said julia hall 
a social psychologist at drexel university specializing in aging and 
criminals nobody is brutalizing them or purposely neglecting 
them but nobody is prepared to care for them and it is costly 
kansas where the elderly prison population doubled in six years 
has 153 inmates over 55 including 31 who are past 65 
a geriatric unit is being built at a former state tuberculosis 
hospital and mental unit surrounded by farm fields four miles 
outside this prairie town of 3400 residents 
the unit will be more like a college dorm than a prison 
cellblock outer doors including one leading to the chapel have 
wheelchair ramps 
cells are converted hospital rooms and close with wooden doors 
rather than steel bars inmates all medium or minimumsecurity 
prisoners will have keys to their rooms 
prison staff will be specially trained to be more sensitive to 
older inmates needs a gym and basketball court would presumably 
get little use so the recreation room will have board games each 
cell has a cable tv hookup to accommodate inmates too infirm to work 
its been a neglected population older people have more 
medical problems said louis bruce director of the norton prison 
when you get older you dont see as well you dont hear as well 
and you just cant get around as well 
corrections officials also want to separate them from young 
bullying inmates who might harm them 
they cant fend for themselves they just become easy prey 
theyre pretty fair game said jay shelton assistant prison 
director 
richard baker 66 came to the norton prison to serve his 
1to5year sentence for driving without a license after a drunken 
driving conviction he has emphysema arthritis and a heart 
condition and he was given a cane after twice falling down steps at 
the prison reception center in topeka 
i dont have any trouble getting down steps getting up them is 
a different story the whitehaired baker dressed in prison 
denim said with a laugh 
but he promptly stopped his joking i dont think the public or 
the institution sympathizes with us the attitude is let him die 
if you did the crime do the time he said i stay to myself i 
stay in my room and play solitary i dont mix with crowds i stay 
away from excitement 
ernest smith 57 serving 4 to 20 years for possession of 
marijuana said prison is a place called hell for the elderly 
its even worse everything hurts more in prison every emotion is 
intensified 
the indignities are manifold elderly inmates who need 
painkillers medications and sleeping pills must queue up two or 
three times a day for single doses individual prescriptions in 
bottles might encourage black market trade 
canes are given to lame or unsteady inmates only under special 
conditions for fear they could become weapons or vehicles for 
smuggling contraband even wheelchairs are searched 
we know how to run prisons we dont know how to run oldage 
homes said bud walsh an executive assistant in the new jersey 
department of corrections 
his state where the elderly inmate count is expected to increase 
fivefold in 11 years is considering adding a geriatric unit one 
study projects that 9 of 10 prisoners now in their 30s will be older 
than 50 before they get their first chance at parole or release 
the biggest complaint from elderly inmates is their medical 
problems arent being addressed fast enough walsh said we 
really dont do preventive medicine we dont have the staff and the 
facilities the regular prison unit is not equipped to handle the 
kinds of problems geriatric inmates present and the medical costs 
may be astronomical 
the average cost putting someone behind bars for a year is 
23000 but the tab for an elderly inmate triples mainly because 
of health needs according to larry fultz of the maryland parole 
commission 
money goes for such expensive operations as heart bypass surgery 
procedures like kidney dialysis or longterm medications for high 
blood pressure and enphysema 
at the eastern state correctional facility near philadelphia 
inmates formed the concerned seniors group they meet thursday 
evenings to discuss health care and other issues of concern 
its a sad way to end a life said drexels hall who helped 
organize the group they have such a sense of despair and 
depression they feel their lives have been totally wasted

japanese personal savings rose to 504 trillion at 
the end of fiscal 1988 an average of 126000 per household and up 
114 percent over the previous year the bank of japan said in a 
report today 
it was the third consecutive year that personal savings 
deposited at banks or postal offices and held in stocks bonds and 
insurance posted such a doubledigit increase said an official of 
the central bank 
an increase in household incomes thanks to the nations 
booming economy is contributing to a continued increase in 
savings said the official who spoke anonymously 
the official said an international comparison of savings was not 
available due to changes in exchange rates but said japans total 
personal savings is the second largest in the world after the united 
states which has twice as many people 
other bank officials said they anticipated no change in the trend 
of japanese putting away money for years to come 
numerous surveys say the heads of japans 40 million households 
save to prepare for illness and disaster or for retirement and 
education fees for children 
the united states has suggested that japanese should save less 
and buy more imports to cut the nations massive trade surplus 
which totaled 788 billion last year up from 7616 billion in 
1987 according to japanese figures

the detroit pistons swept away los 
angeles decade of dominance and ended a 41year title drought 
tuesday night beating the lakers 10597 to win the national 
basketball association championship 
most valuable player joe dumars who averaged 273 points in the 
finals scored 23 points to help give the pistons a 40 sweep of the

sixth in the 1980s

hopes of becoming the first team to make it through the postseason 
with a perfect record 
instead it was detroit that dominated giving the pistons their 
first title since the franchise started in 1948 in fort wayne ind 
james worthy led the lakers with a careerhigh 40 points but no 
one else had more than 13 for the twotime defending champions

an unprecedented plan by boston university to take 
over the chelsea public schools became law tuesday as gov michael 
s dukakis signed a bill that offered new hope to the troubled 
district but raised union opposition 
chelsea a city just northeast of boston with one of the most 
troubled school systems in massachusetts will receive new school 
buildings an infusion of money and the academic clout of bu in 
exchange the school committee will turn over management control of 
the schools to the university for a decade 
i want this effort to succeed i think we all do dukakis 
said were taking a step which will make it possible for it to 
succeed 
the legislation calls for an oversight committee to ensure that 
the university abides by state laws on public disclosure and open 
meetings even though the contract between the university and chelsea 
exempts the university from extensive scrutiny 
both teachers and national union officials worried the agreement 
would allow decisions about salaries and work rules behind closed 
doors the chelsea teachers union has a pending lawsuit over public 
disclosure and hispanic parents on tuesday challenged the plan 
because they feel they were left out of the process 
chelsea with 3500 students has a 17 percent dropout rate one 
of the highest rates in the state the teen pregnancy rate of 14 
percent is the highest in the state and nearly half the citys 
households earn less than 10000 per year

education programs such as early childhood education nutritional 
counseling and midcareer teacher retraining 
the university will also replace or upgrade buildings and infuse 
3 million per year to chelseas current 12 million school budget

two more diplomats attached to the chinese 
consulate here may be considering asking for political asylum 
because they dont want to inform on chinese students according to 
a published report 
the pair a husband and wife who work in the education section of 
the consulate of the peoples republic of china are staying with 
friends in the san francisco bay area despite being due back in 
beijing this week according to a report in wednesday editions of 
the san francisco chronicle 
quoting sources close to the couple who were not identified the 
paper said the diplomats had been expected to inform on chinese 
students engaged in us protests here over the june 4 massacre of 
demonstrators in tiananmen square 
they dont want to provide a blacklist said a friend of the 
couple who was identified only as a student leader at nearby 
stanford university 
wang shaohua a spokesman for the consulate denied the couple 
might be considering defection 
he said they left the consulate last week to live in a friends 
home for some time he added that their move was quite a bit 
unusual because the travel of communist consulate officials in the 
united states is restricted 
the newspaper said there were no documents on file at the state 
department about the couples move as would normally be required 
two other chinese diplomats from the consulate sought fbi 
protection saturday night after announcing at a city hall rally that 
they planned to defect because of the beijing governments 
propaganda campaign which claims no students were killed in the 
crackdown on the countrys prodemocracy movement 
the chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed mostly 
soldiers however chinese witnesses and western intelligence said 
the toll could be as high as 3000 most of them civilians 
zhou liming 26 vice consul for cultural affairs and zhang 
liming 25 vice consul for overseas affairs told the fbi that 
they wanted to seek political asylum in the united states they have 
since gone into hiding and are reportedly reconsidering their 
actions 
the district office of the immigration annd naturalization 
service did not immediately return a phone call tuesday night an 
fbi spokesman said the agency had not been contacted by any other 
diplomats seeking asylum

at a time president bush has urged 
americans help reduce air pollution by building cars that run on 
alcohol brazil is ending a similar experiment because it has proven 
so costly 
brazil in 1975 launched its proalcohol program and created 
millions of alcoholpowered cars in the worlds first largescale 
test of the fuel 
the leaders of this oilimporting country believed the program 
could mean not just greater energy independence but also big 
savings alcohol is made from sugar cane of which brazil is a 
leading producer 
today however the government is urging a return to 
oldfashioned polluting gasoline engines 
burdened with a huge foreign debt and 1000 percent inflation 
brazil says it simply cannot afford to subsidize the 40abarrel 
fuel 
proalcohol is inflationary and consumes as much energy as 
it produces said joao augusto gurgel a longtime critic and the 
owner of the gurgel auto plant 
in announcing measures to combat air pollution bush on monday 
offered incentives to the us auto industry to build cars that run 
on cleanerburning fuels such as alcohol and natural gas 
when brazils alcohol program started alcohol was simply mixed 
with gasoline at 22 percent to make gasohol 
in 1979 the program got more ambitious the first 2271 
purealcohol cars were produced to compensate for poor mileage the 
government made alcohol 35 percent cheaper than gasoline and offered 
tax breaks on the new cars 
the incentives worked sales of alcohol cars shot up from 03 
percent of total sales in 1979 to 285 percent the next year 
by 1985 alcohol cars accounted for 96 percent of all autos sold 
today 37 million of brazils 129 million vehicles run on pure 
alcohol 
the alcohol industry grew with it distilleries today produce 32 
billion gallons of alcohol a year five times more than a decade ago 
one of the benefits was less air pollution alcohol cars produce 
half the carbon monoxide of gasolinepowered ones and no harmful 
hydrocarbons 
but petrobras the government oil monopoly said it has spent 
649 million on alcohol subsidies since 1981 
worse when it raised alcohol prices the government had to raise 
gasoline prices too to keep the 35 percent spread the 
merrygoround of price increases added to inflation 
also offshore oil fields were discovered in brazil that made the 
country less dependent on imports brazil now produces about 600000 
barrels a day or about 55 percent of its oil needs 
in may world sugar prices rose and many brazilian cane growers 
sold their harvests for sugar instead of alcohol service stations 
in some cities simply ran out of the fuel 
it was like we were on the titanic approaching an iceberg but 
nobody believed it would hit and it did said petrobras 
president carlos santanna 
the government immediately reduced the amount of alcohol in 
gasohol to 18 percent and urged automakers to cut the number of 
purealcohol cars produced to 50 percent of the total 
sales of alcohol cars slumped last month and owners of such 
vehicles have lined up at mechanics to convert to gasoline 
it was a shock for the market consumers felt cheated said 
marcelo bairao spokesman for the syndicate of car dealers and 
distributors in sao paulo state 
the move back to gasoline will worsen air pollution in big 
cities environmentalists warn 
the quality of air has improved now were breathing better air 
because there is less carbon monoxide which is the principal 
pollutant said alfred szwarc manager of the vehicle pollution 
control department of cetesb sao paulos environmental protection 
agency 
szwarc said that despite other sources of pollution such as the 
widespread burning of the amazon rain forest the proalcohol 
program has improved the air primarily in urban centers 
still brazil doesnt plan to abandon the alcohol program and it 
has its defenders 
just because we dont need it now doesnt mean we should kill 
it said luiz avelar scheuer director of the local subsidiary of 
mercedez benz when a baby stops drinking milk you dont get rid 
of the cow you could need butter later

interdiction efforts arent keeping drugs out 
of the united states federal agencies say they will someday but a 
congressional researcher says that even if the borders were sealed 
the american people still would face a drug plague 
whats a government to do 
william j bennett director of the office of national drug 
control policy says the united states must keep up the interdiction 
pressure on all fronts air land and sea 
but as bennett works on a national strategy for combating drug 
abuse and the violence spawned by drug trafficking he also is 
accepting that much more must be done on prevention education and 
treatment 
you dont abandon interdiction just because drugs are somehow 
getting through said bennett spokesman don hamilton you have 
to do what you can to make the lives of traffickers more difficult 
 
the whole strategy consists of doing everything doing 
everything smarter and everything better hamilton said 
a report by the general accounting office the research branch of 
congress says drugs were found on only 10 percent of the planes 
targeted for inspection through aerial interdiction and that half 
of those were controlled deliveries in which intelligence agents 
knew in advance that the planes were bringing in drugs 
arnold p jones of the gao stressed during testimony last week 
before the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations that 
despite all interdiction efforts the drug supply in the united 
states is increasing illustrated by an increase in purity of drugs 
sold on the street a decrease in price and a hike in drugrelated 
emergency room treatments 
enforcement officials acknowledge that huge amounts of drugs are 
still getting through but say the interdiction efforts have other 
benefits 
coast guard lt cmdr james g simpson says that even if aerial 
interdictions success rate were just one out of 20 planes thats 
a great record 
for years simpson said the coast guard putzed around the 
caribbean with two or three ships and we came up with huge seizures 
of marijuana eventually we put a lot of equipment down there and 
seizures dropped 
simpson said he views decreased seizures not as a failure but as 
success indicating that the drug traffickers have had to use other 
routes that possibly cost more and pose more problems such as using 
individual overland couriers or hiding the drugs in cargo containers 
dick weart of the us customs service said a system of radar 
balloons along the souther border is only partially completed but 
already landborder crossing seizures are up 500 to 600 percent 
more and more were getting containers with 5000 6000 7000 
pound loads 
this indicates to me that theyre moving toward less desirable 
means of transporting their product weart said explaining that 
such modes are less desirable because they cant control it from 
beginning to end like they can on a small plane 
but some say interdiction no matter how dramatic some seizures 
may seem ultimately wont work not only because foreign drug 
traffickers will continue to get around barriers but because 
domestic producers will fill any otherwise unmet demand 
the head of the senate investigations subcommittee sen sam 
nunn dga and other panel members are frustrated by a lack of 
information and direction on the issue said a source on the 
subcommittee staff 
if we keep forcing them elsewhere where does it end where 
will they go next are you willing to seal off all the borders of 
the united states said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
even if you manage to seal a complete border around the united 
states what will that accomplish weve had people tell us that 
if the borders were sealed within three days domestic labs will be 
producing synthetic cocaine 
hamilton of bennetts office agreed that our salvation in the 
drug war will not be hermetically sealed borders he said that 
while he was unaware of synthetic cocaine domestic producers meet 
us demand for methamphetamine and pcp and provide 25 percent to 35 
percent of the marijuana consumed here in fact marijuana is being 
exported from this country he said 
there would be a drug problem in the united states even if the 
border were sealed hamilton said while some people do have a 
drug of choice many people simply want to get high 
changing that through drug abuse prevention education and 
treatment will take a long time and wont be as headlinegrabbing 
as the seizure of mounds of cocaine or piles of drug money 
changing the behavior of people is a longterm process jones 
said i personally believe that to look for the light at the end 
of the tunnel during the course of any administration does not do 
justice to the enormity of the problem

house ethics committee chairman julian dixon 
says there was no connection between his wifes share of a lucrative 
los angeles airport concession and the 170000 in legal fees his 
committee paid the president of the los angeles board of airport 
commissioners 
dixon confirmed on tuesday that the ethics committee hired 
johnnie l cochran head of the airport board three months after 
the companies in which mrs dixon has an interest were awarded the 
concession to operate the airport stores 
dixon dcalif said the two actions were unrelated 
there was no connection he said i want to make this as 
strong as i can no connection between the hiring and mrs 
dixons business i have never discussed with johnnie cochran 
anything about betty dixons business 
cochran a los angeles attorney was paid 170000 in 1986 and 
1987 for legal work he did for the ethics committee which was then 
looking into the personal finances of thenrep fernand st germain 
dri dixon said 
dixon recently gained national exposure when he presided over the 
ethics committees investigation of jim wright who resigned as 
house speaker after the panel charged him with 69 violations of 
house rules 
among other things the committee said wrights wife accepted 
improper gifts from a wealthy texas businessman allegations wright 
denied 
dixon said cochran an outstanding lawyer was hired by the 
ethics panel based on his qualifications and the qualifications of 
his law firm 
cochran said he didnt know mrs dixon was part of the airports 
dutyfree concession until about a year ago 
at no time did julian and i ever talk about it until recent 
weeks said cochran 
dixon amended his 1986 financial disclosure form on monday 
showing that his wife paid between 5000 and 15000 for an 
investment in two minority companies that have yielded dividends 
totaling more than 150000 in 1987 and 1988 the companies help 
operate the dutyfree and gift shops at the los angeles 
international airport 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said tuesday that he 
doesnt know of anything improper in mrs dixons business 
arrangement 
foley who recently succeeded wright as the ranking democrat in 
the house made his comments tuesday in response to questions about 
dixons handling of his financial disclosure forms 
as far as i know there is no impropriety of any kind and the 
refiling is in accordance with the rules foley said 
two months after the house committee retained cochran on feb 5 
1986 the los angeles airport board awarded a concession to run 
seven dutyfree stores at the airport to a joint venture headed by 
duty free shoppers inc of san francisco 
at that time april 1986 cochran was president of the airport 
board he is no longer president but remains on the fivemember 
board 
in july 1986 mrs dixon bought a 12 percent interest in two 
companies in the joint venture mir kanon inc listed as a 
minority enterprise and peideau inc listed as a femalerun 
business 
california state records show that the two companies had 
identical boards of directors as of september 1988 
city policies required that minority and femalerun businesses be 
part of any concession handed out by the airport airport officials 
now are examining the contracts to make sure they meet the intent of 
the citys minority contracting policy 
duty free shoppers said mir kanon and peideau make up 32 percent 
of the concession for the seven dutyfree shops and 18 percent of 
the concession for the 18 gift and news shops at the international 
airport the thirdbusiest in the world

a conservative was reelected president of the 
southern baptist convention dashing moderates hopes that an 
election outside the bible belt would help their candidate 
jerry vines the pastor of first baptist church of jacksonville 
fla won 565 percent of the vote tuesday in defeating his moderate 
challenger daniel vestal pastor of dunwoody baptist church in 
suburban atlanta 
im just convinced the joy bells are going to begin ringing in 
the southern baptist convention said vines who continued a 
conservative resurgence in the nations largest protestant 
denomination 
vines received 10754 votes to 8248 for vestal it was the 11th 
straight victory for conservative candidates since 1979 
vestal said he was disappointed but already considering another 
run for the presidency at next years convention in new orleans 
i fear a kind of militant partisanship in this denominatiion 
he said 
but vines said the appointment tuesday of richard jackson a 
phoenix pastor who opposed vines for the presidency last year to 
the home mission board was part of his effort to bring a kinder 
gentler denomination to pass 
more than 20000 delegates registered for the threeday 
convention that opened tuesday morning 
moderates who came within 700 votes of defeating vines last 
year had hoped the convention site would help their cause some 
conservatives stayed home in protest of the convention being held in 
a city with legalized gambling 
hal lane editor of southern baptist issues a conservative 
publication based in south carolina said vines victory was 
extremely important almost critical because we had a site 
offensive to so many conservatives it was a year we felt could have 
gone either way 
conservatives counted on the power of the incumbency no 
incumbent president seeking a second oneyear term has lost in 
recent years 
stan hastey executive director of the southern baptist alliance 
a moderate group said the election continues the losing streak 
without demoralizing moderates 
but richard land executive director of the christian life 
commission said the string of conservative victories should force 
moderates to rethink their thesis which is that the real southern 
baptist convention has not been heard from 
both vines and vestal believe the bible is without error but 
their different approaches to doctrinal issues reflected the 
divisions within the 148 millionmember denomination 
vestal said conservatives have run roughshod over the central 
baptist belief in the priesthood of the believer or that christians 
are able to interpret the bible for themselves 
but vines and other conservatives contend there is a need to set 
stricter parameters on theological teachings to preserve 
denominational unity on central tenants of faith 
moderates have shown increasing strength in recent years winning 
elections at the state level in texas georgia north carolina 
south carolina virginia and tennessee 
the southern baptist convention more than doubled in size in the 
past 25 years to surpass a declining united methodist church as the 
nations largest protestant denomination but has grown by barely 
more than half a percent each of the last two years the lowest 
growth rate since 1937

president carlos salinas de gortari promises 
to make life impossible for drug traffickers because of their 
corrosive effect on society but says mexico cannot be expected to 
halt the drug trade by itself 
it worries me that it drug use and drug trafficking doesnt 
show signs of diminishing as a world trend salinas said during an 
interview tuesday with executives and members of the associated 
press 
on other issues salinas emphasized the importance of ongoing 
negotiations to reduce mexicos 1074 billion foreign debt denied 
opposition claims that his institutional revolutionary party plans 
to steal july 2 state elections and said political solutions are 
needed in central america 
i would have liked to have gone faster on the debt front 
said salinas who spoke in english he said debt reduction talks 
were difficult because banks look at their balance sheets and we 
have to respond to social pressures 
he said he expected the complex negotiations to take weeks 
maybe months but said mexico must resume economic growth to feed 
its population raise living standards and create jobs there is 
not much time he said 
salinas said mexicans have lost 50 percent of their buying power 
in the years of austerity since the oil boom ended in 1982 he said 
he feared a turn to more radical solutions if his program for 
opening up the economy and encouraging the free market and private 
investment does not work 
populists will always present solutions without costs said 
salinas 
mexico will spend about 16 billion this year to service its 
foreign debt economic analysts have said a debt agreement must be 
reached before mexico runs out of foreign exchange and some have 
said they expected a pact within two weeks 
drug trafficking and corruption that protects traffickers are a 
major bone of contention in usmexico relations mexicans believe 
the real problem is immense demand in the united states and say they 
are pleased the united states is beginning to do something about it 
we will not end drug trafficking by fighting it in mexico 
said salinas calling for an international effort to combat the 
problem 
salinas said the drug trade and corruption are threats to 
mexicos national security and that drug use is a danger to 
mexicans health 
if we dont stop it now it will have a corrosive effect on our 
social relations salinas said we dont want our children to be 
tied in the web of drugs 
later in the day the federal attorney generals office announced 
the seizure of more than four tons of cocaine and the arrests of 28 
people in a twostate operation it described as the countrys 
biggest drug haul since salinas took office 
in the interviews most emotional moment salinas described how 
he recently inspected several historic artifacts that had been 
stolen from the museum of anthropology and recovered 
i was able for the first and last time in my life to touch 
them he said and its really something that goes deep into 
your skin 
he said the artifacts were a symbol of the continuity of mexican 
culture in the modern world 
weve taken this step of opening the economy because we have a 
strong culture he said when you come from a civilization that 
was able to build and create with such tremendous artistic ability 
and devotion you can open yourself with confidence 
salinas said his greatest accomplishment since taking office dec 
1 has been to foster a positive attitude among mexicans 
i find today mexicans are willing to make the added effort that 
is required for change in our country because they know it will mean 
an improvement said salinas who despite a weak electoral mandate 
has taken a series of bold strokes against corruption and economic 
inefficiency 
he said political solutions are needed in central america adding 
that those countries too need to grow and growth wont come with 
military tension he said central american economic problems might 
result in increased migration to both mexico and the united states 
salinas said mexico would stick to its principles of 
nonintervention and respect for selfdetermination with regard to 
panama although he remains critical of gen manuel antonio 
noriegas rule 
on other issues he said his administration is pushing for a more 
open relationship between church and state and plans to increase 
investment in education without education growth will not be 
permanent he said 
salinas said political opponents on the left and right who claim 
elections continue to be unfair are not looking at the present 
its more rhetoric than something we have in reality

rescue workers descended down ropes from a 
helicopter to recover the bodies of seven of the 11 people who died 
when a sightseeing plane crashed into a steep valley wall 
county firefighters and national park rangers found the bodies of 
the other four passengers but the recovery was suspended at 
nightfall tuesday they planned to return to the remote site this 
morning 
the twinengine beechcraft slammed into an 1800foot high wall 
at the back of waipio valley on hawaii island shortly after taking 
off sunday from hilo airport en route to kahului on the island of 
maui there were no survivors 
the wreckage of the plane was spread over a 300footlong 
firescarred swath in the thick vegetation it was found just after 
dawn tuesday by helicopters that tracked the signal from the planes 
emergency locator transmitter 
heavy rains and low clouds had prevented aircraft from searching 
the area monday 
most of it was all disintegrated said hawaii county deputy 
fire chief edward bumatay the biggest part they could find was

gangs taking advantage of relaxed controls under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform programs have contributed to 
a 32 percent rise in the soviet crime rate since january officials 
say 
gorbachev has acknowledged that the restructuring he initiated 
since coming to power four years ago could lead to more crime 
maj gen anatoly smirnov of the interior ministry told a moscow 
news conference tuesday that the relaxation of discipline and 
shortages in basic commodities had fueled an increase in murder and 
other serious crimes 
official figures show street crime increased over the same 
fivemonth period in 1988 by 83 percent property crimes by 53 
percent and murder by 26 percent smirnov said 
nine soviet policemen were killed in clashes with criminals in 
may alone 
shortages that have worsened steadily under economic experiments 
begun in recent years have created a demand for stolen goods that 
spurs robbers on according to the smirnov 
he said the countrys rail air and river transport systems have 
become increasingly crimeridden especially with robbery and 
mugging 
the ministry also noticed a rise in the aggressiveness of 
certain citizens the general said 
one crimefighting experiment has shown good results smirnov 
said in the russian city of gorky where two policemen were 
murdered this winter and residents were afraid to leave home at 
night creation of workers militias to back up police cut the crime 
rates growth by 38 percent 
gorbachev told communist party leaders in a speech this spring 
that they should keep in mind that any extension of democracy and 
humanization of life should go parallel with an uncompromising 
struggle against criminal elements 
police col alexander gurov estimated that more than a dozen 
major crime networks exist in the ussr but he said tuesday that 
there was no organization there on the scale of the cosa nostra a 
reference to organized crime in the united states 
the cosa nostra would go broke within a week here gurov 
said the bureaucracy would smother it because the bribes it 
would have to pay to get offices and basic supplies would prove 
prohibitive 
police col gennady chebotarev said tuesday that organized crime 
got its start in the massive shadow economy of theft 
embezzlement and unofficial wheelinganddealing that has thrived 
since the 1970s 
more than 1000 organized crime groups are uncovered every year 
often groups of more than 100 people frequently former athletes 
who stake out territory and demand protection money chebotarev said 
he said organized groups of criminals have also begun to foster 
ties with international crime particularly with computer imports 
antiques gold and jewels computers are in heavy demand in the 
soviet union and speculators can make huge profits by buying and 
selling even relatively cheap computers

despite guatemalas pledge to end political 
killings the military and police keep operating death torture and 
abduction squads amnesty international said today 
the londonbased human rights organization said it has reports of 
222 people who have disappeared since president vinicio cerezos 
civil administration in 1986 took over after 20 years of military 
rule 
although the number of abuses decreased initially there has 
been a resurgence of abductions disappearances and extrajudicial 
executions in the past 18 months the report said 
it added that many of the abuses which include murder and 
mutilation are carried out by police and military agents both 
while in uniform and while in plain clothes in the guise of the 
socalled death squads 
cerezo a centrist christian democrat took power pledging to end 
political killings intimidation and other abuses of previous 
military governments 
an amnesty international spokeswoman said cerezo who put down an 
attempted military coup last month was not apparently directly 
involved in the death squads but his government failed to 
investigate the killings 
we know that the army is running some of these squads said 
researcher tracey ulltveitmoe who drew up the report there may 
be some government officials involved but we dont think to the 
same extent as when there was military rule 
she said cerezo has become a useful front for the military 
he has been more successful in convincing some potential donors that 
the police and military have cleaned up their act 
wealth is concentrated with a militarybacked business and 
landowning minority the impoverished majority are mainly mayan 
indian peasants 
the report said peasants labor unionists clergy academics and 
students usually people the government saw as leftwing have 
been singled out particularly by the men in white death vans 
among the victims cited in the report were a labor unionist and a 
law student whose bodies were found on the outskirts of guatemala 
city in march 1988 with their hands cut off apparently to prevent 
identification 
power union official manuel de jesus lopez morales and student 
jose derick calderon figueroa had been abducted separately 10 days 
earlier the report said 
another victim former economics student ana paniagua was 
grabbed by armed men in plainclothes before terrified witnesses in 
february 1988 beaten up and taken away in a white van said the 
report 
her body was found two days later with stab wounds and her throat 
slashed it said 
charging that cerezo failed to investigate the report said that 
in march 1988 a judge due to try treasury police agents linked to 
the death van murders was kidnapped and held hostage for 52 
hours 
those arrested were later released for lack of 
evidence said amnesty international 
it said cerezo has not replied to its letters urging 
investigations of the reported abuses

mikhail s gorbachev buoyed by an 
outpouring of goodwill and a new friendship pact with west germany 
flew to this hightech stronghold today in search of expertise to 
advance his reforms 
the soviet leader and his wife raisa were greeted upon arrival 
at echterdingen airport by bademwuerttemberg states popular 
governor lothar spaeth rumored to be a challenger to chancellor 
helmut kohl in next years federal elections 
gorbachev was to tour a hightechnology exhibit at stuttgart 
university and meet with the political and industrial leaders of 
badenwuerttemberg one of west germanys most prosperous states 
on tuesday he appealed for close integration of the west german 
and soviet economies to make the countries improving relations 
more quakeresistant 
addressing west german business leaders at the cologne stock 
exchange the soviet president challenged them to invest in large 
soviet projects rather than trifles 
west germany is the soviet unions largest western trading 
partner but gorbachev said the level of trade is small compared to 
the possibilities 
he also called on the west to lift restrictions on 
hightechnology transfers gorbachev is seeking advanced western 
technology and knowhow to rebuild soviet industry and keep his 
promise that reform will bring average soviets a better life 
west germanys most powerful banker has warned that it could take 
up to two decades to reform the soviet economy which is plagued by 
consumer shortages and shoddy goods 
but precisely because it will take so long there is a need to 
start immediately and steadfastly pursue the reform efforts 
deutsche bank chairman alfred herrhausen said in a television 
interview monday night 
his fourday visit which ends thursday has been marked by a 
desire on both sides for a fresh start in sovietgerman relations 
and cooperation between the historical adversaries in pursuit of 
european unity 
gorbachev who is immensely popular among west germans has been 
greeted by cheering crowds of thousands during the visit 
while the soviet union clearly hopes the summit will yield deeper 
economic ties with west germany and other western nations officials 
on both sides have stressed that they are part of a broad strategy 
endorsed on tuesday 
the document spells out common objectives for improving security 
and ensuring peace and it stresses other nations should not fear 
closer ties between moscow and bonn 
it proclaims their desire for a common european home in which 
the united states and canada have their place and where all 
nations exist in peaceful competition with one another 
in an address at a state dinner at augustusburg castle outside 
bonn gorbachev predicted our cooperation can serve as a catalyst 
for new relations between the whole of east and west 
government spokesman hans klein described the declaration signed 
by gorbachev and chancellor helmut kohl as a turning point in 
sovietwest german relations 
the declaration reiterates the aim of cutting strategic nuclear 
weapons by 50 percent and completely eliminating chemical weapons 
the accord also states support for the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty signed by both superpowers which is seen by the 
soviets and west germans as a ban on development of the star 
wars space defense advocated by former president reagan 
it carefully avoids reference to the main point of contention in 
arms control between nato and the warsaw pact the issue of how to 
go about reducing shortrange nuclear weapons 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov at a news 
briefing with klein said gorbachev had deemed the declaration the 
reward of a long path of searching over many years 
eleven agreements were signed by ministers from both countries 
during the ceremony at kohls office tuesday 
they included establishing a hot line between moscow and 
bonn as well as new declarations on human rights and cultural and 
student exchanges

fran allison the warmhearted foil for two 
goofy puppets in tvs kukla fran and ollie show and pioneer for 
some of todays most popular childrens programs has died at the 
age of 81 
death was blamed on bone marrow failure an inability to produce 
sufficient numbers of white and red blood cells said sherman oaks 
community hospital spokeswoman johna rogovin 
fran was a bridge character between the audience and the puppet 
characters muppets creator jim henson said of miss allison who 
died tuesday 
you have a person who takes those characters as real and that 
helps make the characters more believable said henson who called 
the kukla fran amp ollie show my major influence in terms of 
puppetry 
we have continued to use that technique henson said of the 
realism miss allison brought to the show 
she worked as a singer and radio personality in shows originating 
from chicago during the 1930s and 40s and was well known for her 
role as the gossipy aunt fanny on don mcneills breakfast club 
the actress joined burr tillstroms popular puppet show 
originally known as junior jamboree when it began on local 
television in chicago in 1947 
it was a delight working with him from the very first moment 
miss allison recalled after tillstrom died in 1985 
the program featuring tillstroms kuklapolitan players 
emerged from the early age of television to become one of tvs 
longestrunning childrens programs 
kukla fran amp ollie ran nationally from 1948 to 1957 and 
later appeared on public television and in syndication during the 
1960s and 70s going off the air for good in 1976 
miss allison costarred with a bald gentle clown named kukla and 
an exuberant bucktoothed serpent oliver j dragon 
she essentially played herself a chicago singer and actress who 
appeared in front of the puppet stage and whose concern joy and 
infinite patience for her costars enthralled millions of young 
viewers 
she was so honest i think that was what made it work so 
well said jon stone a sesame street creator and producer at 
the childrens television workshop she took the puppets at face 
value 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
said she is beginning a june 20 seminar on childrens television at 
the museum of broadcasting in new york with clips from the show 
i am using it as an example of the concern that the broadcast 
industry used to have for children and their families ms charren 
said it was one of those wonderful ideas that happens rarely 
when something that appeals to children also appeals to adults 
miss allison was born in laporte city iowa in 1907 said her 
niece nan calvin 
she is survived by her brother lynn allison her husband of 35 
years archie levington died in 1978 
a memorial is scheduled saturday in suburban sherman oaks with 
burial to follow in cedar rapids iowa ms calvin said

his home and one officer was wounded the excelsior news service 
reported 
authorities had issued a warrant sunday for zorrillas arrest in 
the fatal shooting of manuel buendia a vocal critic of corruption 
in government no formal charges or details on a court hearing had 
been announced by early today

officers and about 50 vehicles surrounded the residence 
local news reports said district attorney ignacios morales 
lechuga arrived about a half hour later and the men talked inside 
the residence before zorrilla gave up

from 1981 to mid1984 the 49yearold zorrilla headed the 
federal security department a now defunct agency that was similiar 
to the fbi 
in an interview on television monday night morales lechuga had 
identified buendia as the intellectual author of the slaying 
authorities have refused to comment on a possible motive

zorrillas agents had been following buendia for more than three 
months before his death 
zorrilla met with buendia three times in the month before the 
slaying including the night before the fatal shooting proceso said 
authorities declined to say what motive zorrilla might have had 
for wanting to have buendia killed 
zorrilla has also been mentioned in news reports in connection 
with the deaths of three policemen and an investigator 
he was suspended from the security post in mid1984 and the 
governing institutional revolutionary party dropped him as a 
congressional candidate in 1985 amid reports that he was under 
investigation 
before taking over the federal security department zorrilla was 
a former congressman and private secretary to fernando gutierrez 
barrios deputy interior secretary at the time gutierrez barrios is 
now interior secretary there has been intense pressure on the 
government to solve the murder of buendia one of more than a score

the contests prizes were 8000 free packages of cheese 500 
skateboards 100 bicycles and at odds of 15 millionto1 a 1990 
dodge caravan 
the game required consumers to match left halves of a pictured 
van contained in inserts in specially marked packages of kraft 
singles cheese with right halves appearing on coupons in sunday 
newspaper advertising in the chicago and houston areas 
but due to a printing error it looks like nearly everybody won a 
prize and at least a hundred people won the car 
were telling people whove matched the pieces to go ahead and 
mail them in but we dont know what well do ms knuth said 
obviously we feel very badly about the situation 
if kraft wants to blame the printing company for the foul up 
then kraft should sue the printing company weinstein said in a 
telephone interview but kraft still is obligated to compensate the 
contest winners he said 
ms knuth declined to reveal any details about the promotion 
other than to argue that the company cannot be held liable for the 
error 
it is so obviously unintentional she said 
the company ordered packages of the cheese slices removed from 
grocery store shelves 
the illinois attorney generals office fielded at least 50 calls 
from angry customers said spokeswoman therese mcmahon

the soviet union today joined the united states and 
vietnam in opposing calls for forcible repatriation of vietnamese 
boat people from their refuge in other southeast asian states 
but other nations at the twoday un conference on indochinese 
refugees including britain china thailand the philippines and 
the netherlands support such a policy 
the conference is expected to formally endorse measures designed 
to deter the mounting number of vietnamese fleeing economic problems 
rather than political persecution 
the plan will introduce screening procedures in the countries of 
first refuge to determine whether new arrivals can claim political 
asylum and refugee status and are thus eligible for resettlement it 
call for the return of all nonrefugees to their homeland 
on the first day of the conference monday attended by 60 
countries hong kong gov sir david wilson backed by britain had 
urged quick mandatory repatriation of all boat people denied refugee 
status 
the consequences for hong kong are appalling said wilson 
our resources have been overwhelmed 
wilson disputed assertions that mandatory repatriation was 
inhumane 
the real inhumanity is to encourage people to leave vietnam 
with women and children in unsafe boats in the hope of getting to 
destinations on the far side of the world which they will never 
reach because the doors are closed he said 
with 43000 boat people hong kong has by far the largest number 
of vietnamese in any territory in the region 
british foreign minister sir geoffrey howe said the influx has 
put an intolerable burden on hong kong and caused a major 
humanitarian crisis in the british colony already one of the most 
densely populated places in the world 
soviet chief delegate genrikh v kireev told the conference 
today repatriation of refugees should be carried out only on the 
voluntary basis echoing statements made tuesday by us deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and foreign minister nguyen 
co thach of vietnam 
the un high commissioner for refugees jeanpierre hocke says 
if the conference approves the plan the number of boat people 
returning voluntarily should rise 
vietnam has given assurances to the un agency that no punitive 
action will be taken against these returnees it has said it will 
not accept those returned against their will 
since march only 143 boat people have voluntarily returned a 
fraction of the number who arrive daily in the regions coastal 
states the hong kong branch of the oxfam relief agency has 
supported the governors call for mandatory action saying voluntary 
repatriation does not work 
the draft plan before the conference while making clear all 
nonrefugees should return makes no explicit recommendation how 
this should be done 
the number of boat people declined in the early 1980s but the 
exodus has accelerated again nearly 90000 vietnamese three times 
the 1986 total now live in refugee camps 
another 100000 refugees from cambodia and laos also live in 
camps 
wilson said screening procedures instituted by hong kong last 
year and expected to be adopted under the un plan showed most 
new arrivals do not qualify for refugee status 
their reasons for leaving vietnam are essentially economic 
he said making them ineligible for resettlement in third countries 
specifically in north america where most hope to go 
the united states has accepted 900000 of the 15 million 
indochinese who fled their homes since the vietnam war ended in 
april 1975 
eagleburger announced the united states is prepared to resettle 
22000 of the 55000 vietnamese who arrived in southeast asian 
nations before any screening procedures were instituted he also 
said the united states anticipates accepting up to half of all new 
arrivals granted refugee status

local governments need to come up with billions 
of dollars to repair or replace threefourths of county bridges and 
upgrade at least 17 million miles of roads according to a national 
survey 
the survey released tuesday by the national association of 
counties indicated that about 165000 bridges need repair or 
replacement 
in four states alabama arkansas missouri and texas more 
than 90 percent of county bridges were listed as defective all but 
three states oregon idaho and arizona had more than half of 
their bridges needing repair 
one county official frustrated over pressure to keep a faulty 
bridge open gave in but posted it for a load limit of zero and 
another suggested local bake sales to raise funds for bridge repair 
said norman walzer a coauthor of the report on county highways for 
the national association of counties 
walzer economics department chairman at western illinois 
university described the frustration of local officials trying to 
pay the increasing cost of road and bridge repair as federal and 
state assistance continues to decline 
there are some hard times out there he said adding that 
some of the nations 3000 counties have been forced to cut back on 
spending for roads and bridges in a day when a new road grader can 
cost as much as some counties total annual road budget 
walzer said county road supervisers who responded to the survey 
indicated that about onefourth of the nations roads are viewed as 
less than barely adequate by the engineers who have to maintain 
them 
walzer said some defective bridges become more of a hazard as 
rural populations change 
a family moves in with a couple of children and then youve 
got a nineton school bus crossing the bridge he said 
the study says 17 million miles of county roads were not built 
for todays level of use and the nearly 165000 substandard bridges 
need to be rehabilitated or replaced at an average cost of between 
110000 and 140000 each 
at that rate the total bill for county governments could exceed 
20 billion for bridges alone just under half the nations nearly 
halfmillion bridges are the responsibility of county or town 
governments 
traditional sources of revenue such as the property tax are 
inadequate to meet the urgent need for repair and replacement of 
county roads and bridges said john thomas association executive 
director he said more federal aid is needed for county roads 
the county association also urges local governments to seek the 
authority to raise funds for roads and bridges by adding to the 
gasoline tax and opposes any use of gasoline tax revenue for 
nonhighway purposes thomas said 
the 350page statebystate report by walzer and fellow western 
illinois economist claudia mcfadden titled linking america 
said counties or town governments spent 1169 billion on highways 
in 1987 including 58 billion for maintenance and traffic services 
and 38 billion on capital expenditures 
the state share of county road funding declined from 406 percent 
in 1977 to 302 percent in 1986 and federal funding from 87 
percent to 54 percent the report said it said this has forced 
counties to increase borrowing from 6 percent in 1977 to 133 
percent in 1986 
the report divides county bridges into three categories those 
with a greater than 80 sufficiency rating which do not need repair 
those with a 50 to 80 rating which can be rehabilitated without 
replacement and those with less than 50 which need either extensive 
repair or must be replaced 
the sufficiency ratings are given in biennial inspections 
reported to the federal highway administration data compiled for 
the survey showed that 446 percent of the bridges fall in the worst 
category 304 percent need some repair and 25 percent are rated as 
not needing repair or replacement 
states with the most bridges in the worst category were missouri 
759 percent texas 701 percent oklahoma 683 percent arkansas 
633 percent and alabama and mississippi both 604 percent 
states with the fewest bridges needing possible replacement were 
washington with 96 percent oregon 105 percent and illinois 13 
percent

president bush vetoed the bill increasing the 
minimum wage less than 20 minutes after it arrived at the white 
house all with the stroke of his pen somewhere in the sky between 
wyoming and nebraska 
this may be the first faxed veto in history white house 
chief of staff john sununu joked tuesday in wyoming a few hours 
before bush vetoed the measure aboard air force one 
it turned out no facsimile machine was involved 
bush had taken a prepared copy of the veto message with him on 
his twoday trip at 139 pm edt the president was notified by the 
white house that the measure had arrived sixteen minutes later the 
white house had a message back from the president the veto message 
was signed affix a stamp of the presidents signature to a 
duplicate left at the white house and deliver it to congress 
it arrived there at 238 pm just as democratic leaders 
prepared for a news conference at which they planned to urge bush 
one last time not the veto the measure 
word of the veto quickly swept the capitol followed by questions 
by reporters from news organizations that had reporters traveling 
with bush 
first an aide to sen edward m kennedy dmass scrambled to a 
phone then an aide to rep augustus hawkins dcalif neither could 
find out for sure if the measure had been vetoed 
senate majority leader george mitchell arrived and outside a 
room full of reporters told kennedy he believed the measure had 
been vetoed already but was not certain 
i cant believe it said kennedy who nonetheless took a seat 
and began rewriting his prepared remarks 
by the time house speaker thomas s foley arrived the suspense 
was over 
the veto message had made its way to the house where the clerk 
was reading it into the record 
no mitchell said bluntly when asked if the speed of the veto 
surprised him 
foley a 24year house veteran said it probably been the 
quickest veto of any bill in my memory

six israeli warplanes blasted a 
palestinian guerrilla base today in syriancontrolled hills above 
beirut wounding at least four fighters in two bombing runs 
the base is operated by guerrillas of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine one of nine factions of the palestine 
liberation organization 
a statement by the israeli military command indicated however 
that it was not the intended target and that the air force meant to 
bomb another plo base 
meanwhile syrian and christian gunners traded rocket and 
artillery fire in and around beirut amid reports that christian army 
commander gen michel aoun had rejected a syrian proposal for 
halting the confrontation 
police said three people were killed including a sergeant 
serving with aouns troops 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 370 people killed and 
1441 wounded since the fighting broke out on march 8 
the guerrilla base bombed by the israelis is located in pine 
woods just outside bshamoun a tiny druse village about eight miles 
southeast of beirut many of the trees caught fire after the planes 
diving from clear skies dropped at least 10 bombs on the 
guerrillas position 
palls of smoke could be seen rising from the area as guerrillas 
fired their ak47 rifles into the air to warn away reporters and 
photographers 
theyve raided our base shouted one angry fighter wearing a 
red headband ill shoot whoever approaches the area 
four ambulances sped into the base each carried one wounded 
guerrilla to kamal jumblatt hospital in choueifat a nearby druse 
town the rescuers said 
police said two planes first dropped four rockets on the base at 
1150 am four more jets swept low over the base 20 minutes later 
and dropped six more bombs 
a guerrilla who identified himself only as ayman said we 
didnt even hear the jets roaring overhead we realized we were 
under attack when the first two planes fired four rockets 
a police spokesman said the jets dropped 250pound bombs 
the statement by the israeli military command said the planes 
raided a base of the syrianbased palestine liberation front a tiny 
plo faction founded by the late talaat yacoub who had split from 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine in the mid1970s 
the israeli army said the air raid was in retaliation for a may 
28 barrage of sovietmade katyusha rockets that hit the northern 
town of metullah injuring an 8monthold baby the attack was 
accompanied by an unsuccessful infiltration attempt 
both the plo factions claimed responsibility 
the popular front led by george habash is a marxist group based 
in damascus syria and the secondlargest of the plo factions 
loud explosions echoed across beirut during the bombing attack 
the seventh by israel jets into lebanon this year 
the police spokesman said the planes released scarlet balloons to 
deflect heatseeking missiles but guerrilla defenders did not 
deploy such weapons he said speaking on anonymity in line with 
standing regulations 
guerrillas opened up with twinbarelled 23mm antiaircraft guns 
but scored no hits he said 
by police count six people were killed and 49 wounded in the six 
previous israeli air attacks 
a lone israeli helicopter gunship rocketed iranianbacked 
guerrillas in southern lebanon last wednesday wounding three members 
of the shiite moslem hezbollah or party of god 
lakhdar ibrahimi of algeria assistant secretarygeneral of the 
arab league was in moslem west beirut today to meet with acting 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads one of two 
cabinets competing to run the country 
the other government is run by gen aoun a maronite catholic 
the prestigious daily newspaper annahar said the latest round of 
fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war intensified after aoun 
rejected a syrian proposal for the formation of a security 
committee representing various lebanese factions to oversee 
implementation of a ceasefire 
annahar said aoun insisted on the creation of a 
lebanesesyrian security committee arguing that the 
confrontation was between syrian and lebanese forces and not among

china today accused an associated press reporter 
and the voice of america bureau chief of violating martial law 
restrictions and gave them three days to leave the country 
the reporters are john pomfret of the associated press and the 
voice of americas beijing bureau chief alan pessin 
the british broadcasting corp in beijing initially reported that 
brian barron its far eastern correspondent for television also was 
ordered out but later said it was just a mistake 
we thought he had been but were assured it isnt him the 
american networks the wires and ourselves all seem to have made the 
same translation error it is not brian barron we do not know who 
it is said a bbc spokesman in london commenting anonymously 
police called in pomfret and pessin this afternoon according to 
pomfret police said he met with the leaders of student 
organizations that led seven weeks of prodemocracy protests 
pomfret used his journalism credentials for illegal activities 
and used illegal methods to get state secrets the beijing 
television news accused he protected the leaders of student 
groups and exchanged information with them 
the government ordered martial law in parts of beijing on may 20 
and placed restrictions on foreign correspondents in a bid to 
prevent them from interviewing student protesters but the measures 
have not been strongly enforced 
in new york the expulsion of pomfret was criticized by louis d 
boccardi president and general manager of the associated press 
we deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the 
chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual 
reporting boccardi said 
john pomfret is a journalist not a participant and even those 
who have issued this order must surely understand that 
pomfret 30 has worked for the ap since 1986 and has been based 
in beijing since 1988 he studied in china from 198082 and speaks 
fluent chinese 
i did my job as a journalist and i worked hard pomfret said 
its a shame that these are the results i get 
pessin 33 said police accused him of engaging in reporting 
aimed at distorting facts spreading rumors and instigating turmoil 
and counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the only motive we have is to tell the truth as best we can 
governments do not always like that he said

the foreign ministry summoned turkeys ambassador 
today to complain about that nations decision to allow a soviet 
defector to fly to the united states rather than be extradited to 
the soviet union 
soviet air force capt alexander zuyev took a mig29 fighter on 
may 20 after a shootout with a sentry at tskhakaya airport north of 
the black sea resort city of batumi and flew across the border to 
turkey the soviets have said 
turkey returned the plane to the soviet union the next day but 
rejected kremlin appeals to extradite zuyev who requested asylum in 
the united states 
washington agreed to the request and zuyev was permitted to fly 
to the united states on friday 
the foreign ministry released a statement carried by the 
official tass news agency that was read to ambassador volkan vural 
of turkey 
the actions by the turkish side toward criminal zuyev cannot be 
perceived in the soviet union other than running counter to the 
spirit of good neighborliness in sovietturkish relations the 
statement said 
according to the soviets zuyev banned from flying for health 
reasons shot and wounded an airport sentry before escaping in the 
plane 
the judgement by the turkish court which ruled that zuyev 
committed his action for political reasons and ruled out the chance 
of his extradition and moreover punishment and also the 
confirmation of this decision at a higher level is grossly at odds 
with international legal principles the statement said 
the foreign ministry noted that turkey signed the 1948 universal 
declaration of human rights and the 1967 un declaration on 
territorial refuge 
we had every right to expect from the turkish side an 
implementation of the principle of an unconditional extradition of 
terrorists the statement said 
the was no indication that the soviet union intended to take 
further action against turkey 
the soviet ambassador to turkey albert cernishev said last week 
that authorities would now ask the united states to extradite zuyev

congressional calls for a justice department 
investigation of a federal housing program have intestified in the 
wake of a former officials refusal to answer questions about 
favoritism and mismanagement in the project 
deborah gore dean onetime executive assistant to former housing 
secretary samuel pierce refused tuesday to respond to a house 
subcommittees questions about her role in the program 
dean invoked her constitutional right against selfincrimination 
in declining to discuss her involvement in selection of projects for 
funding under the department of housing and urban developments 
section 8 moderate rehabilitation program 
several congressional committees have been examining the program 
after huds inspector general found that a number of former reagan 
administration officials had reaped large profits from it as 
contractors or consultants 
dean said she has been unable to obtain hud records which would 
enable me to give accurate testimony that would be complete and 
truthful 
i respectfully have decided to decline to answer any questions 
posed by the subcommittee at this time on the basis of the rights 
guaranteed to me under the fifth amendment to the constitution 
she said 
hud secretary jack kemp suspended the housing rehabilitation 
program in april as the inspector general had recommended but he 
reinstated funding on june 1 after developing new guidelines and 
regulations 
dean the sole witness to appear under subpeona before the house 
government operations subcommittee on employment and housing was 
accompanied by two attorneys charles leeper and former us 
attorney for the district of columbia joseph digenova 
panel chairman tom lantos dcalif told dean he and the 
subcommittee would assist her in obtaining the documents she needed 
but rep bruce morrison dconn questioned whether the 
extensive list of documents requested by dean including all of 
pierces phone logs and appointment records between january 1984 and 
december 1988 was reasonable 
pierce testified last month that those records no longer exist 
morrison also questioned whether dean was implying that her 
answers to the panel would be incriminating 
reminding morrison that the fifth amendment was designed to 
protect the innocent leeper said the supreme court has found it 
sufficient to refuse to answer inquiries where any answer may or 
could expose that witness to prosecution 
morrison said theres no suggestion of guilt however the 
fact that any witness would feel the threat of this investigation 
turning into a criminal investigation i would hope that this 
would suggest to the justice department that there may be criminal 
wrongdoing 
the inspector general said he found no evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing in his audit of the program however his report has been 
referred to the justice department for further review 
morrisons republican colleague from connecticut rep 
christopher shays wondered aloud whether dean had requested 
specific documents or if she had asked for such a long list of items 
to make her testimony here never to occur 
i find it absolutely astounding that the very person who 
was at the center of this was not investigated shays added 
earlier silvio debartolomeis a former hud deputy assistant 
secretary said he viewed dean as the final decisionmaker in 
the department on the rehabilitation program 
debartolomeis said he had told dean of his concern that there was 
possible political influence on the programs selection process in 
one instance he said he left town to avoid signing documents 
approving funding for two projects 
but he said he subsequently was ordered to sign the documents by 
dean

riot police fired tear gas at 1000 
striking taxi drivers who were protesting government measures that 
more than doubled the price of gasoline and devalued the currency by 
52 percent 
no injuries were reported in tuesdays incident although police 
arrested one cab driver and charged him with instigating 
disobedience 
the austerity measures by the leftist sandinista government were 
aimed at combating inflation which was 155 percent last month the 
cost of living rose 20000 percent last year 
earlier tuesday president daniel ortega announced pay raises of 
up to 50 percent for public employees and accused businessmen of 
fueling inflation by speculating in dollars 
cabbies from managua and three other major cities leon granada 
and masaya stopped working tuesday to protest the measures 
authorities gave the 1000 cabbies gathered in the capital at a 
corner gasoline station 30 minutes to disperse police said the 
gathering was illegal because the drivers did not have the required 
permit 
the black berets specially trained riot police blocked 
roads leading to the station and a half hour later lobbed six 
teargas grenades in the yard 
the drivers refused to disperse instead singing the nicaraguan 
national anthem with raised fists while dabbing teary eyes 
the cabbies told police we are poor people just like you 
and we cant be accused of anything except trying to earn a 
living 
on monday ortega ordered a 52 percent devaluation of the cordoba 
against the dollar the highest this year 
prices immediately rose for everything from food and 
transportation to clothing services and entertainment 
food prices doubled and markets emptied cab drivers doubled 
their fares but found few takers 
ortega said tuesday that nicaragua traditionally a food exporter 
to the rest of central america will have to import basic foods such 
as tomatoes onions bananas and cabbages in june and july to make 
up for domestic shortages 
to stimulate production the government has been giving financial 
incentives to agricultural producers who began their seasonal 
plantings in may but have been plagued by a drought

the deranged fan who stabbed theresa 
saldana wont get out of prison for at least nine months but thats 
still too soon says the actress 
the state board of prison terms on tuesday extended arthur 
jacksons parole date from thursday to march 15 1990 for breaking 
windows and disobeying orders in prison he has served seven years 
of a 12year sentence for attempted murder 
the scottish drifter who has vowed in letters to miss saldana to 
complete his divine mission to kill her had earned time off for 
good behavior and had been scheduled for early release from the 
california medical facility 
miss saldana who is six months pregnant said i am 
temporarily relieved and im glad we can have the baby and not be 
worried about a release date around the time of my baby due date 
however she expressed dismay that the man who tried to kill her 
in front of her west hollywood apartment in 1982 would ever be freed 
its very confusing she said everyone tells me just have 
him committed everyone feels that will be the solution looking at 
it logically that would be the solution i just dont understand 
last week los angeles district attorney ira reiner charged 
jackson with making death threats from prison and he could face 
nearly eight more years if convicted 
somebody who is sitting in a prison cell and making threats is 
hardly entitled to time off for good behavior reiner said 
it is unfortunate that the law under which jackson was 
sentenced allows an individual with his atrocious record to have any 
hope of ever being paroled gov george deukmajian said 
jackson 53 has been diagnosed a chronic paranoid schizophrenic 
said dr v meenakshi the prisons chief psychologist 
if you look at it in the way the courts look at it legally 
then no hes not dangerous in legal terms the doctor said but 
hes dangerous in psychiatric terms

south of the lebanese capital of beirut in retaliation for a rocket 
attack on an israeli border settlement two weeks ago the army said 
the base belonged to the syrianbased palestine liberation front 
founded by the late talat yacoub there was no immediate report of 
casualties it was the sixth israeli air raid in lebanon this year 
and the second near wartorn beirut 
in another development israeli media reported that the army is 
seeking permission to deport palestinians from the occupied lands 
without waiting for the completion of lengthy appeals 
the united states has denounced the expulsions saying they 
violate international human rights conventions that bar deportations 
from occupied territories 
the israeli truck driver was attacked by a group of axwielding 
palestinians as he delivered fuel to a gas station outside the 
village of beit lahiya in northern gaza strip the army said the

condition after suffering a fractured skull said nili nir a 
spokeswoman for barzilai hospital in ashkelon

taken to nasser hospital in nearby khan yunis 
leaders of the 18monthold uprising have ordered palestinians 
working for the military government to resign and called on 
militants to attack those who ignore such orders scores of 
palestinian police and military government employees have quit their 
jobs in response to the threats 
at least 516 palestinians have died and more than 10000 have 
been wounded since the uprising began in december 1987 twentytwo

was quoted as telling the committee on tuesday in explaining the 
need for the change 
under the proposal the appeal could be considered after the 
deportation and if the supreme court decided in favor of the 
deportee he would be allowed to return 
since the start of the uprising israel has deported 45 
palestinian activists to southern lebanon 
another 13 palestinians have been ordered deported with the 
latest orders issued in august 1988 of these cases some are still 
under appeal while in others the army has delayed the deportations

their marriage was made in law school and 
when morgan lamb failed his state bar exam he sent his pregnant 
lawyer wife masquerading as a man to take the test for him she 
passed 
now the california supreme court is considering whether to 
disbar laura beth lamb who scored ninth highest on the exam then 
was rushed to the hospital to deliver her baby 
the state bar says she should be disbarred for undermining the 
exam process and foisting on the public an unqualified lawyer her 
exhusband 
her lawyer tom low implored the court tuesday to choose a 
suspension rather than disbarment he said his client was an abused 
wife who participated in fraud to save her life and the life of her 
child 
low said that lamb who owned a gun had threatened to kill his 
wife the fetus and himself 
there is not one shred of evidence that laura lamb is an evil 
person or an unethical person low argued she became 
overwhelmed she thought that her baby would die she thought she 
would die 
during her pregnancy mrs lamb a diabetic suffered from 
hypertension kidney failure and complications that threatened her 
with blindness low said 
she took the threeday bar exam for her husband in july 1985 
while seven months pregnant then she was rushed to the hospital 
and placed in intensive care until the birth of her daughter 10 days 
later he said 
its astonishing to me said chief justice malcolm lucas 
that she was able to pass the bar and get the ninth highest 
grade 
attorney diane yu representing the state bar argued that mrs 
lamb participated in a premeditated deliberate plot 
she had the brains in the family said ms yu and she took 
the exam and scored ninth it was brilliantly executed she also was 
an outstanding actress 
the state bar was tipped off anonymously as the test was being 
graded mrs lambs husband never was admitted to the bar and never 
practiced law 
the fraud was disclosed by an anonymous tip to the state bar 
mrs lamb now 33 met her husband at university of california 
los angeles law school and they married after graduation low told 
the justices 
mrs lamb passed her bar exam and became an attorney for the 
securities and exchange commission in january 1984 her husband took 
the exam in february 1985 and failed he became abusive and violent 
toward her and asked her to take the exam for him low said 
she refused numerous times when she was so beaten down because 
she had nowhere to go she gave in low said 
the bar alleges that in june 1985 mrs lamb cut her hair and 
dressed in mens clothes then went to have a bar identification 
photo taken signing her husbands name and deliberately smudging 
her thumbprint she took the exam a month later 
low noted that although mrs lamb wore a mans shirt bar 
examiners could have seen that she was pregnant 
he said lamb abandoned his wife after the baby was born and they 
have since divorced 
mrs lamb pleaded no contest in march 1987 to felony charges of 
deception and impersonation the charges later were reduced to 
misdemeanors she was fined 2500 and placed on probation which 
has ended 
she is continuing therapy low said and works as a legal 
secretary and researcher while raising her daughter 
mrs lamb stopped practicing law voluntarily in 1986 and was 
placed on inactive status in may 1988 after a bar hearing panel 
recommended disbarment 
mrs lambs lawyers are asking for her suspension for a 
reasonable period rather than disbarment 
a suspended lawyer is reinstated automatically when the 
designated period ends a disbarred lawyer can apply for readmission 
after five years but must prove moral fitness to resume practice 
last year lamb was given three years probation and ordered to 
perform 500 hours of community service for forgery and false 
impersonation

five accidental shootings of children by 
children since june 1 prompted gov bob martinez to add gun safety 
to the agenda today in calling a special session of the legislature 
martinez had already planned to call lawmakers back to the 
capital to take up a 22 billion turnpike expansion plan the 
special session announced today will take place monday through 
wednesday next week 
the five shootings have left two children dead and one near death 
today in each case children found guns around the house and shot 
themselves or others 
a proposal sponsored by rep harry jennings would make it a 
misdemeanor to leave a gun within reach of a child and a felony 
carrying up to five years in prison if the child died or was 
permanently maimed 
no one in this world is more curious than a child and nothing 
is more tragic when that natural curiosity result sin a child being 
hurt or killed martinez said 
if we can pass legislation that makes just one parent act more 
carefully that saves just one child from tragedy our efforts will 
be worthwhile 
martinez also wants to build toll roads near most of the states 
largest cities including a 91mile beltway around orlando

when a historian writes the chapter about the influence peddlers 
of washington and their frenzied feeding during the 1980s james 
watts stripmining consultant fees for a lowincome housing project 
will be the perfect case in point 
james watt king of the urban tenements did you ever dream youd 
hear those two topics watt and urban housing mentioned in the 
same sentence not unless watt was ordering the destruction of a 
housing project to mine a vein of some valuable mineral 
but the former interior secretary during the first reagan 
administration who became a sort of environmental emperor nero in 
the view of his enemies has gone freelance performing some 
offshore drilling of the washington money beds to make his mark in 
the housing field as a consultant 
to be specific watt consulted a few times by telephone with 
samuel skinner the secretary of housing and urban development and 
skinners helpers in the bureaucracy that is now under the command 
of former us rep jack kemp the contractor for whom watt used his 
name paid him 169000 for the trouble 
watt earned more than 400000 all told as a housing specialist 
although he had no background in housing and never inspected any of 
the projects

charleston wva daily mail on honoraria for members of 
congress 
there was only one point worth remembering in former house 
speaker jim wrights smarmy hectoring sayonara speech to the house 
 
wright tried to make the case that some of the houses rules on 
income and outside earnings are subject to varying interpretations 
thats easy enough to fix the way to do it is to write clear 
rules of conduct that every house member can understand 
the first step in clarifying these rules is to eliminate 
honoraria outright the practice of allowing congressmen to take 
speaking fees from special interests seeking legislation subjects 
every congressman even the honest ones to skepticism and 
disrespect 
in fact why doesnt congress simply end its soulsearching and 
ethical squirming by limiting its members to the salary that comes 
with the job even jim wright could understand that rule

burlington county times willingboro nj on a drug giveaway 
probably some skeptic suspected gd searle amp co of a publicity 
gimmick a year ago when it announced it would offer heart drugs free 
of charge to the poor 
nationwide the company has issued 200000 certificates for a 
months supply of heart medicine with thousands of physicians and 
pharmacies participating and about 65000 patients receiving searle 
products 
now the company is broadening the program to include its newest 
product cyototec a gastriculcer prevention drug for arthritis 
patients 
these policies rate applause not just for the service they 
provide but for the example they set 
if the medical needs of the poor and those with no medical 
insurance are to be addressed adequately private hospitals and 
medical firms have to increase their charitable commitment the task 
is too big and costly to leave to government alone 
searles drug program is essential if were to help the

the leafchronicle clarksville tenn on thomas foley as house 
speaker 
thomas foley has the unenviable task of trying to get the house 
in order 
the 60yearold democrat from washington was recently elected 
speaker of the house known as a negotiator and a consensusbuilder 
foley will need all of the political skills that he has acquired 
over the years if he hopes to restore some semblance of normalcy to 
the lower chamber of congress 
the house is reeling from partisan political attacks and ethical 
investigations of both democrats and republicans foley succeeds 
jim wright of texas who resigned the post and his seat after a 
house ethics panel brought charges against him 
the speaker said that he hopes to quickly restore a mood of 
conciliation reconciliation and cooperation between the two 
parties he also said that revising house ethics rules and 
campaign laws will be a top priority 
a new era of leadership should not mean that the ethics charges 
against current members of the house be swept aside still one 
would hope that all of the allegations could be resolved in a timely 
fashion so that the legislators could get back to the business they 
were elected to do making the nations laws

the duluth minn newstribune on the gop memo about foley 
mark goodin is jobless today but leaves behind him at the 
republican national committee what has become an increasingly 
valuable political commodity deniability 
goodin was ousted as committee communications director when a 
storm broke over his memo smearing house speaker thomas foley with 
insinuations of homosexuality 
so goodin goes but lee atwater republican national committee 
chairman gets to deny having anything to do with the nefarious 
memo he apologizes to foley but keeps his job and his patron 
president george bush expresses disgust at the memo and life 
goes on in the white house as he denies finding such actions 
acceptable 
perhaps this outrage will be so soundly rejected by 
properthinking republicans that the partys hatchet men will be put 
on a tight leash or asked to join goodin in the search for honest 
work and perhaps the incident will convince democratic gutfighters 
these negative attacks have gone too far 
this doesnt mean questions of political ethics should stop being 
asked they just should be asked in an honest straightforward 
manner

the greenville sc news on the gop memo about foley 
lee atwater the republican partys national chairman said he 
had no prior knowledge of a memo dripping with innuendo about newly 
elected house speaker tom foley 
but in the end it does not matter whether the gop chairman knew 
about the memo authored by atwater aide mark goodin because it was 
a perfect expression of atwaterstyle politics 
in fact it has been reported that atwaters first response to 
goodins mischief was that it wasnt out of bounds the memo 
came from goodins desk but the ultimate inspiration for it is 
clear 
goodin resigned his post as communications director for the 
republican national committee which means only that both he and 
atwater got off too easily 
but goodin was a small potato in the foultasting political stew 
atwater has been cooking since entering politics this whole episode 
is not about goodins bush league indiscretion its about lee 
atwaters standards of political conduct 
a fervent hope is that this episode will mark the beginning of 
the end of atwaters politics of sleaze 
white house chief of staff john sununu described the memo as 
wrong not because it damages our relationship with the democrats 
its wrong because its wrong sununu said both he and president 
bush had reprimanded atwater but the president needs to go much 
further than he did 
if he continues to support atwater as leader of the party he 
will share responsibility for atwaters activities bush is too 
decent and too capable a person to need what atwater has to offer 
and the gop doesnt need it either

the seattle times on aids 
as the reports at the past weeks international conference in 
montreal make clear the search for effective defenses against aids 
continues to be a maddeningly slow proposition 
more and more the acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 
assuming a strong resemblance to cancer with no magic bullets 
likely to be found anytime soon aids increasingly is regarded as a 
disease that is here to stay breakthroughs toward improved 
treatment and even cures most likely will occur one plodding 
methodical step at a time 
many of the data presented at montreal were a repeat of 
information already made public in numerous reports in scientific 
journals a striking exception was the presentation by dr jonas 
salk the poliovaccine pioneer on the research hes been doing 
with colleagues at the national institutes of health and at the 
university of southern california 
salk expressed restrained optimism that an experimental vaccine 
he has developed eventually could immunize people already infected 
with hiv the aids virus against developing the disease itself 
members of salks team told the new york times they did not want 
to raise false hopes still amid the years of frustration and 
bleak despair over the incurability of aids despite billions of 
dollars in research spending the salk report afforded at least one 
very welcome bright spot

journalworld lawrence kan on computer crime 
computer experts continue to look for cures for the growing 
epidemic of computer viruses yet they see no sure way so far to 
stop outbreaks which threaten all but the most isolated and 
elaborately protected systems 
some experts say the threat is so acute it may force the nation 
to rethink its growing dependence on computers of all sizes 
experts say weve only barely scratched the surface of the 
computer crime problem and many fear the great damage that can be 
done until there are more answers than questions

vicksburg miss evening post on protecting the environment 
ok fellow americans it comes down to this yes you are willing 
to die for your country but will you sweat for your environment 
in vermont the answer seems to be yes the vermont 
legislature has passed a bill that would halt the sale or 
registration of vehicles equipped with airconditioners that use 
chlorofluorocarbon a coolant know to eat the earths protective 
ozone layer 
ah but does vermonts commendable social conscience come too 
easily even in the depths of july the temperature then averages a 
mild 70 degrees and only about half of vermont drivers bother 
to buy cars equipped with air conditioners 
so what about an unair conditioned august in mississippi a bit 
sticky huh 
but would we rather stay cool now and leave the creeping 
catastrophe of ozone depletion complete with increases in skin 
cancer eye disease plant and animal deaths food chain disruptions 
to be faced by our children 
vermonters arent sacrificing much but they have answered that 
question

the daily republic mitchell sd on the need for nuclear 
reactors 
the bush administrations plan to build two new military 
nuclear reactors in south carolina and idaho should be shelved 
defense department officials used to crying national defense 
at the drop of a hat believe we need additional reactorgenerated 
tritium a radioactive gas for nuclear warheads we need to have 
more than enough they argue because unilateral disarmament is 
otherwise inevitable 
but the idea of spending 68 billion over the next 10 years to 
put up the reactors considering the safety problems with the rest 
of this countrys reactors makes absolutely no sense 
we dont need more tritium we instead need defense department 
officials who dont use national security jargon as an excuse to 
ask for anything under the sun including 68 billion nuclear 
reactors

the senate agriculture committee unanimously 
passed a rural development program today after senate leaders agreed 
to tackle drought relief next month 
the insistence tuesday by senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas that the senate pass drought relief for winter wheat farmers 
in his state and elsewhere before rural development had threatened 
to cripple both pieces of legislation democratic committee members 
today 
however committee chairman patrick leahy dvt and the panels 
ranking republican sen richard lugar of indiana announced they 
had agreed to move forward with the rural development bill and act 
on drought relief july 19 
i think everything has been accomplished leahy said i 
think we have guaranteed we will have a feasible rural development 
bill on the floor 
lugar said weve agreed that were going to work for passage 
of these two bills 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine has promised that the 
senate would act on the rural development program this summer and 
send it to the house which does not have any similar legislation 
dole had argued in a committee meeting tuesday that quick action 
on drought relief for winter wheat should take precedence over rural 
development legislation 
kansas winter wheat farmers have been wiped out by the early 
spring drought said dole who has sponsored a bill extending terms 
of 1988 drought relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest this 
year namely winter wheat 
in my state rural development means drought relief dole 
said 
winter wheat crop losses in kansas the hardest hit of all the 
states have been estimated to be 16 billion said dole 
however doles objections threatened to scuttle both pieces of 
legislation because some senators were objecting to provisions in 
the rural development bill other farmstate lawmakers including 
sen kent conrad dnd did not want to pass a droughtrelief bill 
before it was known how extensive the dry weather would be this year 
conrads state was devastated by drought last year and experts 
are still concerned about dry soil conditions in the upper midwest 
the 132page rural development legislation would provide 100 
million in federal seed money for revolving loan funds as well as 
200 million to improve education health services communications 
and utilities in rural areas to encourage business expansion 
leahy said drought relief legislation would be discussed july 13 
with a committee vote july 19 
rural development is a high priority as congress moves toward 
designing the 1990 omnibus farm bill a house subcommittee has been 
holding hearings to gather information on the needs in communities 
rapidly losing population because of depressed economic conditions 
leahy said he wants the senate bill to move quickly so the house 
would have time to work with it this year but he has been opposed 
to passing any drought relief bill until it is clear whether spring 
crops have been damaged

queen elizabeth ii conferred an honorary knighthood 
on former president reagan today the highest honor britain can give 
a foreigner 
i feel greatly honored reagan said as he left buckingham 
palace holding the insignia of the knighthood a star badge and 
crimson silk sash i cant say how proud i am 
the queen standing alongside reagan warned him jokingly 
dont drop them 
buckingham palace announced the award as reagan and his wife 
nancy lunched with the queen and her husband prince philip on the 
fourth day of his british visit 
the palace said the queen made reagan an honorary knight grand 
cross of the most honorable order of the bath an order established 
in 1725 that recognizes services to britain 
reagan is the 58th american to receive an honorary knighthood it 
is the highest honor britain bestows on americans but only britons 
can use the title sir 
the reagans arrived in a fourcar motorcade at a private entrance 
to the palace and were greeted on the steps in brilliant sunshine by 
prince philip 
the queen met them inside for the lunch which was attended by 
just the two couples 
the reagans on their first visit to britain since leaving the 
white house in january arrived sunday and are due to leave for 
paris on thursday 
burkes peerage which chronicles the british aristocracy said 
earlier that reagan had accepted the offer of an honorary 
knighthood buckingham palace previously had refused to confirm or 
deny its intentions 
on tuesday night the reagans dined with prime minister margaret 
thatcher guests included british actors peter ustinov and richard 
todd and bestselling novelist frederick forsyth at what a thatcher 
aide called a jolly evening 
earlier in the day reagan addressed the english speaking union 
in the guildhall the 1000yearold seat of london city government 
where he spoke as president 13 months ago 
reagan said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was possibly his 
countrys only hope for change and we should take the risk of 
believing he is serious about arms control 
of china the former us president said the chinese 
government hasnt learned something very elementary you cant 
massacre an idea you cannot run tanks over hope you cannot riddle 
a peoples yearning with bullets 
several members of mrs thatchers governing conservative party 
had recommended a high honor for reagan 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage said 
monday that reagan was offered a knighthood because of his special 
contribution to the british government under mrs thatcher he 
helped mrs thatcher in the falklands war and in many different 
ways 
the united states provided naval intelligence communications 
facilities and political support to britain during its 1982 war 
against argentina over the falkland islands in the south atlantic 
most british honors are made on the recommendation of the prime 
minister and formally awarded by the queen buckingham palace said 
awards to foreign officials must be recommended by the foreign 
office 
the order of the bath is one of the highest orders of chivalry 
and had its origins in the knights appointed at the coronations of 
saxon kings 
reagans defense secretary caspar weinberger was awarded an 
honorary knighthood in february 1988 but in a lower order that of 
the british empire 
other americans who have received honorary knighthoods include 
president eisenhower former secretary of state dean rusk 
philanthropists paul mellon and john paul getty ii actors douglas 
fairbanks jr and sidney poitier former us sen william 
fulbright dark and food magnate henry j heinz ii

after starting their first atomic chain 
reaction officials at the longdelayed seabrook plant said they 
know how thomas edison must have felt when he lit the first electric 
light bulb in 1879 
we certainly havent reinvented the light bulb seabrooks 
top executive edward brown said tuesday but we believe there is 
great significance in our success 
have we changed history some people are saying so brown 
said seabrook station has faced one of the longest most 
convoluted licensing processes that any commercial nuclear power 
plant has ever encountered in this world 
the plant symbolizes the troubled state of the nations nuclear 
power industry seabrooks owners originally planned two reactors at 
a cost of 973 million the first to start commercial operation 10 
years ago but repeated regulatory delays drove the first reactors 
pricetag up to 6 billion and forced cancellation of the second 
reactor 25 percent complete 
the plant also became a focus of antinuclear activism protests 
since construction began in 1976 have resulted in more than 3200 
arrests including 734 arrests in two days of civil disobedience 
earlier this month 
despite its woes the seaside plant was completed in july 1986 
and last month won its lowpower testing license which allows it to 
conduct tests at up to 5 percent of full power 
three faulty safety valves set back the start of fission by about 
a week but at 523 pm tuesday seabrook operators started a chain 
reaction in the plants 100 tons of uranium fuel 
operators plan to conduct tests for about seven days at power 
levels ranging from a fraction of 1 percent to 3 percent of capacity 
tests continued smoothly today at 001 percent of power plant 
spokesman ron sher said the reactor was at up to 1 percent during 
the night as operators tested properties of the uranium fuel sher 
said 
on tuesday about 30 seabrook workers broke into applause and 
shook hands when told the reactor had split its first atoms 
we have crossed the threshold said joseph grillo the 
operations manager we are in the homestretch toward fullpower 
operation and everyone here is excited about it 
still unresolved is whether seabrook will ever operate 
commercially it must win federal approval for evacuation plans for 
crowded beaches and communities up to 10 miles away including six 
communities in massachusetts which refuses to cooperate 
seabrook has developed its own evacuation plans for 
massachusetts and nuclear regualtory commission licensing board 
hearings on them are expected to finish later this month seabrook 
officials hope to win a commercial license this fall 
plant foes led by massachusetts attorney general james shannon 
have promised to fight to the us supreme court if necessary to 
block a commercial license 
but brown president of seabrook operator new hampshire yankee 
was confident the plant would run commercially 
the opposition also said they were going to take us to court on 
the lowpower license they didnt win brown said 
its inevitable this plant is going to operate and wed be 
much better off if massachusetts would participate in emergency 
planning 
seabrooks owners also may have to prove they are financially 
qualified to run the plant commercially lead owner public service 
co of new hampshire is under federal bankruptcy protection and 
some of the other 11 new england utilities with stakes in the plant 
also face financial problems

authorities today announced the arrest of two of 
21 student leaders wanted for roles in the prodemocracy movement 
and ordered two western reporters expelled for their reporting on 
the martial law crackdown 
given three days to leave were john pomfret of the associated 
press and voice of america bureau chief alan pessin 
the british broadcasting corp in beijing initially reported that 
brian barron its far eastern tv correspondent also was ordered out 
but later said it was just a mistake 
the expulsion order came as authorities intensified criticism of 
the united states and pressed on with a nationwide clampdown on 
dissent that has already netted more than 1000 arrests 
communist authorities have criticized voa whose shortwave 
broadcasts are an important source of information for chinese as 
spreading distortions they have also condemned washington for 
sheltering chinese dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian at 
the us embassy 
us diplomats in china t were wounded it said about 100 civilians 
were killed and nearly 1000 injured 
the figures were lower than those given last week by a government 
spokesman who said nearly 300 people were killed including many 
soldiers chinese witnesses and western intelligence estimates say 
about 3000 people were killed most of them civilians 
the government crackdown on dissent continued unabated with 
national television announcing the arrest of two student leaders of 
the sevenweek movement for a freer society 
national television said one of 21 student leaders of the 
prodemocracy movement zhou fengsuo was arrested in the central 
city of xian after being turned in by his sister and her husband 
who works at an air force academy 
pictures of zhou a 22yearold physics student at qinghua 
university in beijing and the other activists were flashed on 
television tuesday and today and appeared in todays newspapers with 
appeals for people to turn them in 
the evening television news showed zhou sitting in a police 
station being questioned 
a later report said xiong yan 24 a graduate student of law at 
beijing university also was arrested but gave no details he also 
was shown being questioned 
television also reported that fang ke a member of the 
independent student union that led the protests surrendered to 
police in the central chinese city of wuhan it identified fang as a 
philosophy student at peoples university in beijing 
authorities have ordered all students and workers active in the 
squashed prodemocracy movement to turn themselves in 
among them were wuer kaixi a beijing normal university student 
who in a televised meeting in may told premier li peng to stop 
beating around the bush because china faced a political crisis 
the government accused the 21 of inciting and organizing 
counterrevolutionary rebellion in beijing during the movement for 
a dialogue with the government free speech and an end to official 
corruption 
beijing radio said 32 people including workers were arrested 
while trying to flee from the capitals railway station troops and 
police have set up checkpoints at the railway station and have been 
inspecting bags and identification papers 
the peoples daily editorial continued to attack both fang and 
the united states for sheltering him some foreigners who are 
hostile to china praise them fang and li and make them out to be 
democracy fighters in so doing they cant but dream of using 
fang lizhi and others to throw china into chaos it said 
the xinhua report claimed that student protesters had received 
funds and materials from overseas reactionary political forces 
but did not specify the sources student groups in the west and hong 
kong had openly sent donations to the students 
xinhua also attacked a 33foottall statue modeled on the us 
statue of liberty that the students erected in tiananmen square as 
an attempt to stir up worship of americanstyle freedom and 
democracy 
the offensive against foreign criticism was begun tuesday by 
premier li who accused a small number of nations of using 
chinas political troubles to spread all kinds of rumors stir up 
antichina sentiments and put pressure on us 
almost all western countries have condemned chinas violent 
suppression of the student movement and warned of economic sanctions 
if human rights abuses continue the bush administration has cut off 
military aid and sales to china 
there were unconfirmed reports that the party central committee 
would hold a plenary session soon to officially remove party chief 
zhao ziyang from office he has not been seen in public since may 
19 the day before martial law was declared in beijing

the indianapolis star on china 
the united states is right to ignore chinese communist demands to 
turn over astrophysicist fang lizhi who with his wife has been 
granted refuge in the us embassy at beijing 
fang although he remained aloof from the demonstrations in may 
had made a personal enemy of chief communist deng xiaoping earlier 
when he criticized marxism and the chinese leadership publicly that 
led to his expulsion from the communist party in 1987 
a government campaign to cast fang as the organizer of an effort 
to overthrow the communist leadership is one of many harsh steps now 
being taken against students and others who demonstrated peacefully 
for greater personal and press freedom the action is exposing the 
governments true colors 
at present the totalitarians in china have the upper hand but 
their time may be running out 
the united states should intensify its voice of america 
broadcasts to mainland china and step up its criticism of the brutal 
military suppression of peaceful students whose only crime was 
seeking the freedoms now enjoyed by most of the noncommunist world

president bush who originally sought to keep the door open to 
normal relations with china through the vicious military crackdown 
on the student uprising is pursuing a lost cause 
normalcy at least the normalcy of a china with a slowly 
liberalizing government responsive to the will of the people no 
longer exists in china any vestige was suspended in beijing the 
night the 27th army opened fire on civilians in tiananmen square 
and has been put to rout across the nation since then 
the aging hardline communist leaders waging a campaign of 
terror against their own people do not deserve continued tolerance 
from the united states 
there can be no business and cultural relations with a government 
with as much blood on its hands and repression in its plans as the 
terrorist government of deng li and yang

polands freest elections in four decades to solidarity by a 
landslide 
unfortunately postelection euphoria is likely to be 
shortlived solidarity leader lech walesa told his supporters 
our political victories will mean nothing if we dont improve the 
economy 
walesa has succeeded in legalizing solidarity and in giving it a 
voice in the government but the union will also share in the blame 
if economic reforms fail 
in the future walesas most difficult task might not be holding 
the government to its promises but keeping the support of impatient 
solidarity members

the westerly ri sun on the death of khomeini 
the confusion and chaos surrounding the burial of the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini follow the pattern of his 10year reign over the 
most confusing and chaotic government confronting the community of 
nations 
as khomeini fades into history there is the chance for a new 
iran to emerge a nation willing to accept the responsibilities of 
nationhood a nation ready to recognize negotiation not terrorism 
as the way to achieve national goals 
the first step facing iran is to avoid a bitter and protracted 
internal power struggle 
as president bush has said we hope iran will now move toward 
assuming a responsible role in the international community

the registerguard eugene ore on saving elephants 
poachers are killing africas elephants at such a rate that the 
worlds largest land animals will be extinct within 20 years 
the best way to protect the elephants is to put the poachers out 
of business and the best way to do that is to shut down the world 
market for ivory 
president bush did his part by banning ivory imports other 
nations should follow 
marine mammals are the source of part of the worlds ivory 
but most of it comes from elephant tusks ten years ago there were 
an estimated 15 million elephants in africa now there are about 
500000 organized poachers are killing 200 to 300 a day 
last year the united states imported 322 million worth of 
ivory or 10 to 15 percent of the worlds total bushs decision to 
ban imports closes the door to a significant segment of the market 
a drop in demand would tend to push world prices down thereby 
reducing poachers incentives 
other nations should quickly impose bans of their own

hit and a source of revenue for the communist nation 
the west german publishers of the soviet presidents book said 
wednesday they alone have sold 700000 copies grossing 15 million 
thus far 
gorbachev gets about 10 percent of that said peter schaper 
business manager of droemerknauer publishers which published the 
book in west germany 
gorbachev has said that part of the proceeds from the book are to 
be given to the communist party in the soviet union with the rest 
used for social projects such as aid to the victims of the 
earthquake in armenia 
schaper in an interview with saarland state radio estimated 
that 10 million copies have been sold worldwide 
schaper said he had no figures on soviet proceeds from worldwide 
sales of the book although an estimate of 5 million to 75 millon 
was reasonable 
perestroika which outlines the kremlin leaders course for 
reform has been on the bestseller lists in west germany since it 
went on sale last year for about 20

vice president dan quayle declared 
today there is a consensus among central american allies for us 
positions on nicaragua and panama and said he warned salvadoran 
rightists not to cause any embarrassment to newly elected 
president alfredo cristiani 
in a news conference this morning on the last day of his 
threeday swing through central america quayle also won support 
from costa rican president oscar arias for his denunciation of the 
preparations in leftist nicaragua for elections next february 
arias told reporters that so far having fair and open 
elections is not possible with the election laws that have 
been put in place to deal with candidate access to the media 
they will have to meet at least a minimum standard so as to be 
considered legitimate arias said 
quayle asked about his meeting tuesday with roberto daubuisson 
and other members of the rightist arena party in san salvador said 
he was firm in telling them not to interfere with cristianis 
moderate approach 
i made it very clear our position on human rights i made it 
very clear to them i did not want to see any embarrassment of 
cristiani he said 
quayles press secretary david beckwith told reporters earlier 
that daubuisson nodded when the vice president pulled him aside and 
made the demand the four other arena politicians present said 
cristiani would be vigilant and punish anyone who committed 
violations beckwith said 
daubuisson and arena have denied links to squads that engage in 
political torture and executions cristiani has pledged commitment 
to human rights as well but concerns have been voiced by 
congressional critics that cristianis election might spark a rise 
in such activity 
quayle was completing his whirlwind tour of central america today 
after his talks with arias on nicaragua and panama the vice 
president has visited guatemala honduras el salvador and costa 
rica 
i have been on a mission of peace and democracy he told 
reporters on arrival at the san jose airport tuesday evening before 
he headed to a reception hosted by arias i look forward to 
meeting with the author of esquipulas ii president arias 
esquipulas ii refers to the 1987 regional peace accord signed by 
the five central american presidents it called for a cessation of 
nicaraguas civil war democratic elections there disarmament of 
the contra rebels amnesty for them and a ban on aid to insurgent 
movements by the signatory countries 
in el salvador quayle also met with leftist politicians ruben 
zamora and guillermo ungo and urged them to sever ties with the 
marxistled guerrillas who have fought the government since 1979 
beckwith said they did not agree to do so and likewise refused 
quayles plea that they tell the rebels to lay down their arms he 
said 
during his threeday trip quayle has kept up a stream of 
criticism against nicaragua the one central american country he is 
not visiting 
on tuesday he heatedly accused nicaraguas sandinista government 
of shipping a large cache of weapons to the salvadoran guerrillas in 
violation of the esquipulas accord 
he viewed the assorted assault rifles antitank rockets and 
other weapons and ammunition displayed in the defense ministry 
courtyard 
quayle said they were of soviet bloc and cuban manufacture and 
were shipped thorough nicaragua 
nicaragua is visibly displayed right here he said they 
are weapons that are made to try to kill democracy here in el 
salvador 
although the united states is backing the diplomatic approach 
leading to free elections in nicaragua next february quayle voiced 
doubts a fair election will occur 
right now nicaragua is in violation of the esquipulas ii 
agreement he said at a news conference you have to be somewhat 
skeptical about the sandinistas following through on other 
promises they have made to allow democratic reforms

from the academy for performing arts the chinese university of hong 
kong and the hong kong polytechnic worked on the project which took 
a week to complete 
since the chinese crackdown on demonsrators supporters of the 
students have erected replicas of the goddess statue in parks in 
washington and in taipei taiwan whose government lost a war to the 
communists on the chinese mainland in 1949 
the crackdown provoked widespread fear and anger among hong 
kongs 55 million people who will be under chinese rule when 
britain returns to the colony to china in 1997

chinese students and flooded china with letters phone calls and

collect witness accounts of the military crackdown to challenge 
denials in the official chinese media the accounts will be sent to 
the un human rights commission and the european human rights 
commission a spokeswoman said 
the chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed most 
of them soldiers in the crackdown chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence reports say the toll could be as high as 3000 and 
that most of the dead were unarmed civilians

the planning they referred to the bu plan as a hostile takeover 
more than half of chelseas students are hispanic 
the district has one of the highest dropout rates in the state at 
17 percent the teen pregnancy rate of 14 percent is the highest in 
the state and nearly half the citys households earn less than

highlights of west germansoviet 
economic relations 
west germany is the soviet unions largest western trading 
partner with a trade turnover that has ranged from 75 billion to 
125 billion in the past decade the two nations traded 8 billion 
in goods last year about 58 percent of which were west german 
exports 
west germany mostly ships heavy machinery to the soviet union 
while imports from the soviet union are mostly made up of raw 
materials like oil natural gas and timber 
west german exports to the soviet union surged 20 percent last 
year a jump that industry analysts attribute to increased business 
opportunities created by gorbachevs domestic economic reforms 
still only about 15 percent of west germanys total exports go to 
the soviet union 
west german companies have forged 70 joint ventures in the 
soviet union ranging from machinetool manufacturing to the 
production of consumer goods 
the two nations signed 12 coproduction agreements in 1988 
bringing the number of such agreements to 30 another 30 are under 
negotiation 
in 1988 a consortium of nine west german banks approved a 
record 153 billion line of credit to the soviet union for use in 
improving the nations consumer products industry however the 
credits are tied to specific projects and only about onethird of 
the funds have been borrowed to date 
the soviet union and west germany have signed agreements to 
ease capital investment restrictions and to encourage additional 
joint ventures and business exchanges

helmets are absolutely necessary for children 
on bicycles a consumer safety group said wednesday while warning 
that seemingly innocuous toys like balloons and water slides can 
pose serious dangers 
kids and balloons just dont go together said ann brown 
chairman of the consumer affairs committee of americans for 
democratic action 
among the top causes of death among children is inhaling pieces 
of balloons which can obstruct the windpipe and choke a child 
explained brown at an outdoor news conference called to discuss the 
safety of summer toys 
the committee which has held a similar prechristmas event for 
several years decided to add a summer version this year to deal 
with the many seasonal toys on sale 
children are out of school and more on their own at this time of 
year meaning that parental supervision is less available to prevent 
mishaps brown commented 
with bike riding popular she urged making sure that helmets are 
worn to protect all riders from accidental head injury it is the 
most important thing she said 
backyard gym and swing sets are popular too and brown encouraged 
parents to make sure these are securely anchored and have no exposed 
metal to cut or pinch children 
recently popular water slides can pose a hazard to children she 
added 
these slides are plastic sheets that children wet with a hose and 
then slide on brown said the slides sold by many companies can 
lead to injuries from slips and falls and also from the sharp anchor 
stakes used to hold them down 
other hazards cited included chemical light sticks that can 
irritate childrens eyes if the chemical spills out and motorized 
toy cars that reach speeds of up to five miles per hour a rate 
brown said is dangerous for occupants aged 3 to 5 
the committee also found some safe and fun toys that it 
recommended they included 
sand factory by fisherprice a series of tubes shapes shovels 
and funnels for sand play especially at the beach 
waterbarrow by fisherprice a plastic toy wheelbarrow with 
water tank and hose for sprinkling flowers and oneself 
weekender by fisherprice a lightweight suitcase for children 
grow with me picnic table by fisherprice a heavy gauge 
durable plastic table with attached benches 
big teetertotter by little tikes a sturdy board that can take 
up to 80 pounds yet is lightweight 
scoots by playskool a plastic scooter for 3 and 4year olds 
training wheels can be attached if needed 
splatter up by worlds of wonder a water toy that uses pressure 
from a hose to shoot a plastic ball into the air on command

police on wednesday arrested at least 60 
doctors staging a threeday nationwide strike at staterun hospitals 
for higher pay 
several hundred interns in state hospitals and clinics went on 
strike monday for the second time in seven months demanding pay 
raises and better working conditions 
police said they would detain all others who refused to work 
under zimbabwean law people working in essential services are 
banned from striking and face jail terms of up to 10 years 
on tuesday cabinet minister for public services chris andersen 
warned strikers would be prosecuted if they didnt end the walkout 
wednesday 
only emergency cases were being treated by senior doctors and 
army medical teams in state hospitals officials said 
in zimbabwes secondlargest city of bulawayo 54 doctors filed 
peacefully into police vehicles at mpilo hospital hospital 
officials said 
the doctors apparently were waiting to be arrested when police 
arrived said mpilo medical superintendent naboth chaibva 
in the eastern border city of mutare four striking doctors were 
arrested 
in harare only two were arrested they presented themselves to 
police at parirenyatwa hospital the capitals largest and said 
we have come they climbed into a police car and declared we 
are now under arrest 
police said other strikers in harare dispersed after a morning 
meeting and were being sought 
health minister felix muchemwa said he drafted a new offer for 
the doctors but did not release its details he said the offer 
would be presented to the doctors when they return to work 
andrew cakana president of the hospital doctors association 
said strikers were being asked to determine whether they should end 
their strike 
but he said the doctors who earn an average of 300 a month 
were not simply seeking better terms for themselves they also want 
immediate measures to prevent the breakdown of state health services 
there are no catheters in state hospitals and there is a 
widespread shortage of basic drugs cakana said the only coronary 
unit at a government hospital was closed because there were no 
specially trained nurses he said 
at harare hospital there are only three respirators for 60 
births a day and doctors constantly must decide which babies should 
live and which should die cakana said 
there also is a shortage of surgical gloves and four doctors 
recently died of aids evidently after being infected by patients 
during surgery cakana said

the senate voted 8217 today to end 35 years of 
federal controls on natural gas prices a move supporters said would 
help increase supplies without boosting prices 
the house passed a nearly identical bill in april 
president bush has expressed strong support for natural gas 
decontrol which he calls crucial to giving necessary incentives to 
gas drillers and producers 
the legislation would lift the price controls on jan 1 1993 it 
would complete a price decontrol process that began in 1978 with the 
natural gas policy act which removed price limits on certain kinds 
of gas while also establishing two dozen categories of gas each 
with a ceiling price 
energy experts have said removal of the remaining price controls 
is likely to have little if any immediate effect on prices because 
most gas still under controls already is selling in the open market 
for less than the ceiling price 
many analysts predict however that natural gas prices will rise 
early in the 1990s 
sen don nickles rokla said in debate before todays vote 
that complete decontrol would benefit both the energy industry and 
consumers 
we should allow the market to determine the price of natural 
gas not members of the senate not members of congress he said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio the chief opponent of the 
legislation said consumers would be hurt because gas producers and 
pipelines would be free to raise prices without limit 
the gas producers want to ride that rocket just as far as it 
will take them he said before the vote

as the bush administration seeks 13 billion 
in 1990 to strengthen efforts to keep illegal drugs out of the 
united states some officials say that even sealing the nations 
borders would not end americas drug plague 
a congressional researcher says more drugs than ever are flooding 
the country despite border interdiction programs but federal 
agencies handling such efforts say they will stem the flow in time 
a source on the staff of the senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations says weve had people tell us that if the borders 
were sealed within three days domestic labs will be producing 
synthetic cocaine 
domestic producers already supply us demand for methamphetamine 
and pcp as well as 25 percent to 35 percent of the marijuana 
consumed in this country says a spokesman for william j bennett 
director of the office of national drug control policy 
in fact spokesman don hamilton said marijuana is being exported 
from the united states 
bushs proposed drugfighting budget for fiscal 1990 would 
provide 39 billion for law enforcement including 13 billion for 
drug interdiction efforts 969 million for druguse prevention 
programs and 661 million for treatment 
the bush budget would allot 706 percent of those funds to law 
enforcement efforts 175 percent to prevention and 119 percent to 
treatment 
in 1989 by contrast 335 billion was allocated for law 
enforcement 681 million for prevention and 534 million for 
treatment 
there are widely divergent views on how effective interdiction 
efforts have been and bennett has heard them all as he puts together 
a national strategy to curb drug abuse and the violence spawned by 
drug trafficking 
while he believes the united states must keep up the interdiction 
pressure he also accepts that much more must be done on prevention 
education and treatment 
you dont abandon interdiction just because drugs are somehow 
getting through said hamilton you have to do what you can to 
make the lives of traffickers more difficult 
but he adds that we have to realize that our salvation in the 
drug war will not be hermetically sealed borders 
there would be a drug problem in the united states even if the 
border were sealed while some people do have a drug of choice many 
people simply want to get high 
arnold p jones of the general accounting office a congressional 
research office stressed in testimony last week before the senate 
investigations subcommittee that despite all attempts at 
interdiction drug supply in the united states is increasing that 
is illustrated he said by an increase in the purity of drugs sold 
on the street a decrease in their price and a hike in drugrelated 
emergency room treatments 
coast guard lt cmdr james g simpson says that even if the 
aerial interdiction success rate were just one out of 20 planes 
half what it is now that would still be a great record 
to denigrate a success rate of 10 percent or even 5 percent 
reflects he said an incredibly naive understanding of the 
problem 
for years simpson said the coast guard had only two or three 
ships looking for illicit drugs making their way across the 
caribbean 
we came up with huge seizures of marijuana eventually we put a 
lot of equipment down there and seizures dropped 
fewer seizures indicate success not failure simpson said 
because they mean drug traffickers have had to try alternate routes 
that may cost them more and give them more trouble such as using 
overland couriers or hiding the drugs in cargo containers 
dick weart of the customs service says that while a system of 
radar balloons along the southern border is only partially 
completed where they are in place landborder crossing seizures 
are up 500 to 600 percent more and more were getting containers 
with 5000 6000 7000pound loads 
but some observers say interdiction wont work no matter how 
dramatic seizures may be not only because foreign traffickers will 
continue to get around barriers but because domestic producers will 
fill otherwise unmet demands 
ultimately the only way to win the war against drugs they say 
is through druguse prevention education and treatment programs 
such efforts wont bear fruit quickly they say 
changing the behavior of people is a longterm process said 
the gaos jones i personally believe that to look for the light 
at the end of the tunnel during the course of any administration 
does not do justice to the enormity of the problem

about 300 boat people from southern vietnam 
pressed demands wednesday for transfer to another camp complaining 
of threats and attacks by refugees from the communist heartland of 
northern vietnam 
groups of southerners left the bowring refugee camp starting 
monday and sat and slept outside the san yick camp where they asked 
to be let in 
the group swelled to about 300 people on wednesday and some 
carried all their belongings with them a corrections department 
spokesman said 
the southerners said northerners over the weekend had beaten a 
southern man who required hospitalization 
they claimed they were threatened there said the spokesman 
who cannot be identified under agency regulations there are 
always disputes between northern and southern vietnamese in the 
camp 
he said department officials had tried to persuade the 
southerners to return to bowring and apply for transfer through 
normal channels 
the northern vietnamese sailed from areas of their homeland that 
have been under communist rule since 1954 others came from what 
once was south vietnam where a usbacked government was toppled 
by communist forces in april 1975 the two regions have remained 
divided economically since the war 
most of the vietnamese at bowring are northerners southerners 
make up the majority at san yick a converted factory that the 
international community condemned as unfit for human habitation 
until hong kong improved conditions 
more than 18000 vietnamese have arrived in hong kong since jan 
1 compared to about 10500 for the same period last year 
facilities are overwhelmed with a total of about 30000 vietnamese 
and hundreds arrive daily 
along with conflicts inside the camps the government of this 
tiny british colony has had to contend with the increasing 
resentment of the vietnamese by hong kong people particularly those 
who live near the camps 
on tuesday more than 200 residents of the yuen long community 
protested government plans to open a detention center there to 
accommodate new arrivals 
the marching protesters blocked a road leading to the sek kong 
military airfield where the government plans to erect of cluster of 
tents on the runway to house the vietnamese the airfield is about 
12 miles northwest of hong kongs city center 
david ford deputy to the governor of hong kong said tuesday 
that officials planned to open the center by the end of the week 
a year ago hong kong adopted a screening policy to separate 
newly arriving vietnamese into two groups those fleeing political 
persecution and thus eligible for resettlement in the west and 
those fleeing because of poverty or other reasons these refugees 
must be returned to vietnam as are illegal immigrants from other 
countries according to hong kong officials and residents 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach rejected that position 
on tuesday at an international conference on refugees in geneva

an independent group on wednesday called 
for the removal of the red star a symbol of communist authority 
from state and public buildings the official mti news agency said 
a budapest chapter of the federation of young democrats said in a 
statement released through the agency it had appealed to parliament 
for the elimination of the emblem as the red star was unfit to 
adorn our state buildings as a sole symbol 
it said the current practice was contrary to the need for a 
pluralistic society 
hungarys ruling communist party and leaders of the opposition 
including the federation of young democrats began historic 
negotiations tuesday on multiparty elections that could set the 
stage for the first coalition leadership since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 
the federation said it was necessary to remove the emblem of an 
ideology which has lost its monopolistic position and offered 
community work from its members to pay for the costs of taking off 
the stars

house democrats today elected richard gephardt 
majority leader and william gray whip as they sought to recover from 
the ethics turmoil that brought down two of their top three 
officials 
gephardt who failed last year in a bid for the partys 
presidential nomination defeated rep ed jenkins of georgia in a 
secret ballot by a vote of 18176 
in the whip race gray of pennsylvania received 134 votes while 
rep david bonior of michigan got 97 and rep beryl anthony of 
arkansas got 30 
grays election put him in the highest house leadership post ever 
attained by a black member 
i think weve got to get the house back on track gephardt 
told reporters weve got to be able to assert and pass a 
substantive agenda he said specifically mentioning a savings and 
loan industry bailout addressing the nations budget problems 
clean air legislation day care and parental leave and ethics 
reform 
in selecting gephardt democrats turned to a figure with lots of 
television experience a populist message honed on the presidential 
campaign trail and perhaps most important in washingtons current 
ethics climate a personal background already wellscoured by the 
media and found clean 
with tom foley of washington as the new house speaker the top 
echelon now represents a new generation of democratic 
leadership said rep jim slattery dkan 
these people obtained their political experience in the 60s and 
70s we have come dangerously close to being perceived as the party 
of the status quo they recognize how important it is for the party 
to be projecting a positive image of change slattery said 
foley told reporters that democrats are satisfied that this is 
a leadership team that can represent the party and our caucus but 
more importantly the country 
foley said it had been hard to choose between people of great 
ability and talent and commitment to the party but said he felt 
comfortable about the competition because we knew we were going to 
have great leaders to serve the caucus 
gephardt said he hoped to reassert an agenda for progress in 
this country 
gephardt of missouri has all the qualities of leadership 
said rep marvin leath dtexas who had supported jenkins hes 
the best listener in the world and a natural consensus builder 
in a nominating speech for gephardt rep david obey dwis 
alluded to ethics attacks on democrats by rep newt gingrich rga 
in this era of newtspeak we need to confront crass with class 
obey said according to one staff member present 
gephardts relatively easy win came in large measure because of 
his ability to listen and seek consensus demonstrated over 12 years 
in congress his reputation as a legislative strategist and his 
campaign work last year on behalf of many democrats 
gray the chairman of the democratic caucus was the early 
favorite in the whip race but had been hampered by reports the fbi 
was investigating whether there was a nowork ghost employee on 
his staff the justice department said this week that gray himself 
is not a target of the probe and grays attorney abbe lowell said 
the congressman met last week with fbi agents and will continue to 
cooperate 
i think when all is said and done they will also end up 
confirming that there has been nothing wrong done in my office past 
or present gray said 
the 259 members of the caucus the organization of all house 
democrats met behind closed doors to fill the jobs by secret ballot 
foley moved up from majority leader last week to become speaker 
after jim wright dtexas stepped down over ethics allegations 
democratic whip tony coelho dcalif is leaving congress on 
thursday because of questions about his financial dealings 
the leadership shakeup marks what obey called the moving of a 
new generation of political power into this place the new team 
will be more telegenic more pragmatic more interested in 
bipartisan consensus than its predecessors 
but it may also lack some of the taste for partisan infighting 
seen in wright and particularly in coelho 
i felt i was on the starting team and was one of the stars 
coelho said but you remove one of the starters and the team 
adjusts somebodys going to do the political work because it needs 
to be done and theres recognition for it and the caucus is going 
to demand it 
gephardt offered campaignhoned media savvy to the visible no 2 
job 
it raises the stature of the house coelho said it in 
effect makes house members bigger players on the national scene 
gephardt has told supporters he is putting aside presidential 
ambitions and is instead putting himself into the longterm track to 
be speaker 
jenkins a popular insider who is a member of the taxwriting 
ways and means committee won sympathy for his call for greater 
representation for the partys conservative southern wing and there 
was talk of creation of a special post for someone from that group 
after weve seen the caucus elections well have a chance 
to examine whether any appointments might be made that would provide 
some additional balance in the leadership said foley

business sales rose 17 percent in april their 
steepest gain since march 1988 and far outpacing a 06 percent jump 
in inventories the government said wednesday 
analysts expect sales to soften but say they see no sign of any 
dangerous buildup in stockpiles 
we find very little evidence of any excess stocks and i think 
thats good news for the economy because it lessens the risk of 
recession as we move forward said economist lawrence chimerine of 
the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
rising inventories if not accompanied by increased sales could 
threaten a recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back 
production until excess stocks are sold 
but the ratio of inventories to sales dropped in april to 149 
meaning it would take 149 months to exhaust inventories at the 
april sales pace 
neither chimerine nor bruce steinberg senior economist for 
merrill lynch consider that a troublesome level 
so far in this business cycle inventory behavior has been 
encouraging in that it has not become excessive steinberg said 
whether that continues to be the case remains to be seen but at 
least at this point there really arent any serious areas of 
excess 
the commerce department reported that sales rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 5163 billion in april after holding steady in march the 
gain was the steepest since sales rose 18 percent in march 1988 
inventories on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 7698 billion after a 03 percent rise a month earlier 
the department said that was the highest since a 08 percent gain 
in january 
steinberg said much of the sales gain was pricerelated and 
added i wouldnt read too much into the sales number 
inflation has been a concern of the federal reserve board which 
until this month was forcing interest rates up in an attempt to 
slow the economy and restrain price increases 
chimerine also said he expects the pace of sales to slow in 
coming months he noted that an advance report on may retail sales 
released by the commerce department tuesday showed a weak 01 
percent gain 
retail inventories registered the strongest increase in april up 
08 percent the department said while the retail sales category 
showed the weakest gain up 10 percent 
manufacturing inventories which represent 47 percent of the 
total were up 06 percent while wholesale inventories rose 01 
percent 
manufacturers led april sales gains with a 24 percent increase 
followed by a 13 percent increase by wholesalers

organizers of an event in memory of people who 
have died of aids defended their plans to release 10000 
heliumfilled balloons despite the danger the balloons may pose to 
some marine life 
we believe that the pathos evoked by the release of these 
balloons makes it a very worthwhile event said karin 
schwartz an executive board member of the heritage of pride 
organizer of the june 25 gay and lesbian pride parade down fifth 
avenue in manhattan 
but in the past few years scientists have warned of the danger 
posed by balloons especially metallic mylar balloons to marine 
life 
they eventually pop and they land in the ocean said louis 
e garibaldi director of the new york aquarium there the silvery 
coating washes off leaving a clear plastic bladder that some whales 
and turtles mistake for jellyfish 
they eat it and theyre not able to digest it he said 
there have been several reported incidents of marine animals 
washing ashore dead from swallowing mylar balloons but there is 
no real way of knowing what the magnitude of these mortalities is 
garibaldi said 
schwartz said tuesday that her organization has been working with 
concerned groups for months and made changes in this years release 
the organization will use only natural latex balloons 
according to garibaldi the danger from latex balloons is much 
lower because they are much smaller when deflated than mylar 
balloons are colored not clear and break down naturally

fort union a trading post that dominated the 
economy of the northern plains until the army dismantled it more 
than a century ago is being rebuilt as a tribute to the fur traders 
who helped shape the region 
crews have been working for four years on the multimilliondollar 
restoration project undertaken by the national park service most of 
the work will be finished later this summer while north dakota and 
montana mark their centennials 
located near the north dakotamontana border the modern parking 
lot will cross the border the fort was a headquarters for fur 
traders of the mid1800s 
fort union is the place where the story of the upper 
missouri fur trade is told says paul l hedren superintendent of 
the 430acre fort union national historic site 
fort union was built in 1829 near the confluence of the 
yellowstone and missouri rivers by john jacob astors powerful 
american fur company 
jean pierre desmet an early missionary once described it as the 
vastest and finest of the forts the american fur company has on 
the missouri 
assiniboin cree crow blackfeet and sioux indians peacefully 
coexisted with fort unions traders for a generation before the 
great indian wars broke out in the west 
guests of the fort during that time read like an early frontier 
whos who john james audubon the famous american naturalist and 
artist desmet the roman catholic missionary who worked among 
american indians and george catlin an artist known for his 
paintings of native americans 
the civilian fort was dismantled in the late 1860s by the us 
army after the american fur company went out of business the army 
used some of the doors and windows for its nearby fort buford 
nothing was left of the trading post and the reconstruction 
depends on paintings and early photographs for design and detail 
we want visitors to the fort to capture the spirit of what it 
was like to live and trade here in the 1800s hedren said weve 
taken pains to be faithful to its original appearance as much as we 
can 
the centerpiece of fort union is the colorful bourgeois house 
the house once the center of social activity was finished in 1987 
and now contains museum exhibits and administrative offices 
the walls of the fort itself began going up this spring 
modern construction techniques will ensure the walls dont 
collapse as they were inclined to do during the forts heyday the 
new walls are underpinned with concrete and steel and the forts two 
bastions which housed cannons are being built of concrete blocks 
that will be faced with native stone 
were opting to build a fort that should last a whole lot 
longer than its original 38 years hedren said 
work also has begun on an indian trade house which sat just 
inside the forts front gate 
the park service will use the basement of the trade house to 
store artifacts discovered at the site hedren estimates more than 3 
million objects have been uncovered since work began and crews 
still are finding beads and arrowheads 
hedren hopes the fort will attract 45000 visitors this year and 
as many as 65000 annually within a couple of years 
the price tag for the work done so far is about 4 million 
hedren said about 33 million has come from federal channels and 
nearly 500000 from supporters called friends of fort union 
an aug 12 dedication is expected to attract a number of 
dignitaries including lord astor of hever england a direct 
descendant of john jacob astor 
fort union probably has more bearing on history between the 
west coast and st louis than anything else says ed leppien a 
board member of the friends of fort union its almost a forgotten 
item in the history of our country

tiananmen square was unguarded by tanks wednesday 
for the first time in 11 days but banners supporting the army and 
wreaths honoring soldiers who died in the military crackdown 
appeared around beijing 
dozens of armored vehicles had been deployed in support of the 
military occupation of the square ever since troops of the peoples 
liberation army swept away thousands of prodemocracy students from 
the area early june 4 
a line of more than 36 tanks and armored personnel carriers was 
parked tuesday along the northern edge of the square in front of the 
imperial palace another dozen tanks were positioned at the southern 
end of the square behind guarded lines of barbed wire 
those armored vehicle were gone wednesday leaving just 20 
canvascovered armored personnel carriers hidden behind the qianmen 
gate at the southern entrance to the square 
the removal of tanks was the latest move to reduce the military 
presence in and around the square which is the symbolic center of 
power in china although tiananmen remained closed to pedestrians 
and guarded by a perimeter of martial law soldiers traffic now 
flows on the four streets that surround the 100acre square 
the number of soldiers stationed along changan avenue the main 
eastwest thoroughfare in beijing also appeared to thin wednesday 
with troops no longer at several positions they had occupied for 
more than a week 
even the troop transports that continued to rumble through the 
city seemed less menacing with soldiers no longer manning machine 
guns placed atop the cabs of the trucks or pointing automatic rifles 
at bystanders 
but the peoples liberation army made its presence felt in other 
more subtle ways in beijing 
several banners have appeared downtown that read respect to 
the pla 
at least two locations near major intersections were set aside 
for wreaths to honor the soldiers who died in the military attack on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
the official xinhua news agency reported wednesday that nearly 
100 soldiers and police died and thousands were wounded in the 
fighting western intelligence sources have said up to 3000 people 
died primarily unarmed students and civilians 
dozens of plastic wreaths adorned a pedestrian bridge over a 
major road in the chongwenmen district southeast of tiananmen 
several armed soldiers guarded the wreaths which they said were 
sent mainly from beijing citizens 
a crowd of dozens of curious onlookers gathered below the bridge 
as a chinese tv crew photographed two elderly woman descending the 
steps after placing wreaths 
the soldiers were just following orders said one man in the 
crowd 
much larger groups of residents earlier had gathered in front of 
major universities where wreaths and mourning banners had been 
placed to honor the students killed by the soldiers those memorials 
were removed by authorities several days ago

the town council decided against putting 
surveillance cameras on the bridges into this posh island community 
after the police chief questioned whether they would help fight 
crime 
we cant continue to build fortresses and barriers around 
ourselves chief joseph terlizzese said before the council voted 
tuesday next thing you know well be building machinegun 
nests 
terlizzese also told the council he doubted the cameras would 
have sufficient resolution to identify drivers 
besides he said crime in palm beach is not that bad last year 
the towns crime rate dropped 125 percent he said adding that a 
special motorcycle patrol team would be more effective than cameras 
the cameras on the bridges are the emperors new clothes 
said council member hermine wiener 
but mayor yvelyne marix insisted the plan could work 
for a very small amount of money the cameras could be of 
assistance if the drawbacks could be solved marix said 
palm beach where developer donald trump and the kennedy clan 
have spacious homes lies across lake worth from west palm beach 
which has highcrime areas 
more than 40 residents turned out in support of the plan when it 
was discussed in april 
but others recalled the negative national publicity the town 
received about a law requiring bluecollar workers to carry 
identification cards declared unconstitutional by a federal judge 
in 1985 
this type of situation might work against us in our public 
image phillip radlauer said then weve been taking a terrible

a titan 4 americas newest most 
powerful rocket blasted off on its maiden flight today reportedly 
sending into space a 180 million satellite designed to provide 
instant alert of a missile attack 
it was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the 
united states with the 220 million rocket a 45 million satellite 
booster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close to 
half a billion dollars 
the 20storytall booster barreled off its launch pad at 918 
am and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twin 
solidfuel boosters as it dashed out over the atlantic ocean 
ten minutes after liftoff lt col ron rand the air force 
launch commentator reported the rocket had successfully drilled its 
secret payload into space 
this is an important milestone for the air force because its 
the first titan 4 our new heavy lift launch booster which will 
give us assured access to space for our critical heavy national 
security payloads rand said 
the titan 4 will be the workhorse as the pentagon assembles a 
stable of rockets to solve a postchallenger crisis that has left 
about 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloads 
languishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle 
the titan 4 can hoist 39000pound payloads to an orbit 150 to 
300 miles high or propel 10000pound packages to stationary orbits 
23000 miles up it replaces the titan 34d booster only one of 
which remains to be launched 
the united states once had a more powerful rocket the saturn 5 
that launched apollo astronauts to the moon but it was discontinued 
after the lunar program it could send a 240000pound payload into 
orbit 
the space shuttle by comparison can lift 55000 pounds into 
orbit 
the new soviet energia rocket the worlds largest rocket has 
nearly the power of the saturn 5 
the air force said only that the big rocket was boosting a 
classified payload 
however it has been widely reported that the rocket carried an 
advanced missile warning satellite 
the satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared 
telescope to detect an allout nuclear missile attack on the united 
states within a minute of launch said john pike associate 
director of space policy for the federation of american scientists 
this quick alert would give the president and military units 15 
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the atlantic 
or pacific oceans or 30 minutes for a landbased strike from within 
soviet borders he said 
that would give bombers enough time to become airborne enough 
time to mobilize our own nuclear forces and enough time to get the 
president into an airborne command post pike said 
the new satellite offers about the same warning time as older 
ones but without such errors as mistaking sunlight glinting off 
clouds for missile exhaust pike said 
the 2ton satellite also will provide intelligence on routine 
soviet and chinese missile test firings and will be able to detect 
the exhaust heat from military aircraft when they fly with their 
afterburners on for extra speed 
pike said nine of the new satellites will be launched over the 
next several years into orbits 22300 miles high to replace aging 
earlier models 
the first of the new rockets had waited a long time for its 
maiden flight it was moved to the launch pad more than a year ago 
on may 15 1988 to be readied for a liftoff last october but 
technical problems caused delay after delay stretching into months 
and adding millions of dollars to the cost 
martin marietta denver aerospace is building 23 titan 4s for the 
air force for 51 billion the two are negotiating another contract 
for an additional 26 rockets 
pentagon officials decided after challenger exploded in 1986 that 
they were relying too heavily on the space shuttle for vital 
military payloads they more than doubled the number of titan 4s on 
order and authorized development of two new smaller rockets the 
delta 2 and atlas 2 
the first two delta 2s launched navigation satellites in 
february and on saturday

president bush declaring enough is enough 
urged leaders of congress today to strip special interest amendments 
from the savings and loan rescue bill and make the thrifts inject 
real capital into the bailout 
i think that every american citizen has every right in the 
world to be disturbed and shocked about this situation bush said 
at a cabinet room session with house and senate leaders 
the house today was taking up the 157 billion rescue plan while 
sampl lobbyists scrambled to weaken provisions the administration 
demanded in exchange for the bailout 
the industry aided by a group composed mostly of republican 
lawmakers is seeking continuation of supervisory good will an 
accounting practice that allows sampl owners to count as capital the 
losses of failed institutions they acquired in the early 1980s 
thumping his hand on the table the president declared in my 
view it is time for the american public and our administration to 
say that enough is enough and to earnestly ask for the support of 
the congress 
he said it was costing taxpayers 10 million more each day that 
congress delays acting on the legislation 
now some of the smaller or the weaker i would say sampls are 
demanding the right to continue to treat good will as capital even 
though good will has no tangible value he said he said the 
result could be up to 600 billion in loans without one dollar in 
real capital for decades to come 
house speaker thomas s foley told bush that just 15 amendments 
would be considered down from the 107 that members wanted foley 
promised the president that by weeks end therell be a strong 
bill from the house of representatives 
the senate has already passed a bill to bushs liking senate 
minority leader bob dole of kansas said he was heartened by foleys 
remarks 
it seems to me its sort of a timebomb that might go off one of 
these days unless we have a very strong piece of legislation 
stripped of all the special interests amendments and knock out the 
good will wherever you can said dole there isnt much good 
will for sampls i find around most of the people have been taken 
for a ride long enough 
leading the sampl lobbyists fight is a group composed mostly of 
republican lawmakers who have bolted from the administration on the 
issue 
theres a heck of a campaign going on said rep chalmers 
wylie of ohio the ranking republican on the house banking committee 
and one of only about a dozen of the gops 175 house members 
supporting bush on the issue 
the us league of savings institutions the biggest sampl trade 
group has someone in today from nearly everybodys district working 
it wylie said 
good will allows an exemption from federal regulations that 
require owners of sampls to put 3 of their own money at risk for 
every 100 they lend it was adopted by regulators with congress 
concurrence in the early 1980s as a way of postponing for several 
years the current sampl crisis 
more than twothirds of the nations 2938 sampls can do without 
the exemptions but if the exemptions are phased out about 450 of 
the nations 2938 thrifts would have to raise more than 6 billion 
in new capital by 1995 or be placed under government control 
william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
which insures deposits in commercial banks said this morning on 
nbcs today program that he agreed with an estimate that the 
overall bailout could cost about 300 billion over 30 years 
including interest payments 
seidman said he also agreed with bush that sampls must be required 
to put up some of their own capital i think it would be a 
disastrous mistake to pass a bill which doesnt require the owners 
to have real money in the business that is certainly a key 
factor in preventing this from happening again he said 
the administration and other critics contend good will and 
other smoke and mirror accounting practices encouraged many sampls 
to gamble federally insured deposits on everriskier loans 
mushrooming their losses tenfold when the loans turned bad 
in an effort to fulfill bushs promise that never again will 
taxpayers be asked to pay for such losses the administration has 
been waging a fourmonth campaign to close the good will and 
similar loopholes 
over the objection of most of its republicans the house banking 
committee complied writing a bill two months ago phasing out by 
1995 the use of some 197 billion in good will on sampl books now 
counted as capital

a 60nation conference endorsed plans to curb the 
mounting flow of refugees from vietnam but made no decision 
wednesday on how to deal with those who leave for economic rather 
than political reasons 
britain and its colony hong kong the destination of most boat 
people go pressed for an agreement that all who cannot prove they 
are threatened with political persecution be returned to vietnam 
an increase in the rate of illegal emigration from vietnam has 
pushed the total population of southeast asian refugee camps to 
nearly 90000 almost three times the total in 1986 most new 
arrivals flee their homeland because of economic hardship 
vietnam and the united states joined wednesday by the soviet 
union have opposed mandatory repatriation foreign minister nguyen 
co thach of vietnam reiterated at a news conference that his country 
will not accept anyone returned against his will 
hong kongs governor sir david wilson governor of hong kong 
told the delegates forced repatriation of all but political refugees 
was a humane course to deal with the action 
sir geoffrey howe the british foreign secretary said the 43000 
boat people now in hong kong had caused a major humanitarian 
crisis in the colony which already is among the most densely 
populated places in the world 
a comprehensive plan of action adopted by consensus at the 
end of the twoday conference provides for screening new arrivals 
to determine whether they are political refugees hong kong has been 
screening since june 1988 and several other nations began in march 
the plan recommends efforts to encourage the voluntary return of 
those who are refused political refugee status only 143 have agreed 
to repatriation so far despite formal assurances by vietnam that 
there will be no reprisals 
if voluntary repatriation does not make sufficient progress 
in reasonable time alternatives recognized as being acceptable 
under international practice would be examined says the sixpage 
plan 
it relies on an international media campaign to publicize 
dangers and disadvantages facing boat people including attacks by 
pirates and the benefits of legal emigration programs 
an appeal in the plan for expanded refugee resettlement programs 
drew immediate responses from several countries which pledged to 
give new homes in the next three years to at least 53500 of the 
55000 longstaying refugees those who arrived before 
screening began 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said the united 
states would take 22000 and also anticipated accepting up to 50 
percent of later arrivals classes as political refugees 
the united states has received 900000 of the 15 million people 
who have fled vietnam since the war ended in april 1975 eagleburger 
said it also has contributed more than 500 million to the support 
of refugees and spent billions on resettlement costs 
in response thach said at his news conference we have to look 
back at the origin of the refugee problem 40 years of warfare 
against vietnam the us delegation tells us that half a billion 
dollars were spent to support the refugees but more than 300 
billion were spent to kill vietnamese 
a statement from the us delegation wednesday said vietnam had 
agreed to resume talks on letting vietnamese detained in 
reeducation camps move to the united states 
one session was held in hanoi in july 1988 but vietnam suspended 
negotiations the next month the us statement said talks would 
resume in july with the date and place to be announced later 
thach said vietnam had released 94000 inmates of reeducation 
camps in the past 10 years and 120 still are detained 
all were interned for having links to the united states or the 
former south vietnamese regime 
more than 10000 former inmates have applied to emigrate to the 
united states with their families a total of 50000 people a us 
official said on condition of anonymity

a judge today refused to declare a mistrial in the 
perjury trial of former rep pat swindall ruling that a question 
asked of a witness by the prosecutor had not tainted the jury 
defense attorneys requested the mistrial after prosecutor craig 
gillen asked defense witness bobby lee cook a lawyer about what 
motivates defendants to take the stand 
swindall lawyer thomas thrash immediately objected charging that 
the prosecutor had planted in the jurors minds the idea that the 
former congressman had something to hide if he did not testify 
us district judge richard freeman stopped the trial saying 
after 17 days ill salvage this if i can but i dont know if i 
can 
after a brief recess however freeman ruled that a mistrial was 
not necessary he instructed the jurors that it was of no concern to 
them whether swindall testified and he said swindall has the legal 
right not to do so 
swindall a 38yearold republican who served two terms in 
congress before being defeated in november is charged with nine 
counts of lying to a federal grand jury about an 850000 loan deal 
he could receive up to 45 years in prison 
defense attorneys have called more than two dozen witnesses in 
three days this week but swindall was not among them 
prosecutors have charged that swindall lied in 1988 when he 
denied being told by a federal agent posing as a money launderer 
that some of the loan money might have come from drug trafficking

a congressional push for drought relief for 
winter wheat farmers may be close to raising taxpayer complaints 
about such aid agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said wednesday 
in my judgment some of the present drought proposals are at 
best on the margin of acceptability to the american public 
yeutter said 
the senate agriculture committee meanwhile unanimously approved 
a rural development program and agreed to take up drought relief on 
july 19 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas had argued before the 
committee on tuesday that quick action on drought relief for winter 
wheat farmers should come before rural development legislation 
large areas of the great plains and western corn belt have still 
not recovered from the devastating 1988 drought the winter wheat 
crop in kansas for example is down by more than a third from last 
year 
yeutter in an interview with reporters said that we have not 
officially embraced any drought legislation and will give an 
official response when the time comes 
yeutter said he preferred doles droughtrelief bill over a 
broader version in the house which he described as too 
openended with far too much taxpayer exposure and vulnerability 
further he said the house bill is far too subject to attack by 
the general public because of its costs and other features 
yeutter said the dole bill is far more acceptable in that regard 
doles drought bill would extend terms of last years drought 
relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989 mostly winter 
wheat which is normally kansas biggest crop 
the house bill which was approved by the agriculture committee 
on may 25 is basically an extension of the 39 billion 1988 
drought relief law under it if farmers qualified they could get 
federal aid for any affected crop or livestock operation 
yeutter said there are limits on measures the federal government 
can or should take to remove risk from the nations agriculture 
we are already covering price risk in agriculture in a very 
significant way through a variety of programs he said we are 
already covering income risks to agriculture in a very significant 
way through a variety of programs including deficiency payments 
subsidies 
yeutter added if were now also to cover weather risks in a 
very significant way one must wonder just what additional role 
government should take up on behalf of american agriculture and at 
what cost 
already he said there are multibilliondollar price tags 
for the price support and income protection under federal crop 
programs 
it seems to me at some point in time as an industry were 
likely to experience a taxpayer rebellion and we ought to be 
careful to ensure that we can persuasively defend these programs to 
the american public yeutter said 
the dole drought bill is obviously more attractive than the 
house bill because it is limited mostly to winter wheat he said 
that at least limits the cost exposure to the american 
taxpayer and confines it to a segment of our economy that has really 
been damaged

a travel agency was fined 50000 in 
federal court wednesday for illegally booking tours to vietnam 
us district judge tf gilroy daly also ordered linblad travel 
inc to forfeit 25000 it collected for the tours and ordered it to 
make restitution of 4410 to the government for the cost of a 
ticket bought by an undercover customs agent 
the westport company had faced a maximum penalty of 500000 for 
one count of violating a federal regulation the regulation 
prohibits tour operators and travel agents from arranging promoting 
or facilitating group or individual tours to countries designated by 
the trading with the enemy act 
under the regulation an individual can approach a us travel 
agent for information about flights to vietnam kampuchea or north 
korea but a travel agent cant solicit the business and cant 
arrange the flight 
larseric lindblad president and chief executive officer of the 
company said he advertised the tours in a travel club mailing last 
year as an act of civil disobedience to test the federal regulation 
lindblad called the regulation indecent and certainly unjust 
lindblad and his employees also had faced individual fines and 
possible prison terms before a plea bargain was reached 
us attorney stanley a twardy jr said the agreement was 
reached because federal prosecutors didnt believe they could win 
prison terms for those charged 
i thought this was a very fair disposition of the matter he 
said 
lindblad had planned to challenge the regulation all the way to 
the us supreme court if necessary but he said the costs became 
too much

a hotel has offered to pay for moving 
adolf hitlers yacht from the sensitive coral reef where it was 
mistakenly sunk earlier this month officials announced wednesday 
the yacht the ostwind was supposed to become an artificial reef 
in 250 feet of water it was sunk june 4 as part of a commemoration 
of the voyage of the damned in which the coast guard in 1939 
turned away a ship carrying more than 900 jews fleeing nazi 
persecution 
but instead the 85foot ostwind wound up in 25 feet of water 
about a mile away from the intended site creating a hazard in a 
shipping lane and threatening a live coral reef 
city commissioner abe resnick who helped organize the ostwinds 
sinking announced the owner and manager of the fontainebleau hilton 
hotel had offered to pay an estimated 10000 to move the ostwind 
we certainly do not want this yacht to be part of an 
environmental problem especially because hitler was the first great 
threat to the worlds environment in the 20th century said 
resnick a survivor of the holocaust 
the army corps of engineers had threatened to move the yacht and 
bill resnick for the costs 
resnick said the ostwind will be moved to the site originally 
intended not far from where the coast guard turned away the ss 
st louis the ship was forced to return to europe where more than 
twothirds of the passengers died in the holocaust 
the ostwind was commissioned by hitler and used by nazi 
officials although hitler apparently only used the vessel once or 
twice it eventually fell into disrepair after world war ii and was 
bought by a jacksonville marina owner

chinese seeking to join spouses in the 
united states besieged the us consulate on wednesday for visas 
and many were turned away because of a limited number of 
applications 
the united states reopened its visa offices at its consulate in 
shanghai and its embassy in beijing after closing them following the 
military crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators june 34 
about 200 people clamored to be let into the consulate on 
wednesday after officials handed out the 100 student visa 
applications for the day many held up passports and letters from 
husbands and wives as chinese staff members repeatedly told them 
their applications would not be accepted for the time being 
a reporter outside the consulate was surrounded by dozens of 
chinese who asked him to carry messages inside 
my husband has been gone for more than a year my life is not 
normal i want to see him said a statistics administrator whose 
husband is studying at the university of hawaii 
i really want to have children but how can i if i cant even 
see him she asked its so cruel we dont even have the right 
to have a family 
several people said they had heard on the us governmentfunded 
radio voice of america that the consulate would accept 
applications 
consul dan keller said his office will begin taking applications 
from chinese whose spouses are in the united states in two or three 
days but that more than half probably would be rejected 
we get students who are barely getting by with the help of 
their sponsors he said if we get a spouse who says he or she 
just wants to go over there and sit around were not inclined to 
give it a high priority well give them visas to people in 
established programs who are financed 
the us government does not allow foreign students or their 
spouses to work but suspects that most spouses try to find jobs 
illegally to earn money and that many couples plan to remain in the 
united states permanently 
more than 1000 people have been arrested nationwide since the 
military crackdown the arrests have created a climate of fear and 
many chinese want to leave the country 
while the consulates office was closed last week staff members 
helped evacuate americans amid massive prodemocracy demonstrations 
in the city of 12 million 
were still clearing up inquiries regarding welfare and 
whereabouts of us citizens keller said 
despite the extra work one consulate official said diplomats 
were making extra efforts to extend help to chinese 
you can taste the sympathy in the air said the diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the scene was calmer at the us embassy in beijing where a 
stampede had been expected but only about 200 people showed up 
apparently because plainclothes police were watching 
i just came here to look i dont even have a passport yet 
said one woman who said she has been accepted for a masters degree 
at the university of wisconsin there are a lot of police here 
about a dozen western reporters conducted interviews on several 
occasions after the interviews ended men who looked like police 
approached the chinese 
what did you talk about one man asked a woman

voters in five european economic 
community nations will pick candidates thursday for the 518member 
european parliament which enjoys a growing voice in eec affairs 
voters in the other seven eec countries go to the polls sunday 
elections will be held thursday in britain denmark ireland the 
netherlands and spain but ballots will be counted only after voters 
choose among candidates in west germany luxembourg france italy 
portugal belgium and greece 
in all 7126 candidates are vying for seats in the 518member 
assembly they represent 178 parties across the political spectrum 
preelection polls say socialists and christian democrats who 
hold 166 and 112 seats respectively in the outgoing assembly will 
remain the largest factions and might even make gains 
green party candidates are expected to do well in west germany 
the netherlands france belgium spain and portugal and win 
substantially more than the 20 seats they held previously 
in ireland luxembourg and greece voting for the european 
parliament coincides with national legislative elections 
but even in countries where no general election is planned soon 
campaigning for the european elections has focused largely on 
domestic issues 
in britain the opposition labor party has turned the elections 
into a referendum on prime minister margaret thatchers 10 years in 
office rather than on its views of european integration 
in italy campaigns also took on a domestic tinge and vote 
results will affect the makeup of the next coalition government 
italys 48th postwar government collapsed last month 
and in spain which joined the eec in 1986 the campaign is 
widely seen as a warmup for general elections that must be held by 
1991 
issues such as the eec single market project under which 
europes internal borders will disappear by dec 31 1992 have 
barely been explained to voters who seem confused about what the 
parliament is and what it does 
the assembly is one of three institutions directly involved in 
the eecs lawmaking process 
but unlike the eec commission and the council of ministers both 
of which are based in brussels the parliament straddles three 
nations its committees meet in brussels its headoffice is in 
luxembourg and its plenary sessions are held monthly in strasbourg 
france 
while the parliament lacks a high profile it gained additional 
powers on july 1 1987 forcing the eec commission and the council 
of ministers to pay more attention to the parliaments views 
the parliament must now be consulted on any single market issues 
involving the environment research and technology occupational 
health and safety and certain measures to harmonize laws among 
nations 
it must also approve some eec treaties with other countries and 
applications for eec membership it can amend or reject the eecs 
annual budget fire the 17member eec executive commission or delay 
an opinion on draft eec legislation to keep it from taking effect 
the parliament also plays a growing role in international 
affairs former president ronald reagan argentine president raul 
alfonsin king hussein of jordan plo leader yasser arafat and pope 
john paul ii have addressed the body in recent years 
the parliament cannot however initiate eec legislation 
the outgoing parliament comprises eight political groups 
representing 79 political parties sitting in alignments of the 
right center and left

a west german scholar whose critical text of 
james joyces ulysses claims to correct 5000 ommissions 
transpositions and other errors defended his book against charges it 
is riddled with errors 
and hans walter gabler predicted his book will withstand the 
attacks and remain the standard text for years to come 
gabler said he is eager to answer criticism by primary detractor 
john kidd director of boston universitys james joyce research 
center who claims it has so many errors it should be pulled 
ive been waiting for four years but im still waiting 
gabler said after a lecture this week during the 1989 james joyce 
conference a gathering of about 400 scholars and enthusiasts of the 
irish novelist continuing through friday 
the wait is nearly over for gabler and scholars who helped him in 
the 1984 edition which they said corrected errors in earlier 
editions dating to the 1922 original which joyce himself knew was 
full of errors the book initially was banned in great britain and 
the united states as obscene 
the new yorkbased bibliographical society of america is about to 
publish what kidd describes as a listing of more errors than have 
ever before been documented in one scholars work he has 
previously discussed only some of his objections to the gabler book 
the essay will appear in a quarterly journal proceedings of 
the bibliographical society of america due out in late june 
kidd has made all sorts of statements that he has not 
substantiated said gabler a professor at the university of 
munich i ought to be able to clear these allegations out of the 
way after all ive put my cards on the table he hasnt 
also waiting is a committee of four experts headed by g thomas 
tanselle vice president of the john simon guggenheim memorial 
foundation in new york it was assembled at the request of jason 
epstein editorial director of random house publisher of gablers 
book the only version of ulysses sold in the united states 
that essay is to be as it were the brief for the 
prosecution said committee member denis donoghue henry james 
professor of letters at new york university and on the basis of 
gablers reply to that we are to make recommendations as to what 
if anything is to be done with gablers book 
some scholars believe kidd who skipped the philadelphia 
conference after sharing a podium with gabler in miami in february 
has overstated whatever errors the text contains 
i think what he gabler has so far been accused of getting 
wrong relates to a very small number of decisions out of what are 
millions of decisions in what is one of the most complex pieces of 
fictional development that exists in this century said arnold 
goldman a professor at the university of kent in canterbury 
england 
gabler demonstrated how he and his team edited ulysses 
about 50 people compared photocopies of joyces birdlike scrawl 
a typewritten version and gablers text 
pointing to the handwritten copy from a partial manuscript of 
ulysses in philadelphias rosenbach museum and library gabler 
noted joyce already had revised sections 
after originally writing mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled 
sweetsour spittle joyce inserted two words to say sweetsour of 
her spittle 
in the typewritten text not typed by joyce the sentence ended 
sweet and sour with spittle 
such changes could have been a typists errors or could have been 
joycean revisions indicating an intermediary manuscript had 
existed gabler said 
gablers edition opts for sweetsour of her spittle but 
includes sweet and sour with spittle in brackets

mikhail s gorbachev visited this 
prosperous industrial city wednesday for a look at the robots and 
other technological wonders needed to modernize the soviet economy 
thousands of people cheered the soviet president and his wife 
raisa when they arrived at the former royal castle to meet with 
businessmen and gov lothar spaeth of prosperous badenwuerttemberg 
state 
about 5000 people gathered in the vast castle square despite 
high temperatures and humidity a crush of security agents and the 
bustle of horsedrawn carriages and palace guards in medieval garb 
several older wellwishers were overcome by the heat and taken 
away by emergency medical crews 
security has been extremely tight during the fourday gorbachev 
visit which ends thursday helicopters hover above his motorcade 
and the routes are cleared of traffic to allow unhindered passage 
west germans have provided an enthusiastic welcome in spite of 
it however and gorbachev has expressed his appreciation often 
this has really pleased all the soviet people he told 
spaeth and said he had spoken with kremlin officials by telephone 
on the flight from bonn 
not since president john f kennedys visit in 1961 have west 
germans given a foreign statesman such a jubilant welcome 
spaeth a popular christian democrat accompanied the visitors to 
stuttgart university for a tour of its technology exhibit 
gorbachev showed great interest in an electronically programmed 
knitting machine which produced a sixfoot banner from a card 
bearing his and spaeths signatures on the soviet flag and 
badenwuerttemberg crest 
i thank you for this it was a good lesson for us on the 
cooperation of science and production gorbachev said in brief 
remarks after the tour 
he mingled with industrialists chatting about the prospects for 
broadening economic cooperation 
when the head of the daimlerbenz aviation and automotive works 
introduced himself gorbachev smiled and declared yes weve 
heard about you 
edzard reuter replied that his corporation was interested in 
joint ventures to produce aircraft and motor vehicles 
in talks with businessmen at the castle gorbachev said the 
reception he received from west germans is evidence of the great 
changes in our relations 
he was told that about 20 new coproduction projects were nearly 
ready for signing 
otto lambsdorff a former economics minister said the two 
countries could not be satisfied with the state of their 
business relations and gorbachev must introduce price reforms and 
other unpopular measures to boost competitiveness 
these are hard steps but the soviet economy must go through 
this valley of tears if it wants to see light at the end of the 
tunnel he said in a radio interview 
lambsdorff leads the free democratic party the junior partner in 
the government coalition wih chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democrats 
while gorbachev discussed the application of new technology to 
soviet industry his wife visited a workingclass family to talk 
about daily life in west germany she spoke privately with iona and 
josef goetz then posed for pictures with them 
the gorbachevs visit to stuttgart ran nearly two hours longer 
than scheduled delaying a private dinner with kohl in bonn

an award given annually for two decades 
to a teacher who promotes racial harmony in this ethnically diverse 
community wasnt given this year 
letters to 900 teachers seeking nominations drew only one 
response not enough to satisfy the local bnai brith chapter that 
sponsors the award 
we didnt feel that rubberstamp approval was enough said 
stephen glassman the chapter president there was not a choice to 
be made this year 
glassman said local educators once nominated about eight 
candidates a year for the philip a bronspiegel award established 
in 1972 in memory of his efforts during a 30year teaching career to 
encourage tolerance among children 
but in recent years glassman said nominations had dwindled 
last year bnai brith received two nominations 
the award will be kept alive though he said 
superintendent constantine t nanopoulos said the award had long 
been a source of pride for educators 
barbara aguiar president of the new bedford teachers 
association said she had nothing to say about what the award 
symbolizes for the teaching community or about the lack of response 
this year 
isadore eisner a past president of the local bnai brith 
chapter said the group was very disturbed by the apparent lack of 
teacher interest and was prepared to fight to keep bronspiegels 
memory alive 
weve got to make sure this doesnt happen again eisner 
said mr bronspiegel stood for brotherhood for understanding 
for every man being equal to the other 
about 70 percent of new bedfords 100000 residents are members 
of ethnic or minority groups 
mario teixeira who ed that the community was given a presidential 
award for educational excellence in 1983 
visitors who came down here to give the award were very 
impressed with the pride students took in their background and how 
we recognized and supported that pride he said

queen elizabeth ii made ronald reagan a knight 
wednesday but without the kneeling and dubbing because the 
knighthood is an honorary one given foreigners who cannot be called 
sir 
the buckingham palace announcement ended days of speculation 
about whether the former president whose easy manner and 
conservative ardor made him a firm friend of prime minister margaret 
thatcher would receive the highest honor for nonbritons honors to 
foreigners are recommended by the government 
reagan told reporters outside the palace i feel greatly 
honored 
he emerged from lunch with the queen with a box containing the 
insignia of an honorary knight grand cross of the most honorable 
order of the bath one of the highest orders of chivalry 
elizabeth accompanied the reagans to their car to say goodbye 
and jokingly warned reagan dont drop them 
with his wife nancy beaming beside him he responded i cant 
say how proud i am to receive it 
sir is a title reserved for britons but at dinner parties 
reagan can sit closer to the queen than unknighted former 
presidents he also can use the initials gcb after his name 
in a statement reagan said the award was not a personal 
achievement as much it is as a splendid recognition of 
angloamerican friendship 
ours is a bond which grows every day and one which is a 
tremendous source of pride for me he said 
reagan said he believed the special anglobritish relationship 
is the compass by which the rest of the world charts its course 
the reagans arrived sunday for a private visit and dined with 
mrs thatcher tuesday night they fly to paris on thursday 
the queen has been pleased to approve a recommendation that 
the honorable ronald reagan be appointed an honorary knight grand 
cross of the most honorable order of the bath the palace 
announcement said 
queen elizabeth made the presentation after lunch in her private 
dining room where she rarely entertains foreigners the reagans 
were the only guests of the monarch and her husband prince philip 
unlike britons receiving knighthoods reagan did not have to 
kneel and be tapped on the shoulder by the royal sword instead the 
queen handed him the orders insignia a star badge and broad 
ribbon of crimson silk 
reagan was the 58th american given an honorary knighthood and 
the first since world war ii to receive the order of the bath which 
has its origins in knights appointed at the coronations of saxon 
kings 
the name comes from the symbolic bath taken by medieval 
candidates for knighthood admission to the order recognizes 
conspicuous service to britain 
honorary gcbs include former president dwight d eisenhower the 
allied supreme commander in world war ii gen george c marshall 
author of the marshall plan gen douglas macarthur and adm 
chester nimitz 
caspar weinberger defense secretary in the reagan 
administration got the title in february 1988 but in the lower 
order of the british empire 
other american honorary knights include philanthropist john paul 
getty ii henry ford iii former secretary of state dean rusk and 
actors douglas fairbanks jr and sidney poitier 
during an interview on independent television news reagan 
praised mrs thatcher his staunchest ally during eight years in 
office 
she is magnificent he said believe me seeing her there 
among all heads of state i can tell you they feel the same way she 
has great respect throughout the world 
in an address tuesday to the english speaking union reagan spoke 
of a world in which communist countries were accepting the supremacy 
of capitalism and democracy and he developed the theme in the 
interview 
we are seeing some of the leading communist nations indicate 
that their system at the least has some great flaws he said 
he recalled visiting china and finding the government had let 
people open shops 
in other words what they were saying to them was use 
capitalism go into private business for yourselves reagan said

thirtythree house members are urging a cut in 
star wars spending to 31 billion from the 49 billion proposed by 
president bush and they want the money spent on conventional arms 
this years declining defense budget is strangling us and the 
future looks worse said one sponsor of the proposal rep charles 
bennett dfla a member of the house armed services committee 
bennett initiated the proposal along with rep tom ridge rpa 
last year the house passed a proposal by the same two 
legislators for a 35 billion cap on spending for the strategic 
defense initiative or sdi as star wars is formally known the 
senate and house later agreed on a spending level of 41 billion 
many experts have told us that 3 billion is plenty for 
vigorous sdi research bennett said in a statement 
the research program is intended to allow policymakers to decide 
by the mid1990s whether to deploy spacebased antimissile 
defenses the soviet union says some proposed research would violate 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which bans spacebased 
antimissiles defenses 
other republicans joining the initiative were reps christopher 
shays of connecticut fred gandy of iowa and bill green and frank 
horton both of new york

the army disclosed wednesday the 
ulster defense regiment a mostly protestant militia in northern 
ireland may be armed with guns that fire plastic bullets 
the report provoked outcry from roman catholic leaders who said 
the regiment is seen as a sectarian force and want it disbanded 
an army spokesman reacting to a newspaper report said 
operational use of plastic bullet gun on a strictly limited 
basis to the udr is an option which has been under consideration 
for some time 
only 3 percent of the forces 6300 fulltime and parttime 
soldiers are catholic the army says that when the force was founded 
in 1970 it was 18 percent catholic but that intimidation by the 
irish republican army drove out many catholics 
the predominantly catholic ira targets catholic recruits as 
traitors in its war to rid northern ireland of british rule 
brian feeney of social democratic and labor party northern 
irelands main catholic party said arming the ulster defense 
regiment with plastic bullets would be stupid and provocative 
he said the ulster defense regiment was perceived by catholics as 
a sectarian force and giving them plastic bullets will simply 
increase the hostility 
the army spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
experience has shown that plastic bullet rounds can be an 
effective but relatively safe means of responding when lives are 
threatened 
plastic bullets are a crowdcontrol weapon to stun and injure 
but they can kill when fired from close range they are used in 
northern ireland by the army and the royal ulster constabulary the 
provinces 85 percent protestant police force 
about 15 people all but one of them catholic have been killed 
and 400 injured by plastic bullets since the outbreak of northern 
irelands present round of troubles in 1969

some cities bar skateboarders but palo 
alto just passed a law authorizing skateboards on most of its 
streets 
about 20 cities in california have ordinances barring 
skateboarders from shopping malls parking lots and streets palo 
alto touts its new law as the first such proskateboard legislation 
in the state 
city council voted 62 on monday to allow skateboards on all but 
25 of the citys busiest streets 
i see it as potentially model legislation said tom terrell 
a skateboard advocate who last fall prompted the city to reexamine 
its skateboard rules 
terrell submitted 300 signatures seeking to have skateboarders 
treated the same as bicyclists 
palo alto is setting a proskateboard example at a time when 
some towns are banning them outright said terrell 
under the law skateboarders may use residential streets and some 
major thoroughfares if they obey basic rules of the road that apply 
to bicyclists skateboarders who travel at night will be required to 
wear a reflective device but unlike bicyclists they will not have 
to have lights or brakes 
final passage of the ordinance is expected this summer

attorney general dick thornburgh was not 
informed but should have been before fbi agents tried to interview 
rep william h gray iii in connection with an investigation a 
spokesman said wednesday 
two philadelphiabased fbi agents traveled to washington on 
memorial day to interview the pennsylvania democrat who was elected 
house democratic whip on wednesday 
the justice department has been reported to be investigating 
allegations of a noshow employee on grays payroll the department 
in an unusual statement reacting to leaks about the investigation 
said monday night that gray was not a target of the probe and was 
cooperating 
thornburghs press secretary david runkel said wednesday the 
attorney general has a policy requiring that he be notified before 
federal law enforcement agents contact members of congress or other 
high government officials about an investigation 
without going into the gray matter chief fbi spokesman milton 
ahlerich said the fbi does not go out and contact nationally 
elected officials on an investigative matter without the highest or 
very highlevel approvals within the headquarters of the fbi 
such a policy is never violated ahlerich said 
normally there is close coordination between the fbi and the 
justice departments criminal division ahlerich said 
while there is no fbi procedure requiring notification of the 
attorney general in such cases that is the practice and that is 
the wish of the attorney general and that is certainly 
appropriate the fbi spokesman said 
i fully appreciate his management style of being apprised of 
those kinds of matters we work very hard do to that ahlerich 
said 
runkel said he did not know whether any official in the justice 
departments criminal division had been informed before gray was 
contacted 
more broadly justice department guidelines require the approval 
of the attorney general before a preliminary inquiry involving a 
public official is launched by the fbi 
despite the apparent procedural lapse and unauthorized news leaks 
about the probe runkel said thornburgh believed the investigation 
was being conducted properly by the fbi and the us attorneys 
office in philadelphia 
the spokesman said monday nights statement was issued because 
the leaks had unfairly characterized the status of the matter 
runkel said 10 fbi agents had been temporarily assigned to 
washington from other field offices to assist the justice 
departments investigation of the leaks

gov bob martinez asked lawmakers 
wednesday for a law that would punish people who leave firearms 
within reach of children 
the concern i would have as a parent is that my child is 
visiting a neighbor and that neighbor hasnt taken the same 
precautions and my child is killed or hurt in someones home 
martinez said at a news conference to call the states legislators 
to a threeday special session beginning monday 
lawmakers persuaded martinez to include the gunsafety measure in 
the special session which is primarily aimed at passing a turnpike 
expansion bill after the accidental shootings of five florida 
youngsters since june 1 in each case children found guns and shot 
either themselves or other children two died 
the latest victim 4yearold silvio pierre remained in critical 
condition wednesday at a tampa hospital he found his fathers 
25caliber pistol under a couch while playing sunday 
by public policy we can make a sound statement that we hope and 
we pray that people who own weapons place them in a secure positon 
so children cannot gain access to them said martinez he said he 
kept a gun in his home when he lived in tampa but said it was 
safely stored 
marion hammer director of the state arm of the national rifle 
association attacked the proposal 
putting griefstricken parents in jail will do nothing to 
prevent future tragedies she said if its to be a revenge 
mechanism for parents who have not properly taught children not to 
touch guns outside of their homes that will be what it will 
probably do most 
i think its political games she added the governor is 
putting in the call so he can stand back and say i did something 
we all know hes done nothing if he wanted to do something he could 
call for education on gun safety 
under a proposal by state rep harry jennings it would be a 
misdemeanor to leave a firearm accessible to a child the offense 
would be a felony with a maximum fiveyear prison term if the person 
who left the gun accessible was negligent and a child died or was 
permanently maimed 
jennings measure was passed by the house during the recent 
regular session but the senate didnt take it up 
his bill would require that guns be secured with a trigger lock 
or kept in a locked container 
i think if we did nothing else other than pass the gun bill it 
would be worth the trip senate president bob crawford said 
wednesday in a telephone interview

joseph hazelwood the former exxon skipper whose 
tanker ran aground and caused the biggest oil spill in us history 
was heckled aboard an airline flight by passengers who videotaped 
him and called him a real jerk 
alaska airlines spokesman lou cancelmi said airport police were 
asked to meet the plane and ensure peace when the flight from 
anchorage arrived tuesday night in seattle 
my understanding is that some folks on board were taking video 
pictures of him said cancelmi 
hazelwood was on the first leg of his trip back to new york with 
two attorneys one of whom asked the passengers to stop the 
videotaping which they did cancelmi said 
the plane carried about 35 passengers and was not crowded he 
said 
a passenger aboard flight 102 told the seattle times he saw a man 
he believed to be hazelwood and asked the flight attendants whether 
they knew they had a real jerk on the plane 
he then walked past hazelwood and called him a jerk and other 
passengers took up the heckling with more names and jeers the 
passenger said 
the passenger who was not identified by the times said the 
heckling cooled down when flight attendants asked them to stop 
one of hazelwoods traveling companions asked the flight crew to 
have security standing by when the plane landed and the flight crew 
complied with the request cancelmi said 
as far as we were concerned there was no situation on board 
that warranted anything of the sort cancelmi said 
no doubt there are strong feelings felt in alaska about 
hazelwood but it apparently did not manifest itself in people 
shouting or screaming at him or anything of that sort he said 
a spokeswoman for port of seattle police said three officers were 
sent to the terminal to keep the peace when the flight landed at 
844 pm 
hazelwood left the plane last without incident cancelmi said 
hazelwood 42 of huntington ny had been in anchorage to 
plead innocent monday to state felony charges of criminal mischief 
in the march 24 oil spill in which nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil escaped into prince william sound from the exxon valdez 
hazelwood earlier pleaded innocent to separate misdemeanor 
charges a june 20 trial date was set for both sets of charges said 
dick madson a fairbanks alaska attorney representing hazelwood

striking cab drivers resumed talks with 
the sandinista government wednesday over the doubling of gasoline 
prices a day after riot police fired tear gas to disperse 1000 
drivers holding a meeting 
only a few cabs were on the streets wednesday and those defying 
the strike order faced union sanctions 
on tuesday the drivers rejected an offer by the leftist 
government so sell gas for four days at the old price of 88 cents a 
gallon taxi drivers presented a list of seven demands to the 
government including freezing fuel prices 
union leaders met again with transportation minister mauricio 
valenzuela and other government officials wednesday 
as part of antiinflation measures the government on monday 
increased the price of gasoline to the equivalent of 186 a gallon 
a 110 percent increase it also devalued the cordoba by 525 
percent from 9500 cordobas to 20000 cordobas per dollar 
we have put up with a lot because of our goodwill and we 
recognize the situation the country is in said manuel jerez of 
the 19th of july taxi union but that doesnt mean that were 
going to starve our families

1000 cabbies was illegal 
each devaluation of nicaraguas currency the cordoba brings 
higher fuel prices which raise most other prices from food to 
public transportation to services mondays devaluation was the 20th 
and highest of the year

oklahoma natural gas co workers on 
wednesday checked out hundreds of reported gas leaks after an 
equipment malfunction sent strongsmelling gas throughout the 
oklahoma city area 
a lightning strike tuesday morning at ongs edmond storage 
facility caused a machine called an odorizer to malfunction 
company spokesman don sherry said 
the machine normally drips minute quantities of the chemical 
mercaptan into natural gas to give it a familiar pungent smell but 
sherry said the machinery instead dumped about nine gallons of the 
chemical into an inactive gas line 
the gas line was reactivated tuesday night and the 
chemicalladen gas began moving through the ong distribution system 
he said 
the chemical is nontoxic sherry said 
theres no harm but its very pungent especially in these 
quantities sherry said 
the utility had about 1200 leak calls pending at one time 
wednesday compared to 100 normally sherry said 
of course we have to investigate each one were not going to 
take any chances but its taking much longer to respond to calls 
he said weve been trying to get the word out that in all 
probability what theyre smelling is that mercaptan

the senate rules committee split along party 
lines approved a package wednesday that would require states to 
allow voters to register for federal elections through the mail and 
when they apply for drivers licenses 
i hate to see it come down to a partisan effort committee 
chairman wendell ford dky said as the bill was approved 63 
democrats were in favor saying the measure would prompt more 
americans to go to the polls fewer than 50 percent of eligible 
americans voted in november 
senate republicans however were critical of the measure with 
sen ted stevens ralaska leading the attack 
rides roughshod over the rights of small states said 
stevens its going to be very badly received in the west and i 
would warn most people from the west to stay away from it 
ford scoffed at that claim if we were running roughshod over 
small states i would be bitterly opposed to it because my state is 
small 
the motor voter bill would apply only to federal elections 
drivers license applications would automatically register qualified 
voters unless they declined by checking a box on the form 
states would be required to use a uniform application for mail 
registration produced by the federal election commission 
notarization and other forms of authentication would be barred a 
number of government agencies would provide help in filling out 
forms 
names of voters could not be purged from registration lists for 
failure to vote under the senate measure 
a house version of the bill that has cleared committee and awaits 
floor action includes a purging provision that calls for address 
verification to be carried out every two years using a 
nonforwardable postcard or the postal services computerized change 
of address system 
the senate rules committees bill would not require states that 
currently permit registration on election day to change that 
practice but it would bar any state that does not already have such 
a provision to adopt it 
the senate judiciary committee currently is weighing a rival 
measure under which states would be required to file a plan with the 
attorney general if the percentage of minority registration dropped 
below the percentage of nonminority registration

corn farmers may see a growing market in the 
fuel industry during the next decade if congress goes along with 
president bushs clean air plan agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said wednesday 
its too early to make predictions he said but bushs call for 
more cars to use neat fuels that dont pollute should be 
perceived as potentially good news for farmers 
yeutter said the bush proposal calls for manufacturers to turn 
out 500000 cars a year by 1995 and 1 million a year by 1997 that 
are equipped to use alternative fuels 
during his visit this week to the university of nebraska bush 
participated in a demonstration of an automobile using ethanolbased 
fuel and witnessed another using a combination of ethanol and etbe 
ethyl tertiarybutyl ether a promising alternative to gasoline 
ethanol a fuelgrade alcohol currently processed in the united 
states mostly from corn has held high hopes for many farmers and 
energy companies for years its production has been heavily 
subsidized to make it competitive 
yeutter told reporters that etbe has an ethanol base at the 
moment but also could be based on methanol a rival fuel made from 
coal natural gas and plants 
a lot can happen in the next six or seven years he said 
we really dont know what might be the fuels of choice at that 
time 
yeutter said that during talks within the administration on 
reform of the 1970 clean air act he cautioned against announcing a 
specific fuel for the 1995 project and beyond 
technology that exists today for ethanol or methanol or any 
other neat fuel could change dramatically he said 
also yeutter said the current technology and methods of 
providing ethanol from corn could not compete with gasoline without 
federal subsidies 
whether or not that will be the case by 1995 remains to be 
seen he said

the us and soviet envoys to the united 
nations on wednesday said the chinese suppression of prodemocracy 
protesters in beijing should not be taken to the security council 
soviet envoy alexander m belonogov and us representative 
thomas r pickering said taking the military action to the council 
might be unwarranted interference in chinas internal affairs 
and the military crackdown in beijing should not affect chinas 
recent application to join un observers in the middle east and 
southern africa they said 
belonogov said chinas crackdown poses no threat to international 
security and should not be discussed by the united nations 
but pickering while opposing discussion at this time did not 
rule out that chinas human rights performance might be raised later 
he said the united states has made emphatic statements deploring 
the loss of civilian lives and mass arrests in the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement the soviet union has not criticized chinas 
action 
these are terribly difficult acts for us to accept pickering 
told a news conference with belonogov 
there has been no formal move to raise the issue in the security 
council the highest un body overseeing international peace and 
security china is one of the five permanent members of the 
15nation council and as such can kill any resolution 
the other four permanent members are the united states the

a 300 million rural development program 
unanimously passed the senate agriculture committee wednesday after 
senate leaders agreed to wait until next month to act on drought 
relief 
democrats had charged that senate republican leader bob doles 
insistence on passing drought aid for winter farmers before 
approving a rural development bill could have scuttled both measures 
but committee chairman patrick leahy dvt and the panels 
ranking republican sen richard lugar of indiana said they had 
agreed to move forward with the rural development bill and act july 
19 on drought relief 
i think everybody has been accommodated said leahy i 
think we have virtually guaranteed that we will have a feasible 
rural development bill on the floor one that will have a good 
chance of passing we have also guaranteed that we can make a 
real try at drought legislation 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has promised the 
senate would act on the rural development program this summer and 
send it to the house which has no similar legislation 
the rural development package would provide 100 million in 
federal seed money for revolving loan funds as well as 200 million 
to improve education health services communications and utilities 
in rural areas to encourage business expansion 
dole of kansas had argued in a committee meeting tuesday that 
quick action on drought relief for winter wheat should take 
precedence over rural development legislation 
kansas winter wheat farmers have been wiped out by the early 
spring drought said dole who has sponsored a bill extending terms 
of 1988 drought relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest this 
year namely winter wheat 
winter wheat crop losses in kansas the hardest hit of all the 
states have been estimated to be 16 billion said dole 
however it became apparent that neither drought relief nor rural 
development could pass without broad support in the agriculture 
committee lugar said committee members had been threatening to 
sidetrack or delay one bill or the other he said 
weve essentially agreed that were all going to work for floor 
action on these two things lugar said 
some farmstate lawmakers such as sen kent conrad dnd did 
not want to pass a drought relief bill before it was known how 
extensive the dry weather would be this year 
conrads state was devastated by drought last year and experts 
are still concerned about dry soil conditions in the upper midwest 
i was very concerned because were only going to have one drought 
bill conrad said 
leahy said drought relief legislation would be discussed july 13 
with a committee vote july 19 
rural development is a high priority as congress moves toward 
designing the 1990 omnibus farm bill a house subcommittee has been 
holding hearings to gather information on communities rapidly losing 
population because of depressed economic conditions 
farm state lawmakers want to make sure the rural development is 
funded this year so the money doesnt come out of the 1990 farm 
bill

the capitol plaza was temporarily transformed 
into a mint wednesday as whitegloved legislators manned giant 
presses to strike gold and silver coins commemorating the 200th 
anniversary of the congress 
the festive first strike ceremony in a flagbedecked tent 
marked the first time since 1792 that us coins have been struck 
outside of an official mint 
donna pope director of the mint said the plaza was a fitting 
site for a coin foundry since the capitol itself has proved to be a 
great white foundry in which congress turned the dream of 
democracy into reality 
its the anniversary of that 200year triumph that these coins 
commemorate and celebrate she said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady invited by mrs pope to test 
his midas touch was the first to step up to one of the 
seventon presses don a white glove and push the run button 
two whumps later brady proudly displayed a 5 gold coin 
featuring the capitol dome on one side and the american eagle from 
the old senate chamber on the other 
at his next stop a press outfitted to produce the 1 silver 
coin there was an unexplained malfunction and brady quickly moved 
to a backup machine 
it was bound to happen sooner or later quipped mrs pope 
now you know why we have four presses and only two coins 
imprinting the silver coin takes three whumps each packing 
205 tons of pressure the coin features the statue of freedom from 
the capitol dome and the mace of the house of representatives a 
staff topped by an eagle astride the world globe 
brady was followed to the presses by treasurer katherine ortega 
mrs pope and a string of members of congress including senate 
republican leader robert dole of kansas who jokingly tried to 
pocket the fruits of his labor 
rep lindy boggs dla noted that the constitution gives 
congress the power to coin money and said this was the first time 
in history members of congress have the opportunity to take the 
founding fathers literally 
the 22 million expected to be raised from sales of the coins 
will be used to help restore the capitol high on the priority list 
a facelift for freedom the bronze lady who stands atop the 
capitol dome in disrepair and the installation of marble fountains 
built as part of lady bird johnsons beautification program but 
which have languished in a warehouse for lack of money to install 
them 
mrs pope said proceeds will ensure that for years to come 
that great white foundry the home of democracy the house of 
congress will endure 
the coins were struck on presses hauled in from philadelphia just 
for the occasion but bear w and s mint marks since the 
bicentennial series will be produced at the west point and san 
francisco mints 
immediately after the first coins were struck the mints were 
telephoned and instructed to start the presses on production of 
the coins mrs pope said 
in addition to the gold and silver coins the mint also will 
issue a halfdollar coin as part of the bicentennial series that 
coin 92 percent copper clad in nickel features a bust of 
freedom and a full view of the capitol ringed in stars 
the special proof and uncirculated quality coins will come from 
specially polished dies have a mirrorlike finish are handfed 
into the coining press and handled with white gloves mrs pope said 
production will be limited to 1 million 5 gold coins 3 million 
1 silver coins and 4 million halfdollar coins regular prices 
which include a surcharge for the capitol preservation fund will 
range from 6 for an uncirculated halfdollar to 215 for a 
proofquality gold coin a sixcoin set that includes a proof and 
uncirculated version of each of the three coins will sell for 480

president bush declaring enough is enough 
railed wednesday against a group of house republicans trying to 
weaken the chief reform of his plan to cover 100 billion of savings 
and loan losses 
as the house began debate on the measure bush joined the 
campaign against industrysponsored amendments by reps jimmy 
quillen rtenn and henry hyde rill to exempt some 450 sampls 
from having to put up 6 billion in new capital to protect taxpayers 
from future losses 
i have a certain sense of obligation to the american public to 
get legislation through that is going to protect the people against 
the abuses of the past and to fix it and fix it once and for all 
bush said 
pounding the table during a cabinet room meeting with 
congressional leaders he said every american citizen has every 
right in the world to be disturbed and shocked by this situation 
including interest the bailout is expected to cost taxpayers 
between 157 billion and 200 billion over the next 30 years or 
600 for every man woman and child in the country according to the 
general accounting office 
bush urged the defeat of amendments that would allow some 
institutions to count a noncash accounting entry supervisory 
good will as atrisk capital for meeting the proposed new 
standards 
some of the small or the weaker i would say sampls are 
demanding the right to continue to treat good will as capital even 
though good will has no tangible value bush said 
the result he said is that those thrifts could lend up to 600 
billion in federally insured deposits which taxpayers are 
ultimately obligated to cover without one dollar in real capital 
for decades to come 
in my view it is time for the american public and our 
administration to say that enough is enough and to earnestly ask for 
the support of the congress bush said i think every american 
citizen has every right in the world to be disturbed and shocked by 
this situation 
both republican and democratic house leaders said bushs remarks 
should bolster the case against the good will amendments which 
have won widescale support particularly among republicans 
it was helpful to have presdient bush step up to the plate to 
use his baseball metaphor and take a swing at the ball said 
house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia 
but even before his remarks it was doubtful that quillen and 
hyde had sufficient support for their measures which are to be 
voted on wednesday in an order that gives supporters of bushs 
proposal a second shot at defeating them if one should pass 
theyve structured the capital amendments so that we cant 
win said one vehement congressional supporter of the good 
will accounting practices speaking on the condition of anonymity 
house speaker thomas s foley called bushs remarks helpful 
but added i think the house is headed toward a very strong bill 
in any event 
the good will exemptions totaling more than 20 billion were 
granted by federal regulators in the early 1980s as a way of 
encouraging healthy sampls to take over insolvent thrifts and postpone 
for several years the current crisis 
in effect the accounting practice allows sampl owners to count as 
capital the losses of failed institutions they acquired for as long 
as 40 years 
the senate reduced the effective life of the exemptions to 25 
years but the house banking committee cut their life to just five 
years bush originally has proposed phasing out the exemptions over 
10 years 
more than twothirds of the nations 2938 sampls have well more 
than the current capital for meeting bushs proposed new 
requirements without including good will on their books 
and about 500 institutions are so helplessly insolvent that they 
will be liquidated or merged with other healthy sampls under the 
bailout proposal 
quillen and hyde are trying to protect the 450 sampls who hold 
about onethird of the industrys 13 trillion in assets and would 
have either to raise new capital or shrink in size if the good 
will exemptions are phased out

house democrats on wednesday elected richard 
gephardt of missouri as majority leader embracing a no problems 
former presidential candidate in an effort to push beyond the ethics 
furor that felled two top party leaders 
the democrats then chose rep william h gray iii dpa to be 
majority whip making him the no 3 democrat in the house behind 
speaker thomas s foley and gephardt and the highestranking black 
in congress 
gephardt defeated georgia conservative ed jenkins 18176 and 
gray won with 134 votes to 97 votes for david bonior of michigan and 
30 for beryl anthony of arkansas 
the two victors both considered liberals fill out the new 
leadership team democrats have had to install in midterm because of 
the resignations of speaker jim wright of texas and whip tony 
coelho of california both following ethics allegations foley of 
washington was elected speaker last week 
shortly after their selection gephardt and gray jopined other 
congressional leaders for a white house meeting with president bush 
on the savings and loan bailout bill 
bush began the session by congratulating both men saying i 
look forward to working with you arguing with you working with you 
and i do mean that 
gephardt accepted the no 2 post with a call to democrats to push 
aside what he said were republican attempts to slander the party a 
top gop official was forced to resign last week after sending out a 
statement comparing foleys voting record to that of a homosexual 
congressman an episode democrats contend was an example of typical 
republican tactics 
some on the other side are committed to the dark side of 
politics smear innuendo rumors cynical media management the 
politics of character assassination gephardt said but let us 
say that we will win at the ballot box not by the force of our 
slurs but the force of our ideas 
in the secret ballot gray won the whips post over two rivals 
despite news reports that personnel practices in his office were 
under investigation by the justice department 
after wednesdays vote gray said he was helped by a statement 
from the department that he was not the subject of the federal 
probe and he was grateful for the vote of confidence from his 
colleagues 
bonior will continue in his role as chief deputy whip and anthony 
as chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee 
jenkins said in his campaign it was time for the democratic 
leadership to include a representative of the more conservative wing 
of the party and although he didnt win there were assurances that 
a southerner would be installed in an appointed leadership post 
the party has to do more to expand to include the onethird 
of its party that is in the more conservative ranks especially if 
it expects to win the white house he said 
gephardts experience as a presidential candidate will help the 
party in the house and nationally said rep dan glickman dkan 
an ally 
he is more on the cutting edge of issues than weve had for 
some time glickman said and the fact that he survived the 1988 
presidential campaign without a hint of dirt in his background gave 
in a sense a kind of a relief that people know hes got no 
problems 
in a nominating speech for gephardt rep david obey dwis 
alluded to ethics attacks on democrats by rep newt gingrich rga 
in this era of newtspeak we need to confront crass with class 
obey said according to one staff member present 
afterward gephardt echoed foleys statement last week that 
ethics and campaign reform legislation is a top priority this year 
but he emphasized the theme of economic nationalism that was the 
hallmark of his unsuccessful run for the democratic nomination last 
year 
in my humble opinion america is beginning to be in a state of 
decline gephardt told reporters and we as democrats have to 
lead even though its not a crisis even though the presidency is 
held by a different party and even though getting our consensus 
together on the democratic side is always difficult to do 
wednesdays election left a vacancy in grays former position as 
chairman of the house democratic caucus the no 4 position the 
democrats will meet later to fill that post which is being contested 
by two candidates reps steny hoyer dmd and barbara kennelly

oliver l norths motion to set aside his three 
irancontra convictions was denied wednesday by the trial judge 
clearing the way for the former white house aides sentencing next 
week 
us district judge gerhard a gesell who presided over eight 
weeks of testimony in the case rejected norths last posttrial 
motions including a request for an acquittal judgment or a new 
trial on each of the three felony convictions 
north scheduled to be sentenced june 23 could face a 10year 
prison term and 750000 in fines if given the maximum sentences for 
his convictions of unlawfully destroying government documents 
aiding and abetting in obstructing congress and illegally accepting 
a gratuity from arms dealer richard v secord 
gesell ruled there was sufficient proof for the jury to find 
that north was aiding and abetting a reagan administration 
effort to conceal from congress details of the sale of us arms to 
iran 
the judge also rejected norths contention that prosecutors had 
not proven that he was the legal custodian of records he was 
convicted of mutilating after the irancontra affair became public 
in november 1986 
there was ample proof that north checked out highly sensitive 
top secret official documents asked his secretary to alter these 
documents and never returned the originals or acknowledged 
alterations gesell said this is exactly the type of conduct 
the statute has criminalized for well over a century 
there was ample proof that north engaged in a deliberate effort 
to rewrite what had occurred by attempting to falsify the official 
record of the national security council the judge said in his 
13page opinion 
gesell also rejected norths arguments that he was unfairly 
convicted of illegally accepting the installation of a 13800 
security system paid for by secord outside norths great falls va 
home 
the judge rejected a defense contention that the jury should have 
been instructed to consider norths testimony that he accepted the 
security system from secord because no government agency would 
protect him following terrorist threats 
long after north heard of the threat by abu nidal he backdated 
letters indicating he was to pay for the system and he concealed the 
fact that secord had actually paid security consultant glenn 
robinette for the system the judge said 
this behavior reflects his realization of wrongdoing rather 
than duress the judge said 
north had a legal alternative to acceptance of the security 
system as a gratuity gesell said he could have paid for it 
himself from the funds he admittedly had the judge said 
referring to norths testimony that he kept 15000 in cash in a 
locked box in his closet 
prosecutors contended the security system was an illegal gratuity 
because secord was benefiting financially from the sale of us arms 
to iran 
gesell disposed of two other defense motions 
dismissing a defense motion for a hearing on an april 22 letter 
that nbc news distributed to the homes of jurors requesting 
interviews after the verdict there is no rational way that a 
jurors natural resentment against this interference with privacy by 
the television media could affect the outcome either way said 
gesell who had rejected the same motion last month 
denying another defense motion which had been made under seal 
seeking a closed hearing on alleged conduct of a juror the contents 
of the motion were not released

a house appropriations subcommittee voted 
wednesday to spend 200 million to begin construction of the super 
collider after president bush assured the panel chairman that 
several foreign countries would share the costs 
rep tom bevill the influential alabama democrat who heads the 
subcommittee on energy and water said energy secretary james a 
watkins told him at a white house meeting before the closed vote 
that a 1 billion contribution is expected from japan 
bevill earlier this year had insisted he would not agree to fund 
the super collider in fiscal 1990 unless the energy department 
secured firm commitments from foreign countries willing to share the 
44 billion cost 
but on wednesday bevill agreed to a bill that has no 
requirements for any level of foreign participation as well as no 
restrictions on the 200 million initial construction could begin 
after oct 1 the first day of the new fiscal year 
watkins assured all of us that theyre going to have a good bit 
of participation bevill said 
also attending the session were rep john myers of indiana the 
panels ranking republican white house chief of staff john sununu 
and budget director richard darman 
other potential contributors mentioned by watkins were italy and 
india bevill said india is the only foreign nation to sign a 
commitment to share costs of the particle accelerator and has 
promised to contribute 50 million 
after his meeting with the president bevill issued a statement 
saying i told him i would put the money in for him but it may be 
difficult to get it approved its a good project but the cost of 
it concerns me a great deal it will be up to congress to make the 
final decision 
under the subcommittees plan 110 million would be set aside to 
initiate construction at the ellis county site including 
preparation for tunneling of the 53mile underground ring for 
highenergy physics experiments that scientists hope will help them 
understand the fundamental nature of matter the remaining 90 
million would be used for research and development 
the full committee could vote on the appropriation as early as 
next week said rep jim chapman the senate appropriations 
committee however has yet to vote on the collider and weve got 
a battle in the senate to win 
under the house version the money could be used for detailed 
design construction of power and utility facilities site 
preparations and for support buildings also included are funds for 
longlead procurement of such items as tooling and superconducting 
materials

after a near brush with a mistrial testimony 
ended wednesday in the perjury trial of former rep pat swindall 
without the former congressman taking the witness stand 
the defense rested on the 17th day of the trial in us district 
court and prosecutors called only one rebuttal witness attorneys 
planned to make legal arguments to the judge thursday and the jury 
was told to return friday for closing statements 
swindalls testimony before a grand jury got him indicted in the 
first place he is accused of nine counts of perjury for lying to a 
federal grand jury in february 1988 regarding his 1987 dealings with 
an undercover agent posing as a money launderer and with a swindall 
associate who has since been convicted of money laundering 
swindall a republican who served two terms in congress from 
atlantas eastern suburbs before being defeated last november faces 
10 months to five years in prison on each of the nine perjury counts 
if convicted 
the trial nearly came to a halt after prosecutor craig gillen 
asked a defense witness defense lawyer bobby lee cook a question 
regarding the possible motivations of defendants to testify 
isnt it correct gillen asked that if a defendant were to 
testify and he knew certain things could help him he would 
be more prone to testify in that regard 
swindall attorney tom thrash immediately asked us district 
judge richard c freeman to declare a mistrial arguing that the 
question planted in the jurors minds the thought that if swindall 
did not testify it would be because he had something to hide 
freeman after fretting ill salvage this if i can and 
taking a break to study law books returned and denied the mistrial 
motion 
he also ordered the jury not to infer anything if swindall chose 
not to testify as is his right 
swindall whom freeman has already ordered to stop smirking in 
court got another rebuke from the judge as he nodded his head while 
his attorney argued for a mistrial 
dont you shake your head at me freeman warned youve got 
two lawyers there and im going to listen to them not you

eight environmental groups and the state of 
massachusetts filed suit wednesday seeking to overturn a decision by 
federal regulators to streamline the licensing process for 
commercial nuclear power plants 
the streamlining by the nuclear regulatory commission took effect 
last month and was aimed at encouraging electric utilities to build 
new nuclear stations 
no new nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978 in part 
because of a lengthy licensing process that sometimes has stretched 
for 13 years lando zech jr the nrc chairman has said the new 
process can cut the licensing time to six years 
antinuclear groups contend the rule changes unfairly limit 
public participation in the nrc licensing process 
the nuclear regulatory commission is attempting to create a 
future for the nuclear industry by removing the publics voice in 
reactor licensing said michael marriotte executive director of 
the nuclear information and resource service 
mariottes group which is a party to the suit filed in the us 
circuit court of appeals in washington said the nrc revisions 
violate the 1954 atomic energy act which requires the opportunity 
for two public hearings one before issuing a construction permit 
and another before granting an operating license 
the nrc which formally adopted its rule change april 18 says it 
adheres to the atomic energy act because it allows the possibility 
of a second public hearing although only under certain 
circumstances controlled by the nrc 
bills have been introduced in congress to put the nrc changes on 
the statutes but no action appears likely this year 
robert polland of the union of concerned scientists which also 
is a party to the lawsuit said his group favored efforts to resolve 
important licensing issues before the start of plant construction 
but he said the new nrc rule goes too far in trying to settle all 
issues before the public is fully aware of a plant builders plans 
the other groups joining the lawsuit are public citizen the 
committee to bridge the gap the new england coalition on nuclear 
pollution the sinnissippi alliance for the environment the energy 
research foundation and the citizens for responsible energy

fifty years after the third reich killed more 
than 6 million jews some historians are trying to mitigate the nazi 
brutality the antidefamation league of bnai brith charged 
wednesday 
in a report on holocaust revisionism the league warned that such 
scholarship may diminish lessons of the genocide 
the new revisionist trend acknowledges that the holocaust 
occurred but challenges the wellaccepted understanding of the 
motives behind it said abraham h foxman national director of 
the league 
the report cited what it said was the suggestion by princeton 
university professor arno j mayer that the jews were killed 
because of the nazis belief that bolshevism was a jewish 
creation it said that view disregards the massive 
documentation that the nazis acted out of antisemitism 
mayer reached in france where he is on leave from princeton 
said bnai brith had misstated his position he said he believes 
antisemitism was a part of nazi ideology but not its core until 
it became dominant under very very specific circumstances 
growing from the war in eastern europe 
i do not take the position that jews were killed because of the 
antibolshevism he said that is an absolute misstatement 
the bnai brith report also cited work by west german historians 
ernst nolte and hellmut diwald who it said argue that it is unfair 
to single out the nazis because other nations also have committed 
genocide 
mayer called it an outright insult to be linked to nolte and 
diwald

a navy sailor linked to the 
investigation of the gun turret explosion that killed 47 men on the 
battleship iowa has been reassigned to mayport naval station his 
lawyer said wednesday 
gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt has been assigned to a 
destroyer commanders staff and could report any time thursday said 
lt cmdr tim taylor a navy spokesman at mayport 
he wants to become a sailor again miami attorney ellis rubin 
said in a telephone interview he would like to just put this 
behind him 
published reports have said the navy has investigated the 
relationship between truitt and his friend clayton hartwig who 
died in the april 19 explosion 
truitt named as the sole beneficiary in a 50000 
doubleindemnity life insurance policy purchased by hartwig was 
reportedly under investigation to see if there was a link between 
the men in either a murder or suicide plot truitt 21 has 
vehemently denied wrongdoing and has said the navy was seeking a 
scapegoat 
the board of inquiry investigation of the iowa disaster is 
expected to be released soon and truitt will have no comment until 
then rubin said 
i hope it will contain an apology from the navy for leaking 
this false information the attorney said 
he said he has asked several times but has no assurances that an 
apology will be included in the report 
in a news conference about two weeks ago in washington truitt 
suggested the explosion in the iowas no 2 gun turret may have been 
caused by inexperienced sailors pushing bags of gunpowder too 
quickly into the 16inch guns magazine 
rubin also suggested that the gunpowder in the bags was volatile 
because it was improperly stored and subjected to high temperatures 
the navy has denied that storage conditions had anything to do with 
the explosion 
the iowa recently left norfolk va on june 8 for six months in 
the mediterranean

unusual coldair funnel clouds that looked 
like tornadoes touched down around madison on wednesday tossing 
cars damaging buildings and snapping utility lines no injuries 
were reported 
theyre not as strong as tornadoes they usually dont touch 
down but there were two reports of touchdowns from this storm 
said margaret mooney of the national weather service in madison 
ordinary funnel clouds and tornadoes generally develop during 
intense thunderstorms that form along and some distance ahead of a 
cold front during warm humid weather 
but there were no intense thunderstorms in the area wednesday and 
the weather was relatively cool so there was less energy to drive 
the funnel clouds than would be available to a tornado she said 
the distinction was lost on most people who encountered the storm 
we could see it pick up cars and toss them around like a toy 
said theater manager richard lepsch 
employees at a car dealership said the windows in their showroom 
blew out and dozens of cars were tossed into one another in the lot 
it sounded like we were in a vacuum cleaner said russell 
foskett an employee at the lot 
i went over to close the door foskett said i thought it 
was hailing it was flying glass the flag pole was at a 45degree 
angle 
lisa hoger a switchboard operator at the auto dealership said 
the storm was kind of scary it just happened all of a sudden 
this big gust of wind 
scott lawver a salesman said he looked out a window and all 
i saw was a lot of flying junk glass and styrofoam going in a 
circle over the building 
lawver estimated 50 to 60 cars were damaged by the funnel cloud 
and some of their windows were popped out 
a police dispatcher in sun prairie said that city was surrounded 
by funnel clouds shortly before noon 
the storm toppled alice and leo bakkes barn and tobacco shed at 
sun prairie blocking a county road 
all the windows were blown out in the house mrs bakke said 
and all my knickknacks were broken 
most of the funnel clouds did not touch down 
john hermanson was driving on interstate 90 when he saw a big 
cloud with a little funnel coming out of it it looked like a snake 
dangling out of it

a judge ruled wednesday that prosecutors did 
not intentionally withhold evidence in the cotton club murder 
case and refused a defense request to strike key testimony 
municipal court judge patti jo mckay who heard six days of 
testimony on the defense claim that prosecutors violated discovery 
rules said she found no evidence of misconduct 
this court finds there has been no violation of the courts 
discovery order she said there has been substantial compliance 
with the order 
the defense claimed prosecutors withheld details of the testimony 
of william rider former security chief for hustler magazine 
publisher larry flynt 
rider who testified briefly on june 2 implicated two defendants 
in the 1983 murder of new york theatrical producer roy radin he 
said william molony mentzer and alex lamota marti also former flynt 
bodyguards confessed to him that they killed radin 
marti and mentzer are charged with the murder along with karen 
delayne greenberger and robert ulmer lowe who has agreed to stop 
fighting extradition from maryland 
radin who was negotiating with hollywood producer robert evans to 
finance the movie the cotton club disappeared on may 13 1983 
and his body was found a month later 65 miles north of los angeles 
the prosecution alleges mrs greenberger hired the flynt 
bodyguards to kill radin because of a dispute over profits from the 
cotton club deal and the theft of some cash and cocaine from 
mrs greenbergers home 
riders testimony was halted when defense lawyers said the 
witness was blurting out things they had never heard before and a 
continuance was granted for the defense until tuesday to prepare for 
a new prosecution witness 
but on the disclosure complaint judge mckay found that most of 
the disclosures had been available to the defense through videotapes 
of his interviews with authorities two investigators and deputy 
district attorney david conn said they did not take notes on the 
star witness statements during interviews 
the defense had asked that riders testimony be stricken from the 
record and that conn be held in contempt of court and required to 
pay the defenses court costs for the weeklong hearing

a spokesman for iranbased afghan rebels 
announced wednesday that his group and afghan guerrillas based in 
pakistan agreed in principle to form an interim government irans 
official news agency said 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia quoted 
ali jan zahedi as saying representatives of the groups reached the 
accord this month 
zahedi said that once ratified the agreement would supersede the 
existing interim government in which iranbased rebels are not 
represented 
the usbacked rebels known as the mujahedeen islamic holy 
warriors are split into the iranbased shiite moslem coalition and 
the mainstream sunni moslem alliance based in pakistan 
the sunni rebels formed the existing interim government soon 
after the soviet troop withdrawal from afhganistan was completed in 
february they predicted that president najibs marxist regime in 
kabul would quickly collapse but government troops held their 
ground and najib now is calling for a ceasefire and negotiations 
the shiite coalition originally boycotted the provisional 
government when it was refused all the seats it demanded the sunnis 
came courting again however after suggestions emerged that the 
shiites might cut a separate deal with the soviets and fragment the 
rebel movement 
shiites make up 15 percent of afghanistans population 
in recent fighting in afghanistan guerrillas said wednesday that 
their artillery attacks forced afghan officials to close the airport 
outside kandahar afghanistans secondlargest city during day 
hours 
the airport in afghanistans arid south was closed tuesday 
after heavy fighting between rebels and communist forces said the 
guerrillacontrolled afghan news agency based in pakistan 
a steady barrage of rocket fire halted government flights said 
the agency which speaks for gulbadin hekmatyars radical 
hezbiislami rebel group 
kandahar lies about 270 miles south of kabul and is the home of 
afghan royalty 
akbar nakyar a spokesman for the national islamic front of 
afghanistan rebel group said the latest report reaching quetta 
pakistan was that government aircraft still could make night 
landings 
the moslem guerrillas began an insurrection after a communist 
coup in afghanistan in 1978 the war has killed at least 13 million 
people and about 5 million afghans a third of the population 
have fled to neighboring pakistan and iran 
guerrillas have not been able to capture a major city but have 
wide control of the countryside

more than 100 stolen artifacts of jade gold 
and stone missing for 3 years were returned wednesday to the 
archaeology museum in a ceremony where mexicos leader welcomed the 
nations recovered inheritance 
president carlos salinas de gortari told members of his cabinet 
and foreign diplomats at the national museum of archaeology that 
finding the lost treasure amounts to recovering a part of our 
identity a part of our pride 
officials said a pair of college dropouts linked to cocaine 
dealers looted seven display cases at the museum before dawn on 
christmas day 1985 
federal police recovered 111 of the 124 stolen items and arrested 
a suspected thief and six associates last week they were charged in 
court monday with theft and damaging national treasures authorities 
said 
the loot dating from 500 bc to 2500 bc included masks 
jewelry and other artifacts from mexicos ancient aztec mixteca 
maya and zapotec civilizations 
salinas praised efficient police action 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo whose department 
cracked the case said to intercede for the nation with 
attatchment to the law is to intercede for our heritage our 
history and our resources 
salinas and alvarez promised to beef up security at mexicos 
museums and 150 archaeological zones 
museum director sonia lombardo gave salinas and his cabinet a 
tour of the pieces now enclosed in glass cases in a display 
called recovered inheritance 
investigators got a lead in the case from a suspected drug 
trafficker arrested in april at reynosa across the border from 
mcallen texas alvarez told reporters monday 
federal agents in mexico city followed one suspect carlos 
perches trevino 24 for 45 days before his arrest friday alvarez 
said 
perches and ramon sardina garcia had staked out the museum for 
six months visiting it more than 50 times to determine which were 
the most valuable pieces he said 
the pair then jumped the fence crawled in through an air 
conditioning duct and looted seven display cases 
officials said investigators were stumped for so long because 
they believed professionals executed the daring theft 
alvarez said the two men kept the treasure in a closet in 
perches parents house for more than a year then took it to the 
pacific resort town of acapulco 
there they met some drug traffickers and tried to interest one 
salvador gutierrez in buying the artifacts perches and sardina 
gave him several artifacts in exchange for an unspecified amount of 
cocaine but never completed a deal for the entire cache 
authorities still are searching for the missing items 
one of the most important pieces a restored zapotec mask of the 
batgod murcielago from the monte alban ruins in southern mexico 
had come apart and had to be repaired alvarez said

president bushs savings and loan bailout is on 
its way to a vote in the house over loud but lonely objections from 
a few members trying to delete provisions benefiting special 
interests 
lobbyists for sampls and other companies affected by the 
legislation have swarmed around the capitol for months and the 
732page bill shows the results in provisions inserted by house 
committees to benefit specific firms 
theres pork in there warned rep robert walker rpa just 
before the house voted 33095 to adopt rules of debate that will 
preclude any consideration of an amendment knocking specialinterest 
sections from the bill 
democrats voted 23717 to adopt debate procedures crafted by the 
democraticcontrolled rules committee while republicans voted more 
narrowly 9378 in favor of the rules 
walker ticked off a list of companies that succeeded in winning 
concessions including such wellknown names as sears roebuck amp 
co merrill lynch and chemical bank 
one section according to walker exempts columbia savings and 
loan association in beverly hills calif from a provision that 
would force it to sell off much of its junk bond portfolio the 
largest of any sampl in the nation 
this is wrong this is the congress of the united states at 
its worst complained rep tim valentine dnc 
rep jim leach riowa one of the thrift industrys sharpest 
critics pleaded to no avail with democrats to permit debate of his 
amendments including one to exclude specialinterest provisions 
at issue is whether the party of reform in the 1970s has become 
the party of the status quo in the 1980s he said allow the 
reform sentiments of this house to be unshackled 
by far the most heavily lobbied part of the bill is a provision 
bush calls the key reform it would force sampl owners to risk more of 
their own money providing a thicker cushion between loss and the 
government deposit insurance fund 
more than 700 sampls are pushing for an accounting break that would 
allow many of them to avoid risking any of their own money earlier 
in the 1980s regulators granted the accounting break known as 
supervisory good will to institutions willing to take ailing sampls 
off the governments hands 
rep james h quillen rtenn has become the industrys 
spokesman on the issue he sported an sampl button on the floor of the 
house reading a deal is a deal and repeated the slogan during 
debate 
the good will institutions lost a series of close votes in house 
committees and the bill as it goes to the floor forces them to 
give up the accounting break in five years 
however theyll get another chance although the houseadopted 
rule fails to permit debate on either leachs antispecial interest 
amendment or another toughening capital requirements even further 
it permits a vote on a quillen provision allowing sampls to keep their 
good will for as long as 40 years 
in case that fails a vote on another amendment sponsored by 
rep henry hyde rill will be allowed it would allow sampls to 
delay having to meet tougher standards for up to 18 months 
although the lobbying firepower is tilted heavily in favor of 
sampls a few groups are working to bolster the other side 
peggy miller of the consumer federation of america was in the 
capitol wednesday trying to counter the industrys efforts by 
handing around a bright pink sheet similar to the slate cards 
distributed at polling places by political parties it listed the 
amendments to be debated by the house this week and for each 
instructed in capital letters vote yes or vote no

rescuers worked to recover the last four 
bodies wednesday from a remote hawaii island valley where a tour 
airplane crashed killing 11 people 
the scenic air tours hawaii plane slammed into an 1800foot high 
wall sunday afternoon at the back of waipio valley there were no 
survivors 
the twinengine beechcraft was on a flight from hilo airport on 
hawaii island to kahului on the island of maui 
a threemember national transportation safety board team was to 
travel to hawaii island to meet with officials in charge of recovery 
effort said bruce butts operations officer for the hawaii county 
civil defense agency 
barry trotter leader of the ntsb team said that in addition to 
examining the crash site the team would investigate scenic air 
tours crew training procedures and how the company selects its 
pilots 
the planes pilot pascal meric 28 of honolulu had about 4000 
hours flying experience said doug rogers chief pilot for scenic 
air tours the crash was the first in the companys nineyear 
history 
rescue workers descended on ropes from a helicopter to recover 
seven bodies tuesday those remains were found upslope from the main 
portion of wreckage 
the remains of the others from what i understand are in and 
around the main wreckage itself and that wreckage is hanging 
precariously on the side of a steep valley wall butts said 
butts said civil defense officials firefighters and national 
park rangers were trying to minimize the risk to rescue workers 
working to recover the remaining bodies 
the twinengine beechcraft struck a sheer valley wall and its

citizens of the baltic republics annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 held memorial rallies wednesday for thousands 
of countrymen deported by josef stalin and some used the occasion 
to speak out for independence 
stalin began deporting estonians latvians and lithuanians on 
june 1314 1941 tens of thousands of the baltic elite were 
reported sent to siberia on those two days alone 
amita upmine a member of the latvian peoples front said 
lithuanian television broadcast a rally at domsky square in riga at 
which speakers called for the independence of latvia 
ms upmine quoted one speaker a member of the helsinki watch 
group that monitors international human rights accords as saying 
dont listen to the communist party latvia must be sovereign 
she said similar demands were made by a leader of her 
organization a grassroots political group 
a brief report on the observances by tass the official soviet 
news agency called the deportations illegal and said the meetings 
were in memory of the repressed but did not mention calls for 
latvian independence 
last week the executive body of latvias legislature declared 
the deportations illegal and designated june 14 a memorial day for 
those repressed under stalin said mikhail bonden a reporter in 
riga for the moscowbased dissident journal express chronicle 
lithuania took similar action proclaiming june 14 a day of 
mourning and hope for the deportees said vytautas bogysis 
father of a lithuanian activist of the same name 
an accompanying statement from the government and lithuanian 
communist party called the deportations genocide bogysis said 
by telephone from vilnius capital of the republic 
in washington president bush said in a proclamation of june 14 
as baltic freedom day that the undeniable voice of baltic people 
is being heard congress also has passed a resolution designating 
the special day 
activists in all three baltic republics have demanded for years 
that moscow renounce a secret provision of the 1939 hitlerstalin 
nonagression pact under which the soviet union annexed the baltics 
earlier this month the new soviet congress created a commission 
to investigate the agreement 
by admitting it made a deal with adolf hitler the kremlin would 
acknowledge as lies half a century of assertions that the baltic 
states joined the soviet union voluntarily 
stalin deported large numbers of people often entire ethnic 
groups from several regions of the soviet union as a means of 
crushing real or imagined opposition 
one western account says 48000 members of the baltic elite were 
deported on june 1314 1941 
many more were sent away in subsequent years and most died with 
fewer than 20 percent returning after stalins death in 1953 no 
confirmed total of deportations is available but estimates run into 
the hundreds of thousands 
last month representatives of peoples fronts of all three 
baltic republics demanded a trial of soviet officials blamed for the 
deportations and associated political killings 
a peoples front leader in riga repeated the demand at 
wednesdays rally demanding that the kremlin publish a list of 
officials responsible for the deportations ms upmine said 
in vilnius thousands of people attended a memorial roman 
catholic mass in cathedral square said the younger bogysis a 
member of a helsinki watch group he said bells throughout the 
republic tolled at noon 
survivors and others marched on tuesday to a railroad station 
near vilnius from which deportees left the city and many placed 
flowers on the tracks bogysis said 
flags flew at half staff in tallinn capital of estonia and a 
memorial concert was held at city hall said tonis avikson of the 
estonian peoples front mourners in tartu estonia laid the 
foundation of a monument at a railroad station he said

television viewers are happy with their cable 
programs a cable executive said wednesday in urging congress not to 
impose restrictions willynilly on a thriving business in which 
viewers vote every month with their subscription payments 
a kentucky broadcaster however joined an ohio senator in saying 
cable growth could threaten the viability of overtheair free 
television 
john malone president of the nations largest cable tv company 
telecommunications inc said the government needs to keep a close 
eye on media conglomerates because of their size and a certain 
amount of regulation is healthy up to a degree 
but in an appearance before a senate subcommittee that is 
studying increased concentration of media ownership malone rejected 
calls for widespread reregulation of the cable industry and said 
congress should focus on specific abuses if they exist 
there are a dozen or more bills pending in congress to impose 
pricing and other restraints on an industry that essentially was 
deregulated under the 1984 cable act 
lawmakers have expressed concern over sharply higher rates for 
cable service since deregulation and over the prospect of more 
sporting events going to pay tv 
viewership of free overtheair television is down and cable 
companies have consolidated their hold on the television business 
through acquisitions and investments in programming services 
socalled horizontal and vertical integration 
malone acknowledged that prices have risen since the 1984 act 
but only because local governments had held prices artificially low 
for the 10 previous years 
even with higher prices the number of cable subscribers 
increased from about 30 million in 1984 to about 45 million today 
he said where there was only one cable programming service in 1975 
hbo there are expected to be 110 by 1990 
and except for local news coverage cable viewers consistently 
rate cable programming as more diverse and of higher quality than 
broadcast television malone said 
the growth of the industry i think shows viewers like what they 
see people vote every month with their subscription payments 
malone said 
he said cable tv has the lowest return on investment of nearly 
any business and that tci has never paid a shareholder dividend 
but when sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the 
communications subcommittee of the commerce science and 
transportation committee asked malone if he were implying that tci 
was a nonprofit enterprise malone acknowledged that the companys 
stock value had increased nearly 900 times since 1977 
on behalf of free tv fred paxton president of wpsdtv paducah 
ky warned the senators they could expect a firestorm of protest 
if your constituents wake up some day to find that virtually the 
only desirable services they can get are the one they must pay for 
he said broadcasters could be thriving by the end of the century 
or they could be weak sisters to cable and tens of millions of 
viewers would not be able to afford television service 
under the second scenario he foresaw all tv being delivered by 
wire with a halfdozen large companies perhaps the bell telephone 
companies owning the systems and holding control over local and 
national news programs 
i believe it is a whole chain of events triggered by the 
emergence of cable television and its deregulation at the federal 
and local levels paxton said 
he said today the top 20 cable group owners control nearly 70 
percent of all cable subscribers while in 1985 70 percent were 
controlled by 50 group owners 
one of the cable industrys most outspoken critics sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio told the subcommittee that congress must act to 
rein in cable before it is too late because competition 
gradually is being eliminated 
he said cable tvs prices have increased more than any other 
single product since 1987 and cable companies that produce 
programs now are denying those programs to competing delivery 
services such as wireless microwave cable and satellites 
he said the proposed merger of time inc and warner 
communications which would create the worlds largest media 
concern would mean less programming for consumers

from rockefeller center to corn dog on a stick 
from yakima wash to chattanooga tenn the workers in 
minimumwage jobs have the same message for president bush 335 an 
hour is not enough 
thats why new york city has so many homeless people work hard 
and they cant even afford the rent said amy hanne 27 of 
brooklyn a rockefeller center security guard in manhattan 
patricia zaradic manager of corn dog on a stick at the nittany 
mall in state college about five miles east of penn state 
universitys main campus said its places like this that raising 
the minimum wage would be a big help to a lot of people 
ms hanne and ms zaradic were among workers and managers queried 
by the associated press after bushs veto of a measure to raise the 
current 335 hourly minimum to 455 the house failed to override 
the veto wednesday 
mike farr assistant manager of the off the record record store 
in yakima said that although he makes more than the minimum wage an 
increase would be significant for me i think it would make the 
manager have to move me up to maybe 55 cents over what im making 
now 
washington is one of several states where the minimum is already 
higher than the federal law washingtons is 385 and employees at 
the record store start at 4 
in states such as washington maine and massachusetts the ap 
survey turned up few establishments that said they were paying the 
minimum wage 
in boston restaurants are advertising for employees at 6 or 7 
an hour and dishwashers in chinatown start at 5 according to a 
restaurant owner 
in chattanooga however linda gilliam 43 a grandmother who 
works at a krystal fastfood restaurant and recently got a 10cent 
raise to 410 an hour said you get these ladies that dont have 
a good education who come in and theyre divorced and have children 
threethirtyfive an hour then they have to go on welfare or food 
stamps to help with that and thats pitiful 
raymond alian who owns and manages an oklahoma city taco 
restaurant said he was glad bush vetoed the bill 
it would be the people that would hurt the whole country 
alian said this cost is going to be passed on to the people 
alian said he pays his employees 350 an hour 
jamie arndt 21 a university of minnesota student said a raise 
of 120 an hour would make a difference but not a lot of 
difference she said tips about double her minimumwage pay at the 
gingham kitchen a tiny neighborhood restaurant in minneapolis 
ms arndt also cautioned that a higher minimum might hurt a 
lot of employers are stingy and theyll try to get by with the least 
amount of workers it will cause a situation in the workplace where 
the workers will be overworked and theyll quit 
kate odonnell 57 a sales clerk at jenney lee bakery in 
downtown pittsburgh however said the extra money could make a big 
difference to some 
who can live on 335 an hour ms odonnell asked even a 
couple of bucks would make a big difference when you dont have it 
it all helps 
in state college nancy silks said she would have to close one of 
her three pet stores and reduce the staff at another if the raise 
went into effect as canaries chirped in the background ms silks 
said ends are hard enough to meet as it is for a small business 
anyway 
but suzanne gowan manager of a burger king restaurant in newark 
nj said a higher wage would limit turnover and attract older 
workers 
we get applications from kids 15 and 16 years old but we need 
18yearolds and older for the night crews she said 
vera kelly 49 of queens who works behind the lunch counter at 
lamstons a five and ten cents store in manhattan said even 455 
still wouldnt support a family it should be even more than 
that 
she doubted employers would be forced to lay off people if the 
minimum were raised 
you got to have help said mrs kelley you cant cut back 
but so far

vice president dan quayle wrapped up his blitz 
through central america on wednesday declaring he had forged a 
consensus among the regions democracies behind us opposition to 
nicaraguas leftist government and the rule of gen manuel antonio 
noriega in panama 
quayle said the usbacked governments of costa rica el 
salvador guatemala and honduras agreed with the bush administration 
stance as regards nicaragua and panama but he conceded that no new 
plans had been laid to accomplish us objectives 
still quayle told reporters traveling home with him on air force 
two that he felt his threeday trip had heightened political 
pressure on noriega to step down and on the leftist nicaragua 
government to change its ways 
of his oneonone meetings with the four central american 
presidents quayle said 
it was very important for them to see my deep convictions about 
nicaragua and panama i was very emphatic very direct and i left no 
wiggle room about where the united states was coming from 
what we were able to do is develop a genuine consensus on 
our strategy on two very important countries 
officials traveling with quayle said there was general agreement 
by the presidents that if an ongoing organization of american states 
mediating effort fails to convince noreiga to step down there will 
likely be calls for new unspecified steps against him 
one official talking to reporters on the condition of anonymity 
predicted that latin leaders acting outside the oas would consider 
acting jointly against noriega if the oas fails to achieve a 
solution by the july 19 deadline it has set for its mediation team 
in the meantime the us allies are expected to move further in 
the political arena the official said adding also that costa rica 
was preparing for the possibility of cutting diplomatic relations 
and trade arrangements with panama if the oas effort fails 
the official also said that cuba was willing to accept noriega 
should he leave panama and that administration officials believe 
spain venezuela and the dominican republic would also take him 
one enticement for noriega to step down might be the assurance of 
going to a country that has no extradition treaty with the united 
states such as cuba so he could avoid having to face drug 
trafficking charges in a florida indictment president bush has said 
he would not consider dropping the indictment 
at a san jose news conference before he left wednesday for 
washington quayle was joined by president oscar arias in denouncing 
the sandinista government of nicaragua for failing to put in place a 
structure for free elections next february 
under current legislation enacted to govern the election 
having a fair and open election is not possible said arias 
with their law on the media it is impossible he said in 
reference to the election law that critics say gives opposition 
candidates a disadvantage in terms of media access 
the sandinistas will have to meet at least a minimum standard 
so as to be considered legitimate in their election he said 
quayle said that in his talks throughout the region he found 
agreement that nicaragua is violating terms of the regional 
esquipulas ii peace accord signed in 1987 by the five central 
american presidents

the white house said wednesday that president 
bush remains committed to affirmative action programs despite recent 
supreme court decisions viewed as a setback to helping women and 
minorities overcome bias 
keeping some distance from the high court rulings spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said the cases were still being reviewed by the 
justice department and we have not taken any further position 
while promising that the government will abide by the rulings he 
said nevertheless the governments policy on affirmative action 
remains the same 
the president has spoken out often that he supports affirmative 
action in terms of helping blacks and increasing their economic and 
social status in this country as well as other minorities 
fitzwater said 
he said there are any kinds of mitigating events that occur 
such as supreme court rulings changes in the law and regulatory 
decisions 
but the presidents basic belief that we should wipe out all 
the vestiges of prejudice and racism as it relates to economic 
progress remains the same he said 
on monday the court expanded the ability of white men to 
challenge courtapproved plans giving preferential treatment to 
minorities and women in government jobs 
the court in january ruled that state and local governments 
generally may not impose racial quotas for public works projects on 
june 5 the justices erected new barriers for minorities seeking to 
prove with statistics that they are relegated to lower paying less 
desirable jobs 
asked if bush would support legislation to bypass the courts 
rulings on affirmative action fitzwater said well have to wait 
and see what the reviews indicate right now we dont have any 
proposals to make

the corporation for public broadcasting which 
has been criticized by broadcasters and producers for poor decision 
making political interference and lack of money on wednesday 
called for a public tv summit to develop a plan for national 
program financing 
cpb president donald ledwig said he had invited participation by 
the public broadcasting service and the national association of 
public television stations to develop a programfinancing strategy 
in preparation for a cpb report that must be submitted to congress 
by jan 31 1990 
ledwig made the announcement at the pbs programming and producers 
convention in marco island fla and said pbs president bruce 
christensen had accepted his invitation cpb spokeswoman jennifer 
grossman said 
cpb in april released a survey it commissioned in which a 
majority of the 80 program producers public tv station managers and 
financing sources interviewed cited three major problem areas a 
need for more money and new sources of funds a need for better 
vision leadership and coordination and a need to eliminate 
industry infighting and political interference 
grossman said cpb had not been surprised by the surveys findings 
when we began our study we designed it specifically to 
pinpoint problems she said i dont think its fair to say the 
study pinpointed problems that surprised us and now were reacting 
to that 
congress in the public telecommunications act of 1988 ordered 
cpb to submit a plan by next january outlining the best way to fund 
national public tv programming 
if congress accepts the plan it would go into effect in october 
1990

scores of soldiers from a us army 
construction battalion arrived wednesday to build the worlds 
highest airport near the mining city of potosi 
the 160 men joined 90 troopers who arrived in the last few days 
with heavy equipment with which to level a hill and extend the 
runway at potosi 345 miles southeast of la paz the hill at the end 
of the runway limits the size of aircraft that can land at potosi 
marxist political parties claim the united states plans to 
establish a forward base for operations in south america but the 
us embassy says the only purpose is to build the airport 13500 
feet above sea level in the andes 
the soldiers are from the southern command in panama us 
military headquarters for latin america and will be here about 
three months returning next year to finish the work information 
minister herman antelo said 
in 1650 potosi was the largest city in the americas with a 
population of 160000 renowned for its silver mines magnificent 
colonial architecture and churches glistening with gold 
it still depends on mining but depletion of the silver and tin 
deposits have made it a poor city of 113000 
potosi needed this done in the hope of expanding its tourist 
trade and providing more jobs and revenue to the area said bruce 
wharton the embassy information officer 
at the same time it provides us military engineers the 
chance to work at 13500 feet above sea level and test themselves 
and the equipment at that altitude

concentration of newspaper ownership in fewer 
companies is a threat to individual liberty a norwegian journalist 
said wednesday but a us publisher predicted that the clock is 
not going to be turned back 
gunnar bodahljohansen secretary of the norwegian press 
association spoke at a working session of the 42nd world congress 
of newspaper publishers and the international federation of 
newspaper publishers 
in a time with an increasing concentration of power in all 
parts of society and where a diminishing number of companies and 
persons own and manage an increasing part of the public assets a 
free and independent press is of a greater importance than ever 
before he said 
above all it is the press that must act as a counterbalance to 
the concentration of power 
the press is not doing its job in society if it becomes a part 
of this power structure he said it is no longer a guarantor of 
freedom of speech and pluralism if individual newspapers become 
part of large media monopolies or industrial conglomerates they may 
lose their credibility and legitimacy with their readership 
they may become an instrument for those in power not an 
instrument to monitor their activities 
james k batten president and chief executive officer of 
knightridder inc responded that group ownership does not 
necessarily mean control from afar by people more interested in 
profits than community concerns 
he noted that a survey conducted by the american society of 
newspaper editors found a generally positive attitude at newspapers 
that were part of chains 
editors whose papers had been acquired by groups felt strongly 
that their newspapers had benefited from the change batten said 
they also generally felt free to pursue their own best editorial 
and community service instincts without checking those instincts 
with their outoftown owners 
the clock is not going to be turned back on the concentration 
of newspaper ownership the economic forces that have dictated those 
changes are much too powerful and they will continue to be he 
said 
however he said there can be too much of a good thing 
we are hearing a great deal these days about the 
internationalization of the media he said some believe that by 
the early years of the 21st century a handful of global 
megacompanies will control the news and entertainment business 
worldwide on that score i count myself as a watchful skeptic 
william b ketter of quincy mass editor of the 
90000circulation patriot ledger said that four decades ago there 
were about 375 groupowned newspapers about even in total 
circulation with about 1200 independently owned papers 
today 143 groups own 1247 papers with 83 percent of the 
countrys subscribers said ketter who is chairman of a committee 
formed by the american society of newspaper editors to study effects 
of media concentration 
the american society of newspaper editors fears that if us 
newspapers are suddenly owned by corporations such as mobil oil ibm 
or mitsubishi the american public and our government may view us as 
just another profithappy business and the principles of a free 
press could suffer he said

victims were tortured and their bodies were mutilated in the 10day 
wave of ethnic violence at least 90 people died most victims were 
meshki turks a minority of 300000 people forcibly resettled from 
their soviet georgia homeland by dictator josef stalin in 1944 
ryzhkov made his disclosure at a meeting with communist party 
officials in andizhan a regional center northeast of the fergana 
valley where the arson shootings and stabbings were committed

responsibility 
ryzhkov did not name the officials or their titles but he said

the tragic events in the fergana region were well planned and 
organized lt gen vk pankin an interior ministry 
investigator told tass houses which were destroyed were studied 
carefully long beforehand 
he blamed criminals using nationalism as an excuse to create 
disorder and destabilization 
turks were just a pretext for the disturbances pankin said

organizations former police officers dismissed for corruption and a 
large number of selfstyled intellectuals

regulations that banned most news gathering 
staterun television announced the arrests of two of 21 student 
leaders named in a wanted list released tuesday and issued a new 
circular calling for the arrests of three leaders of an independent 
labor union 
dozens of people nationwide were shown being led into police 
stations some with their arms wrenched in the air in a posture 
called by chinese the airplane position 
while the mass arrests continued the peoples liberation army 
reduced its presence in beijing and tiananmen square was unguarded 
by tanks for the first time since the military began cracking down 
on the democracy movement 11 days ago 
authorities ordered pomfret and pessin to leave china within 72 
hours 
the order against pessin followed a barrage of criticism of voa 
by the official chinese media as a rumormonger 
pomfret also was accused of having contacts with student leaders 
and of obtaining unspecified state secrets 
louis d boccardi president and general manager of the ap said 
in new york that he protested in the strongest terms to the 
chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual 
reporting 
in washington chinese ambassador hun xu was summoned to the 
state department and issued a formal protest of the expulsion order 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington that 
pomfret and pessin were only trying to print the truth 
richard carlson voa director said the action was a step 
backward for the media in china which over the past couple of years 
has demonstrated some steps forward 
the expulsion orders appeared to be part of chinas campaign 
against the united states for sheltering leading dissident fang 
lizhi and his wife at the us embassy after the army opened fire on 
prodemocracy protesters june 34 
the military action ended seven weeks of demonstrations by 
students and their supporters for a freer society more than 1000 
people have been arrested since the crackdown began 
the communist party newspaper the peoples daily said in a 
frontpage editorial what kind of people these socalled 
democracy fighters are and the role that some americans played is 
now all too clear 
we hope the us side will emphasize the overall situation of 
chineseamerican relations stop interfering in chinas internal 
affairs and not do anything to hurt bilateral relations it said 
another peoples daily commentary said events showed that class 
struggle continued in china 
television reports said two student leaders zhou fengsuo and 
xiong yan were arrested they were among 21 leaders accused of 
inciting and organizing counterrevolutionary rebellion whose 
names and pictures were flashed repeatedly on tv on tuesday 
the reports said zhou was turned in in xian by his sister and her 
husband who works at an air force academy there zhou 22 was a 
physics student at qinhua university in beijing no details were 
given of the arrest of xiong 24 a graduate student of law at 
beijing university 
a beijing student leader not on the circular fang ke turned 
himself in to police in the central city of wuhan the tv report 
said a leader of an independent worker union set up to support the 
students was arrested after fleeing to nearby hebei province the 
report said 
beijing radio said 32 protesters were arrested at the railway 
station as they tried to flee beijing 
the dozens of tanks that had been in tiananmen square disappeared 
overnight and 20 remaining armored personnel carriers were covered 
with tarps 
tiananmen remained closed to pedestrians and guarded by a 
perimeter of martial law soldiers but traffic now flows on the 
streets that surround the 100yard square 
key intersections that had been guarded by soldiers with rifles 
also were unguarded but several banners appeared downtown that 
read respect to the pla 
a western diplomat said there was no sign any of the troops who 
were called into beijing had left the area western experts 
variously estimated the troop strength at 150000 to 300000 
the staterun media continued its efforts to convince chinese 
that the army acted only in selfdefense and that the worst violence 
was committed by citizens who attacked army tanks 
the official xinhua news agency charged that students and workers 
distributed knives iron bars and chains and incited crowds to kill 
security forces 
it said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands 
were injured while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1000 were 
injured it did not account for the discrepancy with government 
figures issued last week that said nearly 300 people died altogether 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death 
toll may have been as high as 3000 
the us state department announced tuesday that it would begin 
granting nonimmigrant visas to chinese for short stays in the 
united states 
the us embassy in beijing expected a stampede at its visa 
office wednesday but it never happened apparently because many 
chinese were watched closely by plainclothes police officers about 
200 people gathered outside the office opened for the first time 
since the military crackdown began 
in shanghai the us consulate was besieged by people seeking 
visas to join spouses in the united states about 200 people 
clamored to be let into the consulate after officials handed out the 
100 applications that would be accepted wednesday

the senate on wednesday overwhelmingly approved 
the nomination of ambassador richard r burt to be the chief us 
nuclear arms negotiator rejecting claims by sen jesse helms 
rnc that burt is a security risk 
the vote was 8910 with helms and nine other senators voting no 
burt who most recently served as us ambassador to west 
germany will preside over renewed nuclear missile negotiations with 
the soviet union the strategic arms reduction talks or start talks 
beginning monday in geneva 
in an hourlong debate helms who has delayed action on the 
nomination for weeks contended that the nominee had established a 
pattern of negligence and repeated violations raising serious 
questions of whether mr burt is fit to hold a security clearance 
senior republicans and democrats said helms allegations could 
not be taken seriously 
if my brother had the record mr burt has i would not vote for 
my own brother helms said some senators may say hes the 
greatest thing since sliced bread but that seems to me to be 
somewhat of a derogation of sliced bread 
but other senators including senior republicans said there is 
no evidence to prove allegations against the nominee who they said 
would by his past performance be in a position to serve the united 
states with distinction at a crucial and historic juncture of 
relations with the soviet union 
we have said in the past that it was wrong to pursue 
allegations with no evidence to substantiate them said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas rick burt has undergone 
three intensive background investigations and has been confirmed 
twice by the senate for other positions 
if there is no evidence to back allegations the president has 
the right to his nominee dole said 
none none of the allegations accusations have risen to the 
level of being taken seriously said sen joseph r biden ddel 
a member of the senate foreign relations committee which voted 162 
to recommend burt be confirmed 
in fact they are all little more than innuendo biden said 
here we have an incredibly qualified nominee who is about to 
take over a negotiation at one of the most historic moments of the 
nations history biden said we need a nominee of mr burts 
insight intelligence and background 
sen orrin g hatch rutah said that he voted in the past 
against confirming burt for other government positions but would 
support him now because he has grown on the job and proven 
himself 
i have found him honest and forthright hatch said i think 
he is a person of consummate intelligence ability and capability 
burt a former reporter for the new york times served as 
director of the state departments bureau of political affairs from 
1981 to 1983 and as assistant secretary of state for european and 
canadian affairs from 1983 to 1985 when he became ambassador 
helms allegations included those that burt had printed allegedly 
classified information while working as a reporter that he had as 
an unmarried government official dated a reporter who allegedly 
printed classified information that he had once lost a brief case 
allegedly containing classified information and that security 
officers had discovered a film canister containing marijuana inside 
the us embassy in bonn during burts ambassadorship 
helms said burt has said the canister must have been left by a 
guest 
joining helms in voting against the nomination were sens david

genetic tests are sufficient evidence to justify a 
new rape trial for gary dotson because the tests show he couldnt 
have attacked cathleen crowell webb as he was convicted of doing 
dotsons attorney said 
the test results conclusively corroborate cathleen crowell 
webbs 1985 testimony that the 1977 rape charge was a fabrication 
and that mr dotson was arrested convicted and sentenced for a 
crime that never happened attorney thomas breen said tuesday in 
asking for a new trial in circuit court 
dotson was freed on parole in 1985 after mrs webb recanted her 
1979 court testimony but gov james r thompson refused to pardon 
dotson of the crime the governor renewed that refusal after dotson 
asked last fall for a pardon based on tests performed by a scientist 
the scientist edward blake of forensic science associates in 
richmond calif examined mrs webbs semenstained undergarments 
and concluded in august that dotson couldnt have been among the 5 
percent of men whose genetic pattern matched the pattern found in 
cells in the stain 
the stain was a key piece of evidence used to convict dotson 
in april british scientist alex jeffreys a pioneer in genetic 
testing with the university of leicesters genetics department said 
blakes test proved dotson innocent 
it is clear that rejection of this evidence by the judiciary 
would constitute a gross miscarriage of justice jeffreys wrote in 
a letter to breen 
jeffreys had said earlier the stain was too old to prove dotsons 
guilt or innocence using his own methods 
dotson 32 of south suburban country club hills remains in an 
alcoholism treatment center as a condition of his august parole from 
prison 
since his release in 1985 dotson has been in a halfdozen 
runins with the law he returned to prison in december 1987 and 
remained there until august for failing to promply call his parole

accept repatriation

ala cubas foreign ministry told the us interests section in 
havana that clearance for the plane had been withdrawn according to 
a statement by the ins 
no reason was given and the state department is trying to 
determine why the clearance was revoked said a state department

a jury began deliberations wednesday in a mock 
trial designed to encourage settlement of a 300 million lawsuit 
that neighbors filed against the former operator of a government 
uranium processing plant 
the plaintiffs say they have suffered emotional distress and that 
property values have fallen because of radioactive contamination 
from the feed materials production center plant at fernald 18 miles 
northwest of cincinnati 
the plant processes uranium for nuclear weapons 
the us department of energy which owns the plant says the 
claims are groundless 
the plant was operated from 1951 through 1985 by national lead of 
ohio inc 
energy department lawyers contend nlo and its parent company 
national lead industries inc cannot be held liable because the 
companies merely carried out orders of the government which had 
told the operators at times to put priority on production not 
environmental concerns 
the proceeding is called a summary jury trial the jurys verdict 
will not be legally binding but if there is no settlement the case 
is to go to a real trial aug 15 the jury began hearing the case 
june 5 
in closing arguments tuesday lawyers for the plaintiffs 
described the plants former operators as polluters who disregarded 
their neighbors 
stanley chesley lawyer for about 14000 residents claiming 
damages because of radioactive contamination from the plant said 
the 300 million in damages the plaintiffs want is warranted 
obviously thats a lot of money but there was a lot of 
damage chesley told the jury can anybody believe people want 
to move near a plant that is leaking radioactive waste come on 
if the shoe fits theyve got to wear it 
energy department lawyer henry gill jr said nlo hurt nobody 
the energy department estimates that 383000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty 
exhaustair filters since the plant opened in 1951 government 
lawyers say the material has not endangered residents or harmed 
property 
chesley said the suit seeks 178 million in punitive damages and 
the balance in compensatory payments he said the 178 million 
represents the profit national lead of ohio inc made during the 
time it operated the plant 
the plant has been operated by westinghouse materials co of ohio 
since 1986

diesel fuel from a 10000gallon 
storage tank spilled early wednesday killing unknown numbers of 
wildlife and threatening to spread down the manasquan river into an 
ocean inlet officials said 
crews used absorbent pads and vacuum trucks to clean up the fuel 
but poor weather prevented authorities from gauging how far the 
slick would spread said rick fulton a spokesman for the state 
department of environmental protection 
fulton said the tank at johnathan green seed co in howell 
township emptied into bog brook after a fuel line was left on 
overnight the tank is used to fuel delivery trucks 
two miles of bog brook are impacted there is a heavy sheen all 
the way down to the manasquan fulton said were still 
concentrating on getting a massive amount of oil out of there 
fulton said a small amount of fuel reached the manasquan river 
and workers placed 300 feet of floating boom in bog brook to try to 
prevent further spreading 
police were investigating whether someone tampered with the tank 
fuel line johnathan green owner of the company notified officials 
of the spill 
fulton said he expected the cleanup to take several days 
authorities were concerned that rain forecast for the next two 
days could carry the oil beyond containment booms and into manasquan 
inlet 
were trying to avoid the brook breaking loose if the water 
gets high fulton said if that occurs it will have a 
substantial impact on the inlet

the chinese government on wednesday accused two 
american reporters of violating martial law restrictions in their 
reporting on the prodemocracy movement and ordered both to leave 
the country within 72 hours 
john pomfret of the associated press and alan pessin of the 
usgovernment funded voice of america were the first journalists 
ordered expelled under the martial law regulations since china moved 
to crush the democracy movement 11 days ago 
the regulations ban foreign reporters from interviewing student 
leaders taking photographs of troops or covering events around 
tiananmen square scene of the military crackdown on june 34 
the government earlier had not strongly enforced the measures 
imposed by premier li peng on may 20 
vernon mann a reporter for britains independent television news 
was under house arrest wednesday at his hotel in chengdu after being 
arrested tuesday while filming burnedout buildings and buses an 
itn spokesman said 
his passport and papers have been confiscated and he has been 
ordered to stay in his hotel and await punishment added the 
spokesman who spoke anonymously in keeping with british custom 
soldiers detained denis hiault beijing bureau chief of agence 
francepresse for an hour on wednesday and confiscated his residence 
card hiault was accused of photographing troops 
last week in shanghai an itn reporter was deported for covering 
demonstrations while on a tourist visa 
the expulsion orders came as the chinese media continued to 
attack the united states for criticizing the military crackdown and 
for giving refuge to dissident fang lizhi at the us embassy 
the united states formally protested the expulsions white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington that pomfret and 
pessin were only trying to print the truth 
actions such as this the harassment of journalists trying to 
do their job and attempts to jam voa broadcasts will not succeed 
in keeping the truth about what is going on in china from being 
heard in that troubled land or throughout the world he said 
the official xinhua news agency said wednesday nearly 100 
soldiers and police died and thousands were injured in the beijing 
confrontation while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1000 were 
injured government figures last week said nearly 300 people died 
altogether 
according to western intelligence estimates up to 3000 unarmed 
people were killed by troops 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration had no plans to take any reciprocal action against 
chinese journalists in the united states 
the ap also protested the expulsion order to chinese authorities 
we deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the 
chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual 
reporting said louis d boccardi president and general manager 
of the ap john pomfret is a journalist not a participant and 
even those who have issued this order must surely understand that 
pomfret 30 said police accused him of meeting with the leaders 
of student organizations that led the democracy movement and of 
illegally receiving state secrets 
he said that when he asked for clarification of the charges he 
was told you yourself know 
pomfret said he also was accused of giving protection to wuer 
kaixi one of the leading student activists now in hiding chinese 
authorities have charged wuer with counterrevolutionary activities 
pomfret who has worked for the ap since 1986 and has been based 
in beijing since 1988 wrote a profile of wuer before the martial 
law crackdown and interviewed him several times during the 
demonstrations 
i did my job as a journalist and i worked hard its a shame 
that these are the results i get pomfret said 
chinas official press has accused the voa of rumormongering 
and demanded that it immediately stop its disgraceful reporting 
on the military crackdown 
the voa is a major source of information for millions of chinese 
seeking details of events not provided by chinas tightly controlled 
domestic press 
pessin 33 said police accused him of engaging in reporting 
aimed at distorting facts spreading rumors and instigating turmoil 
and counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the only motive we have is to tell the truth as best we can 
pessin said governments dont always like that 
richard carlson director of the voa called beijings action a 
step backward for the media in china which over the past couple of 
years has demonstrated some steps forward 
pomfret and pessin were the first beijingbased correspondents 
ordered to leave china since american and japanese reporters were 
expelled in 1987 following smaller prodemocracy student 
demonstrations 
shuitsu henmi a reporter for kyodo news service and lawrence 
macdonald an american working for afp were accused of receiving 
state secrets from chinese sources 
a new york times reporter john burns was detained and expelled 
from china in 1986 for taking a motorcycle trip through a restricted 
rural area of southwestern china

when the internal revenue service sent chad 
l brenner a refund check for 3954155 he had two questions 
can i get a new bike and can i go outside and play 
the federal tax refund check sent to 8yearold chad was a 
mistake his father floyd said tuesday 
but when brenner walked into the irs district office in wheaton 
md to return the money the receptionist looked at the check 
laughed then told him to take a number 
i waited about an hour and 15 minutes said brenner who owns 
a commercial decorating company in rockville when i showed them 
the check they kind of looked at me saying whats the problem 
chad was not due a refund after paying taxes of 152 on interest 
and dividends last year his father said neither the irs computer 
nor the representative at the district office could offer any 
explanation of why the check had been issued he said 
the representative offered to take the check brenner said but 
they were so confused over what had happened that i kept it until 
they tell me whats wrong 
irs spokesman frank keith said error made in entering data into 
the computer wrongly crediting payments or misplacing decimal 
points can lead to mistakes 
but most are caught at the service center before the check is 
actually issued keith said 
he said brenner should return the check for cancellation and get 
a receipt 
brenner thought the irs should be more grateful that he was 
trying to return the money 
maybe they see a lot of money come their way but 39000 is a 
lot of money to me

democrats and republicans on the house foreign 
affairs committee reached a compromise wednesday to make it easier 
for president bush to keep military aid flowing to el salvador 
at the same time the committee adopted a provision linking aid 
for el salvador to ending civil rights abuses and a demonstrated 
respect for democracy and the rule of law 
the legislation part of a larger foreign aid bill would make 
available up to 85 million a year in foreign military financing to 
the salvadoran government over the next two years 
the compromise ended one of the last roadblocks preventing action 
on the bill authorizing 115 billion in foreign aid over the next 
two fiscal years if congress approves the bill the money still 
would have to be appropriated by separate legislation 
the committee was expected to approve the measure thursday 
paving the way for action by the full house 
many members of congress are suspicious of the newly elected 
conservative government of el salvador some of whose supporters are 
alleged to have taken part in socalled death squad activities 
against leftists and political opponents 
an initial version of the legislation would have permitted aid to 
el salvador to have been cut off by the vote of any one of four of 
the congressional foreign affairs and appropriations committees 
the compromise would permit a presidential veto of a 
congressional decision to cut off aid to el salvador a twothirds 
vote of both houses is necessary to override such a veto 
a 51page amendment to the bill contains a large number of 
specific restrictions on aid to el salvador and other latin american 
nations 
among them is a provision preventing 5 million in aid from being 
spent until the salvadoran government has pursued all efforts to 
bring to trial those responsible for the killing of 10 peasants in 
september 1988 and has taken certain other steps to prosecute 
persons involved in alleged death squad activity 
the legislation requires president bush to certify every six 
months that the government and armed forces of el salvador are 
seeking a fair political settlement to the fighting in the country 
and are taking active steps to end human rights abuses and to bring 
to justice those involved in political violence including those 
responsible for abductions torture and murder

world bank officers are meeting with chinese 
officials in beijing to decide when hundreds of millions of dollars 
in bankfinanced development projects in strifetorn china dollars 
can continue the banks vice president for asia said wednesday 
vice president attila karaosmanoglu described the talks as very 
constructive and told reporters the world banks governing board 
of member nations will be advised when the staff believes operations 
can resume 
security concerns prompted the bank to withdraw its team from 
beijing two weeks ago he said later a core group of the 
beijing resident representative and two officials from washington 
headquarters went to china for the meetings he added 
karaosmanoglu said that in evaluating conditions for proceeding 
with development work in china world bank officers are not 
influenced by te politics of the country and focus on purely 
economic considerations and the prospects for carrying out the 
approved projects 
at this point it is difficult to make any projection but i 
can assure you any decision will be made on the merits of the 
case said karaosmanoglu

unemployment poverty and the continuing 
emigration of the young weigh heavily on the minds of voters but 
irelands general election itself is a major issue in thursdays 
national voting 
prime minister charles haughey who has led four minority 
governments called the election in the hope of winning his first 
majority 
although analysts say haughey may succeed his standing and that 
of his fianna fail party have dropped in opinion polls since he 
announced the election 
i feel perfectly confident that ill be forming a government on 
the 29th of june said alan dukes leader of the opposition fine 
gael party there is a twoweek lag between the election and the 
formation of a new government 
haughey using the colorful idiom that is his hallmark has said 
that dukes and his ally the progressive democratic party wont get 
within an ass roar of victory 
fianna fail was the first choice of 44 percent of the voters in 
the irish independent newspapers final poll published wednesday 
while fine gael was chosen by 28 percent and the progressive 
democrats by 7 percent 
fianna fail has gained none of the undecided vote from a week 
earlier while fine gael was up by 1 percentage point and the 
leftist labor party was up 2 points 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed irish 
republican army was one of several other parties sharing 4 percent 
support 
irelands system allows voters to list their preferences in 
descending order and these are shuffled around in a complex 
tallying system that makes opinion polls unreliable its the second 
choices that will likely decide whether haughey gets his majority 
the point of this election early in the third year of haugheys 
fiveyear term was to produce a fianna fail majority that may have 
been a selfdefeating aim 
richard sinnott a lecturer in politics at university college 
dublin said haugheys supporters among farmers and the middle class 
were satisfied to have him restrained by having to cooperate with 
other parties those supporters sinnott said were annoyed by the 
early election 
jack jones chairman of market research bureau of ireland which 
conducted polls for the irish times said he had believed all along 
that the circumstances under which the general election was called 
would have a key influence on the voting behavior of quite a number 
of people including the ubiquitous floating voter 
haugheys government elected in 1987 has presided over a drop 
in unemployment from 20 percent to 175 percent he has reduced the 
standard tax rate from 35 percent to 32 percent and has imposed 
spending cuts to bring the budget deficit below 5 percent of gross 
national product down from 15 percent within the decade 
those gains however were made with the support of the fine gael 
opposition which had advocated similar policies during its 
coalition government with the labor party that fell two years ago 
what objective does he see as attainable under a possible 
fianna fail majority government which would not have been attainable 
under the arrangement in the outgoing dail parliament asked the 
irish times after the election was called 
the countercase against mr haugheys request for a clear 
mandate will be that he is better for being held in check it said 
in an editorial 
fianna fail won 81 seats in the 166seat dail in the 1987 
election just short of a majority fine gael won 50 the 
progressive democrats 14 and labor 12 small parties and 
independents won the remainder 
ireland has not had a majority government since the fianna fail 
administration of jack lynch left office in 1973 no government has 
won two consecutive terms since 1969 
appearing on state television tuesday night haughey dismissed 
the idea that a fifth minority victory would be the end of a career 
in which he has become known as the great survivor 
aw i have plenty more years said haughey 63 i may not 
have got a majority but no one else did either 
tuesdays appearance was as close as haughey came to a debate 
with dukes the lanky 44yearold economist who took over fine gael 
in march 1987 in place of former prime minister garret fitzgerald 
it is dukes first election as party leader 
the 24 million voters will also be electing irelands 15 
representatives in the 518seat european parliament but that 
campaign has been all but submerged by the general election

indicted us district judge robert aguilar 
temporarily gave up most of his official duties wednesday to fight 
racketeering charges that he improperly used his influence to help 
felons 
the districts chief federal judge said he expects aguilars last 
major ruling condemning immigration officers tactics in northern 
california factory raids to be set aside in a mistrial because 
aguilar is removing himself from the case 
aguilars ruling earlier this month a victory for immigrants 
rights groups would not bind the new trial judge us district 
judge william ingram told reporters he or she would have to hear 
the evidence again 
ingram also discussed plans to distribute aguilars cases to 
other judges including a doubling of his own caseload 
aguilar 58 a 1980 appointee of president jimmy carter and the 
only fulltime federal judge in san jose was named tuesday in an 
eightcount indictment that included the first racketeering charge 
ever against a federal judge 
he was accused of intervening with two other judges to seek 
favorable treatment for a former teamster leader convicted of 
embezzlement and for a former law client of aguilars who was 
convicted of bank fraud in connection with the sale of a casino 
the judge was also accused of tipping off a selfstyled former 
mafia hitman that his telephone was wiretapped of communicating 
with his former secretary while she was a fugitive and of advising 
a lawyer to lie to the grand jury the charges against aguilar are 
punishable by a total of 55 years in prison 
ingram chief judge of the northern district of california told 
reporters that aguilar was voluntarily removing himself from all 
current and future cases until his indictment is resolved the only 
exceptions are a current jury trial in a police brutality suit 
against the city of san jose and a few pending motions in civil 
cases 
aguilar will retain the title of judge and his 89500ayear 
salary ingram said a federal judge can be removed from office only 
through impeachment by congress 
justice department spokesman joseph krovisky broke the 
departments silence on the case wednesday with a brief statement 
denying that the prosecution was politically motivated or 
vengeful 
lawyers for aguilar have contended the judge was being targeted 
as a minority liberal who has issued several important rulings 
against the government

at the actresss bungalow near hollywood on aug 5 1962 next to an

fire destroyed nearly 50000 square 
miles of amazon rain forest last year wiping out a section of land 
roughly the size of louisiana according to brazilian satellite 
studies released wednesday 
however brazils space studies institute said the amount of 
forest cleared by farmers and ranchers was not as great as in 1987 
when 80000 square miles were destroyed 
preliminary results of satellite studies showed that 48400 
square miles were set on fire in the amazon last year physicist 
marcos da costa pereira said by phone from the institute in sao jose 
dos campos 60 miles northeast of sao paulo 
the burned area comprises about 242 percent of the 2 million 
square miles that is considered the legal amazon which is made up 
of the brazilian states of amapa para roraima maranhao goias 
acre rondonia mato grosso and amazonia 
pereira said about 30 percent to 40 percent of the 48400 square 
miles was either virgin rain forest or savannahs the remaining area 
was land that was burned for the second or third time by cattle 
ranchers and farmers getting rid of secondary vegetation that had 
grown back 
in both cases he added the centuriesold slashandburn 
technique was used to clear the land to plant crops and create 
pastureland 
he said it was difficult to say how much of the amazon rain 
forest has been devastated in all but i think its safe to say 
that about 12 percent of the entire area has been destroyed over the 
past century 
pereira attributed the decline in burned forest to political 
and economic factors referring to the international pressure on 
brazil to preserve its rain forest 
another scientist at the national institute of research on the 
amazon in manaus said the satellite findings can be misleading even 
though he agrees a large portion of the rain forest has been 
destroyed by fire 
they overestimate the total amount of legal amazon area 
burned said philip fearnside who estimated 84 percent of the 
legal amazon rain forest has been destroyed this century 
fearnside said among other things the satellite used to collect 
the data is built to study clouds and oceans 
he said satellite sensors often are saturated by heat from 
fires causing the satellite to register a large area being burned 
even if the fire is confined to a small area 
but the important thing is that a tremendous area of the rain 
forest is being burned fearnside stressed 
the amazon accounts for 30 percent of the worlds tropical rain 
forests

a new city aids prevention advertising campaign 
urges men who have sex with each other to rubber up for safety 
by using latex condoms 
we recognize that this effort will be viewed as controversial 
and that it will engender powerful responses health commissioner 
stephen joseph said wednesday but we would rather risk public 
rejection than lives 
the citys major broadcast network affiliates have refused to air 
a campaign video spot in which an actor recalls how he and a male 
lover agreed on the importance of using a condom to have safer 
sex 
we kept making changes and going back to the stations but in 
the end they just said no said terry chabrowe of cappiello amp 
chabrowe the agency that designed the campaign nobodys come out 
and told us why 
councilman noach dear of brooklyn called the campaign an insult 
to taxpayers the city should not be involved with pornography 
and thats all this ad campaign is 
the ad campaign includes 30second video spots and print ads in 
some of the former an actor white black or hispanic depending 
on the spot recalls a romantic night with another man 
the print ads are based on doubleentendres such as 
mantoman in which the letter o is represented by a picture 
of a rolledup condom they feature the rubber up for safety 
slogan 
the videos will be distributed free to bars movie theaters and 
discos radio spots also will be distributed the print ads will 
appear on posters and be offered to magazines and newspapers 
response from the latter has not been overwhelming chabrowe 
said 
aids is the thirdleading cause of death in the city after heart 
disease and cancer in men between 30 and 44 and women 25 to 39 it 
is the no 1 killer

television stations affiliated with the fox 
broadcasting corp announced on wednesday the formation of a new 
childrens television cooperative 
the kids network due to deliver its first animated series to the 
125 fox stations in september 1990 will pool the resources of the 
fox stations to produce networkquality programming for children age 
211 said mike fisher chairman of foxs affiliate board 
with all the fox affiliates we will reach 90 percent of the 
country fisher said i think the best way to think of it is 
that fox is going to be the banker and the affiliates end up owning 
the programming 
the childrens network will operate as its own company with 
profits divided among participating affiliates based on their 
audience delivery fox broadcasting corp will manage promotion 
marketing and program development 
the move is aimed to free the fox stations from the costly 
practice of buying childrens show from television syndicators the 
kids network hopes to produce two hours of childrens show daily 
weve got at least the top 5 childrens tv producers standing 
in line wanting to put their best foot forward with quality 
programming fisher said we can become really good

about 200 southern baptists led by a hollywood 
evangelist carrying a 12footlong wooden cross fanned out 
wednesday along the strip to give gospel tracts to gamblers 
tourists and casino workers 
were on the way to caesars palace weve got another place 
that is gods palace lets take people there evangelist arthur 
blessitt said as he led the southern baptists from the las vegas 
convention center to the strip 
blessitts 9yearold son jerusalem carried a smaller cross as 
he walked beside his father 
the march down the heart of the nations gambling capital came 
after a conference meeting at the midpoint of the threeday southern 
baptist convention that has attracted more than 20000 people 
we want the world to know were telling people about jesus 
said jay strack president of the conference of southern baptist 
evangelists 
the evangelists planned to distribute 16000 gospel tracts along 
the strip of casinos 
blessitt who carried the 80pound cross in 109degree heat said 
the march was a symbolic statement that the church has got to 
reach into its community to the homeless the hungry and the 
hurting 
he led the southern baptists two miles down the strip from the 
stardust hotel to caesars palace where they held an impromptu 
rally amid the casinos lavish reproductions of roman statuary 
all i know is its a long way from mississippi said bob 
hill pastor of calvary baptist church in cleveland miss 
some tourists handed gospel tracts seemed surprised by the 
apparition of evangelists in front of the casinos 
the methodists dont do it said thelma moore her husband 
dwain said the baptist evangelists were a little too pushy for 
his taste 
one tourist from illinois made a confession of faith outside 
caesars palace chris martin of park forest ill said he was 
riding on the bus and got off out of curiousity when he saw the 
baptists 
after listening to blessitt i accepted the lord martin 
said asked if he would continue to gamble martin replied with a 
smile sure oh yeah 
some southern baptists already have revised their opinion of the 
city 
rb chandler pastor of mount airy baptist church in maryland 
said the pointblank truth is that everybody in the world is 
either born again or not he said as he carried a handful of new 
testaments the idea is hopefully we would catch some people and 
tell them about christ for the first time 
sodom and gomorrah was how george mitchell the mayor of a 
small town in western colorado and a member of the rifle southern 
baptist church envisioned las vegas 
but he said wednesday he discovered average las vegans seem to 
be all godfearing people 
the decision to meet in the nations gambling capital evoked 
controversy within the 148 millionmember protestant denomination 
with some southern baptists deciding to stay home rather than bring 
their families to a city built on the vices they condemn 
leaders within the nations largest protestant denomination 
which has pledged to evangelize the world by the turn of the 
century decided to emphasize evangelism at this years convention 
i embrace the old philosophy if someone gives you a lemon you 
make lemonade said john b wright chairman of the conventions 
committee on order of business 
a series of revivals were held last week in las vegas churches 
and nearly 2000 people participated in a doortodoor 
evangelization effort that led to more than 350 confessions of 
faith church officials said 
the denomination hopes to start up 12 new churches in las vegas 
there are about 22000 southern baptists in 71 churches in nevada 
once one of the nations fastestgrowing churches more than 
doubling in size in the past quarter century the southern baptist 
convention has grown barely more than half a percent in each of the 
last two years the lowest growth rate since 1937 
in convention business wednesday delegates defeated a proposal 
to reconsider the conventions 350000 allocation to the baptist 
joint committee on public affirs the vote was 6034 to 5198 
the washingtonbased committee has been criticized by 
conservatives for lobbying against proposals for school prayer and 
tuition tax credits on the grounds they violate baptists beliefs in 
the separation of church and state

the military junta wednesday approved a 
series of democratic constitutional reforms including dropping a 
ban on marxism 
the reforms to be ratified by referendum are the product of a 
recent agreement between the rightwing military government and 
opposition political groups 
immediately after the fourman junta approved the changes the 
government said president augusto pinochet planned to announce the 
referendums date on thursday officials have said the vote will 
take place late july or early august 
gen fernando matthei air force commander and a member of the 
junta said the reforms ensure a soft controlled landing in the 
transition back to democracy 
presidential and congressional elections to pick a new civilian 
government are planned for dec 14 pinochet commander of the 
powerful army was obliged to schedule the balloting when he lost a 
referendum last year on extending his rule to 1997 
the change in government is scheduled to take place next march 11 
the junta whose members include the chiefs of the navy air 
force and national police and an army representative named by 
pinochet acts as a legislature in the absence of an elected 
congress pinochet disbanded congress when he seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup 
the reforms include replacement of a controversial constitutional 
clause that ban marxism the new text the government said does not 
ban ideologies and ensures in a better way a responsible political 
pluralism 
also changed was the makeup of the future senate the government 
refused to strike a clause authorizing it to appoint nine senators 
but it accepted an increase in the total senate membership to 48 up 
from 36 thus reducing the voting power of the nonelected bloc 
most legal experts say the constitution bars pinochet 73 from 
seeking relection on wednesday in an informal dialogue with 
reporters he said he would consider running if the people ask me 
to do so but he did not elaborate

the american society of interior designers 
plans to honor an assistant professor for a study confirming what 
most women have long suspected there are too few toilets in womens 
restrooms 
the study by sandra rawls an assistant professor of housing and 
interior design at the university of missouricolumbia is not 
only commendable for its scholarly research but for its practical 
application as well the society said 
the group plans to present ms rawls with an award in chicago on 
thursday 
ms rawls and her research team collected data at four sites a 
highway rest area a sports arena an airport and a conference 
center 
they used stopwatches to measure the amount of time that 230 
males and 224 females spent in the restrooms they asked the 
subjects to fill out confidential questionnaires telling researchers 
the number and type of their activities in the restrooms 
ms rawls who conducted the study as a doctoral candidate at 
virginia tech found men and women did much the same things in 
public restrooms but women took more time to do it 
men spent about the same time in the restroom regardless of the 
site but the mean time spent by women varied from site to site the 
study concluded 
women were also more likely to have to stand in line than men did 
the study found the optimal ratio of urinals to toilet seats in 
mens facilities is 21 and confirmed that women need more toilets 
than men do

the widow of prime minister olof palme 
on wednesday won the right to testify in the murder trial of her 
husband without facing the man she has accused of the fatal shooting 
in an unprecedented decision the district court granted a list 
of conditions set by lisbeth palme for her testimony including 
suspension of all tape recording during her appearance on the stand 
mrs palme said in a petition to the court it was a necessary 
precondition that she be allowed to testify without the defendant 
carl gustaf christer pettersson in the room 
mrs palme has pointed out pettersson in a videotaped police 
lineup as the man she saw an instant after her husband was shot feb 
28 1986 palme was gunned down as the couple was walking home from 
a movie 
there is no reason not to believe lisbeth palme when she says 
that from fear and other reasons she would not be able to tell the 
truth if christer pettersson is present said presiding judge 
carlanton spak reading a threepage ruling 
he said mrs palme may confront the defendant later in the trial 
mrs palmes unusual demands could undermine her credibility in 
a case in which the prosecution already has suffered repeated 
setbacks 
mrs palme who had been called to take the stand wednesday 
declined to come to the courthouse until the tribunal replied to her 
conditions the court said it would reschedule her appearance 
it also granted her request to close an adjoining press room for 
an overflow crowd of journalists but refused to hold a closeddoor 
session when she testifies 
in later testimony wednesday a convicted bank robber harri 
miekkalina recanted the account he gave police that petterssons 
hatred for palme could be a motive for the killing 
he said petterssons grudge was against society and the criminal 
authorities but not against palme personally i have never seen 
him show any hatred toward palme miekkalina said 
he was the third witness to back away from evidence given earlier 
to police as outlined in a 3000page indictment prepared by the 
prosecution all were friends of pettersson with criminal records

true or false after a scary brush with runaway 
prices in the 1970s americans have had to contend with only 
moderate inflation in the 1980s 
if you already owned your home and had nobody to put through 
college during this decade perhaps you answered true 
but if you happened to dig through your files and compared what 
you paid for say car insurance in 1981 against what it costs you 
now you might not be so quick to agree 
in recent years the reported increase in the consumer price 
index has hovered around 4 percent a year for the first quarter of 
1989 it accelerated to an annual rate of more than 6 percent 
this is not moderate inflation by historical standards only by 
the dismal and more recent experience of the 1970s says paul 
boltz financial economist at the investment management firm of t 
rowe price associates in a justpublished report entitled whats 
an acceptable rate of inflation 
even excluding food and energy an analytical favorite of those 
who neither eat drive nor heat their homes the inflation trend 
is worrisome boltz observes 
over the last 50 years he says there have been four distinct 
periods or chapters in the story of inflation in this country 
from 1939 through 1949 the increase in the cost of living 
averaged 55 percent this boltz notes was considered 
astronomical and only acceptable in the context of fighting a global 
war 
then came the golden era of 194969 when the inflation rate 
averaged just 22 percent for millions of americans who came of 
age started families and bought homes in this era 2 percent 
inflation was moderate and more or less acceptable boltz says 
for the ensuing 15 years prices surged upward at an average rate 
of 72 percent a year nearly tripling in the process eventually 
this wave forced the federal reserve to take severe countermeasures 
bringing on two recessions at the start of the 1980s 
one of the most disheartening aspects of inflation in the 1970s 
was the slowness of the electorate to see its odious consequences 
boltz says 
the great middle class benefited so heartily from rising house 
prices and virtually indexed wages that recognition of inflations 
heavy burden came slowly however the toll finally became apparent 
after the recessions of the early 80s inflation receded it 
has been near 4 percent during the current economic expansion 
it appears to be headed toward 5 percent this year and if the 
expansion continues next year to 6 percent or even higher in 1990 
is this moderate acceptable this is uncomfortably close to 
the world war ii rate and far above the rate of the golden age 
for most of the time since 1939 the american public has been 
relatively tolerant of inflation however boltz notes the 
bursts of inflation in the 40s and 70s that lifted the average 
were definitely unacceptable to the electorate voters supported 
grim recessions in the 50s and early 80s to bring inflation into 
line 
if 5 percent or 6 percent inflation is now considered 
moderate then we have forgotten some of the important lessons of 
the 1970s

real estate investor gail gass had high hopes for 
a recent business trip to bali but her journey turned into a 
nightmare when she suffered severe head injuries in a car crash 
there 
i had hired a driver one day and was just beginning to relax 
and the last thing i remember after that was waking up in a 
hospital recalled the 38yearold santa fe calif woman still 
recuperating from surgery 
gass whod hoped to start a business on the exotic indonesian 
island says her life was saved by a 49 travel insurance policy she 
bought on a whim a couple of days before her trip without that she 
said she wouldnt have been able to afford the more than 28000 in 
emergency medical transporation expenses to singapore where she 
received most of her treatment 
few people think about travel disasters like hers but unforseen 
events from medical emergencies to an airline bankruptcy can 
shatter the bestlaid plans 
travel insurance can provide financial as well as emotional 
relief but chosing the right plan can be confusing because a 
number of companies provide coverage on everything from traffic 
delays on the way to the airport to emergency transit from remote 
parts of the world 
standard packages which cover the length of a trip usually 
include trip cancellation or interruption loss of luggage or 
personal property accidental death or dismemberment medical 
coverage and transporation to adequate medical facilities these 
usually start at around 20 and are available through a travel agent 
or directly from an insurer 
additional coverage can be provided for instance 550 can buy 
you 100 of coverage on lost luggage or for trip cancellation while 
yearlong medical insurance for the overseas traveler can cost as 
much as 2000 
benefits and costs vary 
for example travel guard international offers for about 50 a 
policy covering one person on a trip of up to a week coverage 
includes 25000 accidental death insurance 5000 for emergency 
assistance 2500 for medical expenses and 600 for trip 
interruption or cancellation 
among the major insurers in the 100 million industry are travel 
guard international based in stevens point wis the carrier gail 
gass used access america inc of new york mutual of omaha 
teletrip co of omaha the travelers cos of hartford conn and 
worldcare travel assistance association inc of washington 
travelers should shop around for insurance because conditions 
limits exclusions and costs vary depending on length of trip and 
benefits provided some policies specifically exclude coverage if a 
tour operator defaults for instance 
experts also recommend that travelers first determine what 
insurance they already have before buying more 
if youre a normal traveler you probably have more protection 
than youre aware of said john karanik a senior vice president 
for atlantic mutual insurance cos of new york you may need to 
purchase less than you think 
some creditcard issuers for instance provide life insurance on 
flights as well as auto and baggage insurance and legal and medical 
referrals abroad during trips paid for with the card 
also most homeowners or renters policies usually cover losses 
to some degree away from the home and medical policies with 
medicare the noted exception are extended for care abroad 
although they dont usually include emergency transporation 
in addition a number of auto insurance plans are extended to 
rental cars in the united states and canada but not in foreign 
countries 
in mexico for example its wise to buy that countrys fairly 
inexpensive auto insurance at the border before entering or risk 
going to jail if you end up in an accident 
melanie marsh a spokesperson for the health insurance 
association of america recommends that when going abroad travelers 
pack a couple of health insurance claims forms in their suitcases 
just in case 
you have to make sure the claim forms are filled out before you 
leave she said if you only have a bill that may not be enough 
for insurance companies to reimburse you 
and dont worry if its written in a foreign language 
of course there are some situations where travel insurance might 
not help 
last summer richard and barbara seltzer of boston had to rush 
their 13yearold son bobby to a staterun childrens hospital in 
romania after he suffered an asthma attack while competing in a 
worldwide junior chess tournament 
they were staying in a remote village and the next flight out 
wasnt for at least another two weeks so they had to rely on local 
doctors 
i sat there watching the cockroaches crawling in and out of the 
drawers where they kept the medical instruments it was scarey 
said seltzer even though it wouldnt have helped here im 
going to take a good hard look at it insurance on my next trip

when she decided to write a novel about the starship enterprise and 
its crew 
id seen some of the other books and i was a big reader of 
science fiction she said and i thought well why not 
after i finished it i submitted it to the publisher and heard 
nothing for 13 months i figured that was the end of it 
but one day dillard got a telephone call from pocket books 
informing her that mindshadow had been accepted 
thus dillard became part of one of the most successful series in 
publishing history and another extension of the 1960s television 
series which was reincarnated as star trek the next 
generation soon to begin its third year as the most popular 
dramatic series in syndication 
to date pocket books has published more than 60 star trek 
novels including four hardbacks and sold an estimated 18 million 
books according to star trek editor david stern 
every one of the novels published since may 1986 has been on the 
new york times best seller list 
the books have become as successful as virtually everything else 
in the star trek venture the fifth motion picture star trek 
the final frontier has just opened with a box office gross of 
174 million in the first weekend 
paramount pictures makes the movies paramount television makes 
star trek the next generation and pocket books is owned by 
paramount communications co 
the current books began when star trek creator gene 
roddenberry did the novelization for the first movie star trek 
the motion picture in 1979 said stern prior to that bantam 
books had published about a dozen star trek novels 
the novelization of the latest movie has just reached the book 
stores its written by dillard shes also the author of the latest 
hardcover novel the lost years to be published in the fall 
its a historical piece said dillard in a telephone 
interview from her home in florida it fills in the gap between 
the end of the enterprises first fiveyear mission marked by the 
cancellation of the 1960s series and the first movie 
it talks about the enterprise coming home how capt kirk lost 
command of the enterprise when he was talked into becoming an 
admiral and explains why spock returned to his home planet of 
vulcan 
dillard who has now written five star trek books said she 
has a free hand in creating the stories as long as they dont 
contradict the established history of the ship and crew 
stern said the books are written by sciencefiction writers 
writers from other fields and star trek fans 
dc fontana who wrote some of the most popular shows of the 
original series wrote vulcans glory the book published in 
february is still on the bestseller list at two major book store 
chains it brought back capt christopher pike and number one 
two characters from the original star trek pilot 
i felt that went into an area no one had ever explored 
before said fontana id created spocks parents in the 
original series and this book also took spock back to vulcan star 
trek fans want to know everything about every character 
its the only star trek novel ive done so far because im 
primarily a screenwriter but i love the great freedom you have to 
tell a story the characters are good the relationships are good i 
like doing thoughtprovoking stories with an action background 
books about spock are particularly popular and are occasionally 
suggested by editors stern and kevin ryan the first hardback 
spocks world written by diane duane came about this way 
we suggest certain stories that for budgetary and other reasons 
arent done in the movie or television series said stern 
spocks world was a centuriesspanning story of the planet 
vulcan and some history of spock we suggested doing the story that 
became the lost years 
in addition to the novels pocket books publishes a wide 
selection of nonfiction books about star trek a revised 
edition of the star trek compendium by allan asherman is being 
published in june 
next month they will publish captains log william shatners 
personal account of the making of star trek v the final 
frontier as told to his daughter lisabeth shatner shatner in 
addition to playing capt james kirk cowrote the movie and was 
director

an international interdenominational conference sees expanded 
openings for religious activity in the world and calls on christians 
everywhere to proclaim the good news of gods redeeming love 
they also were urged to help those struggling for justice and to 
share the earths resources equitably 
these points highlighted the message of the 10th world conference 
on mission and evangelism involving about 700 christians of most 
denominnations in 100 countries including a 48member roman 
catholic contingent 
sponsored by the world council of churches and held about every 
nine years the weeklong meeting that ended june 1 in san antonio 
was the first of its kind in the united states 
christ is still suffering in many parts of the world the 
conference declared calling for solidarity and action in behalf 
of those in anguish and pain 
the conference which got little attention in the american press 
while it was going on also cited signs of renewal particularly 
the new opportunity for religious expression in many socialist 
countries 
without naming those countries the conference added that the 
holy spirit of truth freedom communion and justice is at work 
today in different parts of the world 
communities and even entire nations in unexpected ways are 
involved in selfexamination repentance renewal and struggle for 
justice turning to the living god stressing the infinite value of 
human dignity and turning to one another to make peace 
russian orthodox archbishop makarij of ivanovfrankovsk told the 
conference that for the first time in 70 years soviet christians 
with great joy can proclaim their faith in the streets 
he said bishops have been guest speakers at schools universities 
and political academies to tell about christianity and have been 
invited to answer questions on popular latenight tv talk shows 
the conference dealt gingerly with some sensitive subjects such 
as relations to other faiths and proselytism among denominations 
but praised the advances toward christian unity 
we confess that we are already one in mission because of what 
the living god has done to and for us a section report said 
our unity is a reality we cannot undo even if we wished 
we are given to one another as sisters and brothers in the one 
household of god 
the sponsoring council includes more than 300 protestant eastern 
orthodox anglican and national catholic denominations totaling more 
than 400 million with roman catholics also represented in various 
units 
the vatican appointed 21 of the catholic participants at the 
conference 
despite gains toward unity the rev eugene stockwell united 
methodist head of the councils evangelism commission called 
continuing divisions a scandal pure and simple 
concerning relations with other faiths a section report points 
to the tension saying 
we are committed to christ and to unequivocal witness to 
salvation in him yet open to others even to the possiblity that we 
may be enriched through our encounter with them 
bishop leslie newbigin retired head of the church of south 
india observed 
i cannot communicate who christ is and what he has done unless 
i am willing to listen to other people real dialogue requires that 
we respect the integrity of the other 
the rev christopher duraisingh directordesignate of the 
councils evangelism arm asked if he considers christ the only 
way to salvation said 
in jesus of nazareth we have been given decisive knowledge of 
the love of god it is incumbent on me to witness to that so that 
all may come to a saving knowledge of jesus christ but i dont 
want to move from the witness stand to the judges bench and use 
that affirmation to judge those who dont make it 
concerning proselytism among denominations a section report said 
evangelism sometimes turns into programs for denominational 
aggrandizement 
we believe that evangelism that does not promote good 
relationships with other christians in the community must inevitably 
come under question all unhealthy competition in mission work 
should be avoided as constituting a distorted form of mission 
at the same time the report says some denominations may become 
ingrown and stagnant and in such situations other christians 
may perhaps be privileged to play a catalytic role in renewal 
but they can do so the report adds only if they identify with 
the other faith group and treat it with sensitivity and respect 
several sections emphasized the imperative of siding with the 
poor and suffering 
the rev emilio castro council general secretary said it is 
from the starting point of the poor that the fabric of gods kingdom 
will be woven 
on specific political trouble spots the conference called for 
establishment of an independent palestinian state urged withdrawal 
of israel from occupied territories and recommended witholding of 
us aid to israel until palestinian rights are achieved

whatever happened to manuel noriega 
not much so far 
that question and answer carry a lesson in limits 
despite us pressure despite the dispatch of nearly 2000 
troops to join the 11000 or so already there despite help from 
other nations in trying to get him out the panamanian strongman 
remains just that 
nearly six weeks after the elections his henchmen disrupted and 
then disavowed noriega still commands the real power in panama 
president bush said he is not giving up the us effort to force 
noriega from power and from the country 
inevitably the crisis atmosphere has eased other issues have 
moved past panama on the agenda and noriega persists 
the regime he dominates tried to erase the elections after the 
fact because he didnt like the outcome his paramilitary squads 
beat opposition candidates bloody in full view of cameras and 
therefore the world the organization of american states rebuked him 
for all that noriega could not be quickly ousted 
the united states and the oas still are trying 
but the outrage level is down the oas mission returned to panama 
this week seeking to promote negotiations between the government 
and the disenfranchised opposition the oas decided its mediators 
should have another six weeks to seek a solution 
vice president dan quayle pressed the us campaign on a trip to 
central america this week our bottom line is that noriega must 
leave not only from power but also it is our position that he 
should leave the country he said 
last time anybody asked noriega whether he would resign he 
dismissed the question as stupid 
the difficulty of achieving that outcome in panama points to the 
reasoning behind president bushs cautious handling of the situation 
in china after the savage crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
in beijing the administration cant write scripts in such crises 
not even in tiny panama with the leverage of the canal and the us 
garrison 
the major step in what bush called a prudent response to the 
chinese army assault on demonstrators was a halt in weapons sales 
and exports despite pressure from some corners for tougher 
sanctions 
bush said he didnt want a break in us relations with china 
when you see these kids struggling for democracy and freedom this 
would be a bad time for the united states to withdraw and pull back 
and leave them to the devices of a leadership that might decide to 
crack down further 
thats exactly what the chinese leadership is doing now but 
there is no practical way for the united states to change it 
bush said at his june 8 news conference that china and panama 
both are affected by a worldwide yearning for democracy as you 
look around the world and you see change respect for the election 
process i would simply say panama is not immune he said were 
all traumatized and properly by the terrible excesses of 
tiananmen square and i havent forgotten the brutal beating of 
guilermo ford in panama and the world hasnt forgotten it ford 
was the opposition candidate for vice president of panama 
it is my fervent hope that the organization of american 
states will stay with their mission and will keep working on their 
mandate until mr noriega leaves the president said 
noriega commander of the panama defense forces was indicted by 
two us grand juries last year on drug trafficking charges the 
administration has been trying to get him ousted for nearly 18 
months using economic sanctions withholding canal revenues and 
financing the opposition for the aborted may 7 campaign 
after the election bush suggested that the military kick out the 
general i would love to see them get him out the president 
said they wouldnt need support from the united states to get rid 
of noriega hes one man and they have a welltrained force 
bush said again last week that the administration has no quarrel 
with the panama defense forces only with noriega quayle carried 
that message on his central american trip 
the pressure continues so for now does noriega

gerald gunther now a leading 
american law professor came back to his birthplace still 
remembering the nazi teacher who regularly called him a jewish 
pig in the 1930s 
as dozens of other west german towns and cities have done 
usingen invited its former jewish residents back a halfcentury 
after they were driven out by adolf hitler 
gunther now one of the foremost us experts on constitutional 
law was born in may 1927 in usingen about 20 miles north of 
frankfurt he started school there in 1933 the same year hitler 
came to power and began the harassment of jews 
the nazi insults particulary when they came from such an 
authority figure as a teacher left an indelible mark gunther said 
but at the same time they inspired him to excel 
i was only 6 when hitler took over in 1933 and i will never 
forget the nazi teacher who put us in the back corner of the 
classroom to separate us from the germans and called us jewish 
pigs gunther said in an interview 
because of this nazi teachers passion for drilling us with 
dates in german history such as when german kings were born i 
memorized those dates and was always first with my hand up to answer 
when i did that he would turn his back on me and say to the 
german kids how is it that this jewish pig knows the answers and 
you dont 
gunther stood as he talked in front of usingens former 
hugenotten church built in 1702 as a place of worship but used as a 
school from 1823 to 1965 
ironically i believe my passion for constitutional law and the 
division of power in government was born in that school because of 
the nazi insults gunter said 
he was born guenther gutenstein the son of otto and minna 
gutenstein and fled to the united states with his parents and 
brothers in september 1938 many of the 90 jewish residents of 
usingen had already left 
after arriving in the united states gunther learned english and 
went on to an engineering college that was followed by university 
law courses and he graduated second in his class from harvard law 
school 
gunther said he changed his name from gutenstein because my 
father felt a nonjewish sounding name would help me get a job in 
engineering but then i got involved in law 
he now teaches law at stanford university in california where he 
lives 
gunther is the author of the college textbook constitutional 
law which is used in nearly every us law school 
among those welcoming gunther and 18 other jews back to their 
hometown were an old german school friend mrs friedel preiss 
i always remember him as the cute chubby little guy with curly 
black hair she said 
the hair is thin and gray now but gunther repaid mrs preiss 
compliment with a kiss on the cheek as they stood near the site of 
usingens former synagogue where the visiting jews laid a wreath 
mrs preiss said german schoolmates were stunned by what the 
nazis did to drive out their jewish neighbors and friends 
after they left we always talked at home about them we always 
wondered if they were ok and where they were she said 
also in the group of former residents was laura duering 65 of 
san francisco her family name was rosenberg 
mrs duering said her family made apple cider and other fruit 
spirits in usingen which were delivered to restaurants as distant 
as sachsenhausen a part of frankfurt 
we had a german driver wilhelm kolte who was a very good 
friend of the family she said he would take the cider into 
sachsenhausen at night because it became illegal for restaurants to 
deal with jews 
she added that after her family had emigrated to the united 
states to escape the nazis kolte was drafted into the german army 
and taken prisoner in the soviet union 
my family wrote a letter to soviet officials to convince them 
kolte was not a nazi and they later set him free she said 
we were lucky because we could leave mrs duering said my 
husband rudolf escaped too but his mother and father died in 
auschwitz she said referring to the notorious nazi concentration 
camp in what is now poland 
stefan kolb a local high school teacher initiated the project 
to invite usingens former residents back home at the citys 
expense kolb said he had been working on it since 1980 after we 
decided to study about what happened to our former jewish residents 
as part of a history class 
usingen has a population of about 10500 the city allocated mark 
equivalent of about 70000 to bring its former jewish citizens back 
home 
many of the group of 19 jews from israel france and the united 
states were in their 70s and accompanied by their spouses and other 
family members for the weeklong visit

through delicate diplomacy the doors gradually 
had opened between american and chinese christian leaders but now a 
questionmark hovers over those associations 
so far contacts between church officials in the two countries 
continued but seemed increasingly uncertain as chinas ruling 
regime widened its suppression of democratic impulses 
in the long run the situation cannot do anything to chinese 
and western christian relations except deepen the solidarity says 
cynthia mclean a specialist in the the china program of the 
national council of churches 
but in the short run it may become difficult to keep up 
contacts weve had if the situation turns antiwestern and 
antiforeign she added in an interview 
she said mutual expressions of support during the current crisis 
coupled with accumulated trust developed between american and 
chinese church leaders would make for a longrange strengthening of 
ties 
but for the moment she said we just dont know whether 
barriers will go up again its possible but we hope not 
weve been in touch with people there on an almost daily basis 
and they tell us to go on saying what we need to say and doing what 
we can do so far they havent been contacted by political 
authorities 
some of the estimated more than 200 americans sent there by us 
churches mostly english teachers medical personnel or other 
experts are remaining there while others are pulling out 
several us church leaders sent messages of support and prayers 
and a letter was relayed here from bishop k h ting president of 
the china christian council expressing shock over the bloodshed 
as far as we can gather he said churches in other cities 
than beijing are carrying on unaffected in beijing where the 
main slaughter by the military occurred church attendance was 
reported reduced to a fraction 
we all feel strongly that in whatever we do and say we must 
act responsibly to the best interest of the church as god guides 
us to see ting wrote we firmly believe gods justice and 
democracy will prevail 
he had expressed support for the prodemocratic student 
demonstrations before the military crackdown and still did so 
afterward in his letter he also voiced gratitude for concern 
expressed by christians around the world 
we need your prayers especially for strength and wisdom at 
this difficult time he said 
the episcopal church set up a special crisis team to monitor 
developments in china and frame strategy appropriate to events there 
and to meet any requests from the chinese christians for material 
assistance 
episcopal presiding bishop edmond l browning wrote ting voicing 
sorrow at the suffering and deaths that have occurred in your 
beloved country and adding 
we pledge to you our solidarity and support we only await your 
word to us of the ways in which we may express concretely our 
concern 
united methodist bishop j woodrow hearn president of the 
denominations board of global ministries and its general 
secretary the rev randolph nugent also voiced dismay at events 
there 
but they pledged continued work with the church in china and 
all chinese of good will to continually build bridges of lasting 
peace justice freedom and prosperity 
of the church personnel serving in china most of the 45 southern 
baptists either had left or planned to do so with classes not held 
for weeks and the spring term ending baptist press said 
were leaving it up to the teachers to decide whether they will 
come out or not says britt towery hong kong representative of 
cooperative services international through whom the southern 
baptists were placed 
of 26 teachers and others serving there through the national 
councils china program only one so far was planning to leave and 
that was because of anxieties of us parents ms mclean said 
she said the building of interchanges with chinese christian 
leaders had begun slowly and tentatively on their part at first but 
lately had become a confident working partnership 
it was a stepbystep process largely involving the 
development of trust she said 
there were only about 700000 chinese protestants and 3 million 
catholics when communism virtually closed the country in 1949 but 
the official protestant total is now 6 million with unofficial 
estimates of more than 50 million 
when the west first learned of that immense growth of 
christianity during its underground years ms mclean said it was 
a shock it also showed the much smaller results of 100 previous 
years of foreign missionary work 
chinese christians had to prove themselves as chinese 
christians she said thats what theyve done in the last 35 
years now theyre accepted as a legal religion and not a foreign 
religion as it was before 1949

the supreme court has let stand a lower courts 
decision that prohibits prayers before public high school football 
games as unconstitutional 
the douglas county ga school district had asked a review of a 
decision that banned the pregame invocations but the high court 
rejected the appeal 
the school districts plan providing for prayers led by 
students parents or school staffers selected without regard to 
religion or the lack of religious beliefs had been upheld by a 
disrict court 
but a federal appeals court said that since douglas county was 
mainly protestant the likely result would be protestant christian 
invocations and that violated the first amendment clause against 
establishing religion

when charles chuck simmons took over as 
police chief in this atlanta suburb last year the first thing he 
did was get rid of the traditional sixshot 38caliber revolver 
weve just finished our transition to the 9mm glock 
semiautomatic pistol which can carry up to 20 rounds simmons 
said now were looking at replacing our shotguns with 9mm 
carbines 
simmons isnt alone in beefing up his arsenal more and more 
police departments big and small are switching to semiautomatic or 
fully automatic weapons most of the new weapons fire 9mm bullets 
which are slightly smaller than 38caliber rounds but 
semiautomatics use clips that hold many more bullets than 
traditional police arms 
simmons said clipfed pistols and rifles give the police three 
things they badly need to combat todays heavily armed criminals 
more firepower quicker reloading and greater accuracy over longer 
distances 
simmons came to marietta from palm bay fla where he says his 
officers were outgunned in a 1987 shootout at two shopping 
centers with a man carrying a semiautomatic rifle with a 30round 
clip 
two police officers were among the six people killed he 
said it appeared one of our officers was fatally wounded while 
trying to reload his empty revolver 
simmons who said palm bay was switching to semiautomatic pistols 
at the time of the shootout now has rearmed three departments in 
seven years 
im either a leader in the field or a jerk depending upon your 
point of view he said 
the trend goes against other efforts to ban highfirepower 
weapons such as californias recent law against civilian possession 
of the ak47 assault rifle and it troubles some law enforcement 
officials 
its true the police are facing ever more dangerous weapons 
said hubert williams director of the police foundation a law 
enforcement think tank in washington however the police are part 
of the civilian population in this country and to the degree we 
increase the type of arms they bear they become to that same 
degree a more militarytype police force 
simmons feels much the same 
ideally we shouldnt need these new weapons he said but 
there are so many semiautomatics on the street these days it would 
take years to get rid of them even if we banned them tomorrow 
meanwhile we simply cant afford to let ourselves be outgunned when 
the shooting starts 
police swat teams have used powerful weapons for years but its 
the cop on the beat who is getting the new 9mm pistols with names 
like glock beretta ruger sig sauer and taurus 
these new nines with the funny names are where its at right 
now said dewey stokes president of the 198000member fraternal 
order of police 
we know that many many of our members have switched over to 
nines but we dont know just how many he said were polling 
them in an effort to find out 
the national sheriffs association is conducting a similar poll of 
the nations 29000 sheriffs and deputies 
we feel that the wheel gun or revolver just isnt adequate 
anymore said bud meeks director of the sheriffs association 
los angeles washington dc miami boston atlanta and 
columbus ohio are among big city police departments converting to 
semiautomatic pistols and chicago is studying the idea 
new york decided to stick with sixshot revolvers but several of 
its suburbs have switched 
the movement definitely isnt confined to big cities said 
cheryl epps of the international association of police chiefs 
while dc is going to 9mm for example prince william county 
virginia further up the road also is armed to the teeth with fully 
automatic weapons theyre everywhere now she said 
in winnetka ill a suburb of chicago police chief herbert timm 
created a stir when he proposed putting uzi machine guns in squad 
cars 
simmons here in marietta said he also has considered machine 
guns 
we feel the shotgun is outdated as a street weapon given what 
were coming up against he said just a few days ago for 
example we answered a routine trouble call and wound up 
confiscating an ar15 the commercial variety of the m16 
semiautomatic rifle 
sgt jack schmida firearms expert with the los angeles police 
department said an lapd officer was killed last year by a gunman 
with an ar15 
the drug dealers usually shoot each other with these weapons 
but they do shoot at us from time to time said schmida whose 
department will begin monday to slowly phase in 9mm berettas by 
issuing them to new recruits 
in columbus ohio police officers are given a choice 
our officers can carry a 16shot 9mm semiautomatic or a 
nineshot cliploaded 45caliber pistol said dewey stokes a 
member of the 1300member force 
with the 38s the officer carried a total of 18 rounds 
counting the 12 in his belt and six in the revolver stokes said 
now with the nines they will carry 48 rounds and thats a 
heckuva difference 
in houston officers are armed with a variety of pistols 
they buy their own weapon and can carry practically anything 
they want said firearms instructor jw walston as a result 
our officers carry a multitude of calibers everything from 9mm to 
44 magnums to 45s however we do encourage them to not carry 
38s and we suggest they use hollow point rounds 
many urban police departments have begun using hollow point 
bullets a softnosed round that has greater stopping power it 
tends to spread out and produce more wallop from increased tissue 
damage 
some financially strapped cities cant make make acrosstheboard 
purchases of semiautomatic pistols which cost from 350 to 550 
but they frequently permit officers to buy their own sidearms 
that is the case in stockton calif where a gunman armed with 
an ak47 rifle opened fire on a schoolyard in january killing five 
children and wounding 29 students and a teacher 
sgt ed williams a 24year veteran of the stockton force said 
he made the switch and became a big fan of the 9mm pistol 
im not a gun nut he said in fact i wouldnt mind going 
to the english method of unarmed police officers but the switch 
from a 38 to a 9mm has greatly improved my accuracy and 
confidence 
officers in walla walla wash huntington wva and muskogee 
okla also may buy their own semiautomatic pistols in muskogee 
threefourths of the 75 officers have switched to 9mm police maj 
rex eskridge said 
like many towns in florida where drug trafficking is 
particularly heavy palm bay has come to see 9mm weapons as a 
necessity 
in addition to the 9mm sidearms we also provide our officers 
with 9mm rifles said frank mcbee the departments firing range 
officer right now were getting five to 10 requests a week from 
other law enforcement agencies for information about the rifles the 
requests have come from all around the country even the fbi has 
requested information about them

ray nash jr considers himself a 
nononsense police chief yet he wouldnt dream of going to work 
without slipping a pair of nunchakus into his belt 
when i first arrived in this town 18 months ago i was afraid 
people would see my chuks and wonder who is this idiot nash 
said 
now however each of the 33 officers on the town police force 
carries a set of police chuks a modified version of the martial 
arts weapons often seen in gradeb karate movies 
the switch from nightsticks to nunchakus is one example of how 
police officers around the country are experimenting with 
alternative weapons to defend themselves against betterarmed 
criminals 
there was some resistance at first but once our officers saw 
the weapons capabilities they were soon converted nash said 
its those darn kung fu movies that have given chuks a bad 
reputation actually they are a far superior secondlevel weapon 
for a police officer than the traditonal nightstick 
he held up his nunchakus a pair of 14inch rosewood sticks 
attached by a short cord 
with a nightstick or slapjack all you can do is prod or hit 
somebody he said but with these chuks i can clamp them on your 
wrist or ankle and generate excruciating pain with a minimum of 
permanent damage used in this manner they are excellent as a 
comealong device and give an officer an option to simply hitting 
an unruly suspect who refuses to comply with a verbal command 
then demonstrating the weapons versatility he grabbed the end 
of one stick and whirled the other piece of wood in a blurry arc 
the chuks can go from 14 to 28 inches in length in a flash and 
even strike around corners said nash i can strike you a 
disabling blow to the knee wrist or elbow we teach our officers to 
always strike below the shoulder but if need be chuks can be used 
as an instrument of deadly force 
our female police officers really like them because you dont 
have to be tremendously strong to get a lot of leverage with them 
he added 
also he said in addition to being versatile theyre 
cheap only about 3 a pair their only drawback is that they are 
harder to control than a nightstick or a sidehandle baton but we 
dont allow our officers to carry them unless theyve passed a 
rigorous training course 
nash said he learned how to use nunchakus in 1982 
i was taught by joe hess who is recognized as the man who has 
made police chuks popular in this country he said 
hess contacted at the university of north florida law 
enforcement institute said he has introduced the martial arts 
weapons to officers from more than 300 police agencies across the 
country and several other nations 
i learned about them when i got interested in karate years 
ago he said at the time i was a member of the police force in 
wildwood nj in 1969 we became the first police department in the 
country to carry chuks 
hess said one advantage of chuks is that police officers can 
carry them anywhere 
if a police officer goes into a restaurant he probably wont 
bring in his nightstick or sidehandle baton he said but the 
chuks fit into your belt and can go anywhere comfortably

economists tend to get a little squinty eyed 
when they look at the big picture of us agriculture that way they 
dont have to focus so much on a drought here a flood there 
for example in the agriculture departments recent studies of 
the farm economy assumptions are made that the terrible heat and 
drought that devastated crops last summer will not be repeated on so 
grand a scale in 1989 
but much of the 1988 drought area particularly in the great 
plains and western corn belt still hasnt recovered fully that was 
evident in last weeks usda report showing a sharply reduced winter 
wheat crop 
the big picture looks substantially better however 
whats more usda economists assert that despite the agonies of 
1988 farmers generally never before had so much money to spend net 
cash income the difference between intake and outgo was at a 
record high of about 577 billion last year 
analysts say cash income will fall in 1989 but still may be in 
the range of 50 billion to 55 billion a big reason for the 
decline they say is a surge in expenses resulting from expanded 
crop acreage 
while not all farmers had stored grain to sell last year the 
high prices resulting from drought losses were one of the reasons 
for the record net cash income but not all farmers lost crops 
because of heat and drought either 
so how does the us agricultural sector stack up one barometer 
is the condition of the major credit institutions serving farmers 
there are four basic groups the farm credit system a network of 
cooperatively owned insitutions overseen by the federal farm credit 
administration commercial banks life insurance companies and the 
farmers home administration a usda agency 
according to a report in the june issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine all except fmha have recovered greatly from the big 
financial crunch of the early 1980s 
last year the report said loan delinquencies reported by the 
farm credit system or fcs dropped 2 billion to half the level of 
two years ago life insurance companies showed a drop of 500 
million in farm real estate loan delinquencies commercial banks saw 
both delinquency rates and net loan chargeoffs on nonreal estate 
farm loans decline to levels of the early 1980s 
if farm loan quality continues to improve at last years pace 
by 1990 farm loans will be near the quality seen before the farm 
financial stress began in the early 1980s the report said 
the improved financial health of farmers and their lenders is 
also evident in reduced loan restructuring in the fcs for example 
loan restructuring declined by half last year 
farmers use of chapter 12 bankruptcy also fell sharply in 1988 
to 2035 filings from 6604 in 1987 the law helps farmers 
restructure debt and continue farming 
the combined farm loan volume reported by the four categories for 
1988 was down only 14 billion in sharp contrast to the previous 
three years when the volume dropped sharply the report said 
commercial bank farm loan volume continued to rise in 1988 
with 45 billion outstanding at yearend nearly 4 percent more than 
a year earlier the report said banks are continuing to gain 
market share and now hold the greatest proportion of farm debt 
the net income of the fcs rose to 704 million last year 
compared with a net loss of 17 million in 1987 although reductions 
in loanloss reserves and grains from the sale of acquired property 
explain much of the rise 
but the fcs is still having problems generating income the 
report said and the system will continue to consolidate its 
operations last year the 37 banks in the system merged into 15 
and the number of fcs associations was trimmed to 281 from 377 
the fmha has long been considered the governments farm lender of 
last resort because it takes on borrowers who have been denied loans 
by others in contrast to the other lenders fmha continues to be in 
a highly stressed situation with 41 percent of its outstanding 
loans delinquent as of february up from 38 percent a year earlier 
however much of the rise is attributable to reduced loan 
volume the report said the dollar amount of delinquencies 
changed little from last year fmha delinquencies are highest during 
the winter because many annual payments come due at yearend some 
borrowers catch up on late payments by summer 
farm lenders are competing keenly for goodquality loans the 
report said consequently this benefits farmers by holding down 
credit costs even so because of a general rise in interest rates 
farmers faced rising interest rates in 1988 and early 1989 
despite the strong farm financial recovery lenders are 
concerned about the longterm profitability of farm operations and 
farmers ability to repay loans the report said increasing 
competition for agricultural exports and reduced government price 
support could erode farmers profitability

the world bank has announced 15 billion worth 
of loans to mexico with provisions that up to onefourth of the 
funds can be used to lessen the countrys debt burden a move aimed 
at advancing the bush administrations third world debt reduction 
plan 
approval for the loans came tuesday at a meeting of the banks 
board of directors the decision means that mexico becomes the first 
country to gain money for debt relief from the 151nation lending 
institution as part of the debt initiative launched by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady 
world bank president barber conable hailed the decision as a 
milestone in the 43history of the world bank 
this is the first time ever that the bank has made provisions 
to finance debt relief for one of its member countries conable 
said at a news conference todays action signals the banks 
determination to become more involved in solving the problem of 
third world debt within the framework of the brady initiative 
brady announced on march 10 a program to encourage commercial 
banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the 13 trillion debt 
burden being carried by third world countries 
the brady plan envisioned that the world bank and its sister 
organization the international monetary fund would provide the 
bulk of incentives needed for commercial banks to voluntarily write 
down their debt 
but so far the commercial banks have complained that the 
resources being discussed by the two international lending 
organizations are insufficient to accomplish the scale of debt 
relief being demanded by debtor countries 
the banks and mexico are currently far apart in their talks on 
the matter mexico is insisting that its outstanding debt be reduced 
by 50 percent while the banks have only offered to reduce the 
principal of existing loans by 22 percent 
world bank officials said they hoped the loan announcement would 
be enough to break a stalemate in debt reduction talks currently 
under way in new york between mexico and its creditor banks 
conable said the timing of the world banks action was meant to 
send a positive message to negotiators so they would know how much 
money would be available 
about 375 million representing 25 percent of the total package 
of loans would provide mexico with the funds to negotiate various 
methods for reducing its total debt of 1074 billion second 
largest in the developing world behind the 1201 billion owed by 
brazil 
the 375 million would be available for example to allow mexico 
to buy back its own loans in the secondary market where they are 
selling at a steep discount from the face value 
conable said venezuela with 35 billion in debt the 
philippines carrying 302 billion in debt and costa rica with 
48 billion would also be early candidates for debt reduction 
assistance 
the administration is hoping to have a successful mexican debt 
package completed in time for bushs trip to the economic summit of 
major industrial nations in paris on july 14 the hope is that an 
agreement with mexico would serve as a model for debt relief 
programs for other heavily indebted countries

sears roebuck and co is having a hard time 
finding a buyer for the sears tower for its 12 billion asking 
price so the price is coming down brokers say 
the response has not been what sears hoped for said scott 
brandwein executive vice president of frain camins amp swartchild 
one of chicagos leading real estate brokers 
the problem brandwein said is that sears announced that it 
would evacuate most of the 50 lower floors forcing a new owner to 
find many new tenants to replace the lost occupancy 
brandwein said the prestige of being in the worlds tallest 
building starts at the 50th floor and up not on the lower floors 
if it were the upper floors that were available the building 
could command the premium it always has he said 
besides selling its sears tower headquarters building the

japans trade surplus with the united states 
narrowed 19 percent last month to 276 billion from a revised 340 
billion a year earlier the finance ministry said wednesday 
it was the first decline from yearearlier figures in four months 
and likely to be welcomed in both washington and tokyo where trade 
tensions have flared again in recent months 
officials from the two countries ended two days of trade talks in 
japan wednesday and reportedly agreed to cooperate in reducing the 
trade imbalance 
rising imports helped reduce japans overall trade surplus to 
378 billion in may down 27 percent from a year earlier and 48 
percent below the previous month the finance ministry said 
in april the countrys trade surplus rose 77 percent from the 
previous year to 730 billion in may 1988 it was 519 billion 
ministry officials attributed the smallerthanexpected 
unadjusted surplus for may to an increase in the pace of import 
growth which they said resisted the yens relative weakness against 
the dollar compared to its yearearlier level 
however the yens relative weakness tended to shrink the 
dollarbased surplus figure after adjustment from yen they said 
exports in may rose 49 percent from the previous year to 2167 
billion while imports climbed 157 percent to 1789 billion 
after seasonal adjustment the may surplus came to 361 billion 
down sharply from 674 billion in april 
may exports were calculated using an average exchange rate for 
the month of 13398 yen to one dollar compared with 12475 yen in 
may 1988 imports were calculated at an average 13378 yen compared 
with 12476 yen a year earlier 
there was an opposite statistical effect from the stronger 
dollar noted sanwa bank ltd capital markets economist t mizuno 
a ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
continuing strong domestic demand linked to japans healthy economy 
had contributed to the rise in imports 
he said import figures also were boosted by higher world oil 
prices petroleum prices averaged 18 a barrel in may compared to 
1620 a year earlier he said 
the percentage of manufactured products in total imports fell to 
486 percent the lowest level this year he said the level had 
been increasing in recent months 
exports to the united states rose 32 percent from a year earlier 
to 713 billion while imports from the united states surged 246 
percent to 437 billion 
imports of general food products from the united states rose 234 
percent to 9704 million and chemical products increased 46 percent 
to 5388 million 
imports of general us machinery products including 
semiconductors and cars rose 233 percent to 118 billion within 
this category imports of motor vehicles surged 148 percent to 532 
million 
japanese exports of general electrical machinery including 
videotape recorders video cameras and semiconductors to the united 
states rose 119 percent to 162 billion but within this category 
exports of television cameras fell 167 percent to 1276 million

japanese and us officials agreed wednesday that 
their nations economic structures are a key cause of their massive 
trade imbalance news reports said 
deputy cabinet ministers from the two nations agreed that factors 
such as japans complex distribution system and the united states 
low savings rate and high consumption level made it difficult to 
reduce the trade imbalance kyodo news service and the japan 
broadcasting corp nhk reported 
the two sides also discussed how to find a mutually 
acceptable way of dealing with charges by washington that japan 
maintains unfair barriers against us space satellites forestry 
products and supercomputers kyodo said 
meanwhile japan announced wednesday that rising imports pushed 
its overall trade surplus down 27 percent in may from a year earlier 
to 378 billion and its surplus with the united states down 19 
percent to 276 billion 
under the super 301 clause of the new us trade act the 
us government is required to begin negotiations with unfair 
trading nations and can impose penalty tariffs against those that do 
not open their markets within 18 months japan has said it will 
refuse to negotiate under a threat of retaliation 
the twoday talks part of a semiannual series of consultations 
on economic issues between deputy cabinet ministers from the two 
sides were the first since new administrations were inaugurated in 
both japan and the united states 
in the talks at the hot springs resort town of ito southwest of 
tokyo the united states did not ask for any official consultations 
under the super 301 clause kyodo said 
officials of both countries said the alreadyscheduled session 
was used as a framework to follow up president george bushs request 
for talks about structural barriers to trade 
the clause has been criticized as protectionist by members of the 
organization for economic cooperation and development which groups 
western industrialized nations 
we are confident that appropriate discussions related to the 
clause will occur and the issues will be raised in a mutually 
acceptable way kyodo quoted undersecretary of state richard 
mccormack head of the us delegation as saying after the meeting 
the two sides agreed to hold future consulations on the 
structural impediments to a reduction in the trade imbalance kyodo 
said 
the united states has said japans multilayered distribution 
system makes it difficult to increase exports to japan while japan 
has charged that problems in the united states such as its low 
savings rate high consumption level and massive budget deficit 
have worsened the imbalance 
in the past trade negotiations between the two nations often 
focused on barriers to individual industries or products rather than 
on economic structures 
also participating in the trade talks were deputy us trade 
representative linn williams and j michael farren assistant 
secretary of commerce for international trade 
the japanese delegation was led by michihiko kunihiro a deputy 
to prime minister sousuke uno and included the deputy ministers of 
international trade finance agriculture and the economic planning 
agency the reports said

09 percent plunge in february the sharpest fall since january 1987

to exhaust inventories at the april sales pace the ratio stood at 
151 in march and 150 in february

the environmental protection agency says 
hundreds of industrial plants in 44 states must curb chemical 
releases into waterways because the waters nearby are becoming too 
contaminated with toxic substances 
the epa on tuesday released a list of nearly 600 stretches of 
lakes rivers and streams that the agency said do not meet state 
water quality standards because of chemical emissions from nearby 
industrial plants and other facilities 
rebecca hanmer the epas assistant administrator for water said 
that while the poor quality of many of the waterways may be largely 
due to chemical runoffs from agriculture or mining operations in 
many cases the industrial releases also are to blame 
the agency said toxic chemical releases from 879 industrial 
plants city water treatment plants and other facilities are causing 
or significantly contributing to violations in water quality 
standards in 595 waterways across the country 
ms hanmer said that in most cases the polluting plants are doing 
so legally because the releases are within state permit restrictions 
the epa made no estimate on health risks from the industrial 
pollution nor did it provide information on levels of releases into 
specific waterways 
ms hanmer said that while the statistics are worrisome the 
agency could not speculate on the health effects on humans she 
noted that the standards being violated are designed to protect 
aquatic life and the levels do not necessarily pose a health threat 
to humans 
the epa has directed states to develop additional control 
strategies that will require the polluters to curb discharges of 
toxic chemicals so that the waters meet state standards by mid1992 
the epa said only about 40 percent of the 897 polluters have 
submitted plans approved by the epa to bring the toxic releases into 
compliance by 1992 the remainder have either submitted plans that 
were rejected or have yet to submit a compliance program officials 
said 
the epa report covered 126 toxic chemicals including a variety of 
substances believed to cause cancer 
in addition to industrial facilities the polluters included a 
dozen federal facilities and 240 local water treatment plants that 
often discharge pollutants from industrial sources among the 
polluters are several military bases energy department facilities 
and the alyeska pipeline service co in alaska which has been told 
to tighten its controls on dumping contaminated water used as 
ballast in oil tankers 
the greatest concentration of releases stems from plants in the 
metal finishing pulp and paper and natural gas industries which 
account for more than 40 percent of the industrial polluters cited 
the releases involve a broad range of metals and chemicals including 
benzene mercury nickel lead asbestos arsenic cyanide and 
dioxin 
contamination of waterways by at least some of the 126 toxic 
chemicals was found in all but six states arizona north dakota 
south dakota nebraska hawaii and vermont the largest numbers of 
polluters were found in pennsylvania washington state wyoming and 
indiana although epa officials said in some cases a state had more 
polluters listed because of tougher state standards

central newspapers inc which owns 
newspapers in indiana and arizona said wednesday it plans to make 
its first public stock offering 
the company said it would register some of its class a or 
nonvoting common stock for sale it would be the first time the 
indianapolisbased company had offered its shares for public sale

value of their class a common stock said frank e russell 
president of central newspapers we are hopeful that this proposed 
transaction will be completed in the second half of 1989 
the plan which was approved tuesday by the companys board was 
first considered more than a year ago when some stockholders 
indicated they wanted to sell their stock it was delayed however 
because the stock market was declining and there were problems

percent of centrals voting stock and 24 percent of its nonvoting 
stock 
the merger was completed last fall and a wholly owned subsidiary

record oil output last month pushed norway 
past britain and made it europes largest oil producer for the first 
time according to a published report wednesday 
norway pumped a record 157 million barrels a day in may 
compared with an estimated 143 million barrels produced by britain 
which closed several north sea fields due to accidents and 
maintenance problems the business newspaper dagens naeringsliv said 
official figures are to be released in july 
oil ministry spokesman egil helle said the 40 percent increase 
over the may 1988 production level irritated some members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries which hopes to 
stabilize prices by limiting supplies 
the increase is due to new fields coming on stream and other 
fields producing more than expected 
though norway is not an opec member it has held production at 
75 percent below capacity since 1987 to cooperate with the oil 
cartel a sixmonth extension of the limit probably will be approved 
this month oil minister arne oeien said 
only four of the 13 opec countries have production quotas 
exceeding norways in the second half of 1989 the newspaper said

thousands of west virginia coal miners 
today continued a wildcat strike hundreds of them in defiance of a 
federal judge and the walkout spread to virginia 
about 650 westmoreland coal co miners in southwest virginia 
walked off the job this morning company spokesman steve anderson 
said 
the wildcat action began monday when an estimated 10000 miners 
in west virginia walked out in support of 1600 fellow united mine 
workers who have been on strike in virginia and west virginia since 
april 5 against pittston coal group the nations largest coal 
exporter 
us district judge dennis knapp on monday and tuesday issued 
backtowork orders covering 450 umw members at more than a dozen 
west virginia mines but many of the workers affected stayed off the 
job today 
everythings the same as it was yesterday said paul 
kvederis a spokesman for consolidation coal co which had about 
250 miners out 
in ordering the miners back to work the judge said it appears 
the union is violating a nostrike clause in its 1988 national 
contract union officials have insisted that they did not authorize 
the walkout they did not return telephone calls today 
some strikers said they will remain off the job until three union 
officials are released from the roanoke va jail where they are 
being held for violating a state judges order limiting picketline 
activity at pittston mines the judge has also imposed 3 million in 
fines 
roger caldwell a umw field representative said the walkout is a 
result of the massive fines the courts putting on us and the 
jailing of our people down there and i think theyve come to the 
point where enoughs enough 
caldwell estimated that 98 percent of the miners in logan and 
mingo counties the heart of the southern west virginia coal field 
were on strike tuesday 
no reason for the unauthorized work stoppage has been 
communicated to management said tom clarke a spokesman for 
peabody holding co which reported 2360 miners off the job our 
policy is not to talk to the miners until they return to work

industrial nations and 
nongovernmental organizations wednesday approved a 43 billion aid 
package for indonesia this year but pressed for further economic 
reform to guarantee stable growth 
total aid pledged by 15 nations including the netherlands the 
united states and japan exceeded last years 4 billion package 
japan pledged the largest single amount 146 billion the united 
states pledged 90 million 
saleh afiff indonesias minister of state for planning of 
national development said the increase reflected the donor 
nations confidence in our economic policies and management 
the pledges were made at the 32nd annual session of the 
intergovernmental group on indonesia iggi an organization 
chaired by the netherlands indonesias former colonizer 
nongovernmental iggi members include the world bank and european 
economic community 
of this years pledges about 250 million will be grants and the 
rest in loans at interest rates of 2 percent to 7 percent afiff 
said he said most of the aid was not tied to any specific projects 
dutch foreign aid minister piet bukman said with a 5 percent 
economic growth rate in indonesia this year progress has been 
sustained but he said further economic reform was necessary 
further deregulation of foreign trade and better incentives for 
private investment will lead to increased competitiveness which 
will create the many jobs needed by indonesias rapidly growing 
population bukman said 
he said an estimated 12 million people were expected to flood 
indonesias already strained job market in coming years

the place where baseballs harmon 
killebrew once belted home runs is about to become a monstrous 
shopping center billed as a combination of disneyland bourbon 
street and the champs elysees 
the 600 million mall of america developed by the ghermezian 
brothers of edmonton alberta will have hundreds of stores 18 
movie theaters and an amusement park 
you wont have to go to new york or paris or rome anymore 
said nader ghermezian 
groundbreaking ceremonies were held today for the mall promoted 
as the nations largest enclosed shopping and entertainment complex 
with 42 million square feet the mall will have nearly as much 
floor space as the 110story sears tower in chicago the worlds 
tallest building 
the suburban minneapolis mall was originally billed as the 
largest in the world but design cutbacks will leave it 1 million 
square feet shy of the ghermezians west edmonton mall in canada 
four large department stores including bloomingdales nordstrom 
and carson pirie scott will anchor the retail portion rounding it 
off will be 600 to 800 specialty shops 18 movie theaters a health 
club and dozens of eating and drinking establishments 
the stores will be built around an amusement area created by 
knotts berry farm that will be larger than the hubert h humphrey 
metrodome the current home of the minnesota twins baseball team and 
minnesota vikings football team 
the decision in 1978 to build the metrodome near downtown 
minneapolis paved the way for the megamall because bloomington 
officials later bought the defunct metropolitan stadium site where 
the twins and vikings played 
a second phase is envisioned to include hotels but those plans 
have not been completed in addition nader ghermezian said last 
week that the developers are considering building a monorail to link 
the mall to nearby minneapolisst paul international airport 
the developers who announced the project in 1985 are betting an 
average of 100000 visitors a day will routinely come from up to 400 
miles away 
former bloomington mayor james lindau said he hasnt always 
shared the ghermezians optimism 
in may 1987 i thought the deal was dead said lindau whose 
defeat later that year was widely considered a vote against the 
megamall 
the city took a large stake in the project by promising 100 
million in public financing and lindau suffered some embarrassment 
when the brothers grandiose plans which initially called for 
submarine rides in a huge aqua facility began to crumble there 
were long delays for the ghermezians to raise money but melvin 
simon amp associates of indianapolis joined as codeveloper

congressional democrats today promised a 
lengthy fight if they fail in their bid for a quick overturn of 
president bushs swift veto of legislation raising the minimum wage 
were going to be working in the coming hours to get the votes 
necessary and if thats possible well override the veto new 
speaker thomas s foley said as the house prepared to meet to 
consider the dayold veto 
and if not well be getting ready to send another bill to the 
white house said foley dwash 
indeed sen edward m kennedy dmass planned to offer another 
bill swiftly if the house override effort failed as expected 
there will be an increase in the minimum wage if not today 
then soon kennedy said tuesday after bush upstaged congressional 
democrats by vetoing the minimumwage bill less than an hour after 
it was sent to the white house 
all of our efforts now are devoted to overturning the veto and 
i would hope that the compelling justice that is at issue in this 
case would reach sufficient members so that we are successful 
said kennedy dmass if were not successful on this we will 
revisit this issue 
kennedy and other democratic leaders spoke at a news conference 
that had been called as a final attempt to persuade bush to sign the 
measure which would raise the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 
455 by october 1991 
but even as they gathered for the event word reached capitol 
hill that bush had vetoed the bill aboard air force one while 
traveling in the midwest 
it is regrettable that this debate must end with a veto bush 
said in a message to congress accompanying the first veto of his 
fivemonth administration 
the democrats however said the debate was far from over 
hope springs eternal was all foley would say tuesday when 
asked if he had a realistic chance of picking up support from more 
than 30 house members overnight the additional support democrats 
would need for a twothirds override margin 
even if foley delivered the votes more than enough republican 
senators have vowed to side with bush to sustain the veto 
both sides view the battle as a contest for momentum in domestic 
policy 
perhaps mindful of that the democrats made no predictions of 
winning the immediate fight but escalated their rhetoric in hopes of 
creating a political issue that will help them in the long haul 
while white house aides joked about the speed of the veto 
democrats characterized it as a sign of bushs insensitivity to 
minimum wage workers who last got a pay raise in 1981 
it is particularly offensive that the president would do this 
in this manner demonstrating disdain for the poor working people of 
this country at the very time he is exerting the maximum effort to 
provide a 30000 a year tax cut to the very wealthiest americans 
said senate majority leader george mitchell 
what the president is saying is to those who have much we must 
give more to those who have little we must give nothing 
mitchell said we think thats the wrong set of priorities 
bush however said the democrats bill would hurt those it was 
designed to help 
this bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive 
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities bush 
said in his veto message democrats had hoped bush would at least 
make a compromise offer but his veto message left intact his 
takeitorleaveit stance 
increasing the minimum wage is not an effective way to help the 
poor said bush whose offer to boost the floor wage to 425 an 
hour by january 1992 stemmed from a presidential campaign pledge 
bush said his support for even that increase hinged on adding to 
the 50yearold minimum wage law a new provision allowing employers 
to pay new hires less than the minimum for six months regardless of 
prior work experience 
mitchell called that provision a significant step backwards in 
social justice the democrats had offered a restrictive provision 
allowing new entrants into the job market to be paid a subminimum 
for up to two months bush said it was inadequate and would not 
prevent the massive job losses he argues would result from a higher 
minimum wage 
the democrats saw it differently 
not often does any person have the opportunity to help so many 
people simply by signing his name kennedy said president bush 
had that opportunity today and failed

robert noyce watched the technology he 
helped create slip across the pacific and is fighting to rekindle 
americas brainpower in the war for economic survival 
noyce 61 has come to texas capital from silicon valley where 
he coinvented the integrated circuit and helped found intel corp 
a giant of the us chip industry 
last year noyce became the first chief executive of sematech a 
joint industrygovernment effort to reclaim us dominance in the 
45 billion semiconductor industry by 1993 
noyces rallying cry is national security both militarily and 
economically 
in the last 10 years japan has almost taken over the 
semiconductor business us market share fell from about 55 percent 
to 40 percent from 1984 to 1987 the commerce department estimates 
chips are the base of the food chain of electronics the core 
elements in everything from supercomputers to coffee makers 
the idea behind sematech is to bring together the best brains in 
the united states whether they work for national semiconductor 
corp or intel for international business machines corp or 
american telephone amp telegraph co to figure out the best 
fastest cheapest way to make computer chips 
i fundamentally believe that even if sematech is a failure it 
will still be a success if we continue to push that sort of 
program says g dan hutcheson president of vlsi research inc a 
market research company in san jose calif 
already you see signs in terms of some of the product 
development hutcheson said problems are being solved theres 
enormous improvement in yields 
since sematech was started engineers have started calling each 
other and talking he said 
it is this freeflowing exchange of information so crucial to 
learning and science that sematech and other consortia are trying 
to encourage 
the obstacle however is historical american reluctance to share 
knowledge with a competitor for fear that hell beat you at your own 
game 
there are detractors xerox corp chairman david kearns said his 
company had declined to participate because it did not believe the 
level of investment justified the possible return 
i applaud the idea of getting together kearns said but he 
suggested that smaller twocompany combinations would be more 
useful because the results could be more easily tailored to the 
participants needs 
in addition a commerce department study said the us computer 
chip industry will remain faced with trade tax and antitrust issues 
regardless of sematechs performance 
although the report recommends congress spend 100 million on 
sematech next year it cautions that such cooperative efforts should 
be treated with care 
electronics is the nations largest manufacturing employer with 
more than 25 million people largely in california massachusetts 
minnesota new york and texas the american electronics association 
says 
although companies in europe have teamed up to form consortiums 
like sematech it is japan that has taken the lead and where experts 
look for guidance 
japan is a beautiful example of a knowledgebased economy 
says noyce 
sematech an acronym for semiconductor manufacturing technology 
is a consortium of 14 semiconductor makers and users and the us 
government that was created in 1987 to find ways to make 
semiconductors faster and better than anyone else 
already sematech has built a wafer fabrication unit and 
manufactured its first silicon wafer the wafer fab built in 32 
weeks and producing three days ahead of schedule is itself a major 
accomplishment noyce said 
us companies produced about 85 percent of all silicon wafers in 
1984 but just over 20 percent in 1987 commerce department figures 
show sematechs aim is to reverse that trend 
across town from sematech is another consortium microelectronics 
and computer corp where similar work is done on a broader range of 
computer research eight companies including motorola inc digital 
equipment corp ncr corp hewlettpackard co and national 
semiconductor are members of both consortia 
experts claim the united states has lost its edge because of too 
much attention to immediate profits at the expense of research and 
investment 
up until the last 15 years america was riding high clearly 
the highest standard of living in the world noyce said 
noyce notes that the japanese success was based on cooperation 
among competitors an anathema in american business that sematech 
hopes to change 
we have to overcome our own idea that were the superior 
race said hutcheson there are other people out there that are 
working harder than we are theyre intelligent theyre innovative 
theyre doing everything that we did but somehow forgot

a computer chip factory soon will rise 
from a corn field in this community of covered bridges the 
birthplace of john wayne 
for winterset 45 minutes southwest of des moines its a chance 
to exploit iowas reputation for a high literacy rate and a 
dedicated dependable work force 
for areas of iowa farther from des moines and its amenities a 
hightech solution to rural poverty and depopulation is more 
elusive the corn belt is not making a smooth transition to the 
knowledge economy 
small towns in iowa and across the midwest have found that good 
schools and a literate work force often touted as keys to success 
are not enough 
wouldbe employers demand access to good transportation modern 
hospitals sophisticated cultural and recreation attractions 
shopping malls and ample outside professional help from lawyers to 
cpas 
even when small towns succeed in industrial recruitment they 
dont get all the expected economic benefits 
new professionals who move in often opt to do their major 
shopping during weekend excursions to the big city says david 
forkenbrock director of the university of iowa public policy center 
the best way to strengthen the rural economy may be to put a 
barrier in the road to prevent people from going to the big city for 
cheaper goods forkenbrock is fond of saying 
even if iowa does everything right it should anticipate just 
modest growth in its personal income employment and population over 
the next 25 years research consultants say 
iowas agricultural history and its existing industry mix make 
it unlikely that the state will become known as a hightech state 
says a draft report prepared by the sri international center for 
economic competitiveness at menlo park calif 
still the report says a tradition of quality can be the basis 
for iowas more competitive more diverse and balanced economy 
in winterset a community of 4000 which stands to gain up to 600 
jobs the courtship of eac technologies inc a maker of control 
panels for appliances was a community affair 
as the high school band played happy days are here again a 
crowd representing everyone from the farmer in his bib overalls to 
the banker in his business suit celebrated the groundbreaking 
eac bought the business from motorola inc it is closing plants 
in taiwan and texas to build in iowa where it also will locate its 
headquarters and research and development center 
iowas reputation for good schools and an educated work force 
that can cope with technological change were strong selling points 
iowa has the highest college entrance exam scores among the 28 
states where the american college testing program is dominant it 
ranks fifth in the nation in high school graduation rates 
we need quality out of a dedicated work force that stays with 
us said tom phillips the president of eac 
small town schools produce such students because they are forced 
by economics to concentrate on the basics while students often 
suffer in the smorgasbord programs of bigger school systems 
said dick manatt director of the school improvement model projects 
at iowa state 
in small towns where everyone knows everyone else there is 
strong peer pressure to succed 
but a trainable reliable work force would not have been enough 
if winterset werent close to des moines and its shopping centers 
theaters museums and airport phillips said 
promises of cooperation from the microprocessor research center 
at iowa state university and of tailormade employee training from 
the des moines area community college also were selling points 
because of such attractions the area around des moines has been 
promoting itself as the golden circle its one of the few 
sectors of the state that grew in population from 1980 to 1987 when 
a sour farm economy caused a flight from rural america 
its pretty tough for a town thats not on the beaten path at 
all to make progress says thomas pogue an economist at the 
university of iowa 
shenandoah in southwest iowa points out that residents can get on 
the golf course in five minutes or to the doctors office in three 
but that approach often is not enough admitted day hacke the 
executive vice president of the shenandoah development corp 
if they want something beyond that they go somewhere else 
from a competitive standpoint youre going to come up short hacke 
said 
eacs phillips says he had to overcome some reservations before 
taking iowa seriously he was looking forward to building in the 
gentler climate of the south and had visions of north carolina golf 
courses when the search began he said he thought of iowa as 
farming flat and not hightech 
the key was that eac needed a work force that could be relied on 
to grasp new techniques and to show up each day and get the job done 
iowa fit that bill

katsura hattori pushed a button and the 
front page of his newspaper asahi shimbun appeared on a 40000 
prototype television 
even the tiny japanese script was clearly legible on the 
finegrained screen 10 times more detailed than a normal tv 
someday hattori said this may be how a lot of people read 
their newspaper in the morning 
if so most of the groundwork will have been done at the 
massachusetts institute of technology but the first commercial 
users probably will be japanese companies over the past four years 
they have handed mit millions of dollars and sent top employees like 
hattori to help with the research 
mit harvard texas aampm and a handful of other top us schools 
are getting enriched by foreign grants and bolstered by foreign 
researchers but critics say the help carries a high price donors 
are taking ideas and knowhow home draining a national resource 
i dont know why we permit it said irwin freest an engineer 
in massapequa park ny who has been campaigning for congress to 
send foreign engineering students packing 
it hurts us because what they do with their grants they take 
the knowledge back and sell us goods which increases our balance of 
trade deficit he said 
foreign companies and governments sponsor about 5 million of 
research a year at mit which has the highest percentage of foreign 
students of any us university onefifth of its total student body 
and onethird of its graduate students are nonus citizens 
two miles up the charles river at harvard foreign sources 
provide about 11 million a year for research in economics 
agriculture medicine and other fields about 6 percent of harvards 
undergraduates and 17 percent of its graduate students are 
foreigners 
alarmed by such statistics freest and others are calling for a 
kind of academic protectionism the erection of barriers to the 
free flow of students and knowledge across borders 
they are not alone similar pressures are building in other 
countries says dorothy zinberg a faculty member at harvards 
kennedy school of government who is preparing a report on the 
subject for the national science foundation 
japan and the netherlands are today the only two countries that 
are actively seeking to increase their numbers of foreign 
students she said in the us in france a bit less so in 
west germany people are very concerned about losing ideas 
zinberg said some us companies are now attaching strings to 
their university grants insisting that no foreigners be allowed to 
work on the research they support in france she said educators 
are subtly excluding foreigners from certain schools 
the university of rochesters graduate business school rescinded 
acceptance of an employee of fuji photo film co ltd after concerns 
were raised by hometown eastman kodak co it later reoffered 
admission but too late 
defenders of the open university see a dire threat in this they 
note that most leading universities in the united states have 
policies requiring all campus research to be freely publishable and 
therefore of at least as much benefit to american companies as to 
foreign ones 
they also say many foreign researchers and graduate students stay 
in the united states strengthening the nations brainpower 
most of all defenders argue that keeping universities open to 
all based only on academic qualifications is part of the universal 
ethic of science insulating ourselves they say will make us less 
competitive not more 
its generally seen today that american universities are among 
the best in the world said john shattuck harvards vice 
president for public afairs our whole higher education system is 
very attractive and its availability to foreign students is an 
asset to american society because they learn american values and 
become familiar with americans and americans are enriched by being 
exposed to them 
nationally less than 1 percent of all university research is 
paid for by foreign money but five big research institutions 
harvard mit texas aampm oregon state university and the university 
of wisconsin together receive more than half of all that money a 
kitty estimated at about 75 million a year 
experts say there are about 1 million students circulating from 
country to country worldwide and the largest number about 350000 
are in the united states more than half are in science and 
technology creating extraordinary imbalances such as the fact that 
foreigners now earn about 60 percent of the doctoral degrees granted 
in engineering by american universities 
like any protectionist move however attempts to restrict 
foreign students or research projects could be met in kind 
if were not careful zinberg said we may one day find our 
students shut out of foreign universities because we have shut them 
out of ours 
the research that foreigners are supporting on american campuses 
runs the gamut from studying aircraft turbines at mit to ocean 
drilling at texas aampm and weather monitoring at the university of 
wisconsin 
but much of the pressure to cut back the foreign presence comes 
from people in a few highly competitive industries such as 
electronics and biotechnology 
of course wed like people to take back skills and knowledge 
and apply them in their own countries especially the third world 
and countries that arent as fortunate as we are said frank lord 
an engineer with gte in san carlos calif and chairman of a 
manpower committee for the institute of electrical and electronic 
engineers 
but taking valuable technology is another matter and its a 
hard line to draw

now that rjr nabisco inc has to pay 3 billion a 
year in interest on takeover debt skeptics are wondering whether 
the research cookies will crumble at the company that makes oreos 
people are scrutinizing the record 25 billion leveraged buyout 
of rjr nabisco to see whether the heavy debts involved in this 
trendy form of takeover will hurt companies spending on new 
technology 
oreos look simple enough but getting them to screw apart the 
same way every time takes advanced engineering and ovens in the 
knowledge economy technology is built invisibly into the most 
unlikely products from ritz bits to salem slims lights which come 
in an eyecatching beveled box 
shortly before the rjr nabisco battle the company told 
stockholders it had upped research and development spending by 19 
percent it called technology the cornerstone of future growth 
since the buyout led by the new york investment firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co rjrs new management says it remains committed 
to research and development but wont say what changes if any will 
be made 
rampd is less important in rjr nabiscos businesses than in say 
computers or pharmaceuticals food and tobacco are two of the 
lowestranking industries in terms of rampd as a percentage of sales 
according to business weeks rampd scoreboard last year 
still analysts say a stunted rampd program could stop the company 
from creating a successful smokeless cigarette a fatfree frozen 
dinner or crumbleproof packaging for cookies 
so far theres little hard evidence to document the effect of 
big buyouts on research contributing to the dearth of information 
is that companies involved in large lbos tend to go private and 
financial figures become scarce 
but there is a growing perception that companies cut back on 
research immediately after a leveraged buyout if thats so 
debtfinanced megadeals could have a big impact on the knowledge 
economy 
whats happening in lbos is that they take on pretty extensive 
debt in the short term they have to make cuts said fred allvine 
a professor in the college of management at georgia institute of 
technology 
very often they try to cut the fat out of personnel then they 
look at research and development the benefits are hard to measure 
its one of the intangibles they cut back because lbos have to be 
concerned with payback in the short run 
rjr nabisco spokeswoman polly howes said research is continuing 
to function there are new products to develop and improvements to 
make but to speculate on what will happen is premature 
the company has major research centers at its nabisco brands 
inc del monte corp and rj reynolds tobacco co divisions 
in its 1987 annual report to shareholders rjr nabisco called 
research and development essential to the future of the company and 
said it had spent 204 million on it in 1987 no figures are 
available for 1988 
much of rjr nabiscos recent research and development has been in 
plant modernization it also sank about 200 million into the 
development of premier the socalled smokeless cigarette that 
bombed in test marketing last year the company has said it will 
keep working on a smokeless cigarette 
the brookings institution the national science foundation the 
university of california at berkeley and the university of chicago 
are among the institutions that have conducted studies looking at 
leveraged buyouts 
legitimate economists are all over the map on this said 
margaret blair senior research analyst at brookings in washington 
a nsf study said growth in corporate research and development 
spending has all but disappeared in the last five years the 
increase in leveraged buyouts has been a major reason the study 
said 
it found a 128 percent decline in research and development 
spending in companies involved in leveraged buyouts but melissa 
pollock of the nsf cautioned against sweeping assumptions based on 
the study noting it looked only at eight small deals for one year 
not enough for definitive conclusions 
a study of leveraged buyouts released earlier this year by 
kohlberg kravis disputed the notion that research suffers but the 
study also said buyouts should not involve companies that require a 
heavy research investment

gideon gartner was one of the first to 
realize that decisionmakers in business wanted more than reams of 
undigested facts and figures they wanted advice from professional 
thinkers 
gartner quit his stock pickers job at oppenheimer amp co a decade 
ago and began offering wall streetstyle insights and 
recommendations to buyers and sellers of computer equipment 
today gartner group is on the leading edge of the knowledge 
economy its considered one of the top computerindustry think 
tanks in the country with a list of 900 clients that includes 49 of 
the top 50 in the fortune 500 
annual revenue has been increasing 50 percent a year and is 
expected to reach 62 million this year 
were in the wisdom business says gartner an alumnus of 
massachusetts institute of technology and international business 
machines corp 
gartner 54 and silverhaired is a native israeli who combines 
courtly european manners with a preference for casual clothes 
he spurns suits and pads around his modern headquarters 
overlooking long island sound in shirt sleeves stylish slacks and 
walking shoes which he is constantly pitching to colleagues as more 
comfortable than their stiffleather dress shoes 
computer companies such as ibm turn to the gartner groups stable 
of 80 wellpaid analysts for insight on what their competitors are 
doing 
major computer users like american express co and pepsico inc 
rely on the gartner group for advice on which computers or software 
to choose whether to lease or buy and whether they are about to pay 
too much for systems that will soon be obsolete or are about to fall 
in price 
we havent bought any turkeys that i am aware of since we 
started using their services said william p dean director of 
technological management services at pepsico 
before gartner came along computerindustry watchers like 
international data corp pretty much restricted themselves to 
publishing encyclopedic reports that didnt provide the distilled 
bottomline advice that top executives needed to make decisions 
said portia isaacson wright of coloradobased future think inc who 
follows the business information publishing industry 
the gartner group now controls an estimated 60 percent of that 
highpriced market gideon gartner says 
gartner had the perfect background to turn the 500 
millionayear business of information publishing upside down 
wright said 
he spent seven years at ibm where he designed systems to measure 
how big blue was faring against competitors before landing on wall 
street where institutional investor magazine rated him the top 
individual securities analyst in the technology field between 1972 
and 1978 
an opera buff gartner abandoned a career as a french horn player 
because it was too much of what he called a lostsoul career to 
suit his engineerfather 
gartner discovered at mit that he didnt really want to be an 
engineer so he stayed on to get his masters degree in business 
from mits sloan school of management 
he really is an extraordinary analyst in just about every 
sense wright said hes highly intuitive in addition to being 
real numbersoriented 
one former colleague tells of the time he and three other gartner 
analysts using company data bases spent most of the night 
calculating the full impact of a recent ibm price cut they 
discovered the next day that gartner had arrived at nearly the same 
figures by himself doodling on a yellow legal pad on a flight back 
from europe 
gideon has more good ideas in 15 minutes than most people have 
in 15 years said thomas j crotty gartners first employee now 
retired hes always got a new ingenious thought gideons 
biggest problem is that he is not an implementer 
clients pay up to several hundred thousand dollars a year for the 
right to attend the gartner groups annual conferences pick its 
analysts brains and peruse any of the 13 analytical bulletins the 
company puts out 
the analysts most of them industry veterans cull information 
from computer users and sellers and boil it into incisive 
assessments during the freewheeling sometimes heated weekly 
meetings 
gartner group was acquired by saatchi amp saatchi of great britain 
the worlds largest advertising agency for 90 million last year 
gartner agreed to stay on as chairman through 1991 and as a 
parttime consultant another four years beyond that his plans are 
uncertain 
i could become an analyst again i do that pretty well he

muscular workers welding the hulls of 
mammoth ships used to symbolize american business might no more 
only a handful of us shipbuilders are left and they are kept 
afloat by navy contracts the rest have fallen victim to lowwage 
competitors in south korea taiwan and brazil and hightech 
subsidized shipyards in japan and west germany 
in a knowledgebased economy the united states may get a second 
chance to compete for commercial shipbuilding contracts at least at 
the hightech end of the industry where american companies can tap 
experience gained from building stateoftheart warships 
its pretty difficult to compete with taiwan if all youre 
doing is welding steel said tom balfour marketing vice president 
for newport news shipbuilding and dry dock co the united states 
largest shipyard wed be strongest on those ships that require a 
greater degree of engineering 
there is little unskilled work left in building ships for the 
navy and shipyard workers are constantly retrained to keep up with 
changing techniques and new equipment 
the us is building the most sophisticated warships in the 
world says mitch steller a maritime consultant in san diego 
that fact he said could be an advantage for sophisticated 
commercial ships as well 
there are limits to the power of knowledge though shipbuilders 
say they also need dollars in the form of government subsidies to 
match those received by shipbuilders in japan and west germany 
the japanese and west germans supply their shipbuilders with 
millions of dollars in lowcost loans research and development 
funding and tax benefits says the shipbuilders council of america 
in washington 
ten years ago the us shipbuilding industry was the fifth 
largest with about 10 percent of the international market but when 
the reagan administration cut subsidies in 1981 shipbuilding 
declined rapidly 
today no commercial ships are built in the united states in the 
years since 1981 41 shipyards have closed and others are foundering 
survivors are the brawn of the business large navy contractors 
able to afford major investments in equipment and technology but 
even those companies are concerned about the impact of expected cuts 
in navy contracts 
a recent study by the commission on merchant marine and defense 
in washington concluded there is clear and growing danger to the 
national security in the deterioration of americas maritime 
industries 
theres not a maritime country in the world that doesnt 
subsidize its shipbuilding balfour said in a world with no 
subsidies we could compete 
the commission calls for government to jumpstart the 
shipbuilding industry by financing the design and construction of 
commercial ships that are also militarily useful and providing 
matching funds for capital improvements of shipyards 
the plan would cost about 13 billion in the next 11 years but 
would add 244 merchant ships to the nations fleets create nearly 
100000 jobs contribute more than 43 billion to the gross national 
product and raise 6 billion in federal taxes the commission 
contends 
the net cost would be less than 6 billion the commission said 
in a report to president bush adding that the possible costs of 
failing to provide adequate sealift would be much greater 
proponents say that without a commercial shipbuilding industry 
the united states does not have enough ships to carry supplies and 
troops in wartime 
they say if the number of shipyards continues to decline there 
will not be a large enough base of facilities suppliers and trained 
workers to meet the countrys military shipbuilding needs 
edward hudgins director of the conservative heritage 
foundations center for international growth in washington disputes 
the need to support a domestic shipbuilding industry 
i just dont see why we would need it if we can buy it 
somewhere else more cheaply hudgins said what were going to 
do is destroy our economy and make ourselves less capable of 
defending ourselves 
this whole idea that defense means being selfsufficient in 
everything is an absolutely ruinous policy he said these 
companies are not looking out for our security theyre looking out 
for themselves

when bill daugherty worked as a motor inspector 
for republic steel corp he didnt go out of his way to stay near 
the bosses 
you really tried to avoid them he said somebody told you 
to do this you did it in five minutes then you went and sat down 
until somebody told you to do something else 
even though he worked on equipment daugherty was forbidden to 
install electrical tubing that was reserved for another craft 
what was standard operating procedure for a united steelworkers 
member in the early 1980s is now history for those like daugherty 
out on the cutting edge of labormanagement relations 
in the emerging knowledge economy people like daugherty are 
valued as much for their grasp of the big picture as for their grip 
on a phillips screwdriver 
the 37yearold ls electrogalvanizing co employee roams the 
plant now repairing anything electrical he is encouraged to learn 
other crafts the company pays his tuition for technical courses 
and as his skills improve so does his pay 
daugherty can make a dollar per hour above the average industry 
wage to around 13 per hour or around 27000 per year production 
bonuses and overtime can push the annual figure to around 40000 
nobody hides from the bosses anymore workers step forward with 
ideas to improve operations at the sheet steel coating plant a 
6040 joint venture of ltv corp and sumitomo metal industries of 
japan in fact employees are paid to meet regularly with their 
managers 
if we dont work with our employees to make them happier and 
get more work out of them were all doomed said ltv steel co 
president david hoag how can you talk about international 
competitiveness when people hate their jobs 
companies such as ls electrogalvanizing are actually ahead of 
the vaunted japanese in labor relations hoag argues 
japanese steel companies havent advanced beyond the quality 
circle an early form of participative management that employees 
here dismiss as a glorified suggestion box 
sumitomo officials had to be coaxed to accept the partnership 
program hoag said 
the japanese are more autocratic than the americans ever were 
they have a lot of ways of eliciting suggestions but in the end 
the talk doesnt mean a thing he said 
the 65 employees of ls electrogalvanizing who produce topgrade 
galvanized sheet for auto body panels are pioneers in a 4yearold 
venture in industrial democracy dawn is breaking on a realm long 
shaded by arrogance mistrust and retribution 
everybody knows whats going on everybody pulls together 
said john gresh 30 who joined the company two years ago 
where the united states once monopolized the worlds steelmaking 
knowhow just about anybody can make steel these days and just 
about everybody is 
whats harder to come by is smart steel the kind ls 
electrogalvanizing produces its made on computercontrolled mills 
in less time by fewer people its freer of defects more precise in 
composition and monotonously true in its dimensions 
smart steel is shaping up as the american steel industrys ticket 
into the 21st century us producers are getting smart with better 
technology new furnaces continuous casters and rolling mills that 
represent the best thinking in metallurgy 
with innovations as simple as changing the way workers and bosses 
talk to one another companies are tapping a longsealed repository 
of profitable information the rankandfile employee 
at ls electrogalvanizing a lone process coordinator is often 
the only manager on hand and that person helps the 12 others on 
duty to operate the highly automated line 
parking spaces are firstcome firstserved locker rooms are 
segregated only by sex there is one dining room no time clock and 
everyone has a key to the tool room 
its like being among your friends at school not one of us 
minds doing cleanup because we pride ourselves on our mill gresh 
said 
management handed the workers a study estimating the price of a 
chemical engineering project at 90000 and the workers did it for 
5000 said operations manager mike mueller our people just 
recognize a problem and take it on 
joint unionmanagement committees can change anything except the 
financial terms of the contract including training requirements for 
new workers and production goals which bear on bonuses 
although decisions are made by consensus there has never been an 
impasse 
work rules are few and simple be there be there on time and 
do what you have to do to complete your assignment said mueller 
now we wrap coils like its christmastime said wes humphrey 
the vice president of steelworkers local 9126 
overall the workers so respect management that union officials 
proposed that the unions superior production bonus plan be extended 
to cover process coordinators the equivalent of frontline foremen 
they work just like us they eat dirt with us they should get 
the gravy with us humphrey said 
participative management emerged in the 1980 contract talks and 
its popularity grew as the industry lost 12 billion from 1982 to 
1986 amid plant closings and the elimintion of more than 100000 
jobs 
ltv corp remains under court protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
ive seen so much heartache and suffering it was too 
disheartening to just look at and not try to do something about 
it said frank valenta a union director

the two biggest steelmakers in bankruptcy court 
are the two that have done the most to involve employees in managing 
plants says a united steelworkers official overseeing programs to 
improve life in the mills 
usw international secretary edgar ball gives the top marks to ltv 
steel co and wheelingpittsburgh steel corp both reorganizing 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws 
he recognized ltv for supporting labor management participation 
teams which give employees new authority to solve production and 
personnel problems 
ltv just worked all out to make that system work and expand 
it ball said in an interview 
ltvs joint venture in cleveland with sumitomo of japan ls 
electrogalvanizing co has an even more progressive arrangement in 
which workers are largely unsupervised 
their freedom responsibility and authority is unmatched among 
major steelmakers and is among the most progressive anywhere ball 
said 
he praised wheelingpittsburgh for its modified system of 
labormanagement teams 
a miniboard of directors staffed equally from management and 
the union oversees operations at the plant and department levels 
on the shop floor task forces do anything from correct malfunctions 
to reorganize production 
other steel companies have not come as far ball said 
armco incs program was rejected by plant and division managers 
he said 
national steel corp has a partnership program on paper but it 
encountered resistance at the plant level he said 
bethlehem steel corp and usx corp have plantlevel programs 
some highly successful but none at the corporate level and the two 
linger near the back of the pack he said 
ussposco industries inc the usx joint venture with pohang of 
south korea has labormanagement participation teams at its 
pittsburg calif plant but nothing approaching the ltvsumitomo 
joint venture said robert guadiana a usw district director for 
california 
inland and nippon of japan are duplicating the ltvsumitomo 
partnership at a joint venture under construction at new carlisle 
ind 50 miles east of gary 
jampl specialty products corp a stainless and alloy steelmaker 
spun off from ltv is out front in the specialty steel industry 
ball said 
a usw local at the companys detroit plant despite internal 
union criticism for cooperating with management has boosted 
productivity through ad hoc teams the company is rewarding workers 
with profitsharing payments that boost annual pay to around 
50000 ball said 
outside steel rockwell international corp began a cooperative 
program with the usw at its new castle pa axle plant after 
announcing plans to close the facility in 1982 and moving one of its 
departments to south carolina 
it worked so well they not only did not shut the plant but 
brought back the department from south carolina ball said 
aluminum co of america negotiated a participative management 
program for a texas plant in 1977 the first such arrangement 
involving the usw ball said 
other programs have been started by xerox corp and the 
amalgamated clothing and textile workers at a rochester ny 
plant and by goodyear tire co at a nonunion plant in lawton okla 
wheelingpitt is enjoying harmony in place of bitter relations 
under its traditional system 
theres been a vast improvement said john kohelis who left 
the companys steubenville ohio rail car repair shop to become a 
fulltime facilitator helping teams carry out projects 
theres greater cooperation better understanding he said 
were doing so well weve broken every major production record in 
wheelingpittsburghs history 
at its best participative management can make diehard union men 
gush with enthusiasm 
i dont care what anybody says if you give the american worker 
the education the equipment and the opportunity well blow anyone 
apart weve got the greatest work ethic of any country in the 
world said tom zidec the 35yearold president of steelworkers 
local 9126 at the ltvsumitomo joint venture ls electrogalvanizing 
do i sound optimistic he said people tell me im too 
happy i dont love this place but its a good job better than 
before

patents the guard dogs of innovation are 
gaining strength and attention as americas first line of defense 
against purloined corporate ingenuity 
an unprecedented number of applications are flooding the us 
patent and trademark office which expects more than 156000 this 
year up 5 percent from last year 
courts are siding more often with holders of patents trademarks 
and copyrights and the phrase intellectual property has entered 
the lexicon of the emerging knowledgebased economy 
why all the interest because american industry from steel to 
clothing to microwave ovens is running scared 
if youre the undisputed leader in some technology patents are 
not that important because you pretty much call the shots thats 
what it was like 30 years ago said michael blommer executive 
director of the american intellectual property law association 
but today the united states has lost its lead in almost every 
technology and patents are becoming much more important thats 
really all you have to protect yourself 
some critics say the pendulum has swung too far toward protecting 
patent and copyright holders stifling progress by preventing 
inventors from building on what has come before 
others say tough patent protection isnt helping the united 
states against technology leaders such as japan and west germany 
eight of the top 10 winners of us patents last year were foreign 
companies 
isnt strengthening the patent system also strengthening the 
nonresidents asked ogden webster director of eastman kodak 
cos patent law department 
one winner in the patent battlefield is corning inc formerly 
known as corning glass works where engineers revolutionized 
communications in 1970 with their invention of optical fibers 
these are hairthin glass fibers that transport voices pictures 
and data on pulses of laser light opticalfiber cables crisscross 
the country and the atlantic and pacific oceans 
corning anticipated billions of dollars in revenue from its 
invention however other companies were eyeing the potential 
market too 
six years after the invention even before much of the world was 
convinced of the usefulness of cornings creation the company found 
itself trying to enforce its patents 
corning sued american dutch and japanese competitors it even 
sued the us government for buying fiber from a competitor from 
july 1976 until earlier this year the company was immersed in 
patent enforcement lawsuits 
the company won numerous settlements but sumitomo electric 
industries ltd of japan remained a holdout the japanese company 
even built a factory in research triangle park nc to make fibers 
corning won a court order in october 1987 forcing sumitomo to 
stop making optical fiber at its north carolina plant sumitomo was 
allowed to make cable but had to get the fiber for it from a 
competitor 
the damage portion of the patent infringement trial is pending 
today corning is the dominant producer 
corning is a believer in the patent system its very much a 
part of its research activity to see it working is good said al 
michaelsen cornings chief patent lawyer 
the corning experience is one that politicians and government 
officials like to hear 
as we look to the future our ability to compete successfully 
is going to depend on our brainpower not our brawn said michael 
kirk assistant commissioner for external affairs at the us patent 
and trademark office 
a report by the us international trade commission last year 
estimated us companies lose between 43 billion and 61 billion a 
year because of inadequate foreign protection of intellectual 
property 
singapore taiwan and thailand reportedly have begun to cleanse 
their reputations as piracy havens but south korea is still a major 
offender the commission says 
companies must apply for patents in each country where they want 
protection rules differ for instance italy refuses to grant 
patents to new drugs 
japans patent office takes five years on average to issue a 
patent vs about 1 years in the united states says donald j 
quigg us commissioner of patents and trademarks 
an american inventor awaiting a patent in japan has little legal 
protection and therefore is almost forced to share the technology 
with competitors through crosslicensing agreements quigg complains 
it is much easier for japanese companies to get patents in the 
united states for example hitachi ltd won more us patents last 
year than any american company 
kirk is helping negotiate minimum patent standards in trade talks 
involving 100 nations and said he is hopeful an agreement can be 
reached by the end of 1990 
in this country perhaps the biggest development came in 1982 
with the creation of a federal appeals court in washington devoted 
solely to intellectual property disputes 
this court has really turned toward lowering the standard of 
patentability and upholding patents said kodaks webster he 
should know the court rejected kodaks appeal of a guilty verdict 
in a suit by polaroid corp that forced it out of instant 
photography 
by aggressively enforcing its patent rights texas instruments 
inc earned almost as much in royalties in 1987 191 million as 
it did from operations last year royalties accounted for a quarter 
of its profits 
lotus development corp and apple computer inc are facing 
criticism for heavyhanded protection of patents on the look and 
feel of their products such as the lotus 123 spreadsheet 
to critics patents protecting look and feel are the 
equivalent of a patent by general motors corp protecting the 
arrangement of the steering wheel brake and gas pedals on a car 
reflecting the turmoil twothirds of big companies in the united 
states canada and europe are enmeshed in litigation over 
intellectual property rights a conference board survey estimates

an inventive college dropout with a knack 
for pleasing customers has shown 3m co it doesnt take a lab full 
of moleculeminded phds to blaze trails in technology 
frank marentic earned his science degree on the workbench 
tinkering his way into the automotive design industry and giving 3m 
a foothold there with 18 years of creative work in detroit 
he also invented a dragreduction film known as riblets that 
helped speed stars amp stripes to victory in the 1986 americas cup 
yacht race a public relations dream for the 105 billion 
diversified manufacturer 
hes the last of a breed said clem nelson vice president of 
3ms automotive systems division i dont think 3m will happen to 
see another one like him everyone we hire today is from the 
classroom 
marentic 57 is cherished by 3m for his ability to create the 
hot swatch a rough handmade sample of an emerging product 
hes got great hands said william klein technical director 
of the industrial tape division at 3m a lot of people have ideas 
but we need someone to reduce them to practice 
once an idea is reduced to a swatch customers can seek 
refinements or quickly drop the idea cutting development costs by 
shortening the gestation process or sparing the company the expense 
of making duds 
speed and low cost are important even in research the lifeblood 
of the knowledge economy 
3m the minnesota mining amp manufacturing co spends about 65 
percent of its revenue on research and development more than the 
industry average last year it totaled 689 million 
research and development is an investment but they only want 
to invest a minimum amount of money for a maximum return said 
terry morris a senior development engineer at 3m who has worked 
under marentic since he moved back to the companys maplewood 
headquarters in 1983 
marentic said he has a practical streak that makes 3ms financial 
restraints easier to accept but even in the leanest years he said 
he has been able to cut loose on risky ventures 
riblets for example was born from an initial 600 to 1000 
expense that allowed marentic to meet with navy researchers who had 
theorized that a microscopically fine sawtooth surface could reduce 
drag and save fuel marentic gave the theory life when he suggested 
using a plastic adhesive to create the effect instead of the metal 
envisioned by the navy 
he unsuccessfully tried to apply it to cars during the energy 
crisis and was selling the idea to airplane manufacturers when stars 
amp stripes called 
the 2 months he spent in australia to babysit the yachts hull 
were one of the crowning achievements of his career and two years 
later he received 3ms highest honor the carlton award for career 
contributions in research 
riblets hasnt made money for 3m but marentic still champions it 
as a potential revenue giant because airplane makers are toying with 
it 
if i wouldnt have done this i would have gone into music 
said marentic a former trumpet player whose brother james is a 
professional jazz artist i like the creativity one has in jazz 
what i do is an extension of that 
nelson said marentic is a rarity because he rose to division 
scientist after joining 3m in 1955 as an entrylevel technician he 
had found the university of minnesota boring and quit during his 
freshman year only to be inspired to pursue a scientific career by 
his first 3m boss dick drew the inventor of scotch tape 
we spent up to 15 percent of our time pursuing things that 
were not related to our job function marentic said we were 
allowed to create 
in detroit from 1968 to 1983 marentic headed a research lab that 
gained the respect of automakers for adding decorative touches to 
car bodies one of his first successes was the horseshoeshaped 
stripe on the side of fords 1967 mustang he struck gold for 3m and 
pontiac by developing a strong costefficient technology to 
emblazon the firebird emblem on the cars hood 
i think gm made about 11 million off that car and we made a 
little bit ourselves marentic said 
jeff janssen a senior chemist at 3m said marentic has a hidden 
talent for sales because he gleans information from customers to 
find out what they really want 
but janssen agreed with others that marentics greatest asset is 
his practical creativity 
the molecule guys get too hung up on what they cant do 
janssen said that doesnt stop frank

when prosperity depends on ideas 
higherlearning institutions such as the university of michigan 
become as important as gritty factory towns were during the 
industrial revolution 
corporate research facilities crowding northeast ann arbor are 
proof that knowledge today equals power and profits and college 
towns arent placid bystanders in the brainsoverbrawn brawl 
in recessionary chills of years past manufacturingheavy 
michigan caught economic pneumonia when people delayed big 
purchases like cars michigan shut down it happened in the last 
downturn pushing the states jobless rate as high as 173 percent 
in december 1982 
michigan is hoping to use high technology to diversify the 
economy and avoid that jobless jolt the next time a recession comes 
at the same time theres a statewide effort to make michigans big 
factories more competitive 
success will mean other regions look to michigan for lessons 
state commerce director doug ross said 
with the university of michigan in the lead ann arbor is a major 
source of the technology to restore michigans manufacturing might 
research facilities now dot the university area and form a 
40mile automation alley along interstate 94 from ann arbor to 
detroit their success is reflected in state job figures 
employment that hovered around 35 million jobs in 1982 topped 4 
million in 1986 and has ranged around 43 million in 1989 the 
highest ever recorded in michigan 
the number of jobless which reached 749000 in december 1982 
has dipped below 300000 in two months this year for the first time 
since 1978 seasonally adjusted employment rates from the us 
bureau of labor statistics have dropped as low as 61 percent 
the muchmaligned rust belt starts with innate advantages built 
up over time and sometimes not appreciated until a company moves 
said j downs herold who manages the universitys industrial 
development research program 
what you have here are a lot of little tool and die shops and 
model makers herold said the amount of expertise that exists 
among these places in heattreating sandblasting the ability to 
bend and mold metals of all types thats an infrastructure you 
dont just start out and build 
it may seem worthwhile at first to move elsewhere for lower 
labor costs for example herold said but when you need something 
special you dont just run down the street and say i wonder if 
charlie can do that its probably the same thing if youre out in 
california and want to develop a new electronic chip 
to add the advanced technology edge the universitys college of 
engineering emphasizes research contracts with auto chemical 
electronics computer and aerospace companies including general 
motors corp ford motor co chrysler corp and dow chemical co 
said robert w schneider director of corporate relations at the 
college 
students pursue realworld investigations in their area of 
interest and the research provides material for phd theses 
sometimes research leads to postgraduate employment 
one gm project with the college led to a computer software system 
that reschedules plant operations in case of an equipment breakdown 
to keep turning out the mostneeded products 
gm has similar programs with other schools such as rensselaer 
polytechnic institute in troy ny massachusetts institute of 
technology in cambridge mass and stanford university in palo 
alto calif 
gm assigns experienced engineers usually with advanced degrees 
to work with the students said jim caie director of advanced 
manufacturing engineering at gm 
we certainly arent dummies we are really in most cases on the 
cutting edge of technology he said we need to leverage 
ourselves as much as possible get good people from the 
universities helping us we cant do it all ourselves 
the university of michigans intellectual properties office has 
expanded from one parttime staffer 10 years ago to 10 people today 
its royalty income from faculty inventions rose 66 percent in 1987 
and another 10 percent last year to 850000 
what youre finding is that intellectual property issues are 
becoming increasingly important in american business said bob 
gavin director of the office that is a function of the united 
states recognizing that it has to protect its knowledge because that 
is the basis of its future economy 
patented items include a fluid that gets thicker or thinner 
depending on an electrical charge applied to it 
auto companies are vitally interested in how it could be used in 
hydraulics said frederick h reinhart jr marketing director of 
the intellectual properties office 
besides ideas ann arbor has also become the home of an awful 
lot of new industries where people get an idea and spin something 
off said herold the university industrial development official 
in a coup with a ripple effect the university also helped lure 
the us environmental protection agencys auto emissions laboratory 
that led to establishment of a string of laboratories by auto 
companies especially importers that wanted to tinker with cars 
failing to meet us emissions requirements without taking them home

chris peters stretched for words as he 
tried to describe how he makes his living 
its hard to even explain sometimes what youre thinking when 
youre writing a program said peters a software developer for 
microsoft corp youre not thinking in english its hard even to 
describe the thought process 
you actually are the computer at the point youre writing the 
program 
whether or not he can articulate it peters can do it hes one 
of just 12 computer programmers who work on the microsoft excel 
spreadsheet program 
the bookkeeping program is one of microsofts key products its 
weapon for capturing market share from lotus development corps 
123 the bestselling spreadsheet program 
as much as any modern product software epitomizes what is meant 
by the knowledge economy 
microsoft and other software companies physical products are but 
a few dollars worth of magnetic tape or disks a manual and a 
catchy package 
what people pay for is the computer code the abstraction of a 
physical process such as recordkeeping that allows a computer and 
its operator to do complex functions in split seconds 
the raw materials are the ideas of the companies programmers and 
engineers marketers and managers its what their people know and 
how well they can express it that brings in the money 
founded just 15 years ago by william gates and paul allen 
microsoft is now the largest company specializing in personal 
computer software 
gates and allen also provided an informationage legend a couple 
of college kids who wrote a language program for a computer they 
read about in an electronics magazine and turned that asset into a 
corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
gates stock made him the youngest selfmade billionaire ever 
programmers all over the country working at the kitchen table or 
small offices still try to emulate gates but in the big leagues 
where programs can reach 450000 lines of computer code making 
software has long since expanded from a onebrain concoction 
at microsofts headquarters in a firshaded suburban seattle 
office park the workfloor for excel is a long hallway lined with 
compact offices the wing has the atmosphere of graduate student 
cubicles in a large university if theres a college where students 
can afford bmws 
down the hall is a room with pinball and video games standard 
office decor is mounds of paper and three to six personal computers 
one programmer eddy fries has turned an old computer monitor into 
a tropical fishbowl 
the flip side of the frisbees and amateur jugglers who come out 
on nice days is an intensity where arguments and egos can flare and 
work can go on around the clock to make deadlines 
thats what comes in a company where the norm is neargenius 
level and not just in smarts but in creativity and everything 
else peters said 
if you love what youre doing and people say oh but youre 
at work all the time well yeah right this is fun right 
peters 31 joined the company in 1981 as the 100th employee and 
is now about 40th in seniority in a company that employs about 3800 
what keeps him he said is that microsoft and gates himself a 
programmer treat software writers like prima donnas 
stewart alsop publisher of the industry newsletter pc letter 
agrees while microsoft executives may give speeches about the need 
for industry standards alsop says that doesnt stop their own 
developers from violating the rules if the program demands it 
they focus on the very essentials of software does it do what 
people want it to do 
microsoft assigns far fewer programmers to a team than do other 
software giants where lotus has 12 to more than 30 programmers 
working on versions of 123 microsofts 12member team creates all 
three forms of excel for apple macintosh msdos and os2 
operating systems plus foreign translations 
although lotus teams are larger frank ingari vice president 
for lotus personal spreadsheet computer division agrees you cant 
get quality by designing by committee 
no matter how many are on the team you find a small number who 
are the actual architects he said 
peters said 95 percent of writing the intricate code that makes a 
program work is simply an individual programmer staring at a screen 
puzzling it out until the solution comes hell sit there and 
hell think real hard and he might walk around the halls he might 
find some guy and corner him and just talk at him 
hallways are a big deal at microsoft peters said you work 
privately but together its kind of weird 
though programmers build new features on blocks of code written 
before and may use programs to edit and search code for bugs 
peters doesnt put much faith in programs that claim to actually 
write software 
no we do it the oldfashioned way i mean what kind of junk 
would be generated by a machine 
in a way peters said writing software is like designing a 
building bad code is an awful bit of carpentry that wont hold 
the roof up its also like mastering a foreign language it 
takes a few years to even know how to read the stuff and know that 
its good 
or maybe he said its like composing music 
the stuff can be very beautiful and the funny thing the user 
never sees it peters said you can look at someones code and 
it will flow there will just be this elegance to it

the dollar ended mostly higher in europe on 
wednesday on buying before thursdays release of us trade figures 
for april which were expected to show an improvement 
gold prices also rose 
dealers said they saw buying interest in the dollar before the 
us trade figures which were expected to show the trade gap 
narrowing to 82 billion from 89 billion in march 
but dealers said trading conditions were erratic throughout the 
day as a spate of rumors swept the currency markets 
the most pervasive rumor was that japans finance ministry had 
called in some japanese institutional investors to hold back on 
dollarbuying though subsequently denied by the ministry the story 
helped the yen 
dealers said favorable us trade figures would likely encourage 
further dollar buying perhaps helping the us currency through key 
resistance levels

paramount communications inc boss martin s 
davis showed with a dramatic offer for time inc that the folks who 
gave us the indiana jones movies can jolt the takeover world 
with some hairraising stunts 
davis waited until there were 2 weeks left before time was to 
vanish into an embrace with warner communications inc before 
launching paramounts unsolicited 107 billion tender offer for 
time 
the bid enraged time executives sent wall streeters into a 
speculative buying frenzy and forced time shareholders to weigh 
where their loyalties lay 
in a stinging letter times chairman and chief executive j 
richard munro said davis bid smacks more of spite than 
strategy 
youve changed the name of your corporation but not its 
character its still engulf and devour munro wrote his 
counterpart at the company that until only recently had been called 
gulf amp western inc 
the move put the normally mediashy davis in the middle of a 
battle for one of the most revered companies in the american media 
business he declined to be interviewed for this story 
unlike many entertainment executives davis shuns the celebrity 
spotlight he likes riding horses tinkering with classic cars and 
practicing photography associates say and lives quietly in 
connecticuts affluent fairfield county with his second wife luella 
but he can be tough in the boardroom he was part of a group of 
outside directors at rjr nabsico inc who resisted a 17 billion 
managementled buyout offer for the company and got shareholders 25 
billion instead 
davis was born feb 5 1927 in the bronx he quit high school but 
eventually returned to get his diploma he started in the 
entertainment business as a teenage office boy for movie mogul 
samuel goldwyn 
later he worked as a publicity agent for the allied artists 
studio and joined paramount pictures in 1958 as a director of sales 
and marketing he rose to be chief operating officer 
gulf amp western acquired paramount pictures in 1966 and davis 
moved to the parent company three years later he was a top 
lieutenant to chairman charles bluhdorn 
those were the days when conglomerates were fashionable in 
corporate america epitomized by the farflung corpocracy bluhdorn 
had assembled 
gulf amp western owned companies that made cigars clothes 
bedding auto parts hydraulic presses and coinoperated videogames 
it owned sugargrowing operations in the dominican republic a pair 
of horse race tracks and a 900 million securities portfolio 
it also had operations in entertainment finance and publishing 
and these would form the core of the company after bluhdorn died of 
a heart attack while returning from the dominican republic on feb 
19 1983 
the board of directors selected davis as chief executive over two 
other likely successors to bluhdorn five days later 
irwin schloss head of the securities firm marcus schloss amp co 
inc and a gulf amp western board member for 28 years said bluhdorn 
had recognized that the street did not appreciate what he had 
built and put together and had begun the divestment process 
but davis accelerated it presiding over one of the most 
extensive corporate dissections ever 
he liquidated the stock portfolio from march 1983 through 1984 
in august 1983 the company began selling 50 businesses with 
about 13 billion in sales that failed to meet davis performance 
standards the sales produced about 360 million by 1984 
davis sold the sugargrowing business for 200 million in january 
1985 and the consumer and electrical products group for about 1 
billion that fall he sold them because they were cyclical required 
substantial capital or faced intensifying foreign competition 
even as the sales were proceeding davis began a stock repurchase 
program that retired nearly 46 million shares he bought publishing 
companies like the college textbook publisher prenticehall inc 
movie theaters he got the company more heavily involved in cable 
and broadcast television 
the companys stock price is now trading near 60 vs 9 the day 
before bluhdorn died 
its earnings have more than doubled to 3847 million or 321 a 
share for 1988 compared with 1686 million or 109 a share in 
1982 
in april davis disclosed plans to sell associates first capital 
corp taking the company out of the financial services business to 
concentrate on publishing and entertainment the sale is expected to 
generate 3 billion or more that may be used in the battle for time 
aides said davis made the choice to stay with publishing and 
entertainment because of the longlasting profit potential of books 
tv and movies 
davis points to paramounts star trek program that enjoyed a 
short run on network tv in 1960s but has spawned books five 
movies tv syndication revenue and a new syndicated series 
securities analysts who follow paramount had expected davis to 
buy something big following disclosure of plans to sell the 
associates a step that he has called the culmination of a 
sixyear strategic transformation 
they got it with paramounts 175ashare bid for time on june 7 
only 16 days before time and warner shareholders were to vote on the 
proposed time warner merger 
if davis succeeds hell have a 76 billion company bigger than 
foreign media giants such as bertelsmann of germany hachette of 
france and news corp of australia 
the buyout would come at some cost to shareholders davis told 
securities analysts paramount would have no earnings for two years 
and significantly lower dividends if the proposed takeover went 
through 
but he said the chance to buy time represents a 
onceinalifetime opportunity to maximize paramount communications 
longterm potential

the 12 european community countries wednesday 
failed to give their final agreement on regulations directing their 
future single market for television programs 
at least five countries including germany holland and belgium 
disagreed with the socalled television without borders 
directive that was being submitted for final adoption a new 
discussion of the project was scheduled for next month 
the ec had adopted the draft directive by a majority in a first 
reading two months ago but some european artists and producers have 
since expressed concern that the proposal could result in the 
invasion of american and japanese tv programs 
the initial draft had set the limit of noneuropean programs 
shown on european screens to 40 percent of all programs but the 
ceiling had later been dropped under the pressure of more liberal 
countries

consumers are losing confidence in the nations 
financial institutions and their skepticism is rising about the 
governments ability to handle the problem and protect their 
deposits according to a survey released wednesday 
the survey sponsored by the banking consulting firm alex 
sheshunoff amp co also found a widespread belief that the nations 
thrift crisis will raise personal income taxes and push more banks 
and sampls into foreign ownership 
only 67 percent of the people surveyed last week said they 
trusted what financial institutions said about their safety and 
soundness a similar survey in march found 84 percent believed what 
the institutions told them 
during the same period the level of respondents who believed 
what the government told them about the safety of financial 
institutions fell to 39 percent from 48 percent 
even federal deposit insurance is questioned 28 percent polled 
worry about losing money in a financial institution even though it 
is insuredsaid sheshunoff that compared with 18 percent in the 
march survey 
the survey was conducted last week in random telephone interviews 
with 308 people nationwide and 308 in texas california and new 
york the maximum sampling error was plus or minus 56 percent 
among other survey results 
59 percent of the respondents believed troubled thrifts should 
be shut down 
70 percent blamed bad judgment not fraud for the thrift 
industrys problems however 77 percent said the government has not 
been tough enough in its prosecution 
84 percent said banks and thrifts should be regulated in the 
same way 
47 percent said they knew of the bush administrations plan 
currently being debated in congress to bail out the thrift 
industry however 48 percent of those who knew about the plan said 
they didnt think the plan would solve the industrys problems 
78 percent of the respondents said the thrift crisis would 
result in foreigners buying more banks and sampls 73 percent said it 
would raise personal income taxes 62 percent said it would limit 
business growth and 47 percent said it would cause their home to 
decline in value 
8 percent named the thrift crisis as the nations most important 
problem with the federal deficit topping the list at 42 percent 
followed by the trade deficit and congressional ethics problems 
although much of the thrift industrys problems have been in the 
southwest and texas slightly fewer texans worry about losing money 
than the national average 28 percent nationally compared with 26 
percent in texas 
texans have had more experience with financial institutions 
that have been closed sheshunoff said this personal experience 
may have shown them that they wont lose their money 
but at the same time 13 percent of texans have withdrawn money 
from banks or thrifts due to the problems in financial institutions 
compared with 11 percent elsewhere

a private annual survey rating state manufacturing 
climates got a cool reception wednesday from some critics who say 
it inaccurately forecasts which locales could attract and maintain 
big business 
state officials in california for example which got a no 22 
ranking among the nations 29 top manufacturing states were 
unimpressed with the 10th annual survey by the international 
accounting firm grant thornton 
you cant compare a major global economic power california 
with nebraska north dakota or even wilmington delaware said 
tony quinn director of research for californias department of 
commerce 
in the thornton survey released wednesday delaware replaced new 
hampshire as no 1 in manufacturing climate among 
manufacturingintensive states new hampshire fell to no 3 behind 
virginia 
peter praetz manager of the survey said delaware topped the 
list because of its skilled work force wage levels and government 
policies toward manufacturing 
among the 21 lower manufacturingoutput states north dakota was 
first in manufacturing climate due to its low labor costs and good 
quality of life followed in order by south dakota and nebraska 
the rankings were based on 21 factors in five categories state 
and local fiscal policies unemployment benefits and workers 
compensation levels labor costs energy costs and work hours lost 
because of strikes and quality of life 
but praetz acknowledged that states such as new hampshire 
vermont and mississippi which all usually rank high in the survey 
and all are in this years top 10 among highmanufacturing states 
have not become manufacturing giants 
and some states ranked low on the list including no 21 illinois 
and california have had significant growth in manufacturing in the 
past year he said 
the survey designated 29 states as manufacturing intensive 
because they have exceeded the national average in manufacturing 
shipments or workers over the last four years according to 
thorntons 205page report the remaining 21 states have lighter 
concentrations of manufacturing under the same criteria the report 
said 
the survey found new hampshire had the best government fiscal 
policies and mississippi had the nations lowest wages 
hawaii and alaska were included for the first time in the survey 
which carries a 50 pricetag the states both in the low 
manufacturing intensity category were 13th and 19th respectively 
the report was criticized by ford harding of chicagobased phamph 
fantus inc a consulting firm that finds new locations for offices 
research laboratories and distribution centers 
the study has little if any value harding said in a 
telephone interview from new york some of the specific statistics 
used in the study do have merit 
harding said companies that are trying to relocate have varying 
concerns a company with a lot of capital may be worried about real 
estate costs while a business with a lot of employees may be 
interested in labor expenses 
each company will have a somewhat different mix he said 
trying to use something generic defeats what is important to the 
company 
quinn said many important elements of the manufacturing climate 
in california were overlooked in the thornton survey the fact that 
the state graduates 200000 students a year has more scientists and 
engineers than any other state and is home to a third of the 
nations hightech manufacturing 
but praetz said the study simply was designed to compare states 
one of the main feedbacks we get is it keeps the concerns of 
manufacturers available to people he said the study is also 
used by state development agencies and manufacturers to look at 
conditions in their states and compare them to other states

said the sales pace was higher than he expected but he said 
nonetheless that incentives are having a less pronounced effect on 
sales 
the surge that you got this time got sales up temporarily 
healy said you used to get a spike when these things came out and 
now its a yawn 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp had new 
incentive programs in effect in early june replacing those that 
began in april but they apparently failed to attract a significant 
number of buyers over last year when sales ran a little below what 
proved to be the annual trend 
fords earlyjune car sales rose while sales at gm and chrysler 
fell conversely light truck sales rose at gm and chrysler and fell 
at ford 
so far this year car and truck sales by the eight domestic 
makers were running 33 percent behind the pace of last year the 
secondbest sales year on record 
ford said its early june car sales were up 52 percent going to 
an average rate of 6834 this year from 6496 last year light truck 
sales during the period were 39 percent behind last year 
for the year fords car sales were off 08 percent and truck 
sales were down 29 percent 
gm said its car sales in early june were 07 percent below last 
years going to a daily rate of 11113 from 11191 truck sales 
during the period ran 38 percent ahead of last year 
gms car sales through june 10 this year were 85 percent behind 
last year and truck sales were off 13 percent 
chryslers average sales of 2880 cars a day during early june 
were down 67 percent from last years 3087 chryslers trucks sold 
in early june at a rate 46 percent above the 1988 period 
chryslers car sales so far this year were off 139 percent but

texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil gained 89

1870 a barrel 
among refined products july heating oil rose 107 cents to 4565 
cents a gallon contracts for delivery later in the year also 
advanced 
unleaded gasoline futures meanwhile ended the day mixed the 
contract for july delivery remained unchanged at 5992 cents a 
gallon contracts for delivery through november declined while 
later contracts rose slightly 
analysts attributed the gains in west texas intermediate futures 
to continued strong demand in the face of tightening supplies and to 
technical factors and weekly inventory statistics from the american 
petroleum institute 
the api report released after the close of trading tuesday 
showed that crude stocks fell 29 million barrels last week to 
34194 million barrels 
the july crude contract also got a boost from buyers anticipating 
the contracts expiration next tuesday brokers said

barrels last week while total gasoline stocks were down 941000 
barrels 
analysts said a decline in demand for unleaded gasoline from some 
overseas markets helped dampen prices 
gasoline is under pressure partly because the european market 
is amply supplied said randall rothenberg energy broker with 
dean witter reynolds inc

a forecast for warmer drier weather in the midwest sent buyers 
swarming back to the grain markets wednesday giving corn and 
soybean futures prices their biggest oneday boost in nearly 10 
months 
it was exciting said pat oconnell an analyst with 
chicagobased refco inc who watched the feverish trading from the 
floor of the chicago board of trade 
on other markets crudeoil futures surged on supply jitters 
precious metals advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
soybeans for july delivery on the board of trade soared the 
permitted daily limit of 30 cents a bushel shortly before the close 
but finished with a gain of 28 cents at 729 a bushel other 
soybean contracts settled 17 cents to 21 cents higher 
the strongest corn contract for july 1990 delivery settled 9 
cents higher just cent shy of the daily limit in that market 
other contracts advanced from 3 cents to 9 cents with the price for 
july 1989 delivery settling at 256 a bushel 
for both commodities the gains marked the sharpest singleday 
rally since last aug 24 when the grain markets were reeling from 
the worst midwestern drought in 50 years 
wheat settled 1 cent to 6 cents higher with july at 398 a 
bushel oats were 5 cents to 5 cents higher with july at 167 a 
bushel 
experts cited a slew of supportive factors but agreed that the 
catalyst for the rally was tuesdays 30day national weather service 
forecast predicting warmer drier weather in the corn belt through 
midjuly 
corn and soybean prices had been dropping steadily since early 
may as spring rains washed away fears of a second year of drought 
obviously a lot of people in the trade believe the market was 
overdone on the downside and were looking for some excuse to buy 
said walter spilka a grainmarket analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york 
other bullish fundamentals including signs of strong export 
demand and a producerled attempt to shut down brazilian soybean 
sales as an economic protest just added more fuel to the fire 
spilka said 
a national weather service sixto10day forecast issued after 
wednesdays close predicted warmer and drierthannormal conditions 
in the midwest during the middle of next week 
despite the recent rain soil moisture remains low in some parts 
of the corn belt most notably in southern iowa 
if we continue to jeopardize the crop with these weather 
forecasts we could probably take november beans now around 
645 a bushel out toward 670 said oconnell and who 
knows if the weather gets inflammatory we could go a lot higher 
crude oil for nearterm delivery spurted above 20 a barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange on supply jitters linked to 
tuesdays weekly american petroleum institute report of a 
29millionbarrel drawdown in us stocks 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents to 89 cents 
higher with july at 2023 a barrel heating oil was 73 cent to 
107 cents higher with july at 4565 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 44 cent lower to 02 cent higher with july at 5992 
cents a gallon 
gold edged up for the second straight day on new yorks commodity 
exchange settling 60 cents to 70 cents higher with august at 
36750 a troy ounce silver finished 3 cents to 31 cents higher 
with july at 528 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures were mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange as traders turned cautious ahead of fridays monthly 
agriculture department tally of cattle on feed in the seven largest 
producer states 
live cattle settled 02 cent lower to 45 cent higher with june

urging americans to come experience glasnost 
the soviet national airline aeroflot is launching its first major 
marketing campaign in the united states 
aeroflot the worlds largest airline said wednesday it 
increased its flights from new york and washington to moscow from 
five a week to eight as of june 5 the soviets said they also plan 
to build about 25 new hotels in the next two years to handle the 
increase in foreign tourists 
to make the plan work airline officials told a news conference 
aeroflot also would have to work to improve its reputation for bad 
service and inefficiency 
it was difficult or terrible before to reach aeroflot by 
phone said george terentiev commercial manager for aeroflot in 
the united states 
aeroflot recognizes we have a way to go to earn your 
confidence he said unlike donald trump we know its hard to 
build a great airline overnight 
some 125000 americans visited the soviet union last year up 
from 110000 in 1987 and 25000 in 1980 when relations between the 
two countries hit a low point according to anatoly matytsin us 
general manager for intourist the soviet tourism organization 
aeroflot officials told a news conference they plan to start an 
advertising campaign in us travel publications and national 
newspapers later this year the airline has set up a new us 
reservation center and a tollfree telephone line for booking 
aeroflot flights and rooms at the ukraine hotel in moscow 
about a year ago aeroflot and pan am corp started jointly 
operating nonstop flights on boeing 747s between new york and 
moscow four of the eight weekly flights now available to moscow are 
operated by the joint venture the other four two from new york to 
moscow and two from washington to moscow are run by aeroflot on 
sovietmade ilyushin62 aircraft 
roundtrip economyclass tickets from new york to moscow cost 
about 1000 if purchased at least 21 days in advance it normally 
takes about two weeks to get a soviet tourist visa 
terentievs joking reference to trump the billionaire developer 
who purchased eastern airlines northeast shuttle service 
characterized the atmosphere at aeroflots news conference there 
the soviets tried to appear both fun and businessminded possibly 
trying to dispel the stereotype of grim forbidding soviet 
bureaucrats 
we discovered the american marketing concept terentiev said 
he said aeroflot was undertaking its new initiative in the spirit 
of consumerdriven free enterprise and the notsogentle prodding of 
our leader mikhail gorbachev 
the soviets werent as forthcoming with background facts about 
the airline or its marketing they declined to reveal how much 
aeroflot plans to spend on its us advertising which is being 
handled by kelley swofford advertising of miami 
when asked the size of aeroflots fleet and the number of 
employees vladimir kourkov the airlines general manager for north 
america shrugged and replied no one really knows 
who needs to count terentiev said 
kourkov did say aeroflot carried 124 million passengers and 33 
million tons of cargo last year to 3600 destinations in the soviet 
union and around the world 
their marketing awareness has soared with their joint venture 
with pan am said susan kelley president of kelley swofford 
service will be top on their list of priorities and a special 
effort will be made to attract us business travelers ms kelley 
said

speculators gave the dollars early summer rally 
a fresh push wednesday in advance of a government report thursday on 
the us trade deficit 
the rally gained strength late in the day after wavering in asian 
and european trading the dollar soared past 203 west german marks 
in spite of attempts by the federal reserve to keep it below that 
level through dollar sales 
to be short dollars these days is like committing suicide 
said gary lutnick a currency trader at banco di sicilia in new york 
since the end of april the dollar has risen 13 percent against 
the japanese yen 8 percent against the west german mark and 11 
percent against the british pound 
the rally has broken a long period of relative stability and 
brought the dollar back to levels of 1987 and late 1986 
the strong dollar increases the spending power of americans 
money but could hurt the economy in the long run by making 
americanmade goods more expensive in world markets worsening the 
us trade deficit the dollars ascent in the early 1980s partly 
was blamed for throwing american factory workers out of their jobs 
fueling the dollars rise wednesday was speculation that the 
commerce department would report an april merchandise trade deficit 
of 6 billion to 8 billion down from 89 billion in march said 
john lyman a senior currency dealer for the bank of tokyo in new 
york 
it would take more than a year for the full impact of the 
dollars recent rise to show up in deteriorating trade figures 
speculators accumulated dollars for their own accounts wednesday 
hoping they would rise in value because of a favorable trade report 
lyman said 
however the bloated dollar holdings could send the market lower 
if the trade deficit turned out to be much larger than expected and 
speculators sold the currency

saatchi amp saatchi plc the worlds largest 
advertising group said wednesday its aftertax profit sank 72 
percent in the first half of the year because of higher costs and a 
sluggish ad market 
the company also said it was considering selling its consulting 
business which analysts said could fetch between 380 million and 
456 million 
saatchi said aftertax profit in the six months ended march 31 
fell to 106 million pounds or 16 million from 378 million 
pounds in the same period a year earlier 
pershare profit came to 1 penny or 15 cents vs 222 pence a 
year earlier 
the latest results reflected an exceptional loss of 29 million 
pounds or 44 million as a result of charges for reorganization 
costs saatchi said 
pretax profit fell 57 percent to 229 million pounds or 35 
million from 535 million pounds a year earlier 
sixmonth sales rose 8 percent to 206 billion pounds or 31 
billion from 19 billion pounds a year earlier 
the company said that costs in the group have been growing 
ahead of revenues and are too high particularly in a period of 
slower advertising growth 
over the last six months the company conducted a largescale 
reorganization under which 40 units were merged during this 
process cost control weakened as managers concentrated on welding 
businesses together saatchi said 
now the company said it can turn its attention to operational 
management and cost control measures 
saatchi said it recently received some unsolicited approaches 
concerning its consulting unit 
although there were good growth prospects in consulting the 
company said it was inappropriate under current market conditions 
to maintain our aim for world market leadership in this sector 
saatchi said it also would investigate the possibility of 
floating the consultancy business as a separate publicly listed 
company 
consulting trading profits fell to 77 million pounds or 12 
million during the six months from 88 million pounds a year 
earlier while trading profit from the communications unit dipped to 
223 million pounds or 34 million from 418 million pounds 
trading profit is earnings before taxes and exceptional charges 
saatchi said it expects a strong recovery in the second half 
of its fiscal year but that 1989 would remain a tough year

the bush administration has decided to attack 
japanese trade barriers to us forest products on a broader front 
than initially indicated two congressmen said wednesday 
rep ron wyden dore and sen bob packwood rore said they 
the us trade representatives office told them president bush will 
look at a range of japanese barriers as it considers action that 
could lead to sanctions 
the us forest products industry estimates that exports to japan 
could increase by 12 billion if restrictions are lifted 
bush announced late last month that japan was being singled out 
for using certain technical standards to block imports of 
american forest products 
in making the announcement bush triggered the socalled super 
301 provisions of last years trade bill that call for 
investigating a foreign countrys unfair trade practices 
the bill also calls for sanctions if the dispute is not resolved 
after 18 months of negotiations 
packwood wyden and others launched a campaign aimed at 
convincing us trade representative carla hills that other japanese 
barriers to us wood products should also be reviewed 
the administration will publish in the federal register on friday 
information outlining a broader case against the japanese on forest 
products the two lawmakers said 
among the issues the administration will now consider are 
japanese escalating tariffs in which manufactured products face 
higher duties than such imports as raw logs 
japanese building and fire codes such as one that requires the 
use of nails that crack americanmade plywood 
subsidies grants and tax provisions aimed at bolstering japans 
domestic forest products industry 
misclassification for tariff purposes by japan of such products 
as glulam beams and laminated lumber 
internal distribution agreements used by the japanese to keep 
foreign building products out of their market

massachusetts gov michael s dukakis backed 
legislation wednesday designed to separate bad corporate 
takeovers from good ones and to force raiders in massachusetts 
to pay some of the social costs of their actions 
the bill is the product of a study commission that worked over 
the past year in wednesdays commerce and labor committee hearing 
it won the support of both business and labor representatives 
massachusetts has been unusually active in hostile takeovers with 
recent battles raging over polaroid corp prime computer inc and 
dunkin donuts inc 
the proposal calls for a threeyear asset freeze to deter 
underfinanced and overly leveraged buyouts that rely on the buyout 
targets own corporate assets as collateral acquiring companies 
would have to honor all collective bargaining agreements and pay 
severance to laid off workers 
this bill is designed to deter the hostile debtfinanced 
takeovers that often lead to major layoffs and the bustup of 
productive companies dukakis told the committee these 
transactions are abuses of the takeover mechanism which do nothing 
but make a few speculators rich at the expense of many 
dukakis emphasized that the state does not want to stand in the 
way of mergers and takeovers that make companies more efficient and 
competitive 
most takeovers are not bad dukakis said but abusive and 
excessive takeovers which use target assets as collateral for 
financing or require massive layoffs to pay debt service are bad 
in some recent takeovers shareholders have been able to sue 
corporate directors on grounds that they neglected shareholder 
interests in rejecting a buyout 
a proposal included in the dukakis bill would allow directors to 
consider the short and longterm interests of employees customers 
and the community as well as that of shareholders 
grady hedgespeth state secretary of economic affairs and the 
cochairman of the takeover commission said the provision will 
allow companies to be less cautious in deciding to reject a buyout 
bid 
wallace whitney general counsel of norton co a worcesterbased 
abrasives manufacturer said that stockholders should not be the top 
priority in takeover fights 
shareholders are increasingly institutional investors looking 
for a quick profit whitney said it is important to note what 
this does not do it does not entrench management what it does do 
is require a greater balance between competing interests 
among those testifying in support of the bill were bill connolly 
chief steward of the eastern airlines machinists union which has 
been on strike for more than 100 days 
when frank lorenzo took over eastern it was a friendly merger 
over the next three years 13000 people lost their jobs connolly 
said this bill would have helped alleviate all the suffering all 
those employees went through

former wall street financier john a mulheren 
jr already accused of plotting to kill ivan f boesky was charged 
wednesday with engaging in a series of illegal securities fraud 
schemes with the jailed stock speculator 
a 42count federal indictment charged mulheren with manipulating 
the price of gulf amp western inc common stock to assist boesky 
whose 1986 guilty plea triggered a series of wall street fraud 
investigations 
mulheren also was accused of plotting a series of sham stock 
transactions to help boesky companies evade taxes and circumvent 
securities laws in what prosecutors called a classic case of 
parking securities 
specifically mulheren 39 of rumson nj was charged with 
conspiracy securities fraud mail fraud and keeping fraudulent 
records he faces a maximum five years in prison and 250000 fine 
on each of the 42 counts 
last month mulheren pleaded innocent in new jersey to state 
weapons possession charges in connection with an alleged plot on 
boeskys life mulheren was arrested in february 1988 near his home 
with a loaded semiautomatic rifle local authorities alleged he 
planned to use against boesky 
he remains free on 20 million bond for a previous federal charge 
of threatening a witness stemming from the new jersey case federal 
officials have never identified the alleged target but new jersey 
police have said it was boesky 
us attorney benito romano said the federal charge of 
threatening a witness would be dropped friday in favor of the state 
weapons possession charges 
we are content for now to pursue the securities charges and 
have the monmouth county prosecutors office pursue the state charges 
arising from possession of a weapon romano told a news conference 
mulherens lawyer thomas puccio said his client intends to 
plead not guilty and go to trial this position has been stated on a 
number of cases 
puccio added in my view the charges like ivan boeskys 
credibility dont get any better with age 
mulheren was a general partner and chief trader at jamie 
securities a nowdefunct manhattan investment and arbitrage firm 
also indicted wednesday was leonard destefano 32 a former 
trader at jamie he was named on three counts of conspiracy mail 
fraud and fraudulent recordkeeping 
prosecutors said mulheren aided boesky because his risk arbitrage 
business stood to gain from nonpublic information supplied by 
boesky once one of wall streets top speculators in the stock of 
takeover targets 
boesky paid 100 million to settle insider trading charges with 
the sec in 1986 and pleaded guilty to a single felony count he is 
in the second year of a threeyear jail term at a federal prison in 
lompoc calif boeskys confessions led to a series of major wall 
street fraud investigations 
romano would not divulge what inside information boesky allegedly 
gave mulheren 
the indictment charged that in october 1985 mulheren helped 
boesky manipulate the price of common stock of gulf amp western which 
has since been renamed paramount communications inc 
according to the indictment on oct 16 1985 gulf amp western 
which was in the midst of a 12 million share stock repurchase 
agreed to buy a block of stock from boesky but only if the market 
price rose to 45 per share at the time gulf amp westerns stock was 
trading at 4475 
the next day the indictment charged mulheren at boeskys 
instigation made several large purchases of gulf amp western stock 
within a sixminute period driving up the price to 45 per share 
seven minutes after the final mulheren purchase gulf amp western 
bought 34 million shares of its own stock from boesky and 32 
million from an unidentified investor for 45 per share 
the indictment also charged that mulheren and destefano schemed 
with employees of boeskys nowdefunct seemala corp to engage in a 
series of sham stock transactions enabling seemala to evade taxes 
and circumvent mimimum capital limits required of brokerdealers by 
the securities and exchange commission 
romano called the schemes to conceal the stocks true ownership 
a classic case of parking 
when stocks are illegally parked to conceal their true ownership 
an investor sells them with an understanding the buyer will return 
them usually at a specified date and price the ruse is often used 
to avoid disclosing a 5 percent stake in a company to conceal 
possible takeover interest 
the ultimate objective may be slightly different but the 
concealment aspects are very typical of a parking scheme romano 
said

the democraticcontrolled house failed 
wednesday to override president bushs veto of legislation to raise 
the minimum wage giving the white house a win in its first 
legislative clash with congress 
house members voted 247178 to override but that was well shy of 
the twothirds needed so bushs veto stands the bill would have 
increased the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 455 by october 
1991 
defeated but defiant democrats moved immediately to renew the 
fight which has taken on political symbolism beyond the partisan 
differences over the minimum wage 
sen edward m kennedy introduced a bill identical to the one 
bush vetoed and a leading house democrat was preparing a revised 
bill as well still out of line with bushs demands 
the president should understand that this is an issue on which 
congress has just begun to fight said kennedy 
republicans quickly countered the democrats introducing a new 
minimumwage proposal of their own that also included a modest 
expansion of the earned income tax credit available to families with 
young children 
bush the first veto of his administration sustained said his 
offer to raise the minimum to 425 an hour by 1992 remained on the 
table provided employers could pay new workers a lower wage for six 
months 
the congress should enact the presidents minimum wage proposal 
at the earliest opportunity bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
shortly after the house vote 
through fitzwater the president said he would not compromise 
with congressional democrats the presidents proposal is firm 
fitzwater said 
equally firm democrats said was their resolve to end the 
eightyear freeze in the minimum wage 
i would prefer to work out an acceptable compromise with the 
administration said kennedy dmass but if that is not 
possible we will try to enact a measure that has the support of a 
vetoproof majority 
before the house vote supporters of the vetoed measure pleaded 
with conservative democrats who opposed the measure to switch sides 
and join the partys new house leaders in their first major 
legislative clash with bush 
we have a moral obligation and a mission to come here today and 
override this veto said rep john lewis dga the presidents 
veto of the minimum wage bill sends the wrong message it is not in 
keeping with his promise of a kind and gentle nation 
but republicans defended the veto saying the democrats bill 
would result in job losses and thus hurt the working poor it was 
designed to help 
rep robert s walker rpa challenging democratic assertions 
that bushs veto had proven his loyalty to the rich and 
insensitivity to the poor said a vote to sustain bushs veto was 
a vote on the side of lowincome people 
even as the debate unfolded both sides prepared for the next 
round of the fight 
kennedy said he considered his bill a starting point for 
negotiations with the administration but the senator chairman of 
the labor committee said that if bush refused to give ground he 
would ask the panel to move quickly on the measure and send it to 
the full senate early next month 
in the house rep augustus hawkins dcalif was seeking 
agreement with other supporters on a revised bill chief among the 
options being considered by hawkins was increasing the minimum wage 
to 425 an hour within two years 
that would result in a final target in line with bushs but bring 
the minimum wage to the level a year earlier than bush favors 
more significantly however hawkins said he was not prepared to 
meet bushs demand for the sixmonth subminimum a provision the 
president has said must be in any minimumwage legislation that he 
would sign 
as for the new house republican proposal its final minimumwage 
target matched that called for by bush it sought the middle ground 
in the fight over establishing a new subminimum wage by allowing 
employers to pay a lower wage for four months two months more than 
the democrats have proposed and two months short of bushs demand

eastern airlines battling to get airborne again 
despite an intractable strike and the shackles of bankruptcy court 
is facing a new and perhaps more insidious problem allegations of 
sloppy maintenance 
the airline insists these charges are groundless concoctions of 
embittered strikers who have crippled eastern for nearly four 
months 
but the federal aviation administration is monitoring easterns 
maintenance situation an influential congresswoman has expressed 
concern to the agency and sources say a criminal inquiry into the 
airlines maintenance recordkeeping is underway 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
the criminal investigation by the fbi and us attorneys office for 
the eastern district of new york focuses on possibly improper 
practices and allegedly falsified records at easterns john f 
kennedy international airport maintenance facility 
early last month eastern surrendered its repair station 
certificate at kennedy after the faa determined the carrier had 
failed to properly record and inspect maintenance work 
assistant us attorney charles gerber said he could neither 
confirm nor deny a criminal investigation exists fbi 
representatives did not return calls seeking comment 
but ira j furman an attorney and former deputy director of the 
national transportation safety board said he represents a former 
eastern manager at kennedy who has talked to the faa fbi and the 
us attorneys office about alleged violations that occurred at 
least a year ago 
furman said his client has been granted immunity that seems to 
imply the possibility of criminal violations 
the spotlight of publicity turned on safety could not come at a 
worse time for miamibased eastern battered by bad news for years 
the safety question is especially sensitive because it has arisen 
periodically 
labor strife at eastern a year before the strike prompted faa 
inspectors to examine its fleet planebyplane though no 
abnormalities were found special faa reviews in 1987 resulted in an 
823000 fine 
that followed a 95 million penalty stemming from earlier 
infractions and warnings from the faa that easterns operating 
certificate faced revocation if it didnt clean up what examiners 
called a long list of deficiences 
eastern documents and memos obtained by the associated press 
depict an airline in which maintenance crews feuded with 
supervisors disaffected mechanics quit and managers ignored pilot 
protests of sloppy repairs 
we need parts eastern maintenance manager charles r 
seymour pleaded in one internal memo in march 1987 to phil bohan 
vice president of line maintenance i can assure you that the lack 
of parts is seriously affecting our performance and continuing to 
erode our manpower 
seymour director of easterns maintenance base in atlanta until 
he quit early this year also complained to superiors about an 
alarming exodus of maintenance staff and other problems in memos 
from july 1986 to january 1989 
in an april 1988 letter carlos diaz principal maintenance 
inspector in the faas miami office told edward upton easterns 
vice president of maintenance and engineering that an informal 
inspection of a miami repair station had revealed farreaching 
findings 
the deficiencies included failure to separate usable parts from 
condemned ones and failure to follow procedures for handling 
parts outlined in easterns manual diaz told upton 
management personnel are unfamiliar with repair station 
operational procedures and general housekeeping policy is not 
being adhered to by eastern personnel diaz wrote 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation has 
expressed concern to acting faa administrator robert e whittington 
that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering easterns 
ability to maintain its fleet 
in a june 1 letter to whittington collins said her 
subcommittees staff had reviewed internal company documents 
indicating manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the 
maintenance function of eastern 
on may 12 the faa completed a special investigation of 
recordkeeping at easterns maintenance posts in miami and atlanta 
to determine if violations of recordkeeping rules such as those 
found at kennedy were widespread 
the three airports are home to easterns principal maintenance 
facilities the final report hasnt been submitted to whittington 
but jack barker faa spokesman in atlanta said the agency told 
eastern informally that the inspection had revealed no 
irregularities 
at the same time the faa is continuing a special 
surveillance of easterns overall safety which began when workers 
struck the airline march 4 said faa spokesman fred farrar in 
washington 
suspension of the kennedy certificate was for actions that 
predated the strike which pushed eastern into bankruptcy court 
when a maintenance certificate is suspended the airline cannot 
work on planes at the facility it must contract work to others or 
ferry planes elsewhere until deficiencies at the facility are 
corrected 
questions about easterns kennedy operation and maintenance 
practices in general are like open sores in the airlines struggle 
to sidestep the strikers hire replacements and woo a skeptical 
public back to the ticket counter 
unionists accuse the company of pencilwhipping a reference 
to maintenance supervisors signing off on aircraft repairs that 
werent done 
they also charge that management frantically trying to cut costs 
and honor flying schedules during the prestrike months bullied 
mechanics and pilots who complained about serious maintenance 
violations 
it all has root in a corporate culture a corporate attitude 
greg petachenko an eastern pilot for 22 years said in a telephone 
interview their basic tool seems to have been fear and 
intimidation theres enormous pressure to keep your mouth shut 
do what youre told 
until recently eastern paid maintenance supervisors bonuses for 
meeting deadlines the company stresses however that supervisors 
also received bonuses for meeting training requirements and repair 
quality standards 
for its part eastern charges some machinists hid or destroyed 
maintenance records at kennedy then told the faa that company 
supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed 
company representatives discovered records hidden in file 
cabinets and stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the 
airport said eastern spokesman robin matell 
weve never dispatched an unsafe plane we have one of the best 
safety records in the industry matell said he called union 
complaints a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and 
weaken the company 
the safety questions havent stopped frank lorenzo chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp from proceeding with a plan to 
rebuild eastern into a smaller carrier and sell around 18 billion 
of assets 
the plan must be approved by federal bankruptcy court but us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland already has given eastern 
permission to sell its northeast shuttle service to developer donald 
trump for 365 million 
at the same time eastern has been aggressively recruiting new 
skilled mechanics to replace strikers the move complements a more 
highlypublicized drive to recruit new pilots 
the airline recently ran helpwanted advertisements for qualified 
mechanics in newspapers in new orleans dallas atlanta denver 
miami tampa west palm beach and pensacola the ads offer 
exciting career opportunities and wages of 10 to 18 an hour 
before the strike unionized mechanics at eastern earned top 
hourly pay of 1883 that compares with 16 at sister texas air 
carrier continental 1878 at american 2005 at united and 
northwest and 2010 at delta and usair 
were certainly putting a lot of attention on recruiting 
mechanics matell said

a federal bankruptcy judge on wednesday approved 
strikebound eastern airlines agreement to sell 15 aircraft for 
2775 million to uasinvest inc as part of easterns downsizing 
plan 
the sale approved by us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
consists of three boeing 757s 10 boeing 727200s two airbus a300s 
and six spare engines uasinvest is an affiliate of united aviation 
services an aircraft leasing company 
eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on march 9 
five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground 
workers represented by the machinists union in a walkout that 
virtually grounded the miamibased airline 
the jet sale is part of the plan announced in late april by frank 
lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp to rebuild 
eastern as a smaller carrier and sell about 18 billion of its 
assets separately 
the bankruptcy court recently gave lorenzo permission to sell 
easterns profitable northeast shuttle service to developer donald 
trump for 365 million and has approved other sales of aircraft 
the sale to uasinvest leaves eastern with 213 planes compared 
with its prestrike fleet of about 255 lorenzos downsizing plan 
calls for 157 aircraft 
the pilots union expressed disappointment with liflands decision 
and called the downsizing plan a controlled liquidation 
the sale of approximately 6 percent of easterns remaining 
fleet is not consistent with the concerns of the employees 
easterns customers and other parties who want a full restoration 
of eastern operations the union said in a statement 
lifland recently directed eastern to start negotiations with its 
creditors on a reorganization plan for the airline eastern is 
drafting such a proposal which would be centered on its downsizing 
plan and also would address payment of creditors and treatment of 
shareholders 
a buyout plan for eastern proposed by the unions and chicago

reorganization scheme 
the ritchie plan includes a 100 million equity investment and 
210 million in union wage concessions

nelson bunker hunt and william herbert hunt 
onetime billionaires would retain millions of dollars of assets 
under liquidation plans they filed wednesday in federal bankruptcy 
court 
the brothers filed for chapter 11 protection from their creditors 
last year after a peruvian mining company won a 196 million 
judgment against them for their attempt to corner the silver market 
in 1979 and 1980 
the internal revenue service also has multimilliondollar claims 
against the brothers saying bunker and his wife caroline owe the 
government 600 million while herbert and his wife nancy owe 300 
million 
bunker and caroline hunt have said they have assets worth about 
240 million to cover debts of more than 12 billion herbert and 
nancy value their assets at 40 million and debts of 887 million 
also wednesday us bankruptcy judge harold abramson granted the 
brothers request that 601 silver claims representing 877 
million be dismissed from the bankruptcy proceedings 
the decision leaves almost 600 claims amounting to about 360 
million stemming from the brothers silver speculation included in 
that is a reduced 1346 million judgment in favor of minepaco sa 
of peru 
in lengthy disclosure statements filed wednesday with the us 
bankruptcy court in dallas the brothers detail their holdings 
ranging from bunker hunts 10 silver churchill commemorative coin 
to herbert hunts oil and gas holdings worth 83 million 
a hearing is scheduled before abramson on thursday to discuss the 
disclosure statements and the hunts proposed reorganization plans 
earlier plans which contained many of the same features but was 
less detailed were vigorously fought by creditors at an april 
hearing 
the holdings detailed in the new plans include bunker hunts 
collection of 8000 islamic and 2712 roman and greek coins valued 
at 19 million and herbert hunts 35 million collection of 
ancient bronze statues and artifacts currently on display at a fort 
worth museum 
while the separate liquidation plans filed by the brothers differ 
in detail they both suggest creating a liquidation trust that would 
sell their holdings over a sixyear period to pay down their debts 
in both plans the irs would get the lions share of the proceeds 
however herbert hunt proposes to keep 10 percent of the 
liquidation value of his estate or 765 million 
bunker hunt seeks to withhold from the liquidating trust his 
dallas house and furnishings plus interests in currently 
nonproducing oil and gas leases interest in an estate created by 
his father flamboyant oilman hl hunt and 75 percent of the 
proceeds from the sale of his coins and antiquities over 21 million 
in addition to retaining those bunker hunts plan would pay him 
75 million from the first 150 million of the proceeds from the 
liquidation trust and a third of the proceeds over 150 million

the dollar was sharply higher against the yen at 
late morning thursday resulting in a plunge in share prices on the 
tokyo stock exchange dealers said 
the 225issue nikkei stock average a 18944point gainer the 
previous day lost 5153 points or 015 percent closing the 
morning session at 3335153 
the dollar at late morning was changing hands at 15035 yen after 
opening at 15030 yen up 225 yen from wednesdays 14805yen 
close the currency moved in the range of 15030 to 15065 yen 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a trader with daiwa bank in tokyo said the 
dollars surge came earlier than the market had expected 
he said investors are aggressive in their dollarbuying 
anticipating the release of us trade figures for april by the us 
commerce deparment scheduled for later thursday in washington 
market players predict the us trade deficit will shrink from 
its 89 billion level in march 
the bank of japan conducted dollarselling intervention 
intermittenly amounting to 500 million the japan broadcasting 
corporation nhk reported the central bank makes no official 
comments on its monetary activities 
no matter how often the japanese side says the dollar should 
stay lower it has small influence because the united states the 
owner of the currency doesnt make any moves the daiwa trader 
said japanese market players have taken this as an indication 
that the united states is allowing the dollars surge for the 
moment 
because the united states has failed to reduce its trade deficit 
by keeping the dollar lower the country might be shifting its 
policy to using other remedies such as the super 301 provision 
of the us trade act kinugasa said 
the market sentiment for bullish dollar continues and 
investors are likely to keep buying the currency until they start 
selling for profit taking around the 152153 yen level he added 
on the stock exchange dealers said the dollars surge against 
the yen largely discouraged japanese participants especially 
institutional investors 
the current stock market has been so much affected by 
fluctuations in the foreign exchange said kazuhiro nomura a 
dealer with new japan securities co 
there was no buying incentive in todays trading except for 
hightech issues that are strong when the yens weak nomura added
