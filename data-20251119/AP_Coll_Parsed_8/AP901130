smithsonian institution curators are busy 
cataloguing a monumental new collection of nearly 200 years of 
popular american sheet music including stacks of rare 
longforgotten broadway melodies by george gershwin and irving 
berlin 
this bonanza from the nations musical past a gift from fort 
wayne ind broadcaster sam devincent consists of 130000 
original editions of illustrated sheet music nearly 20000 
recordings and boxes of posters concert programs newspaper 
clippings and other memorabilia 
this is one of the great legendary collections of sheet music 
in the world said john edward hasse curator of american music 
at the smithsonians national museum of american history it 
contains some of the rarest of the rare 
the scope of the devincent collection is staggering it ranges 
from yellowing reprints of parlor piano pieces of the 1790s to 
mournful civil war ballads the shameless bigotry of minstrel show 
music railroad songs and ragtime military marches antiwar 
protest songs beatles favorites and political campaign choruses 
the bulk of the collection focuses on the golden era of tin pan 
alley from the 1890s to the 1940s when gershwin berlin cole 
porter and other great songwriters were churning out broadway show 
tunes 
scores of large cartons in the museums archives are stuffed 
with their most memorable hits and some of their most forgettable 
words and lyrics 
among the latter is a 1919 gershwin song titled 
teeoodleumbumbo and a few of hoagy carmichaels obscure 
world war ii morale boosters including im a cranky old yank in 
a cranky old tank 
berlin wrote im the guy who guards the harem and my hearts 
in my work for the ziegfeld follies of 1919 and little 
remembered from his 1933 hit musical easter parade is a song 
titled i say its spinach 
as america sang deeper into the depression berlin wrote 
things dont come on a silver platter 
what does it matter 
long as theres you long as theres me 
long as the best things in life are free 
i say its spinach 
the hell with it the hell with it thats all 
hasse says the devincent collection a rich and diverse 
repository of americana will give historians an intimate portrait 
of the nations cultural tastes and social upheavals over the past 
two centuries 
no fewer than 500 songs give testimony to americas love affair 
with the automobile others trace the rise of labor unionists 
suffragettes and abolitionists popular songs toasted charles 
lindberghs solo flight across the atlantic lamented the titanics 
sinking and poked fun at peculiarities of east european immigrants 
cover illustrations document the rise and fall of fashion styles 
and popular dance steps from revolutionaryera quadrilles to the 
waltz twostep cakewalk ballroom marches bunny hop and turkey 
trot tango charleston jitterbug and twist 
some of the sheet music covers are decorated with outstanding 
examples of the illustrators art winslow homer later to gain 
fame as a painter and watercolorist sketched a cover for the 1850s 
song kitty clyde george m cohans patriotic world war i song 
over there featured a norman rockwell painting of four 
doughboys singing around a campfire 
the collection represents a 60year labor of love by devincent 
retired music director of fort wayne radio station wowo who began 
hoarding sheet music as a 12yearold in chicago 
by 1978 while hasse was writing a doctoral dissertation on 
ragtime music at indiana university devincents collection had 
filled his twocar garage and spilled into nearly every room of his 
home 
when i saw his ragtime holdings i was flabbergasted i was 
speechless hasse said i quickly realized the tremendous value 
of his collection and made a vow to myself that i would try to 
help it find a good home someday 
hasse who joined the smithsonian in 1984 played a leading role 
in negotiating the museums acquisition of the devincent 
collection which was shipped to washington in the spring of 1988 
in five truckloads 
devincent says the rarest items in his collection include an 
original copy of berlins first published song marie from sunny 
italy written in 1907 and a first edition of old zip coon 
an 1816 minstrel song that later became known as turkey in the 
straw 
even the eminent cohan wrote coon songs for the popular 
blackface minstrel shows of his day hasse noted 
we may find the lyrics distasteful today he said but it 
is important for historians to preserve this material so we can 
understand the past and build a better future

housing secretary jack kemp has his agency on 
a reform track but millions of dollars still are wasted because of 
management problems the agencys inspector general says 
in a report thursday to congress inspector general paul a 
adams gave kemp high marks for his efforts to clean up the 
department of housing and urban development the agency was the 
subject of a congressional investigation last year following an 
adams report revealing fraud and influencepeddling in a major 
rehabilitation program 
still adams said much more remains to be done to resolve major 
problems at hud headquarters its regional and field offices across 
the country and in many local public housing authorities that get 
hud money and administer many of its programs 
adams said his office will take a closer look at kemps 
performance to determine how effective management has been in 
correcting previously reported problems 
the inspector generals audits often are the first sign of 
trouble in hud programs but past audits often were ignored by hud 
management under kemp audit followup is being pursued more 
vigorously than ever adams said 
as an example adams pointed to swift implementation of new 
regulations for huds dealings with private closing agents that 
program drew attention during congressional hearings because of the 
ease with which some agents stole millions in hud money usually 
undetected 
most of the persistent problems cited by adams were at local 
housing authorities and huds field offices although he also cited 
several headquarters deficiencies 
for example he said millions of dollars in money for 
multifamily housing programs was being misspent or diverted each 
year in many cases because local and federal officials were not 
carefully monitoring of government funds 
also adams said purchases made through a centralized hud 
purchasing program for public housing authorities cost 18 percent 
more than if the local agencies had sought competitive bids 
during a review of the section 8 public housing program adams 
said his office found inadequate controls on basic quality 
standards for housing an audit of huds cincinnati field office 
for example found violations in 82 of 86 units reviewed 
hud also is plagued by shoddy data processing adams said one 
system made 4 million in duplicate payments to housing authorities 
and authorized another 27 million in duplicate payments that were 
detected before they were spent 
adams said a large share of his offices investigative resources 
during aprilseptember were dedicated to fbi and justice department 
task forces reviewing hud programs 
his report made no mention of the independent investigation of 
kemps predecessor former secretary samuel r pierce jr by a 
courtappointed special prosecutor the justice department sought 
the review last year after numerous accounts of mismanagement 
political influencepeddling and waste during pierces eight years 
as housing secretary pierce has denied any wrongdoing

president bush is hailing a major new 
immigration law for strengthening the power of border patrol agents 
to arrest criminal aliens including drug suspects 
bush signed the measure thursday saying it boosts our war on 
drugs and crime allowing us to send back alien offenders who 
threaten our streets and who make up nearly a fourth of our federal 
prison populations 
it will help secure our borders the front lines of the drug 
war bush said 
under the measure the arrest authority for border patrol agents 
has been expanded from immigration law violations to other crimes 
including suspected drug activity 
the bill the first sweeping reform of legal immigration in 25 
years also makes it tougher for criminal aliens to stretch out 
their deportations by as many as seven years 
but critics say the law could actually deprive all aliens not 
just those arrested or convicted of a crime of their legal 
rights they also question giving more authority to the immigration 
and naturalization service which includes the border patrol they 
say the agency is in chaos and should not be trusted with such 
sensitive responsibilities 
rep lamar smith rtexas sponsored the provision giving the 
nations 3800 border patrol agents additional arrest authority 
there are 3800 more people who can arrest drug smugglers than 
before smith said it streamlines operations and saves time 
they do not have to wait to call in a drug enforcement 
administration agent and for agents in rural areas there often 
is no dea agent nearby 
wade henderson associate director of the washington national 
office of the american civil liberties union said the aclu is 
concerned about expanding the ins authority to enforce federal 
criminal statutes 
he said that is largely because ins agents have not been trained 
as thoroughly as other law officers 
the agency itself is in a state of administrative chaos and 
to give ins agents this brand new authority when its having 
difficulty in enforcing its immigration responsibilities is 
presently a mistake henderson said 
wendy young immigration policy associate for the national 
council of la raza said she also is concerned about the ins 
expanded powers 
there are enough human rights violations going on the border 
as it is she said there is a siege mentality at the border 
ins personnel feel they are under siege and tend to strike back 
and anything that enhances that ability is scary 
smith the ranking republican on the houses immigration 
subcommittee also sponsored provisions to close loopholes that he 
said allow criminal aliens to delay deportation by as long as seven 
years the ins estimates that more than 72000 aliens will be 
arrested annually on drug charges alone yet in 1988 fewer than 
6000 total criminal aliens were deported he said

nasas jupiterbound galileo spacecraft 
will zoom past earth next week taking pictures and making 
measurements as if its home planet were an alien world 
it will be the first time the earth has been viewed from this 
perspective i expect it will give us a greater appreciation of 
this place said bill oneil project manager at the nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
galileos close encounter with earth will take place on dec 8 
and is aimed at using the planets gravity like a slingshot to send 
the craft on the right path 
the craft will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest 
atlantic ocean at 1235 pm pst dec 8 galileo was 397 million 
miles from earth today 
galileo will be the first planetary craft to approach earth from 
space so the flyby will be our first chance to look at earth as 
we have at other planets torrence johnson galileos chief 
scientist said thursday 
during its flyby the spacecraft will measure gases that cause 
the greenhouse effect warming of earths atmosphere and will 
study highaltitude water vapor that helps create and destroy 
earths ozone layer johnson said 
galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern 
instruments to study the far side of the moon which is always 
pointed away from earth he added 
galileo is powered by two nuclear batteries not reactors 
that use the decay of radioactive plutonium to produce electricity 
environmentalists unsuccessfully sued to halt galileos launch 
for fear the plutonium could contaminate earths atmosphere oneil 
said the chance that galileo will somehow plunge into earths 
atmosphere and release its plutonium is less than one in 2 million 
even if it did happen the plutonium would cause no more than 10 
cancer deaths during the next 70 years according to nasa 
galileo is the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever 
built it was launched from a space shuttle in october 1989 and is 
scheduled to rendezvous with jupiter in 1995 after a looping 
24billionmile journey 
galileos route was designed so the spacecraft could use venus 
and earth as gravity slingshots it will use earth for that 
purpose dec 8 and again in december 1992 
it used venus as a gravity slingshot last february scientists 
discussed their venus findings on thursday 
galileos infrared camera made the first pictures of venus 
middle and lower cloud decks pictures also were used to make a 
movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph winds 
studying venus acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere 
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels 
in earths atmosphere will warm the planet like glass trapping heat 
in a greenhouse said arizona astronomer michael belton

the leaders of three puerto rican 
political parties are demanding the us senate authorize a 1991 
plebiscite on whether the island should be independent or remain 
tied to the united states 
gov rafael hernandez colon who favors the islands present 
us commonwealth status and who leads the popular democratic 
party was among the leaders who sent a letter thursday to a senate 
committee 
it would be undemocratic and contradictory that congress 
should not respond promptly and decisively to the request of 36 
million citizens from puerto rico to be consulted as to the choice 
of their ultimate political status the letter read 
also signing the letter were carlos romero barcelo president of 
the prostatehood new progressive party and the president of the 
puerto rican independence party ruben berrios 
the letter was addressed to sen j bennett johnston dla 
chairman of the senate energy committee whose committee handles 
issues pertaining to puerto rico johnston is to visit the island 
next week 
legislation before congress would allow puerto ricans to hold a 
plebiscite next july on whether to continue as a us commonwealth 
with increased autonomy become the 51st state or break away as an 
independent nation 
for the first time in history polls indicate a narrow 
preference for statehood over commonwealth status under which 
puerto ricans are us citizens but pay no federal taxes and cannot 
vote for president the polls reveal little support for 
independence 
president bush has declared himself in favor of statehood for 
puerto rico which the united states annexed in 1898 during the 
spanishamerican war 
the puerto rican leaders demand that congressional leaders 
settle their differences and come up with a bill so a referendum 
can be held in 1991 
it was announced in san juan that johnston will be accompanied 
by sen malcolm wallop rwwyo when he arrives in puerto rico on 
monday night 
the two will meet with party leaders to discuss the plebiscite 
johnston was a cosponsor of a plebiscite bill 
it was put on hold in october after johnston repudiated a 
referendum bill that passed the house saying the status 
definitions it offered were too vague 
johnston then offered a schedule providing for passage of a 
plebiscite bill by july 4 
however hernandez colons party in a meeting two weeks ago 
demanded that plebiscite bills be filed in congress by feb 19

liverpool the winningest team in 
english soccer has swept all before it on the way to 18 league 
titles and four victories in the european champions cup 
but it spent 12 years getting stubborn elderly sisters norah and 
muriel mason to move off club property 
liverpool bought a whole street so it could bulldoze the block 
and spend 15 million expanding its anfield stadium but the 
sisters who have lived in the same two bedroom house for 50 years 
turned down 15 offers of alternative housing 
even after the club had demolished the rest of the street and 
their home stood forlorn amid the wasteland of a parking lot next 
to the 40000capacity stadium the sisters wouldnt budge 
liverpools patience finally ran out and the club went to 
court 
at liverpool county court on wednesday club lawyer david geey 
said the mason sisters agreed to move by the end of february

if the european community doesnt negotiate 
realistically next week at the closing rounds of global trade 
talks it will virtually launch an export subsidy war warns a usda 
official 
deputy agriculture secretary jack c parnell said the bargaining 
nations scheduled to meet in brussels are looking at the final 
moments in the negotiations on liberalizing global agricultural 
trade 
the 12nation ec has long been at odds with the united states 
and other countries that are calling for reducing not only export 
subsidies but internal farm supports that distort trade 
the socalled uruguay round of negotiations has been going on 
for four years under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
if the europeans cant come to the gatt negotiating table in 
good faith and discuss concrete reductions in agricultural 
subsidies and the real measurable lowering of tariff walls then 
they are making the initial unfriendly moves of subsidy war 
parnell said thursday 
there is little doubt that the united states will retaliate 
using every tool available to us in order to maintain our market 
share he said 
parnell also told the concluding session of the departments 
annual outlook conference that us farmers could face even greater 
trade competition 
eastern europe has been liberalized and weve all rejoiced 
he said but suppose the rest of europe seduces these countries 
into joining its common agricultural policy 
parnell said that would mean the former east germany poland 
hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania all would be joining 
the existing bloc 
can you imagine an 18member common agricultural policy 
american farmers have many good reasons to support a gatt 
agreement not the least of which is holding onto their own 
financial prosperity he said 
parnell said there is a great sense of urgency surrounding 
the successful completion of the uruguay round of talks there is 
intense competition and the highrisk path for us agriculture 
in todays world is to do nothing 
the past performance of gatt shows that the process does work 
he said tariffs on manufactured goods were reduced from 40 percent 
in the mid1960s to less than 6 percent now 
but at the same time the rate of protection on agricultural 
goods has risen to 40 percent from 21 percent parnell said 
besides world trade parnell said environmental issues such as 
food safety wetlands water quality and land use are other 
problems facing agriculture government spending budget deficits 
and interest rates are others 
decisions will be made in the next 10 years to balance this 
very fragile equation between the environment and our standard of 
living he said 
 
washington ap overseas demand for us broilers is expected 
to continue strong in 1991 according to agriculture department 
analysts 
exports set a record this year and are expected to rise further 
economist lee a christensen told the departments annual outlook 
conference this week in all broiler shipments may total more than 
1 billion pounds or almost 6 percent of estimated 1991 production 
christensen said in his report that exports are expected to 
benefit from continued and likely improved access to major 
longstanding markets such as japan mexico and canada and to new 
markets in the soviet union 
us broiler output is forecast to expand next year by 5 percent 
to 6 percent following a 65 percent increase in 1990 
total federally inspected production will probably rise to 
around 195 billion pounds in 1991 from an estimated 184 billion 
pounds this year he said per capita consumption may average about 
73 pounds next year up from 70 pounds in 1990 
average net returns to broiler producers in 1991 are estimated 
at around eight cents per pound about the same or slightly less 
than this years average 
christensen said the cost of production in 1991 will average 46 
to 47 cents per pound on a readytocook basis about the same as 
this year 
 
washington ap many farmers apparently are backing away from 
bigticket machinery purchases next year according to john a 
stark a chicago analyst 
demand may drop by 7 percent he said thursday at the 
agriculture departments annual outlook conference 
stark editor of starks offhighway ledger said a new business 
cycle began in north america in august 
since farm machinery production tends to trail the ups and 
downs of farm vehicle sales by three to six months cutbacks in 
farm tractor and selfpropelled combines is fully expected by the 
1991 first quarter saark said in his report 
retail sales of farm vehicles will probably slip to 126100 next 
year with machinery production dropping to 53800 units stark 
said 
he projected that steep price discounts on tractors would occur 
in the first quarter of next year possibly sparking a sticker 
price war 
stark said that because 70 percent of farm tractors are 
foreignmade low value of the dollar will surely create 
extraordinary pressure for producing firms to raise vehicle 
prices 
but the use of competitive price incentives will cause them to 
absorb a major part of the price hikes cutting sharply into 
profit margins

a federal judge today weighed whether the 
transcripts of manuel noriegas jailhouse phone calls are the 
property of cnn or are part of the public record and should be 
shared with other news organizations 
four news organizations went before us district judge william 
hoeveler on thursday seeking the court transcripts cable news 
network fought to keep them secret accusing other media of trying 
to scoop the network with its own story 
hoeveler said he would rule by monday 
robert bernius representing gannett co and its usa today 
argued that in the wake of hoevelers decision on wednesday to lift 
his 3weekold ban on airing the tapes the transcripts were of 
vital public importance 
we want to know why a first amendment crisis was 
precipitated by these tapes bernius said 
gannett and usa today joined the miami herald the associated 
press and the miamiarea postnewsweek station wplgtv in the 
effort to obtain the transcripts 
cnn attorney terry bienstock said the transcripts should be 
burned or returned to the network 
this is not a clash of first amendment rights it is merely a 
display of competitive jealousy cnn said in court papers 
bienstock argued that giving them to other media organizations 
would be like cnn demanding that the organizations give the network 
their own reporters notes the transcripts include some tapes that 
cnn has never broadcast he said 
this is again an intrusion into the newsgathering 
newsediting process said bienstock 
sanford bohrer another attorney for the four media 
organizations said i think its unfortunate that cnn feels its 
being put upon by others in the media the real issue is the 
publics right to look at anything it can get its hands on 
he noted that the transcripts were made by the court and the 
originll tapes were made by the bureau of prisons not cnn 
hoeveler interrupted bienstock frequently and chided cnn for 
fighting previously to broadcast the tapes then opposing release 
of the transcripts 
the whole thrust of your case was that you wanted the world to 
know what was on the tapes hoeveler said 
bienstock also cited a reporters right to protect a 
confidential source saying scrutiny of the transcripts could help 
reveal who gave the tapes to cnn 
but the judge noted that the government through the us 
attorneys office had already seen the transcripts 
in any event he added i have very little sympathy with 
your source someone down the line has committed some grave 
improprieties 
bernius said those seeking the tapes had no interest in 
identifying cnns source only in getting access to the factual 
basis of a landmark judicial determination 
three weeks ago cnn revealed it had obtained seven tapes of 
phone calls made from noriegas prison cell near here federal 
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of 
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers and that all 
inmates are made aware of this practice 
noriegas attorneys went into court nov 8 after learning about 
the tapes and hoeveler ordered cnn not to play any that might 
interfere with attorneyclient privilege the network aired some 
portions of the tapes for a day but withdrew them when a federal 
appeals court backed hoeveler 
the supreme court refused to intervene on a 72 vote forcing 
cnn to submit the tapes to the judge for review 
the transcripts then were prepared by court officials in miami 
to aid hoeveler and attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents 
of the tapes 
on wednesday hoeveler decided to allow cnn to broadcast the 
tapes and returned them to the network cnn spokesman steve haworth 
has said the network had no immediate plans to play the unaired 
tapes in the next few days 
while cnn wont say where it got the tapes noriegas attorneys 
said the tapes were released to the government of panama by the 
state department or the drug enforcement administration and that 
panama gave them to cnn 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million in 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade 
one tape broadcast was a conversation between noriega and his 
defense team in which he speculated about whether two panamanians 
captured after the us invasion would testify against him on 
another tape noriega appeared to be attempting to transfer 4 
million with the help of his mistress mother

a winter war with iraq would spare troops and 
equipment the strain of summer desert heat but would pose other 
pitfalls including dramatic temperature swings high seas and 
sudden sandstorms 
overall us military and private analysts believe the usled 
forces in the mideast would benefit most from fighting in the 
cooler months because hightech american weapons work better 
without the summer heat also iraqi forces are used to the 
tripledigit temperatures that will return in april 
the winter carries other advantages for saddam husseins iraqi 
forces including the prospect that if he unleashed chemical 
weapons they could prove more deadly because gases linger longer 
in cooler air 
the united nations security council approved a resolution 
thursday authorizing the use of force to drive saddams forces from 
kuwait if they do not leave by jan 15 
a deadline for him isnt necessarily a deadline for us but 
from a military standpoint thats the time of year wed prefer to 
fight if it comes to that said a pentagon source who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity the break in the weather should work 
to our advantage both from a manpower and equipmentlogistics 
perspective 
that view is shared by other military and private analysts 
any temperature or weather extreme is going to degrade the 
performance of your equipment and our forces are heavily dependent 
on electronics and hightech systems said piers wood a vietnam 
combat veteran who now is a lieutenant colonel in the army reserve 
he also is chief of staff at the center for defense information a 
liberal think tank that believes bush should give economic 
sanctions at least a year before opting for a military strike 
as the united states mounted its persian gulf buildup in august 
it was quickly apparent that some sensitive equipment would not 
perform up to standards in the saudi summer when temperatures can 
reach 130 degrees 
rippling haze off the desert floor limited the effectiveness of 
optical devices and blurred pilots vision radio wires melted 
troops grew weary fast under the sun and faced the prospect of 
donning heavier chemical protective clothing in the event of 
combat anything with an engine ran hot requiring more frequent 
routine maintenance at a time when spare parts were in short 
supply 
now temperatures in the region might climb into the 80s but 
more likely will average highs in the mid70s through february 
daily highs will creep back into the 80s and 90s in march and then 
over 100 degrees in april 
the cooler climate means better performance from virtually all 
mechanical equipment from jeeps to the hightech turbines in m1 
tanks and fighter jets 
but desert sand grows softer in the cooler months limiting 
vehicles mobility because of that analysts believe it would be 
easier for both sides to predict likely routes if the enemy decides 
to launch a ground attack 
that bodes well for saddam if bush ordered an attack iraqs 
forces are in heavily fortified defensive positions and are 
familiar with the terrain northern saudi arabia has dry river beds 
that can become swampy in the winter if there is heavy rain which 
could complicate any ground offensive into kuwait 
another slight advantage for saddam in a winter war would be the 
increased potency of his mustard and nerve gas weapons although 
analysts believe the gains would be marginal 
the agents will perform better under cooler conditions but 
its more a matter of degree than any dramatic improvement said 
seth carus the author of a washington institute for near east 
policy report on iraqs chemical arsenal it will make a 
difference but i still dont see chemical weapons proving to make 
any decisive difference 
in the desert winter temperature swings and unpredictable 
sandstirring winds replace heat as an armys enemy 
the us military has made no secret of its desire to fight at 
night when it believes its night vision equipment and other 
technology would provide a significant edge over iraqi forces 
subfreezing temperatures are not unheard of at night on the 
arabian peninsula and farther north in kuwait and iraq so any 
troops moving in the cold during night maneuvers would have to be 
ready to deal with a 40 to 50degree temperature swing by 
daylight 
mindful of that the pentagon was shipping sleeping bags 
blankets and winter uniforms to the mideast even as soldiers 
complained about the heat 
an air force summary also warns that wind shifts can bring gusts 
up to 45 knots turbulence blowing dust and sand and can cut 
visibility to less than 50 feet making flying extremely dangerous 
seas as the marines learned during recent exercises along the 
gulf coast can experience waves up to 15 feet

an abnormal gene found in some families can 
lead to a high susceptibility to breast cancer according to a 
study published today 
the finding is a major step that puts researchers closer to 
understanding the inherited tendency to develop malignancies says 
study in the journal science 
the inherited genetic mutation was discovered by studying the 
genes in a small group of families that experience in generation 
after generation of an exceptionally high rate of six types of 
cancer including breast cancer 
up until now there have been no inherited genes isolated and 
identified which provided susceptibilities to some of the common 
adult malignancies said dr stephen friend of massachusetts 
general hospital cancer center 
scientists have long questioned whether a single mutation in a 
single inherited gene could advance the tendency to develop cancer 
friend said the study settles that question 
this shows that the answer is yes said friend if you are 
born with an inactive region in one gene then that gives you a 
hidden susceptibility to malignancies 
although the breast cancer is the most common disease related to 
the mutated gene friend said it is not the only genetic cause of 
breast cancer 
there are multiple genes for breast cancer he said this 
happens to be the first but it wont be the last 
female breast cancer strikes about 130000 american women 
annually and kills about 41000 friend said that it is unclear 
at this time which of those many women have the mutation 
friend who was lead author of the study said the mutation was 
found on what is called the p53 cancer suppressor gene for people 
who inherit a mutated p53 gene he said their chance of getting 
a malignancy by age 60 is 90 percent 
dr andrew feinberg a university of michigan cancer center 
researcher and codiscoverer of genes related to a rare kidney 
cancer said the p53 discovery adds a step in the cascade of cell 
changes that is thought to lead to some cancers 
from a scientific viewpoint it is very important because it 
helps us understand the sequence of events that lead to cancer 
said feinberg however he emphasized that there are a number of 
other steps still unknown that cause a normal cell to become 
cancerous 
the p53 gene is one of a group of genes that control cell 
growth the gene in effect blocks the uncontrolled division of 
cells hence suppresses tumor development if this function is 
lost through mutation then the cell lacks one of the controls that 
keep division in balance 
the mutated p53 gene has been detected in the past in a number 
of types of cancers but the new study is the first to find that 
the mutation can be inherited 
inherited gene mutations have been related in earlier studies to 
rare eye and kidney cancers 
friend said he and his colleagues isolated the specific p53 gene 
mutation by studying people with what is called the lifraumeni 
syndrome these are families in which there is an inherited 
tendency to develop one of six types of cancer at an early age 
often during childhood 
breast cancer is the most common malignancy among lifraumeni 
families but they also can develop leukemias brain tumors 
sarcomas of the bone and cancer of the adrenal gland 
the researchers discovered the mutation in the cells of 
lifraumeni family members who had cancer but not in those family 
members who were free of the disease 
friend said that in the affected family members the p53 mutation 
was found in every cell indicating it was passed genetically from 
one generation to another 
the lifraumeni syndrome was first described by frederick p li 
and joseph f fraumeni jr both of the national cancer institute 
and coauthors of the study in science the syndrome is very rare 
with only about 200 such families in the united states 
with discovery of the p53 mutation friend said a screening 
process may be developed to determine which members in a 
lifraumeni family have inherited the abnormal gene when one 
parent in a family has the mutation there is a 5050 chance that 
each child will inherit it 
children that show the mutation said friend could then undergo 
periodic intensified examinations for cancer so that the 
malignancies they will almost certainly develop could be found very 
early

two cuban doctors have obtained 
refugee status after seeking asylum in an embassy and at least 
three other cuban medical workers are reportedly hiding 
the two doctors who were granted the documents on thursday 
said at the costa rican ambassadors residence that they were 
anxious to leave the country they said they fear cuban state 
security agents will capture them and take them back to cuba 
cuban security agents remained in nicaragua after the leftist 
sandinistas lost feb 25 elections and turned the government over 
to anticommunist president violeta chamorro 
the government was said to be reluctant to grant the doctors 
exit documents out of fear of an avalanche of cubans seeking to 
flee the country 
at least 300 cuban medical workers still work in nicaragua and 
the government depends on them and other foreign doctors to run its 
public hospitals 
nicaraguan doctors fled in droves during the decade of 
sandinista rule creating a shortage of health care workers 
the interior ministry doesnt want to set a precedent because 
the government could be faced with a wave of defections by cuban 
doctors a wellinformed foreign ministry source said 
the cuban doctors mario antonio reyes morales 29 and 
gilberto marcelino perez franco 30 are neonatal specialists who 
arrived in nicaragua in early 1989 
reyes and perez said they returned to nicaragua nov 22 after a 
onemonth vacation in cuba and learned a cuban nurse had gone into 
hiding intending to defect 
thats when we decided to defect reyes told the associated 
press they asked for asylum at the costa rican embassy the next 
day 
reyes identified the nurse as giovanni domenico 23 who had 
been working at the lenin fonseca hospital in managua 
the foreign ministry source said two other cuban doctors at 
managua hospitals also had disappeared and were presumed to be in 
hiding 
the cubans are looking for them the source said 
repeated calls to the cuban embassy were answered by people who 
said no one there was authorized to speak to reporters 
negotiations among cuban nicaraguan and costa rican officials 
on reyes and perez began tuesday they were granted refugee status 
and given travel documents thursday 
costa rican ambassador carlos aguilar said he had been 
fighting with nicaraguan authorities for the mens papers 
yesterday we told them that if nicaragua didnt solve this 
that costa rica was willing to do anything to help them aguilar 
said 
reyes said he and perez were afraid cuban state security agents 
might hunt them down if they remained in nicaragua 
he recalled the case of another cuban doctor gerardo banguela 
who reyes said sought political asylum in 1983 at the honduran 
embassy in managua 
the cuban state security in nicaragua lured him out using a 
girl and when he came out they jumped him reyes said they 
fractured a femur and other extremities hes still in prison in 
cuba

the resolution passed by the security 
council sanctioning the use of force against iraq echoes another 
passed in 1950 to authorize sending us and other troops to south 
korea 
but the cold war is over and this time the west didnt have to 
sneak the resolution past the soviets 
the measure gives baghdad until jan 15 to pull out of kuwait or 
face possible attack by un member states it was approved 122 
thursday 
the soviet union after wresting a few more weeks grace period 
for iraq supports the latest proposal china hesitant to use 
force against iraq said beforehand it would not vote for the 
resolution but abstained rather than use its veto power 
the eastwest unity is a far cry from the divided atmosphere 
that prevailed in june 1950 when chinesebacked north korea 
invaded south korea 
at that time moscow was boycotting council sessions to protest 
the seating of chinas nationalist government on the world body 
rather than the communist government that took power on the 
mainland a year earlier 
on june 27 1950 the british and french gave a diplomatic boost 
to the united states by introducing a hurriedly prepared 
useofforce resolution 
yes they did go very fast in the council because they 
naturally were afraid the russians would come back said brian 
urquhart who helped organize the world body he retired in 1986 as 
undersecretarygeneral in charge of peacekeeping 
they knew they were doing a dirty deed in the dead of night by 
not consulting with a permanent council member another un 
official said on condition of anonymity 
the united states contributed the largest contingent to a 
16nation force that entered the conflict under un auspices 
north korea china and the un forces signed an armistice in 1953 
but no comprehensive peace has ever been struck 
the 1950 resolution recommends that the members of the united 
nations furnish such assistance to the republic of korea as may be 
necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international 
peace and security in the area 
the new antiiraq resolution is similar in that it gives the 
united states and other allied powers permission to act without any 
direct un control 
the soviet union initially wanted a strong role for the security 
councils military staff committee a group of military advisers 
from the united states soviet union britain france and china 
but the only council involvement called for by the resolution is 
that member states keep the council regularly informed on the 
progress of actions they undertake

police have banned a play about poor 
people saying the performance could cause social unrest some 
leading intellectuals say the police action highlights increasing 
government sensitivity to criticism 
actress ratna riantiarno said the comedy cockroach opera had 
been scheduled to open wednesday for a 10day run at the jakarta 
art center 
the police suddenly came and told us the play was banned 
without giving any clear reason she said thursday 
cockroach opera already had been presented three times in 
1985 in jakarta and the west java capital of bandung she said 
after reading the manuscript we found that the message of the 
play was sensitive and that it could create social unrest said 
maj tm siahaan the district police chief 
lt col latief rabar a spokesman said police and other 
authorities were still studying the ban order he declined to say 
why the play was not banned during its earlier performances in 
1985 
the play deals with poor people whose lives are full of 
suffering said nano riantiarno mrs riantiarnos husband and the 
director of theater koma which was staging the play 
good fortune never comes their way and their place in life 
seems to have been destined in sewers ditches and in dark filthy 
and stinking corners where only cockroaches live he said 
several intellectuals and art critics say the government was 
showing signs of increasing sensitivity 
the government earlier this month banned a new york times 
reporter who wrote an article saying president suhartos decision 
on whether to run for reelection appeared to hinge on whether his 
childrens lucrative businesses would be affected 
suharto was named president in 1968 and was reelected in 1973 
1978 and 1988 
farida feisol director of the jakarta art center noted that 
succession a satirical play by theater koma on the issue of 
succession to power was banned in october on the 12th day of a 
scheduled 14day run 
early this month police stopped wellknown poet ws rendra 
from reading two of his poems just 30 minutes before his 
performance was to have begunpolice said the poems dealing with 
corruption and injustice could cause instability if read in 
public

a former united press international reporter 
claims in a 1275 million lawsuit that she was fired from the news 
service because she is a lesbian and wrote a freelance story for a 
gay publication 
julie brienzas lawsuit was filed thursday in us district 
court upi and wisconsin voice of christian youth a 
milwaukeebased religious group were named as defendants 
brienza who was upis supreme court reporter alleged that she 
was dismissed under pressure from vic eliason the religious 
groups executive director 
in the suit brienza contends that eliason began a campaign to 
have her fired after she interviewed him on april 10 for a 
freelance article she was writing about the influence of the 
religious right on broadcasting 
the suit alleges that eliason buys news from upi and that he 
contacted upi management to complain about brienza writing for the 
washington blade a news weekly he then urged listeners to his 
radio network to jam upis telephone lines demanding her dismissal 
the suit said 
on april 27 upi fired her accusing her of violating 
freelancing rules 
upi terminated brienzas employment because of her sexual 
orientation and because she was writing a freelance article for a 
gay and lesbian newspaper the suit contends 
upi spokesman milt capps said thursday he could not comment on 
the suit until he had seen it but earlier capps had denied that 
brienzas firing was due to pressure from religious broadcasters 
and said it was based on violations of upi work rules 
officials at wisconsin voice of christian youth inc in 
milwaukee did not immediately return a call seeking comment 
the suit seeks 750000 in general damages plus 12 million in 
punitive damages 10 million from eliason and 2 million from upi 
for among other things alleged violation of privacy loss of 
income and violation of a district of columbia law that prohibits 
discrimination in employment based on a persons sexual 
orientation the suit contends wisconsins hate crime law also 
was violated 
besides the 1275 million the suit seeks return of brienzas 
job back pay and a retraction from eliason and his group 
the suit acknowledges that brienza used upis internal message 
system to retrieve information on eliason from the news agencys 
milwaukee bureau and that she made two longdistance phone calls 
for the story from upis washington office 
upi rules according to the suit prohibit employees from 
freelancing on company time doing outside work that could compete 
with upi or writing articles that take an advocacy position 
but brienza at a news conference thursday contended her use of 
company facilities was minimal and that other upi employees 
routinely did the same for personal reasons or for outside work 
she said the blade is not an advocacy publication and that she had 
gotten permission from upi management prior to working on the 
article 
she said upis actions were out of proportion to the offense and 
that the issue in her firing really was her sexual orientation

aids in the united states is rising faster among 
women than men scientists say 
the us centers for disease control projected that by next year 
aids would be the nations fifth leading cause of death among 
american women of childbearing age it is now sixth or seventh 
according to the cdc 
separately the world health organization predicted a dramatic 
increase in the infection rate among women worldwide by the end of 
the century 
both studies were released thursday 
i think these findings are a cause for alarm for almost 
everyone said dr constance wofsy a professor of clinical 
medicine and an aids specialist at the university of california at 
san francisco 
aids still occurs mostly among homosexual men and intravenous 
drug users 
women are most likely to become infected through sex with men 
who carry the virus 
such women rarely suspect they are at risk and often fail to 
take precautions wofsy said symptoms that would alert doctors to 
test for aids in a homosexual do not set off the same red light 
in women wofsy said 
physicians are going to have to become detectives she said 
the atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report that by the end 
of the year aids cases among us women would exceed 15000 about 
11 percent of all reported cases more than 9000 of those women 
will be dead by then it said 
in the last year the aids rate rose 29 percent among women and 
18 percent among men the federal health agency said 
currently cancer is the no 1 killer of women between 15 and 
44 followed by accidental deaths heart disease homicide and 
suicide the cdc said 
seventytwo percent of the american women stricken with aids are 
black or hispanic although those groups account for only 19 
percent of the total us female population the cdc said 
from november 1989 through this october 43 aids cases and 
about 27 deaths were reported per 100000 women in the united 
states 
the who report said the share of global infection by the aids 
virus via sex between men and women would rise from 60 percent now 
to between 75 percent and 80 percent by 2000 
the international health organization forecast that by the end 
of the decade the number of carriers of the aids virus would rise 
to between 25 million and 30 million worldwide including 10 
million babies infected by their mothers 
it said that of the 9 million to 11 million people now carrying 
the aids virus about onethird are women

the bush administration may initiate a program 
next year to vaccinate poor preschoolers as a way of checking a 
recent outbreak in childhood diseases officials say 
so far this year 24163 measles cases have been reported a 67 
percent increase from the same period in 1989 says the centers for 
disease control 
health experts say the problem is that many poorer preschool 
children arent being immunized though under state laws they must 
be innoculated before attending classes 
we need to identify points of contact between 
governmental systems and preschool children dr james o mason 
assistant secretary of health and human services said thursday 
federal officials have discussed mandatory and voluntary 
approaches to immunization they have even considered the 
possibility of making inoculations a requirement for receiving 
welfare or medicaid 
but i dont think anybody is seriously saying no shot no 
welfare said mason no one wants to deny children medicaid 
or welfare benefits 
the president is distressed that we have a significant 
increase in the incidence of childhood disease and health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan is similarly distressed said 
mason 
mason suggested that the finances are basically there 
already for such a program but others disputed him 
moneys got to be there whether its voluntary or enforced 
and it will fall to congress rather than individual states to 
provide it said dr james strain executive director of the 
american academy of pediatrics 
congress appropriates money for childhood vaccines but not 
enough to supply it to everyone who needs it said strain 
one problem officials are thrashing out is how to go about 
immunizing children 
mason suggested that public health professionals might be on 
hand at some point in the welfare or medicaid process to administer 
shots to children 
there are ways to do this short of refusing welfare or 
medicaid benefits said dr thomas vernon executive director of 
the colorado health department 
the recipient could be placed on a timetable for having his or 
her children immunized suggested vernon another approach he 
said might be to have a welfare office require a recipient to go 
to a specific location to get immunization started 
the issue is simply that we need to help every child get 
immunized against measles said mason our problem in the us 
is not schoolage children its before they go to school thats 
where we are having disastrous outbreaks with permanent damage and 
dying children from whooping cough and other childhood diseases

united nations the security council has given iraqi president 
saddam hussein six weeks to pull his troops out of kuwait before 
the united states and its allies in the persian gulf are free to 
launch a military strike 
the council voted 12totwo thursday evening with china 
abstaining and yemen and cuba opposed to give baghdad one final 
opportunity to end its aggression against kuwait which began 
with the aug 2 invasion 
if iraq has not withdrawn its army by jan 15 restored the emir 
of kuwaits government and freed all hostages it holds the 
usled multinational force may use all necessary means to 
force baghdads compliance 
it was the first time in 40 years the council had sanctioned 
force to counter aggression the first and last time was when it 
gave its blessing to usled allies in korea 
iraqi president saddam hussein scoffed at the resolution and 
said iraq was ready to resist even the most advanced us war 
systems 
the americans are still influenced by rambo movies but this 
is not a rambo movie this is something different he said 
thursday we do not underestimate american military power but we 
scorn their evil intentions 
thirteen foreign ministers attended the extraordinary council 
session with secretary of state james a baker iii presiding 
making it one of the highestlevel council meetings in history 
today we have started the countdown of the pause of good 
will said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze we 
are confident that before the time is up a turn toward peace will 
have occurred and that the pause will usher in a transition to a 
political settlement 
if not said british foreign secretary douglas hurd no one 
can accuse the council of impatience the military option is 
reality not bluff if it has to be used it will be used with the 
full backing of the council 
in washington president bush called the un vote a very 
strong and powerful message it will go around the world loud and 
clear that this guys got to get out of there 
joining the united states britain and the soviet union in 
voting for the resolution were france canada colombia ethiopia 
finland ivory coast malaysia romania and zaire 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen said china which supported 
11 previous un resolutions did not veto the measure thursday 
because it shares outrage over iraqs aggression but that china 
could not sanction an allied attack 
the united nations should act with great caution and avoid 
taking hasty actions on such a major question as authorizing some 
member states to take military actions he said 
the resolution made no mention of a un military command or any 
un role in overseeing a possible international military 
operation the soviet union has said soviet forces only would be 
committed to a military operation under un auspices 
shevardnadze later told reporters the soviet union would not 
consider committing any troops at this time he cited painful 
memories of world war ii 
the iraqis appeared intransigent 
if war is imposed upon us by the united states this will be 
our destiny said iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari 
our people will not kneel we will rise to this 
responsibility he said as baker glared at him and fidgeted 
impatiently 
sitting in the council chamber below a mural of a peaceful world 
arising from the ashes of war kuwaits foreign minister said iraq 
is pushing the region to a conflagration which we do not want 
but which appears to be the only avenue to restore our rights 
the kuwaiti sheikh sabah alahmad aljaber reviled the wild 
beasts from iraq whom he said were pillaging his country and 
murdering his people 
iraqs ambassador linked his nations cooperation with western 
efforts to promote a general mideast peace settlement including a 
homeland for the palestinians 
iraq calls for peace it desires peace not for us alone but 
for the entire middle east region alanbari said 
nine affirmative votes were required for passage any of the 
five permanent council members the united states the soviet 
union britain france and china could have vetoed the measure 
the other members change on a rotating basis 
the council resolution strengthens bushs hand with congress and 
the american people in calling for offensive action against 
baghdad 
hearings on the gulf crisis continued on capitol hill with 
criticism thursday from former navy secretary james webb who added 
his voice to those questioning bushs plan to send another 200000 
troops to saudi arabia to back up the 240000 already there 
the presidents mistake in sending so many troops should not 
be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature 
unprovoked ground offensive webb said

in another sign of a weakening economy the number of people on 
welfare rose in all but one state in the past year 
an associated press survey of welfare rolls in all 50 states 
found that only wisconsin had bucked the trend partly because it 
enacted pioneering programs to get people off welfare 
although a troubled economy was the villain in many states it 
was not the sole reason or even the most important one in 
others 
officials in some states attributed the increase to changes in 
immigration law or to programs that help poor people apply for 
welfare some mentioned changes in federal medicaid requirements 
that have brought more people into the welfare system 
and some were simply stumped by the upsurge 
our economy is good the employment picture is good so were 
not sure what factors are responsible said alfred k suga 
deputy director of hawaiis department of human services 
hawaii had one of the smallest increases 11 percent in the 
number of households receiving aid to families with dependent 
children the benchmark welfare program new hampshire had the 
largest 46 percent 
those numbers are startling said tom pryor an 
administrator in new hampshires office of economic services the 
primary reason that we see for that increase has been the decline 
in the new england economy 
elsewhere in new england afdc caseloads went up 25 percent in 
vermont 19 percent in connecticut 14 percent in maine and rhode 
island and 10 percent in massachusetts 
the southwest also was hard hit by welfare increases partly 
because new immigration rules allowed more noncitizens to qualify 
for welfare 
the afdc caseload was up 9 percent in california where nearly 2 
million people were receiving benefits in september it rose 23 
percent in arizona 17 percent in texas and 14 percent in new 
mexico 
many states attributed the increase to their own efforts to 
reach out to poor people and enroll them in welfare programs some 
have adopted a onestop shopping concept for social services 
so that poor people seeking one form of public assistance are given 
access to others 
another factor has been a federal mandate that makes medicaid 
available to more pregnant women and infants this has caused huge 
jumps in medicaid caseloads they are up 46 percent in indiana 
for instance and has also caused a spillover into other programs 
such as afdc and food stamps 
when someone comes in and asks for medicaid we dont just 
check to see if they are eligible for medicaid we check to see if 
they are eligible for more services said sherron heinemann 
spokeswoman for the texas department of human services 
the government has no current figures for afdc caseloads 
nationwide the average monthly caseload for 1989 the most recent 
year for which figures were available was 379 million households 
there are more recent figures for food stamps the agriculture 
department says there were 202 million people receiving food 
stamps in september up 7 percent from the year before 
the farm belt and portions of the deep south have come closest 
to resisting the welfare upsurge farm states such as north dakota 
iowa and kansas have shown increases of less than 1 percent as 
have such southern states as mississippi alabama and louisiana 
wisconsins afdc caseload actually dropped 2 percent in the past 
year and that came after three years of even larger declines 
officials attribute the drop to a strong state economy and 
experiments that require children of welfare recipients to stay in 
school and welfare mothers to work or attend school the state 
provides day care for working welfare recipients 
what we are seeing is the payoff of the efforts to encourage 
people to move from welfare to independence said elizabeth 
sniderallen of the state division of economic support 
the rise in welfare caseloads in other states will be costly 
the federal government pays the entire cost of food stamps an 
estimated 141 billion this year but states pay anywhere from 
325 percent to 50 percent of the cost of afdc 
what will states do asked marcia howard research director 
for the national association of state budget officers theyll 
just pay it they really dont have a choice and they will 
divert funds from other programs to do it most likely 
the rising caseloads also may mean that states will be less 
likely to increase eligibility or benefits for afdc which already 
are well beneath the federal poverty level in most states in 
alabama for instance a single parent and two children receive 
124 a month in afdc benefits 
the money barely keeps them intact said tony lee a 
lobbyist for the poor in washington state which pays an average of 
545 per month for families on afdc they stagger from one crisis 
to the next the rent the telephone bill the lights they just 
dont have the energy and everything else it takes to make it

the un security council for years 
divided and ineffectual has been widely praised for its newfound 
courage in a series of bold resolutions aimed at ending iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
but in its latest and toughest resolution adopted thursday 
authorizing military force to eventually evict iraq it may have 
undertaken its most dangerous mission 
after successes in peacemaking and peacekeeping in afghanistan 
the iraniraq ceasefire namibia central america western sahara 
and soon in cambodia the united nations has encountered in the 
gulf what may be the postcold war litmus test of its 
effectiveness 
the last time the un security council approved the use of 
force to redress aggression was in 1950 in the korean conflict 
never before has the council acted so swiftly and decisively to 
counter aggression as soon as it erupted un resolutions have led 
to sweeping economic sanctions against iraq enforced by an air 
embargo and a maritime embargo on the high seas the council 
sanctioned the use of force to implement the trade embargo 
in the iraniraq war the council waited seven years before 
approving resolution 598 in 1987 demanding an immediate end to the 
war that resolution failed to impose sanctions against either 
side 
iranian diplomats said iraq probably felt emboldened by lack of 
un action in the iraniraq war when it invaded kuwait on aug 2 
in its 12th resolution condemning iraqs aggression the council 
thursday voted 122 with china abstaining to sanction a military 
strike if iraqi troops do not withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 cuba 
and yemen opposed the decision 
military action is sanctioned but not mandated and therein 
lies the rub some diplomats say 
if the united nations and its members fail to achieve a peaceful 
settlement which all of them say they seek the organization will 
be faulted for lack of effectiveness 
failing a peaceful settlement if there is no military followup 
the organization and its members will be faulted for lack of 
commitment 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the security council 
thursday we must not let the united nations go the way of the 
league of nations we must fulfill our common vision of a peaceful 
and just postcold war world 
but if we are to do so we must meet the threat to 
international peace created by saddam husseins aggression 
he cited the conquest of ethiopia by italy in 1936 likening it 
to iraqs invasion of kuwait emperor haile selassies appeal to 
the league of nations ultimately fell upon deaf ears 
the leagues efforts to redress aggression failed baker 
said and international disorder and war ensued history now has 
given us another chance 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told the council 
that iraqs conquest of kuwait confronts the council with the 
first extremely grave test of the postcold war period 
no member of the council he said seeks a bellicose outcome of 
the crisis but neither should anyone be mistaken about the 
collective will of the international community about its resolve 
and readiness to act he said 
former un undersecretarygeneral brian urquhart a key player 
in peacekeeping efforts during uns lean years in the 1970s and 
early 1980s called the councils effectiveness really an 
astonishing turnabout 
i think this will be genuinely a turning point in human 
history because this will be the test of whether collective 
security is a valid response to aggression

grant recently approved by congress members of american legion 
post 377 say it now looks like the venerable warship will win its 
last battle 
just about everybody else thinks were crazy but someday this 
will be a firstclass naval museum and everyone that sees it will 
be proud said gordon pfluger legion post commander 
the posts efforts to acquire the ship and convert it into a 
museum have put it 750000 in debt and entangled it in a lawsuit 
with another group that had plans to use at least part of the 
vessel as a floating casino 
the ship was taken over by federal marshals after carter green 
redd inc of gulfport miss sued for return of 47000 it said it 
paid for the rights to open a casino 
blaine kern a member of the foundation created to run the ship 
said the casino plan was nixed after the spanish government which 
last owned the vessel objected he said a settlement with carter 
green redd inc is being pursued 
the ship commissioned in 1943 saw service in the pacific until 
the end of world war ii surviving two kamikaze attacks its crew 
earned nine battle stars and the presidential unit citation for 
extraordinary heroism in action 
in 1967 the cabot was transferred to the spanish government and 
became the sns dedalo flagship of the spanish navy it was retired 
last year 
it was sitting there just rusting away said legion member 
herb wagner the spanish government said that if we would use it 
as a joint spanishamerican museum we could have it 
in 1989 the carrier steamed up the mississippi river to new 
orleans where it was presented to the cabotdedalo museum 
foundation made up of kern members of the legion post and 
others 
but when the foundation tried to dock the ship across from the 
citys famous french quarter the coast guard balked 
the currents along the west bank of the river are too 
strong pfluger said 
so the ship sits at a condemned wharf where wagner said it is 
racking up 1000 a day in docking fees 
its electricity was shut off when the foundation couldnt pay a 
4100 bill and it caught fire earlier this year about the time 
the federal government declared it a national landmark the fire 
caused 15000 damage 
the fire damage is covered by insurance wagner said but the 
foundation owes the insurance company 40000 
when all the financial problems are sorted out the legion hopes 
to move the ship to nearby kenner and begin renovations 
we cant afford to quit now wagner said weve got too 
much in this thing weve raised and spent three quarters of a 
million dollars and we only have 89 members weve done everything 
but hold up convenience stores do you know how many bingo games 
weve held

the dollar surged sharply against the yen friday 
as market players sought a safe investment after the un security 
council adopted a resolution to permit the use of force to drive 
iraq from kuwait 
the weaker yen and possibility of war in the middle east helped 
push share prices down dealers said 
the dollar closed at 13275 yen up 260 yen from thursdays 
close of 13015 after opening at 13370 yen it ranged from 13240 
to 13385 yen in active trading totaling 1844 billion 
the dollar is traditionally seen as a safe investment in times 
of international tensions while the yen is weakened by possibility 
of war in the gulf because japan imports virtually all its oil 
the dollars jump followed its overnight advance in new york 
where it closed at 13325 yen as investors anticipated the un 
decision 
but buying slowed after the dollar hit the mid133yen levels 
and a move to buy back the yen resurfaced traders said 
there is still a fundamental sense that the american economy 
is in bad shape said yoshiyuki kawai a foreign exchange dealer 
at the tokai bank 
on the stock market the 225issue nikkei stock average closed 
at 2245463 points down 25797 points or 114 percent from 
thursdays finish of 2271260 points 
volume on the first section was 320 million shares up from 300 
million shares thursday 
takuo futamura of sanyo securities said the markets bearish 
sentiments in the face of middle east tensions resembled the way 
share prices drooped during emperor hirohitos illness before his 
death in january 1989 
investors are also wary of the declining trend in japans 
economy he said 
we see severe times ahead said a dealer at cosmo 
securities who spoke on condition of anonymity

people from illinois to arkansas are 
divided over whether a climatologists scientifically shaky 
forecast of an earthquake during the next few days is cause to 
party or reason to get all shook up 
in some places schools are closing disaster drills are being 
staged sales of bottled water canned food and earthquake 
insurance have jumped 
i think we have everything in place said elaine van horn of 
memphis a believer whose family joined 11 others to put up a 
stockpile of emergency food and camping gear weve been working 
on this probably since about august 
others are amused 
a rock band called the rhythm hounds planned a shake rattle 
and quake night sunday at the pamph cafe a memphis beer hall a 
pub called zinnies east advertised halfprice specials monday at 
an its your fault earthquake party 
in falls city neb the owner of a variety store recently ran 
this advertisement its new madrids fault its an earthquake 
sale nov 26 to dec 8 if were still here were shaking down 
our prices 
eday if you will is sometime around monday thats according 
to new mexico climatologist iben browning who last summer said 
there was a 50 percent chance of a strong quake on the new madrid 
fault within 48 hours on either side of dec 3 
the fault runs from cairo ill to marked tree ark about 35 
miles east of memphis 
its nonsense said brian mitchell director of the 
department of earth and atmospheric sciences at st louis 
university 
an advisory panel to the us geological survey said brownings 
forecast has no scientific merit that word was tempered however 
with the warning that a quake could happen at any time its just 
that dec 3 has no special significance the panel said 
memphis with 650000 residents is the closest big city to the 
fault which produces more than 200 small earthquakes a year 
scientists give a 60 percent chance of a strong new madrid 
temblor over the next 15 years over 50 years the probability is 
better than 90 percent but scientists say no one can predict the 
exact day of an earthquake 
schools in parts of tennessee arkansas missouri kentucky and 
illinois canceled classes early next week officials at those 
schools generally in small towns and rural areas say attendance 
would be low if classes were held 
earthquake disaster drills have been staged throughout the 
region and many businesses expect more workers than usual to be 
absent on monday 
don wood a spokesman for the memphis and shelby county 
emergency management agency said some residents apparently will 
leave the area for a few days 
i know people who say theyre going to new orleans and wonder 
if the mississippi river will flood them down there if the 
earthquake hits here wood said 
browning 72 bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the 
sun and moon which he says will be particularly strong during the 
prediction period 
if the new madrid fault does produce a strong quake one of these 
days it will likely be in the low 6range on the richter scale 
scientists say a quake of that magnitude could cause serious 
damage 
the fault produced a series of such earthquakes in 1811 and 
1812 their strength estimated at 80 or higher on the richter 
scale which did not exist at the time they were the strongest 
earthquakes in us history

scandinavians have plans to quickly 
erect refugee camps and reinforce their borders if a predicted 
harsh winter brings a tide of soviet refugees officials say 
but the nordic countries are also readying food aid with the 
hope that if the soviets are wellfed at home theyll stay there 
our policy is to feed them so they dont have to come 
across the border at all said asko mattila a finnish foreign 
ministry official 
a worst worstcase scenario with a great migration like 
wolf packs welling over the border is not something we regard 
as possible said bjorn blokhus of the norwegian foreign 
ministry 
a legislator in moscow told nordic parliamentarians last month 
that up to 6 million soviet refugees could head west in search of 
better living conditions soviet officials say they have enough 
food but havent been able to distribute it properly 
germany motivated by wishes for soviet stability as well as 
gratitude for president mikhail s gorbachevs role in german 
unification has committed 195 billion in aid and credits to 
moscow on thursday bonn decided to give the soviets the 340 
million in food and medical supplies that were stockpiled in west 
berlin after the 194849 berlin blockade 
swedish officials have developed a plan to put up emergency 
shelters and extra security that could go into effect within 24 
hours it is described as an operation of last resort 
swedish immigration minister majlis louw said the way to 
prevent a flood of economic refugees is to make it clear ahead of 
time they will not be accepted in scandinavia long known for 
generous asylum laws 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen said the migration 
of soviet and eastern european citizens could dwarf current refugee 
problems 
this problem will place huge demands on our resources he 
said 
although neither denmark nor sweden border the soviet union 
refugees could enter by ferry across the baltic sea the recent 
arrival in finland of hundreds of somalis who flew from africa 
through moscow gave nordic leaders a glimpse of what could happen 
when the soviet union ends travel restrictions on its citizens 
the norwegian military has announced it is prepared to donate 
the food tents and medicines it has stockpiled for war to refugees 
who might want to cross the 70mile arctic border with the soviet 
union 
in a military sense i dont think it a soviet food shortage 
has much significance unless a civil war breaks out and of 
course that is possible said dagfinn danielsen the northern 
norwegian military commander 
finnish officials deny news reports they plan to build refugee 
camps or increase guards along the 800mile border the longest any 
western nation shares with the soviet union 
we dont even consider it a possibility that thousands of 
soviets will rush across our border said gen matti autio 
commander of the border guard 
but the finns will send thousands of tons of meat and potatoes 
to the soviet province of karelia which partly belonged to finland 
before world war ii the food shipment is a commercial deal 
though not charity 
i know those people very well they are very hardy and a mere 
food shortage is not going to drive them over here said teuvo 
korpelainen county mayor in tohmajarvi 10 miles from the soviet 
border 
forecasts say temperatures may fall below minus 40 degrees this 
winter in karelia 
its the cold that will do it if anything said 
korpelainen if they run out of heating oil and the temperature 
falls to minus 40 degrees then well see them over here 
in 1989 finnish officials issued 65000 visas to soviets more 
than 200000 have already been issued this year because moscow has 
eased travel restrictions 
three new border posts have been temporarily opened but autio 
said the 3600man guard force would not be strengthened 
we can manage with the men we have he said

the daily news has filed a 150 million 
racketeering lawsuit accusing its striking unions of using violence 
in an organized effort to win their demands or force the sale of 
the newspaper 
the lawsuit filed thursday in federal court claims the alleged 
conspiracy included attempted murder arson and robbery 
police officials have said they found no evidence of a 
conspiracy in 229 incidents during the 5weekold strike 
the lawsuit claims strikers are using violence to achieve one of 
two goals forcing the tabloid into accepting wasteful contracts or 
making it accept a union buyout plan 
named as defendants are the newspaper and mail deliverers union 
of new york and vicinity the allied printing trades council the 
umbrella group representing the nine striking unions and 23 
drivers 
theodore kheel the unions unpaid legal adviser said the 
underpinning of this lawsuit was blown out of the water at a 
state legislative hearing monday when police officials testified 
they had found no conspiracy 
nine of the tabloids 10 unions representing some 2100 strikers 
began a walkout oct 25 the paper has published daily but 
distribution has been spotty advertisers have pulled out and 
delivery trucks and newsstands have been attacked 
the lawsuit seeks 50 million in damages which can be tripled 
under racketeering law to 150 million if the newspaper wins

the german rush to help the russians stave off a 
hungry winter is rooted in the generosity of a wealthy country 
worry over a return to stalinism in moscow and a frank admission of 
german guilt for world war ii 
above all germany is thanking soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev for not blocking the unification of east and west 
germany 
we know that on this difficult path to unity you were with us 
you helped us and we are grateful chancellor helmut kohl said 
in a speech welcoming gorbachev to germany early this month 
although gorbachev appealed publicly for more aid during his 
visit the german government was at first reluctant 
germany already had committed a whopping 195 billion in aid 
and credits to moscow largely to finance the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from the formerly communist eastern part of germany 
on thursday however germany took a step that gave rich meaning 
to the treaty of friendship nonaggression and cooperation that 
gorbachev and kohl signed on nov 9 the first anniversary of the 
opening of the berlin wall 
the government decided to give the soviets the mass of 
foodstuffs and medical supplies that were built up in west berlin 
against a repeat of the 194849 berlin blockade in which josef 
stalin tried to starve the wests isolated island in berlin the 
government values the reserve at 340 million 
kohl in this decision appeared to be several steps behind the 
public especially in berlin where the suggestion arose almost two 
weeks earlier to give the soviets the berlin reserve 
on thursday a planeload of 25000 prepackaged meals for 
childrens hospitals and orphanages flew from hanover to moscow in 
the first shipment by german charities aimed at easing the chaotic 
food situation in the soviet union 
organizers say the relief airlift will fly every day an echo of 
the immense us and british airlift that saved west berlin four 
decades earier 
at the same time the masscirculation bild newspaper started 
its own campaign a heart for russia encouraging the public 
to assemble aid packets or donate 34 50 marks minimum to a 
special red cross fund for soviet hunger relief 
stefan gaensicke spokesman for the axel springer publishers 
that own bild said the campaign sprang from the companys lone 
crusade since 1958 for german unity 
when it finally came about we knew damn well to whom we 
really owe it all to the man in moscow who said it makes sense 
well have to let the east germans go gaensicke said 
on wednesday the grassroots campaign took on an official 
character kohl went on zdf television to appeal for donations 
the zdf program showed empty soviet stores russian women 
fighting over blocks of cheese and an expose of the 
blackmarketeers who steal food sometimes letting it rot if they 
cant sell it 
stern magazine allied with zdf in the campaign said thursday 
it was donating 340000 stern called on all germans to help 
rescue 20 million to 50 million soviets from a hunger winter 
it is a commandment of humanity especially for us germans 
who inflicted immeasurabee suffering on those people in world war 
ii twentysix million soviet citizens lost their lives the 
weeklys editorial said 
it reported that some soviets now say that under stalin they at 
least had bread if not freedom we cannot permit a new stalin to 
take power in the kremlin just because the hungry are screaming 
for bread stern said 
the german union of warwounded and handicapped people which 
has 500000 members is supervising the delivery of aid packets to 
old peoples homes groups of the handicapped and families with 
small children 
the german shippers organization put out a call to its members 
for trucks and expertise in surmounting the road rail and 
bureaucratic bottlenecks in the soviet union

harry m caudill an author whose 1963 
expose of appalachias social and enviromental problems helped 
inspire president lyndon johnsons war on poverty in the 1960s 
shot himself to death at age 68 
the muckraking writer lawyer historian and state lawmaker died 
thursday a friend said caudill suffered from parkinsons disease 
and a world war ii injury to his foot and had been depressed 
caudills writings helped shape federal programs to control 
strip mining improve mine safety and eradicate poverty his 
night comes to the cumberlands in 1963 was credited with 
bringing appalachias problems to the nations attention 
coal has always cursed the land in which it lies when men 
begin to wrest it from the earth it leaves a legacy of foul 
streams hideous slag heaps and polluted air caudill wrote in 
the book it mars but never beautifies it corrupts but never 
purifies 
johnson subsequently backed a wide range of social programs to 
develop the region the president used the appalachian mountains as 
a backdrop when he announced his war on poverty at a tarpaper shack 
near inez in 1964 
by last spring caudill had written 10 books 80 newspaper 
essays and editorials and some 50 magazine articles 
harry was always the one to challenge the unchallengable 
said ron eller director of the appalachian studies center at the 
university of kentucky 
he was the one to speak out and the one to confront the 
corporations and the wealthy that kind of courage is what made him 
a champion to those in the region 
caudill shot himself in the head with a pistol while seated in 
his yard which has a view of pine mountain an imposing ridge he 
cherished deeply 
he did it in typical harry style to go outside and be near 
the mountains said edison banks jr letcher county assistant 
commonwealths attorney and a former student of caudills 
his struggle with parkinsons and a war wound restricted his 
mobility in recent months said tom gish a publisher of the 
mountain eagle newspaper in whitesburg and a boyhood friend gish 
said caudill had been depressed 
caudill was born in whitesburg served in the army and graduated 
from the university of kentucky college of law in 1948 
he championed education reform during three terms he served in 
the kentucky house from 1954 to 1957 and from 1960 to 1962 
he turned to writing in the early 1960s and taught appalachian 
history for eight years at the university of kentucky until his 
retirement in 1985 
he is survived by his wife anne a daughter and two sons

the woman whose court case gave west 
virginias psychiatric patients freedom to live with as few 
restrictions as possible drowned after wandering off during a visit 
to a doctor authorities say 
ella hartley 53 died tuesday she was last seen alive at an 
ohio river boat dock where she told bystanders she was going for a 
swim said police capt paul price 
on hartleys behalf the appalachian research and defense fund 
a public advocacy group filed a classaction lawsuit seeking more 
freedom for mentally ill people able to care for themselves 
in what became known as the hartley decision the kanawha county 
circuit court ruled in 1982 that mentally ill persons should be 
kept in the least restrictive environment possible 
the decision resulted in huntington state hospitals mental 
patient population falling from 1500 to 90 
the idea was that the mentally ill would do better if they 
were placed in the community than they would if they were cooped up 
in a mental institution said richard christopher a patient 
advocate at the hospital 
but he said the people released back into the community never 
received the support and supervision they required and that it 
created the circumstances for an accident like hartleys to occur 
people kept coming back through the system and somewhere 
along the line someone is bound to get hurt he said 
state health officials refused to discuss hartleys case 
hartley was a temporary patient at huntington on tuesday when a 
hospital employee took her to a doctors office nearby sometime 
during the visit she left the escorts supervision 
her sister sue davis said that although hartley maintained her 
own apartment she had frequently been hospitalized and a hearing 
on whether to commit her had been scheduled for thursday 
she said her sister suffered from a chemical imbalance that 
causes erratic behavior the malady can be controlled with drugs 
but she said hartley had apparently stopped taking them 
john ambrose of the national mental health association in 
alexandria va said the hartley decision was part of a national 
trend toward releasing mental patients that began in the 1970s 
sidney kapantias of the huntington information and referral 
service a social service agency said counselors there were well 
aware of hartleys role in changing the way the mentally ill are 
cared for 
it was always stunning to people to know that it was her 
classaction lawsuit that facilitated the release of so many people 
from mental hospitals he said was she a victim of her own 
law i dont know

a former us soldier born in kuwait was 
behind bars today on charges of plotting to kill president bush and 
attack military bases 
jamal mohamed warrayat 32 allegedly discussed with an 
undercover fbi agent plans to kill bush as well as secretary of 
state james baker and members of congress 
court papers said he also conspired as the leader of a group of 
seven people to attack unspecified military installations in north 
carolina and texas 
none of the others was named or charged thursday 
at this point in time there is no evidence to show that any 
foreign government promoted or assisted in this activity us 
attorney michael chertoff said thursday he gave no motive or would 
not comment further 
warrayat was held without bail at the metropolitan correctional 
center in new york he could get up to 10 years in prison and a 
500000 fine if convicted 
defense attorney terence scott said the charges stemmed from 
warrayats ramblings and were not supported by evidence 
warrayat was born in kuwait moved to the united states in the 
early 1970s became a citizen and served about four years in the 
army until 1979 scott said

if war is imposed upon us by the united states this will be

the council is but a willing tool in the hands of the american

iraq calls for peace it desires peace not for us alone but 
for the entire middle east region 
this would be the most dangerous resolution ever passed by the 
security council and a violation of the un charter

our aim today must be to convince saddam hussein that the 
just humane demands of the council and the international community 
cannot be ignored 
if iraq does not reverse its course peacefully then other 
necessary measures including the use of force should be 
authorized we must put the choice to saddam hussein in 
unmistakable terms 
todays resolution is clear the words authorize the use of 
force but the purpose i truly believe is to bring about a 
peaceful resolution

we want begin the pause of good will by calling upon iraq and 
president saddam hussein to rise above considerations of prestige 
to display wisdom and foresight and place above all else the 
interest of the country and fate of its people 
those who break the peace should know that all necessary means 
will indeed inexorably be used against them 
all of us would only be happy if the need to resort to such 
means did not arise 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
french foreign minister roland dumas 
can we then tolerate such a blatant challenge for any extended 
period of time especially in a region which is highly sensitive 
where the expectations for security and stability call for special 
consideration 
aggression should no longer be considered the privilege of the 
strong the misfortune of the weak and the object of resignation 
for all the rest 
this text is also consistent with the logic of the attitude 
iraq has displayed if iraq chooses to remain deaf to the appeal 
for reason and respect for law that is to say remains locked into 
the use of force what other choice are we left with but to resort 
to this same means which would appear to be the only ones it 
recognizes

by another is an act on its own it undermines and threatens the 
whole structure of international order and thus the safety of all 
our citizens 
withdrawal must be complete if not then member states are 
authorized acting with the government of kuwait to use such force 
as may be necessary to compel compliance 
there is an option for peace and the iraqis hold it in their 
hands it is for them to use that option or discard it 
the military option is reality not bluff if it has to be 
used it will be used with the full backing of the council

the security council has taken a decision of immense portent 
i would like to stress that even on the most stringent reading 
the resolution just dopted envisages at least 45 days of earnest

relatives of american hostages are agonizing over the un 
resolution aimed at driving iraq from kuwait many noting that 
while force may be the only answer it will put the lives of their 
loved ones in danger 
the resolution adopted by the un security council on 
thursday authorizes an attack if iraqi president saddam hussein 
doesnt withdraw his troops from kuwait and free all hostages by 
jan 15 
ive got a son over there and of course when the bullets 
start flying hes in danger said george carroll of winfield 
kan but i still think its about all we can do we cant let 
this go on forever 
carrolls son a pediatric neurologist is trapped in the us 
embassy in kuwait 
some hostage families said the ultimatum itself might endanger 
the estimated 900 americans stranded in iraq or kuwait 
kristine knutson said she is anxious about what iraqi troops 
might do in the face of a jan 15 deadline her husband has been in 
hiding since the couple decided she and their four young children 
should flee to minnesota 
for his peace of mind it might help knowing theres a 
deadline said ms knutson who asked that her maiden name be 
used to protect her husbands identity but i wonder how the 
iraqis will react to the increased pressure 
david mcdonald jr who has a close friend in hiding in kuwait 
said he believes his friend a midwestern dentist would support 
the resolution 
my friend is not a warmonger but i think he realizes its the 
only realistic option if saddam is to be stopped he said 
but donnita cole who was among a group of hostage relatives 
scheduled to visit the iraqi capital of baghdad next week said she 
cannot abide an offensive stance at least not until every 
diplomatic option is exhausted 
i want to know what gives our president the power to decide 
that on a certain date were going to start a war said mrs 
cole whose husband is among western hostages being held by iraq as 
human shields to discourage an attack 
what gives him the power in the month of november to say that 
in january were going to start a war she asked it should not 
be an american military offensive as a presidential option but as 
an act of congress and the people congress is supposed to 
represent 
at least the resolution puts some kind of a time frame on it 
all said bonnie anderton whose husband has taken refuge at the 
us embassy in baghdad 
but its just another ratcheting of the stakes mrs 
anderton said from larkspur colo and saddam has said hes 
going to ignore it 
jennifer williams 21 who is planning a trip to baghdad to 
plead for freedom for her father and stepmother said the deadline 
is spurring her to do as much as she can while she still has the 
chance her parents are being held as human shields 
i think many people in my situation would do the same thing 
said the student at southern methodist university in dallas 
its not an option its something i have to do she said 
i dont want my family to die in a war and because of this 
deadline i feel like i need to act quickly

fortyeight thousand mine workers walked 
off the job today in the largest strike since turkey granted unions 
the right to strike in 1963 
the strike followed the breakdown in contract negotiations 
between the mine workers union and the stateowned mine research 
insitute and the coal mines enterprise 
in response the employers said they will begin a lockout 
tuesday 
turkish papers reported today that the government had dispatched 
special commando units of the army to the region to prevent any 
violence in the province 
in negotiations which lasted six months the government 
companies offered annual pay raises of about 75 percent the unions 
demanded that the wages be raised fivefold in view of high 
inflation and what they deemed insufficient raises in the past 
the average monthly wage for a miner working in the coal pits 
was 180 and the union was demanding 900 
union president hasan huseyin kayabasi told workers at the 
largest mining area of zonguldak that this strike is the start of 
a process to get rid of those who have condemned workers to wages 
of misery 
he was referring to the ruling motherland party and its policies 
to keep wages low despite inflation of around 60 percent in recent 
years 
contract talks broke off wednesday after president turgut ozal 
founder of the motherland told reporters the workers were 
demanding too much 
after hearing ozals remark union officials said there was no 
use attending a meeting with cabinet ministers designed to resolve 
the pay dispute 
most of the striking workers are employed in coal mines in the 
province of zonguldak on the black sea coast

a mistrial was declared in the negligent 
homicide case of a woman who relied on faith instead of medicine to 
heal her leukemiastricken son 
district judge bruce bennett declared a mistrial thursday night 
when the jury after eight hours of deliberation said it could not 
reach a verdict 
anneta williamson 43 of loranger was tried in the 1989 death 
of her 5yearold son don mrs williamson is a member of a 
fundamentalist christian denomination that believes in curing the 
ill through prayer and fasting 
the prosecution did not immediately indicate whether it would 
retry mrs williamson 
the defense had cited a 1985 law was designed to protect 
christian scientists who also practice faith healing the law 
holds that religious healing instead of medical treatment shall 
not for that reason alone be considered to be criminally 
negligent mistreatment or neglect of a child 
however assistant attorney general ken dejean argued that the 
1985 law does not apply in cases of negligent homicide 
the prosecutions final witness dr sheila moore a specialist 
in childrens cancer had testified that 60 percent to 70 percent 
of children who develop leukemia recover

a huge fleet is hauling hundreds of 
thousands of tons of tanks cannons and other materiel to the 
multinational force in saudi arabia in one of the biggest military 
sealifts in history 
some 150 naval and merchant ships now in a second wave as new 
thousands of troops are sent to the region have transported nearly 
2 million tons of equipment and supplies to the 350000member 
allied force since iraqs invasion of kuwait 
maj gen william pagonis commander of military logistics for 
operation desert shield said the sealift augmented by a 
3000plane airlift is probably unheard of in history 
in vietnam it took five or six years to have this many troops 
on the ground even in korea they never moved this amount of 
people and materiel this rapidly 
between early august and midnovember uschartered ships 
carried more than 2000 tanks hundreds of other armored vehicles 
and artillery guns us officials in saudi arabia say 
another 185000 tons of materiel were airlifted from the united 
states and germany along with 190000 troops 
britain france egypt and syria also transported hundreds of 
tanks armored vehicles guns missiles and helicopters along with 
thousands of troops in some 60 vessels 
now theres a second wave as president bush bolsters us forces 
with another 200000 troops marines sailors and airmen and all 
their hardware 
close to 100 ships were involved in the first wave about 60 
percent of them government owned 
its a heyday for the merchant marine said cmdr jamie 
baldwin who commands a group of naval reserve officers involved in 
the sealift civilians are contributing substantially to the 
sealift 
the first ships were the rollon rolloff ships of the us 
maritime prepositioning squadron which left the indian ocean 
island of diego garcia 2100 miles east of the gulf on aug 7 
the ships arrived aug 15 
next came the afloat prepositioning force ships also based in 
diego garcia which carried army and air force equipment these 
civilianmanned ships were followed by the fast sealift support 
converted container ships that carried army infantry division 
equipment 
then came the ready reserve force ships which were activated 
for operation desert shield 
the last group included merchant ships chartered to the us 
government they included various ship types and included 
foreignflagged vessels 
it was incredible said a shipping executive based in saudi 
arabia one hundred vessels came in three months an average of 
one a day i wouldnt think that even in world war ii there was 
such movement at such speed 
the united states has appealed to its nato allies to provide 
more ships and transport planes to move men and materiel to the 
gulf naval officials have been quoted as saying most were 
available at either commercial charter rates or for free 
most of the first wave of ships came 7000 miles from the united 
states the us government likened the task to moving a midsize 
city halfway around the world 
the second wave is coming mainly from europe which cuts down 
sailing time by midjanuary the sealift is expected to have 
transported three us armored divisions from germany 
the eastern saudi ports and jubail 150 miles south of the 
kuwaiti border and dammam further south are the main unloading 
centers for the us sealift 
pagonis said the huge modern facilities there were a major 
factor in keeping the flow running smoothly with as many as 10 
vessels unloading at a time on some days 
the british french egyptians and syrians which between them 
have deployed or are sending more than 50000 troops and hundreds 
of tanks use the red sea port of yanbu

fusao harada has toiled most of his 60 
years in a family rice paddy in this rustic village stubbornly 
surviving war poverty and an only son who shuns farming 
but his biggest challenge may be yet to come if the japanese 
government bows to us pressure and decides to remove a ban on 
imported rice that is much cheaper 
harada a stocky man whose nearly six acres of land stretches 
toward treecovered hills on the eastern edge of tokyo says he is 
ready to meet that challenge 
as a farmer i cant bear to see a rice field overgrown with 
weeds he said 
but other farmers are less sanguine 
opening up the rice market will lead to the destruction of 
japanese farming said teiichi tanaka 63 a farmer from niigata 
prefecture in central japan competition with cheap us imports 
would be akin to making a toddler fight against a sumo 
wrestler 
the japanese government has long protected its farmers by 
banning virtually all rice imports claiming the country needed to 
remain self sufficient in its staple grain the price of japanese 
rice is about 24 times that of us rice according to agriculture 
ministry statistics 
pressure has been applied on japan to show its commitment to 
free trade by gradually easing the ban vice president dan quayle 
made a pitch for opening the market during a november meeting with 
prime minister toshiki kaifu in tokyo 
the issue may come to a head in december during a crucial 
international meeting on trade in brussels 
many farmers are predicting dire consequences for japanese 
agriculture if the ban is lifted they claim they cannot compete 
with imports because the economies of scale of huge us farms are 
impossible on the tiny plots of arable land squeezed between 
japans many mountains 
but the farmers troubles actually began brewing long before the 
threat of rice imports materialized the japanese diet has been 
shifting from rice toward meat and bread and farming villages have 
been turning into ghost towns as the younger generation heads for 
big cities 
i am going to be the last farmer in this family lamented 
tanaka whose son is a whitecollar worker 
japan now has 59 million farmers 1 million less than a decade 
ago who comprise only 8 percent of the working population 
ricegrowing farmland has declined by about 741000 acres during 
that period as paddies have given way to factories and new homes 
nationwide farmers groups remain powerful because the japanese 
political system gives rural areas strong electoral clout and the 
governments official line on the ban has yet to waver 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said the international 
community should recognize japans need to maintain food security 
through domestic production 
japan is going to emphasize again in the december trade 
talks that japan is the largest importer of agricultural goods in 
the world and also that the selfsufficiency rate is the lowest 
among the industrialized countries watanabe said 
many japanese also see rice farming as central to their culture 
because rice plays a central role in shinto the countrys native 
religion 
still an increasing number of influential politicians are 
saying that the market should be opened to imports many farmers 
believe it is only a matter of time before the ban is removed 
in addition to us demand for liberalized trade policies the 
political clout of rural areas is likely to decline because of the 
dwindling farm population and planned electoral reforms 
one 68yearold woman whose son chose to run a pastry store in 
a former rice paddy instead of cultivating the family land gave up 
rice farming five years ago now she works alone in a garden near 
her home in kamogawa raising strawberries cabbage and scallions 
japanese farming is finished she said with a sigh before 
returning to her gardening

after four decades of rigged elections that gave 
the communists a numbing succession of imaginary landslides 
eastern germans are suddenly awash in the freedom to choose 
on sunday they will join their western countrymen for the first 
united german elections since 1932 
it is the fourth free and fair election in the past 10 months in 
what used to be east germany however and some people have lost 
their enthusiasm for ballot casting 
i wont vote sunday said andrea fischer who also skipped 
the last two elections the more i know about these parties the 
more they seem almost comical 
after overthrowing the communist hardliners east germans 
jubilantly chose a democratic government in march in may they 
elected new local leaders throwing out hundreds of communists 
still clinging to power 
on oct 14 a scant 11 days after german unification they 
chose the governments for the five states their nation had become 
but with another historic chapter about to be written sunday a 
definite air of apathy hangs over the former nation 
some of it has to do with the seeming inevitability of the 
outcome chancellor helmut kohl whose conservative christian 
democratic union dominated the first three races in eastern 
germany is expected to handily retain his post 
a little of it has to do with a growing familiarity with 
democratic political campaigns the novelty has worn off the 
euphoria is gone political rhetoric is greeted with westernstyle 
cynicism 
most of all pressing problems have come to dwarf the small 
thrill of voting the eastern germans are expecting a dramatic 
surge in joblessness as their sputtering enterprises use up what 
little credit they have left in coming months 
i have a child and a job that i only work four hours a day 
said ms fischer 33 a postal employee who lives in the village of 
schildow north of berlin 
i just believe my vote wont make a difference she said 
ms fischer who would have supported the environmental greens 
party or the leftleaning social democrats says she believes even 
they dont have a strong enough message to lure her to a voting 
booth on sunday 
karin wernecke a 30yearold berliner and former communist 
will vote as she always has for the communists now reformed and 
renamed the party of democratic socialism 
we wont win but we need this voice she said ms 
wernecke a single jobless mother says she has little hope for the 
future under the christian democrats 
harry schneidereit is one of the optimists at 65 he has a 
chance to finally do what he always wanted to do 
i have been a watchmaker for 40 years said schneidereit 
who runs a small shop in northern berlin this is the first time 
in my life i can decide what i want this is the essence of life 
for a shopkeeper 
schneidereit could not visit his parents in west berlin after 
the wall was built he had to let the government decide what he 
could stock in his shop what prices to charge how much he could 
pay his employees 
now he has a new product line but is struggling to compete with 
the lower prices of the big retailers 
still he said he would have it no other way thats why he 
said sundays election is important to continue the former 
nations evolution 
it is important that we have no apathy he said this man 
this big man he has promised that he would help and now he should 
help this is the way to hold him to his promise 
the big man is the rotund giant kohl who promised east 
germans both unity and westernstyle prosperity if they elected his 
party in march 
unity came but prosperity still has not 
schneidereit detects apathy among the people in his shop 
stunned by the realization that times are hard and things are 
likely to worsen before they get better 
schneidereit will vote for kohl but he says eastern germans 
themselves carry much of the burden for making the chancellors 
promises come true 
we cant say oh we poor people he said look at the 
soviet union 
we have to find the right way he said we have to take 
our destiny into our own hands

nbc is still king of the hill after claiming its 
11th straight ratings sweeps victory it has surrendered the top 
position only once in 23 tries since 1985 
nobody was surprised and few outside the network were very 
impressed when nbc claimed its latest victory thursday in the 
monthlong viewership tallies held each november february may and 
july 
sweeps figures bolstered by blockbuster programming like major 
motion pictures entertainment specials and other choice shows 
help tv stations set their advertising rates 
the purpose of the sweeps is really to provide numbers that 
our local stations can sell said robert niles nbcs vice 
president for research this is a nice victory 
it was a smaller narrower victory than in past nbc wins the 
other networks noted that nbcs winning margin was 13 percent lower 
than in 1989 while we may have slowed down year to year 
nobodys passed us niles said 
nbc won prime time with a 131 average rating and a 22 share 
abc was second by a tick with a 128 rating and 21 share and no 
3 cbs had a 120 rating and a 20 share 
a ratings point represents 931000 television households in the 
ac nielsen co survey a share represents the percentage of all 
television sets tuned to a show in its time period 
among highprofile sweeps shows nbc had the months toprated 
theatrical movie three men and a baby and the twopart 
madefortv movie the big one abc had the secondhighest rated 
movie the madefortv stephen kings it and crocodile 
dundee 
limited success in the movie category cost cbs said david 
poltrack the networks senior vice president for audience 
research 
the major reason for cbs being third in the sweeps is that you 
have to go all the way down the list to no 6 to find cbs he 
said 
for fox broadcasting co which had added two nights of 
programming this season its 66 rating and 11 share had to be a 
disappointment one industry analyst said 
fox boosted its ratings just a tenth of a point and its audience 
share by just 1 percent over last novembers sweeps 
the sweeps numbers just confirm that with an expanded lineup 
its getting tougher to compete said david marans senior 
audience researcher for the j walter thompson advertising agency 
cbs almost had twice the audience that fox did he said 
any plans that fox had for further expansion have to be 
questionable if theyre only competitive on one or two nights 
now 
fox officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking 
their reaction to the november sweeps 
nbcs victory comes with just over 1 million more households 
tuned in than thirdplace cbs and a 2 percent larger share of the 
audience no 2rated abc had only about 280000 fewer housholds 
tuned in and a 1 percent smaller share 
its the closest weve been to first place in a nonolympics 
year since 1984 said alan wurtzel abcs senior vice president 
for research basically nbc and abc are the same 
nbcs narrow win signals possible change in the network ratings 
game marans said 
if you look at the demographics abc is pretty much on its way 
to becoming the leader in prime time he said

margaret thatcher the longest serving british 
leader this century has been rewarded for her 11 years in power 
with a pension about equal to the salary of a wellpaid london 
secretary 
she will also receive a private office at parliament but only 
so long as she remains a parliament member 
beyond that the only perks of former office will be a limousine 
and a security detail since she could be a target of the irish 
republican army for decades security could cost the government 
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year 
her pension of 34185 a year roughly the earnings of a senior 
secretary in central london is calculated according to a 
procedure laid down in 1937 a government spokesman said 
it provides that a prime minister gets a pension amounting to 15 
fortieths of his or her pay irrespective of length in office 
because she is still a member of the house of commons for the 
north london district of finchley the 65yearold mrs thatcher 
also gets the 52066 salary of a legislator bringing her total 
government income to 86252 
mrs thatcher has crammed the filing cabinets for her finchley 
constituency into the tiny office at the house of commons of a 
fellow legislator peter morrison said her former press secretary 
bernard ingham 
she is using space in morrisons shared office at the commons 
but is due to be given a larger one for herself as the exprime 
minister that too will go if she leaves the 650member commons 
space is at a premium and most legislators have to share 
meanwhile admirers have got together to provide her with a 
privately funded set of offices in a building near the houses of 
commons 
her aides say she is hoping to set up a margaret thatcher 
foundation dedicated to promoting her views on free markets and 
private enterprise the foundation would pay for the office 
the salary of the prime minister is 130395 but mrs thatcher 
who is married to a retired millionaire chose to be paid 107680 
the same as other cabinet members 
britains four other surviving exprime ministers harold wilson 
and james callaghan of the labor party and mrs thatchers 
conservative party predecessor edward heath also retired on the 
15fortieths of their prime ministerial salaries at the time the 
pensions are raised annually in line with inflation

general motors corp is cutting production for 
the second time this month because of slumping demand and says it 
expects to suffer its first quarterly operating loss this year 
since recessionwracked 1981 
gm did not say how many of the automakers 280000 hourly 
workers will be laid off to accomplish the cutback in production 
gm chairman robert stempel told a fort wayne ind business 
group on thursday night that the worlds leading automaker expects 
its fourthquarter operating results will decline significantly 
from the third quarter 
gm spokesman terrence sullivan in detroit said the chairmans 
statement certainly implies gm will have a fourthquarter 
operating loss 
an operating loss differs from a net loss net earnings or 
losses reflect in addition to earnings on a companys core 
operations such factors as the sale of assets the cost of plant 
closings and various accounting practices 
gm did not say whether it would post a net loss 
while the automaker posted a record net loss of 2 billion in 
the third quarter that was due to a 21 billion writeoff for 
plant closings which overwhelmed a 109 million profit on its 
truck and automaking operations 
the automaker announced earlier this month it was cutting 
fourthquarter production by 181000 vehicles stempel said 
thursday that gm was reducing production by an additional 111000 
cars and trucks 
the reductions will leave gm with plans to build 107 million 
cars and trucks at its us and canadian plants during the fourth 
quarter which ends dec 1 
gm declined to say which of the companys 100 plants in north 
america would be affected as a result of the cutback gm will make 
144000 cars and trucks in december 40 percent fewer than what it 
had previously planned to build 
under the gm contract laidoff workers get 95 percent of their 
salary 
stempel said the lower production reflects an erosion of 
consumer confidence stemming in part from the persian gulf crisis 
many people have been taking a wait and see attitude toward 
major purchase decisions for the auto industry this has 
translated into weaker automotive demand that has meant temporary 
plant shutdowns and layoffs he said 
what gm is saying is that we are not going to get caught with 
a surplus of cars that we have to sell with extreme rebates and 
have to shut the plants down in january and february as they did 
in 1990 said auto industry analyst arvid jouppi of arvid jouppi 
associates inc in detroit 
analyst ronald glantz of dean witter reynolds inc in san 
francisco predicted gm would post a net loss of 150 million to 
250 million for the quarter

iraq today rejected a un security council 
ultimatum to withdraw from kuwait by midjanuary and vowed to teach 
the united states and its allies a hard lesson unprecedented in 
history 
staterun baghdad radio interrupted regular programming to 
broadcast what it described as an important announcement by the 
ruling revolutionary command council led by president saddam 
hussein 
the statement said the security council endorsement thursday 
night of the use of force against iraq if it does not leave kuwait 
by jan 15 was illegal null and void because baghdad said it 
was imposed by the united states 
it is first and foremost an american decision in which certain 
powers participated only under american pressure said the 
announcement monitored in nicosia the united states practiced 
all forms of pressure terrorism and bribes to pass the 
resolution 
the measure was approved by a 12to2 vote it was opposed by 
cuba and yemen the only arab member on the 15member security 
council china abstained 
the baghdad announcement noted that the council had failed to 
end israeli occupation of arab territories and said this was one of 
the reasons why arab masses would reject the latest resolution 
against iraq 
the iraqi people reject this injustice and are ready to fight 
in the defense of their territory the announcement said 
referring to kuwait which iraq annexed after the aug 2 invasion 
iraqis now refer to kuwait as their 19th province 
this nation of impossible missions will teach all those 
arrayed against iraq a hard lesson unprecedented in history 
the announcement said 
millions of iraqis are committed to confronting tyranny and 
injustice before the security council session saddam said iraq 
would not be intimidated by a resolution authorizing military 
action against it he insisted that his armed forces had the 
technology to defeat sophisticated american weapons such as the 
stealth fighter bomber 
the americans are still influenced by rambo movies but this 
is not a rambo movie this is something different saddam said on 
thursday 
it is a shameful resolution tarnished with the scandals that 
have transformed the security council into a cover for us 
hegemony and a theater for its dirty deals the revolutionary 
command council statement said 
the double standards of these powers have become crystal clear 
after the latest resolution it said 
it reiterated a call for a dialogue to resolve the kuwait 
crisis and the palestinian question on the basis of equality and 
mutual respect

the 1990 atlantic hurricane season had more storms 
than usual and some forecasters predict thats just a hint of more 
frequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years 
but this years batch did not include the devastating storms of 
years past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmer 
year the season ends today 
dr william gray a professor of atmospheric science at colorado 
state university thinks a dry spell in west africa during the past 
two decades explained the reduction of storms along the eastern 
seaboard in the last 20 years 
in 1988 and 1989 there was near normal rainfall in the sahel 
the semiarid land on the southern fringe of the sahara desert 
some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end of 
a 20year drought and may have spawned gilbert in 1988 and hugo 
in 1989 
gray on thursday predicted a belowaverage hurricane season in 
1991 he based his forecast on several factors including an 
anticipated belowaverage rainfall in the sahel 
but gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlook 
for the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for more 
intense hurricanes than those of the last two decades 
weve been through a real long period of hurricane inactivity 
in the 70s and 80s up until 1985 and i think were coming out of 
that said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center 
in coral gables 
perhaps the gilberts and the hugos were signaling that he 
said recalling hurricane gilbert that wracked the caribbean and 
hurricane hugo that devastated south carolina two of the most 
destructive atlantic hurricanes ever 
hurricanes have been recorded in the atlantic every month except 
april but are rare outside the hurricane season june 1 to nov 
30 
in this years season there were 14 named storms eight of them 
hurricanes the average number of storms is nine with about six 
becoming hurricanes usually only a couple of those storms strike 
the us 
while many of the storms spun harmlessly through the atlantic 
several caused their share of destruction 
the most deadly storm was hurricane diana which swept into 
mexico in early august resulting in flash floods and mudslides 
that killed 96 people and caused extensive damage to roads 
property and agriculture the weather service reported 
a weather disturbance becomes a tropical storm and is given a 
name if its sustained winds reach 39 mph storms become hurricanes 
if winds reach 74 mph

the deadline is set the united nations is 
giving iraq until jan 15 to pull out of kuwait or face forcible 
eviction 
but war is not inevitable even though a line was drawn in the 
sand thursday by the security council iraqi president saddam 
hussein has nearly seven weeks to withdraw his troops and avert a 
war 
congressional democrats are unlikely to relent in their 
determination to restrain the bush administration 
former us military commanders have questioned the wisdom of 
going to war with iraq and diplomats of various persuasions will 
redouble their efforts now to convince saddam to release his hold 
on kuwait 
we do not stop the diplomatic and political efforts now at 
all secretary of state james a baker iii said after the 
security council vote 
we have in fact a pause here for peace that will permit us 
to continue to pursue these efforts he said as he headed to 
dinner with the foreign ministers of the soviet union china 
britain and france to explore with them what their ideas are 
as the council rolled to its 122 vote in favor of the us 
resolution china abstained speaker after speaker stressed not a 
military solution to the crisis but the possibility that saddam 
would take the worlds threats seriously 
canadian foreign minister joseph clark said the resolution gave 
the iraqi leader an opportunity to reflect 
it is up to iraq it is not too late clark said 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd called the resolution a 
clear message that we are making a strong bid for peace on the 
basis of him withdrawing from kuwait 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said we 
want to begin a pause of good will 
in an otherwise tough speech to the council the soviet foreign 
minister called on saddam to rise above considerations of 
prestige to display wisdom and foresight 
shevardnadze said it was time to think again 
baker has ruled out partial solutions and insisted on 
unconditional retreat from kuwait 
so that appears to leave little room for diplomacy to work 
there would seem to be no facesaving device for the iraqi leader 
to grasp 
and yet baker said that while saddam should not reap rewards 
for aggression that should not be equated with an unwillingness 
to pursue diplomatic and political approaches 
baker gave no hint what approaches might be considered in the 
days before jan 15 but a careful look at the resolution shows 
there is a lot of room for maneuver 
yes it authorizes the use of force baker noted i would 
remind you that it doesnt require it its our view that this is 
the best way to give peace a chance if you will 
forty years ago when the un security council decided to act 
against north korea the member nations adopted a resolution 
calling on all states to repel the invasion of south korea 
the resolution approved thursday simply authorizes the taking of 
all necessary means to implement the 11 other resolutions 
approved by the council since the aug 2 invasion 
that suggests the 12 nations that voed for the resolution want 
to avert a clash there is no direct reference to war in the text 
no one here has sought this conflict baker said 
rather than callin the resolution a mandate for war baker 
called it a pause for peace 
and yet jan 15 is a deadline 
after that day president bush saddam and other key actors in 
this dangerous drama will find it very difficult to avoid making 
the hard choices they have postponed so far 
for bush the deadline means he cannot wait much later without 
undermining the credibility of his own military threat 
as for saddam stalling any further is a dare to come and get 
him

a jury that acquitted a man of attacking 
a police officer recommended police and prosecutors apologize for 
arresting him 
when the jackson county jurors issued the unusual statement this 
week they didnt know that ronald l webb 21 had been held in 
jail after being unable to pay a 100000 bond from the time of his 
arrest aug 1 until the verdict 
jurors found out later that webb was in jail during the birth of 
his third child and they did not know police sold his car from the 
city tow lot because being in jail had kept him from claiming it by 
a deadline 
the jurors apparently believed the defense contention that a 
rookie police officer lied in her testimony to avoid being 
disciplined 
after deliberating for about an hour wednesday the jury asked 
for more time to compose a statement a few minutes later jury 
foreman gene scott read the statement which said an apology is 
in order to mr webb and his family for any hardships or 
inconvenience caused by the arrest 
police chief steve bishop said police had probable cause to make 
an arrest and no apology is necessary 
jurors found webb innocent of charges of first degree assault on 
a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action if convicted 
he could have received up to a life sentence on each count 
webb who faces court dates on several driving violations had 
been taken to a police station june 21 for a traffic ticket and 
admittedly walked away to avoid being arrested for driving with a 
suspended license at that point police charged he got into his 
car and tried to run down officer clarissa hager she was not 
injured

from the paratroopers who landed 
on the first plane to the newest arrivals in the desert us 
troops today welcomed a un deadline allowing force if iraq fails 
to leave kuwait by jan 15 
it gives the soldiers a focus for the future people now have 
something to key in on said capt michael langman 26 of 
headquarters co of the armys 82nd airborne division 
langman of new york city was among the first paratroopers to 
set foot on a saudi airstrip nearly four months ago as part of 
operation desert shield the 82nd was considered a tripwire if 
saddam hussein chose to expand his agression beyond kuwait and into 
saudi arabia 
now that theyre talking about an offensive it looks like 
weve got a mission again langman said guys want to kick some 
butt 
air force sgt scott grant 25 of toledo ohio arrived in 
saudi arabia on thursday but he was just as eager to learn that 
the united nations had issued an ultimatum 
now somethings going to be done grant said 
the biggest boost about the un action is knowing a date for 
something to happen according to soldiers who have been sweating 
it out in the desert 
the worst part of all has been not knowing said lt jackie 
jones 25 of springfield va part of a patriot missile battery 
with the armys 18th airborne corps 
this sets a date it gives us a timeline its a big 
motivating factor she said the longer you stay over here with 
nothing happening the more lax youre likely to be 
were not here to babysit said ms jones wed just like 
to get on about our business and go home 
at least one serviceman felt the vote gave saddam too much time 
which the iraqi president can use to dig in and better his 
defenses 
it should have been done two months ago i hope it happens 
tomorrow said seaman steven simpson of hartford conn part of 
the us navys seabees construction battalion 
weve given this guy ample opportunities to withdraw from 
kuwait who knows if theres a kuwait left he stripped it down he 
pillaged the whole country he deserves whats going to happen to

japan will provide its first medical assistance to 
the soviet union since world war ii to help ease shortages there 
this winter the foreign ministry announced today 
japan will also supply 195 million worth of equipment and 
technological help for victims of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear 
disaster said ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the medical assistance would be worth much less than the aid for 
chernobyl victims which is being funneled through the world health 
organization 
japan has had a policy of not extending financial aid to moscow 
until it agrees to return a group of islands it seized from japan 
at the end of world war ii but the medical assistance will be 
extended on humanitarian grounds foreign ministry officials said 
the soviet union also is seeking emergency food from the 
international community this winter 
wed like to watch the situation in regard to the food 
situation watanabe said we have no evidence that we should 
give emergency food aid he added citing reports of a bumper 
soviet wheat harvest this year 
soviet officials say they are having trouble distributing the 
food because of bottlenecks and bureaucratic conflicts

theres a new sheriff in town and its high 
noon for scofflaws who owe 4 billion in fines to the strapped 
city 
philip crimaldi took over the citys antiquated and underused 
sheriffs office on july 30 hes been leaning hard on scofflaws 
ever since 
im not in a personality contest he said 
city agencies issue a plethora of summonses to building and 
fire code violators litterbugs illegal vendors store owners with 
dirty sidewalks pet owners who refuse to scoop noisy nightclubs 
restaurants that emit foul odors 
new york uses its own employees outside collection agencies 
city marshals and on rare occasions the sheriffs office to shake 
money out of scofflaws 
but the sheriffs office which has the most legal power 
collected only 2 million last year 
crimaldi who says most people dont even know new york has a 
sheriff collected 55 million in the past four months all of it 
previously was deemed uncollectible by private collectors who 
concentrate on the easiest pickings 
an astronomical number of people in the city disregard 
summonses of all types crimaldi said 
whether you live in dubuque new york detroit or san diego 
when you get a parking ticket on your windshield your first 
instinct it may be a primal instinct is to tear it up 
conceded mayoral spokesman lee jones 
jones ought to know seven years ago his mind was on personal 
problems instead of alternatesideofthestreet parking 
regulations he ended up paying 2200 in fines 
the city of new yorks going to get whats due said jones 
those who dont pay mean the rest of us have to pay more 
realistically said crimaldi about 800 million of the 4 
billion owed the city is collectible the rest though still on the 
books is up to 20 years old 
parking violations are the biggest category as of tuesday 
unpaid tickets totaled 16 billion some of those have been on the 
books eight years 
the new sheriffs approach is simple he finds out who owes 
money he sends a letter threatening to seize their bank account 
car and other assets 
then he takes it 
weve raided stores and found the citys dunning notices 
wrapped in bundles in the safe said crimaldi theyd get a 
notice another notice and another notice nothing ever happened 
word spread merchant to merchant theyre not going to get you 
well now hello and surprise

the father of an 8yearold girl embroiled in 
a bitter parental court fight says it is meaningless to 
continue the battle following a new zealand decision awarding 
custody to his former wife 
eric foretich a northern virginia oral surgeon said the 
decision giving elizabeth morgan custody of their daughter hilary 
means one of us is going to have to give up and i guess its 
going to be me its meaningless to continue whats the point 
i cant physically take her from new zealand and im not 
going to move there foretich said 
under the terms of a court order issued by new zealand family 
court judge pd mahoney morgan must remain with her daughter 
hilary foretich in christchurch new zealand wusatv and wrctv 
reported late thursday 
she also must report to the court every six months on the girls 
progress and refrain from any further publicity about the case the 
stations said 
in new zealand there was no announcement today of any court 
decision such decisions are often kept secret and new zealand law 
provides strict penalties for violating gag orders hilarys legal 
representative in the case isabel mitchell would make no comment 
friday night 
morgan separated from foretich before hilary was born later in 
a custody battle publicized around the world she accused him of 
sexually abusing the child foretich has denied the allegations 
when district of columbia superior court judge herbert dixon 
ordered morgan to allow foretich to visit her daughter she sent 
hilary into hiding with her grandparents and went to jail for more 
than two years 
mahoney said he ruled in morgans favor despite what he said 
were serious reservations about the negative attitudes she had 
fostered in her daughter the television stations reported 
the judge reportedly said there was a strong argument for saying 
the child should remain in her mothers care where her physical 
educational spiritual and emotional needs are being met 
morgans brother robert morgan declined to comment late 
thursday her attorney stephen sachs also refused to comment 
saying a gag order had been imposed in the case

fbi officials have warned five new york leaders 
that their names were found on a list kept by the man accused of 
killing israeli extremist rabbi meir kahane according to a 
published report 
the list included rep gary ackerman two federal judges a 
former assistant us attorney and a columnist for the weekly 
jewish press new york newsday said in todays editions 
fbi officials believe el sayyid nosair acted alone when he 
gunned down kahane during a nov 5 meeting at a midtown hotel but 
are still trying to determine whether he was backed by a terrorist 
group 
the list appears to strengthen the theory that the killing of 
kahane the founder of the militant jewish defense league and an 
aggressive advocate of israeli security may have been part of a 
larger conspiracy against jewish americans new york newsday said 
it certainly adds to suspicions that this was part of some 
greater plot the newspaper quoted an unnamed law enforcement 
official as saying the official added it doesnt necessarily show 
that anyone else was involved in the shooting 
joe valliquette a spokesman for the fbi confirmed that federal 
agents are looking for links between nosair and any terrorist 
groups but declined to comment on the investigation 
newsday said quoting unnamed law enforcement sources that 
investigators found names of five people scrawled on a bank 
calendar in nosairs home ackerman us district judges jack b 
weinstein and edward korman former assistant us attorney jacques 
simmelman and howard adelman a columnist in the proisraeli 
jewish press 
investigators said there may have been a sixth name but it 
could not be confirmed 
law enforcement officials said nosair has not explained the 
cryptic list but they warned the people named on in to take 
precautions newsday said

columbias seven astronauts 
expressed optimism the shuttles fifth countdown would lead to 
liftoff as the clock ticked toward this weekends launch 
this time why i think we have a very good feeling were 
ready to go columbias commander vance brand said after arriving 
with his crew late thursday from johnson space center in houston 
columbia is scheduled to blast off at 128 am est sunday the 
countdown proceeded uninterrupted with only nickel and dime 
problems the type of things we typically have during a launch 
countdown nasa test director al sofge said today 
meteorologists today forecast a 65 percent chance of good 
weather at launch time slightly worse than earlier predictions 
the main concerns are low clouds and possible high winds 
nasa has been trying since may to send up columbia with the 150 
million astro observatory which will be operated by the crew 
because of hydrogen leaks three previous countdowns came to an 
abrupt halt hours before liftoff numerous repairs were needed 
before the shuttle was pronounced safe problems with the 
observatory also forced a postponement 
comet levy one of the objects to be observed is moving rapidly 
out of the solar system and not nearly as visible as it would have 
been in september during the last launch attempt 
youve all heard comets are harbingers of bad news and bad 
luck well this time we have no comet so were going to go said 
astronaut jeff hoffman one of the crews four astronomers 
among those afraid to get their hopes up are scientists who have 
been working on the astro mission for years 
were just as excited the only qualifier is weve learned to 
be somewhat skeptical if it will actually happen until we see it 
get launched said arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university 
principal investigator for one of astros four telescopes 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope 
will focus on some of the hottest objects in the universe 
the mission originally was scheduled for 1986 but was delayed by 
the challenger accident that year

vice president dan quayle responded to 
calls for caution in the persian gulf by saying that too much 
patience with saddam hussein carries a steep moral price 
holding back on the use of military force against iraq could 
lead to greater us casualties and increased suffering for the 
people of kuwait quayle said in a speech thursday at seton hall 
university 
with every day that passes the plight of the people of 
kuwait grows more and more desperate quayle said is this a 
moral course of action 
will continued patience with iraq help make the world 
vulnerable to nuclear blackmail by saddam hussein he asked 
does patience today risk greater american casualties tomorrow 
quayles call for a limit to patience countered calls for 
caution by two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff who on 
wednesday urged bush to give sanctions at least a year to work 
and on thursday former navy secretary james webb told the 
senate armed service committee that the presidents mistake in 
sending so many troops should not be compounded by a further error 
in using them in a premature unprovoked ground offensive 
quayle argued that a precedent had to be set in the postcold 
war era that the world community would not tolerate territorial 
aggression 
if saddam hussein succeeds in his aggression it is likely 
that his success will embolden other dictators to emulate his 
example he said the persian gulf crisis will set a precedent 
either on behalf of greater world order or on behalf of greater 
world chaos 
sen sam nunn of georgia chairman of the armed services 
committee and house majority leader richard gephardt of missouri 
have appealed to bush to give time for un sanctions against iraq 
to work 
quayle countered by throwing down the gauntlet to congress to 
act if members did not approve of the presidents policy 
if congress doesnt like what the president is doing congress 
has the power to deny funds to the president quayle said 
several dozen protesters greeted the vice president with banners 
that read hey dan should i join the national guard quayle 
avoided serving in vietnam by joining the guard in indiana 
but quayles audience at the roman catholic school was largely 
sympathetic it hissed and booed at a student who asked quayle how 
he could push for a war that may involve tens of thousands of 
casualties when he avoided combat in the vietnam war 
theres nothing wrong with serving your country by serving in 
the national guard quayle said to overwhelming applause

the german red cross trucked 5000 food 
packages to moscow today in a growing worldwide effort led by the 
germans to try to stave off winter starvation in the soviet union 
the aid left this morning from the red crosss central warehouse 
in nearby meckenheim in a convoy of trucks trailers and small 
buses 
the president of germanys red cross botho zu 
saynwittgenstein said he expected the food individual packages 
prepared and donated by german citizens to arrive in the soviet 
capital in about four days 
it is the first land transport of germanorganized food to leave 
for the soviet union another truck convoy organized by the 
catholic relief organization caritas is to leave on saturday 
on thursday a plane carrying 25000 prepackaged meals for 
childrens hospitals and orphanages arrived in moscow in the first 
shipment by german charities aimed at easing the chaotic food 
situation in the soviet union 
also thursday the government decided to give the soviets 
foodstuffs and medical supplies built up against a repeat of the 
194849 berlin blockade in which josef stalin tried to starve the 
wests isolated island in berlin 
those reserves include 66000 tons of rye 26000 tons of canned 
meat and 7500 tons of butter berlin officials estimate the 
supplies could feed 10 million soviets for a month and value the 
reserve at 340 million 
there is rapidly increasing concern that food shortages this 
winter in the soviet union could lead to unrest and destabilize the 
government of president mikhail gorbachev 
german chancellor helmut kohl has made aid to the soviets a top 
item on his international agenda arguing that without a stable 
soviet union ongoing reform in eastern europe could be endangered 
his concern culminated this week in a twoday meeting between 
german experts led by kohls top foreign policy adviser and 
soviet officials to discuss expected shortages and how to prevent 
similar problems in the future 
government spokesman hans klein acknowledged the food donations 
were stopgap measures aimed at getting the soviets through the 
winter 
but he said the delegation led by kohl adviser horst telstchik 
negotiated longterm cooperation between the soviets and 
germans they discussed how germany could help improve the soviet 
unions problemplagued transport system food production and 
rundown factories 
leaders of 15 private charitable organizations meanwhile met 
in bonn today to coordinate donations and logistics 
a government committee was formed in the soviet union to help 
insure the private aid initiatives would not be hindered by 
bureaucracy or transportation problems 
and in moscow the kgb announced today it was forming a special 
unit to control distribution and prevent theft of humanitarian aid 
western diplomats had expressed that concern donated food might be 
stolen by black marketeers siphoned off by corrupt officials or 
simply rot because of inefficient soviet transportation and storage 
facilities 
the masscirculation bild newspaper has started its own campaign 
a heart for russia encouraging the public to assemble aid 
packets or donate 34 dollars minimum to a special red cross fund 
for soviet hunger relief 
the grassroots campaign took on an official character wednesday 
night as kohl went on the national zdf television network to 
appeal for donations 
stern magazine allied with zdf in the campaign said thursday 
it was donating 340000 
the action is an ironic twist in the history of two former 
enemies more than 20 million russians died fighting the germans in 
world war ii and west berliners nearly starved before the allies 
berlin airlift rescued them 
these days germans led by kohl credit the soviet union with 
clearing the way for reunification which will culminate sunday in 
the first free and united german elections since 1932

the national dairy board has been illegally 
promoting an experimental growth hormone for dairy cows a critic 
of the hormone says in in a lawsuit 
jeremy rifkin president of the washington dcbased 
foundation on economic trends said he filed the lawsuit thursday 
after discovering that the dairy board had contracted with a public 
relations firm to promote the growth hormone 
rifkin has used various legal maneuvers to try to block the use 
of bovine growth hormone on the grounds that it is unsafe for 
humans 
the latest action is based on documents he obtained under the 
freedom of information act that rifkin says show the dairy board 
was working in collusion with the growth hormones makers to 
promote it 
he also petitioned the us food and drug administration on 
thursday to immediately halt any promotion of this product by fda 
officials and to immediately rescind the use of this product in the 
marketplace until it is approved 
the fda is considering whether to approve the hormone for 
routine use but it has already allowed milk from experimentally 
treated cows to be released for human consumption 
yvonne dock the dairy boards spokeswoman said she had no 
comment on rifkins action or his remarks william grigg an fda 
spokesman also had no comment saying the agency had not yet seen 
the petition 
grigg defended the decision to allow consumption of milk 
containing the hormone 
the safety to human beings is clear grigg said he said the 
hormone has no effect in humans and occurs naturally in milk so 
weve always consumed it 
rifkin and other critics have charged that the hormone could 
have deleterious effects on human health questions have also been 
raised about the economic consequences of boosting the milk supply 
and thus presumably lowering milk prices 
rifkin said the dairy board is prevented by law from promoting 
such substances before they are approved by the fda 
the dairy board cannot put out any information regarding 
efficacy or safety of a product before its approval rifkin said 
it is a violation of the law nor can they collude and be in 
meetings with private companies to be in such a campaign 
the lawsuit seeks to block the board from continuing with 
their campaign to promote this product rifkin said 
the board was set up by congress to help increase the 
consumption of dairy products produced in the united states said 
maureen bergen the boards director of advertising and promotion 
programs 
the department of agriculture oversees and approves its 
expenses she said but the board is funded by dairy farmers not 
the government 
the documents obtained in rifkins freedom of information act 
request include minutes of an april meeting in which the board 
agreed to spend 1085000 on a public relations firm for the 
management of the bst issue bst stands for bovine somatotropin 
the technical term for the hormone 
in a march 12 letter obtained by rifkin ernest miller chairman 
ofthe boards industry and public relations committee said that 
the law requires that no board funds are to be spent to influence 
legislation on regulation 
if ndb the national dairy board were to become proactive on 
bst while it is still under government review that action could be 
construed as lobbying on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies 
the letter continued

tolerated by the government and three other parties stayed away 
from the contest they are the rightofcenter new wafd 
leftofcenter socialist labor and centrist liberals in the

the kgb announced today it was forming a special 
unit to control distribution and prevent theft of humanitarian aid 
from the west 
the first planeload of donated food reached the capital thursday 
evening and was promptly distributed to childrens hospitals 
orphanages and homes for the retarded 
they began receiving the prepackaged meals and chocolate today 
the first shipment came from german charities humanitarian 
organizations in the united states italy and the nordic countries 
were also preparing to send milk flour canned goods and other 
staples 
western diplomats expressed concern that donated food might be 
stolen by black marketeers siphoned off by corrupt officials or 
simply rot because of inefficient soviet transportation and storage 
facilities 
worried that even a single incident of theft could produce bad 
publicity and slow the western aid the supreme soviet legislature 
voted nov 23 to put the kgb in charge of making sure the food goes 
where its supposed to 
tass reported today that the security police had set up a new 
headquarters to coordinate measures in the battle against 
economic sabotage and ensure the proper use of imported 
products and humanitarian aid provided by foreign countries 
the official news agency said kgb officials view the 
fulfillment of the supreme soviets order as one of its most 
important tasks dictated by the difficult political situation and 
economic crisis in the country 
food shortages have worsened greatly this fall leading to 
rationing of meat butter sugar and other necessities in leningrad 
and dozens of other cities across russia and the ukraine 
in moscow sugar and cigarettes are rationed and the list of 
goods that are hard to find in state stores grows every week it 
now includes milk eggs sausage cheese and matches 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak has warned that without western 
aid major cities could face hunger and popular unrest over the 
winter 
many soviets now openly blame president mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika reforms for their discomfort 
reasons for the chaotic food situation vary 
as the soviet union begins the transition to a market economy 
many farmers have stopped selling their crops through state stores 
at low official prices instead they are taking their products to 
private farmers markets where prices are often 10 times as high 
in addition some of the restive soviet republics including 
georgia byelorussia and lithuania have cut off shipments of food 
products outside their borders 
also black marketeering appears to be on the rise and many 
soviets allege that communist party bureaucrats are intentionally 
creating economic problems to try to stop gorbachevs reforms and 
hold onto their privileged positions 
gorbachev said on thursday that he and other communists were 
guilty before the working class because they have failed to 
address the concerns of ordinary people

the zambian parliament passed a bill today 
allowing the formation of political parties for the first time in 
17 years 
the 125 lawmakers more than twothirds of whom were appointed 
by president kenneth kaunda passed the bill unanimously after four 
days of heated debate 
the bill to be presented to kaunda for final approval on 
tuesday clears the way for multiparty general parliamentary and 
presidential elections in one of africas poorest nations 
but opposition supporters are still arguing over a remaining 
clause in the constitution that bans other parties from contesting 
byelections before national polls open next year 
the clause may end up as a mockery of the entire 
democratization of the system we are talking about said the 
former generalsecretary for the ruling party humprey mulemba 
mulemba is a staunch supporter of the prodemocracy opposition 
group the movement for multiparty democracy 
the group was legalized in july following violent food riots and 
antigovernment protests that left at least 27 people dead 
labor leaders have been at the forefront of the groups campaign 
to end nearly two decades of single party rule in this southern 
african nation of 75 million people 
in september the ruling united national independence party 
bowed to political pressure and said it will reintroduce a 
westernstyle democracy 
kaunda who led this former british colony to independence in 
1964 imposed oneparty rule in 1973 
zambia is the latest african nation to officially reintroduce 
pluralism 
on thursday the former marxist mozambican government permitted 
multiple political parties for the first time since the southern 
african nation gained independence from portugal in 1975

foreign ministry spokesman there was no action against the 
french soldiers 
the spokesman said the french did not oppose the rebel takeover 
the mission of french forces is not to intervene in 
confrontations between chadians he said chad is a former french 
colony 
the government of president hissene habre meeting this morning 
in a special session said it was determined to definitively 
destroy the mercenary hordes and predicted total victory 
it made no mention of a rebel takeover at abeche a town of 
25000 to 30000 inhabitants 
chad contends that the rebels based in neighboring sudan are 
backed by libya but france says the fighting is among chadians 
libya denies involvement in the fighting 
the ministry spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
reiterated that to our knowledge there are no nonchadian 
elements among the rebels

the first black republican o win a house seat 
in two generations comes to washington with an agenda closer to 
that of georgia rep newt gingrich than his 24 black colleagues 
across the aisle 
gary franks a city alderman from waterbury conn opposes tax 
increases supports the death penalty and says he wont vote for 
any civil rights bill that contains even a hint of racial quotas 
his nov 6 election victory over liberal democrat toby moffett in 
connecticuts 5th congressional district makes franks the 
highestranking black elected republican in the country 
franks who is touring capitol hill this week for a series of 
orientation meetings says hes ready to join the 24 democrats in 
the congressional black caucus 
i qualify im black and im a congressman said franks a 
37yearold real estate developer im a fiscal conservative 
republican and i think that in itself will offer a difference 
between me and the some 25 members of the caucus 
he will be the caucus only opponent of this years civil rights 
bill and the lone advocate for a brand of conservatism aggressively 
opposed by many other caucus members 
he will be one voice that will essentially be in terms of 
voting ineffectual said david bositis a senior research 
associate at the joint center for political studies a washington 
think tank that focuses on black political issues 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
says franks wont attract support by waving the conservative 
republican banner 
we hope that he is not used by the right wing to sing the 
praises of their position said edward hailes a lawyer in the 
naacps washington office 
but the republican national committee does plan to enlist the 
freshman lawmaker as a magnet for black voters 
hell be a national spokesman for the party said charles 
black the rncs chief spokesman hell be a great example for us 
to recruit other blacks to run for office and to draw black voters 
into the republican party 
franks says his first loyalty will be to his district 
nevertheless he says i would like to do all that i can to help 
my national party and i will do so if time allows 
there has been no black republican in the house since illinois 
rep oscar de priest stepped down after three terms in 1935 the 
last black in the senate was republican edward brooke of 
massachusetts who was defeated in 1978 
brooke represented the thenhealthy liberal wing of the 
republican party 
but franks describes himself as a real conservative and a real 
republican 
observers say that could be a problem when it comes to 
recruiting blacks to the gop fold 
in terms of his policy positions they are completely 
repudiated by the black community bositis said the idea that 
a candidate who was sent to congress by white voters would be 
embraced around the country by black voters is ridiculous 
the black caucus has been quiet on the subject of franks since 
his election rep john conyers jr dmich the senior black 
member of congress said franks republican status wont prevent 
him from participating

south african foreign minister pik botha 
today met with president daniel arap moi in the first publicly 
acknowledged highlevel contact between the two countries in 27 
years 
the two talked for about 30 minutes at mois official nairobi 
residence and botha conveyed a message to the kenyan leader from 
president fw de klerk according to lee njiru mois press 
officer 
njiru said he did not know the contents of the message and 
declined to say whether botha had other plans while in the east 
african nation 
south africas foreign ministry said the men discussed matters

said flights between kenya and south africa would resume only after 
the apartheid system of racial segregation was dismantled 
the anc is one of the major south african groups negotiating 
with de klerk for total abolition of apartheid and a new political 
order 
a western diplomat in nairobi described bothas visit to kenya 
as an early pitch for trade with south africa the most 
industrialized nation in the continent 
kenya is trying to jump the queue and get trade agreements 
nailed down before apartheid is lifted and the others crowd in 
this is about dollars not politics said the envoy who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
kenya like most other african nations officially has no ties 
of any kind with south africa because of that nations apartheid 
policy 
but there have been unconfirmed reports that kenya continued 
trading with south africa through third parties in blackruled 
states in southern africa 
kenya also has continued to provide transit facilities to about 
half a dozen airlines flying the lucrative londonjohannesburg

the state supreme court today upheld a 
state law that allows young school dropouts to be denied or 
stripped of their drivers license 
the court split 32 in upholding the nations first law aimed at 
denying licenses to 16 and 17yearold dropouts who fail to 
complete school 
chief justice richard neely said the affected student must be 
offered a hearing before the superintendent of schools or an 
authorized official before the student quits so he can be notified 
of the consequences 
the law was passed by the legislature in 1988 to allow 
revocation or denial of a license to a student who drops out before 
completing high school 
christopher butch attorney for dropout michael means of 
charleston said the court test was a first in the nation the 
whole world is watching you today butch had argued when the case 
was presented 
means lost his license when he quit school in 1988 he turned 16 
on march 26 1988 and dropped out of school the next month but 
lost his license even though the law was not enacted until that 
june 
assistant attorney general bruce walker said the law is an 
incentive to keep students in school 
i think holding a bazooka at a childs head would work just as 
well butch said during earlier court testimony 
the court said the means case is moot since the teenager is now 
18 and can get a license but it ruled on the matter anyway 
a child who has an opportunity to go to school and 
deliberately chooses not to avail himself or herself of such 
opportunity demonstrates a general lack of responsibility neely 
wrote 
neely said the law provides that when the withdrawal of a 
student from school is by mutual consent of school authorities and 
the child a waiver of the license revocation may be granted 
justices thomas b miller and thomas e mchugh dissented

a federal regulator told the senate ethics 
committee today that he believed arizona sen dennis deconcini 
crossed the bounds of propriety in trying to help savings and loan 
owner charles keating jr 
the regulator michael patriarca said the other four keating 
five senators under investigation may not have crossed that line 
patriarca a san franciscobased thrift regulator made that 
assessment in summarizing a meeting he and three other regulators 
held with the five senators on april 9 1987 when the senators 
were trying to help keatings lincoln savings and loan 
its only where the senators attempted to influence to change 
the outcome of the examination of lincoln of the regulatory 
treatment for this specific institution that impropriety was 
breached patriarca said 
my personal view is senator deconcini did that he said 
its not clear to me that any of the others did 
he was responding to questions from the committees ranking 
republican sen warren rudman rnh a day earlier patriarca 
said the regulators faced a full court press on behalf of 
lincoln by the senators 
patriarca also testified that his former boss edwin j gray 
was upset after a meeting he held privately a week before with four 
of the senators 
he said gray told him that one sen dennis deconcini dariz 
had offered him a deal on behalf of lincoln that the thrift would 
make more home loans if the regulators would back off a regulation 
limiting lincolns ability to make speculative equity investments 
he was agitated patriarca said of gray who then was head 
of the federal home loan bank board 
he was stressed or distressed and he told me that he was 
shocked by the meeting he said 
patriarca testified for a second day before the ethics 
committees hearing into alegations the five senators improperly 
intervened with regulators on behalf of keating a major financial 
contributor 
patriarca also told rudman that his own efforts to bend over 
backwards to be fair to keatings thrift ultimately resulted in a 
delay of several months in completion of the regulators critical 
examination of lincoln 
under crossexamination by william taylor lawyer for sen alan 
cranston dcalif patriarca said cranston wasnt present in their 
meeting when the other senators mounted what he had described as 
a full court press on behalf of keating 
on thursday patriarca depicted deconcini as the leader of the 
senators efforts 
it was my impression quite frankly that senator deconcini 
was negotiating on behalf of lincoln attempting to get us the 
regulators to change our position on the examination patriarca 
said 
the five senators are accused of intervening improperly in the 
regulatory process on behalf of keating and lincoln after the 
lawmakers and their favored causes received 13 million in 
political contributions from the financier lincolns 2 billion 
collapse has become emblematic of the disaster that engulfed the 
savings and loan industry 
besides deconcini and cranston the senators under scrutiny are 
republican john mccain of arizona and democrats john glenn of ohio 
and donald riegle of michigan 
patriarca now western regional director of the office of thrift 
supervision went beyond the allegations leveled in four days of 
testimony by his onetime boss 
gray the five senators chief accuser said he felt improperly 
pressured by four of the senators in a disputed april 2 1987 
meeting in the session gray referred the lawmakers to his west 
coast staff 
patriarca described the meeting between the senators and san 
francisco regulators which took place on april 9 
the tone that the meeting took was that the senators seemed to 
have made up their minds that we were in fact harassing 
lincoln that we were incorrect wrong and that basically we got 
the fullcourt press he said 
but patriarca said the senators became less aggressive after he 
revealed that examiners intended to seek a justice department 
criminal investigation of some of lincolns practices 
patriarca said the regulators found absolutely reckless 
practices at lincoln with no credit documentation for 52 loans 
they examined he said the thrift was engaged in highly risky 
practices he said there was evidence the files had been stuffed 
with phony underwriting documents 
he said cranston left soon after the april 9 meeting began 
saying he shared the concerns of the other lawmakers but had duties 
on the senate floor 
cranston accounted for 889000 of the 13 million contributed 
by keating and his associates much of the money was given to voter 
registration projects supported by the california senator 
cranston said in testimony released thursday that his 
involvement with keating was politically stupid the testimony 
came last april in a closed session with the committee 
i see nothing ethically morally or legally wrong with the 
amounts that were involved cranston testified i will grant 
that it turned out to be politically stupid and unwise because 
its caused an uproar that i regret but being politically stupid 
or unwise is quite different from being ethically improper 
patriarca told the committee that glenn was blunt and 
seemed to have also made up his mind that our behavior was 
somehow wrong he said mccain seemed uncomfortable being at the 
meeting 
riegle he said conducted a crossexamination to really probe 
the basis for the findings that we were saying wed reached

pro golfer tom watson severed ties with 
the country club where he learned to play after an application by 
the cofounder of hampr block was reportedly thwarted because he is 
jewish 
watson on thursday said he resigned from the kansas city country 
club because henry bloch chairman of the nations largest tax 
preparation service had his application withdrawn 
they put a prominent jewish person up for membership and his 
application was withdrawn watson said its something i cant 
personally live with because my family is jewish 
watson is not jewish but his wife linda is they have two 
children 
the fivetime winner of the british open and twotime winner of 
the us open became a junior member of the club when he was 21 and 
has been a full member for six years 
i would hope the club would significantly change so some good 
people of any religion race and sex could be members said 
watson thats the way i feel about it 
bloch chairman and cofounder of hampr block inc had been 
proposed as a member by donald hall chairman of hallmark cards 
inc hall withdrew blochs application when the membership 
committee failed to act on it 
bloch said today that he had no comment and hallmark spokesman 
charles hucker said hall was out of the country and could not be 
reached 
l chandler smith president of the 94yearold club said it 
had no blacks among its 400 foundation members asked if the club 
has any jewish members smith said to the best of my knowledge 
no 
he declined to explain the clubs membership requirements 
i dont think its proper that i go ahead into the detail of 
that process he said i just dont think it should be public 
information 
but he said the club does not discriminate and blochs religion 
would not have been a factor 
watson said he still believes in the right of private clubs to 
determine their membership but when they choose to discriminate 
against your beliefs you dont have to choose to be a member 
there 
howard levitan president of kehilath israel synagogue in kansas 
city commended watstons action 
watson mailed in his letter of resignation wednesday but had 
informed the clubs president of his intentions to resign three 
weeks ago after blochs application was withdrawn

by separatists tass said 
the official news agency said a new date for a presidential 
visit to the strifetorn republic will be announced later 
gorbachev who faces growing economic problems food shortages 
ethnic unrest and independence drives by most of the 15 soviet 
republics also announced this week he wanted to postpone a 
december trip to oslo to pick up his nobel peace prize he cited 
his domestic woes 
the nobel committee said the award ceremonies would be held as 
scheduled dec 911 but that gorbachev could deliver the prize 
winners traditional speech in may 
tass said gorbachev had been scheduled to speak to the moldavian 
parliament today about the social and political situation in the

the united states should continue our 
present defensive position in saudi arabia rather than wage war 
with iraq a former topranking intelligence official told congress 
today 
retired lt gen william e odom who headed the national 
security agency during the reagan administration said he had no 
doubt that we could win an offensive action against saddam 
husseins forces 
but odom said attacking iraqi forces in kuwait or iraq itself 
could mean an even longer us military presence in the region 
than envisioned with the defensive posture now established 
odoms testimony came at the end of a week in which members of 
the senate armed services committee heard an array of witnesses 
including two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff urge 
caution on the bush administration as it seeks to end iraqi 
occupation of kuwait 
every single witness weve had here with differing views on 
other things all of them have felt weve overdeployed 
committee chairman sam nunn dga said at the conclusion of 
thursdays testimony 
the bush administration could have led off the hearings perhaps 
setting the tone defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff were invited to be 
the initial witnesses 
but they declined and the spotlight has been captured by a 
series of witnesses who underscored doubts among democratic 
senators cheney and powell are slated to testify next week and 
secretary of state james a baker iii said this morning that he 
also would testify 
odom stressed in his testimony today that he supports bushs 
buildup in the persian gulf but said he was bewildered by the 
administrations apparent impatience with the results to date 
i am puzzled by the administrations failure to take the 
credit for its success on this slow route to its objectives said 
odom joining others in urging more time for economic sanctions to 
work 
some of the administrations rhetoric makes it sound as though 
we are losing that is clearly not true said odom now a 
national security expert at the hudson institute a conservative 
think tank 
the weight in favor of holding our present defensive 
position in saudi arabia seems to be quite large he said 
the hearings are proceeding amid published reports that the 
united states is sending another 300 war planes to the persian 
gulf increasing the size of americas air fighting force in the 
region by a third 
the los angeles times quoting unidentified washington sources 
reported in todays editions that the additional aircraft will 
include a second squadron of f117 stealth fighters and additional 
f15e groundattack jets f16 fighters a16 tankkillers 
refueling tankers and rf4c photoreconnaissance jets 
the times said the reinforcements will come from 27 air force 
units with about 10000 personnel the newspaper said the extra 
units will be dispatched from europe and usbased air national 
guard and reserve squadrons 
the deployment which will begin as early as this week will 
boost the number of us air force planes in the gulf to 1200 the 
times said 
bushs announcement earlier this month that he was sending 
200000 troops to the gulf region in addition to the 230000 
dispatched since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait drew fire from 
several democrats among them was nunn who had earlier supported 
the presidents gulf policy 
to blunt the attack republicans urged a special session of 
congress an issue on the agenda today for a meeting between bush 
and congressional leaders 
house speaker thomas foley dwash and minority leader robert 
michel rill had lunch with bush on thursday foley said 
afterward i hope the president doesnt call back the 101st 
congress reports of that may be premature 
the white house was noncommittal about increasing demands for a 
special session from lawmakers who had adjourned before the latest 
deployment lets wait and see presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said 
he agreed with a questioner who characterized the white house 
position as reluctant 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said he hoped we give the president not a 
blank check but give the president a sense of support that we have 
confidence in him to make certain decisions 
but rep william broomfield rmich senior republican on the 
house foreign affairs committee said that airing all of our 
differences at this time in an official session of congress would 
give heart to saddam hussein and doubts to our allies

here is the text of president bushs statement 
and news conference today on the persian gulf crisis 
i have a statement an opening statement that is a little 
longer than normal and id ask your indulgence and then i will be 
glad to respond to questions 
were in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward 
aggression and were there because our vital interests are at 
stake and were in the gulf because of the brutality of saddam 
hussein 
were dealing with a dangerous dictator all too willing to use 
force who has weapons of mass destruction and is seeking new ones 
and who desires to control one of the worlds key resources all 
at a time in history when the rules of the postcold war world are 
being written 
our objectives remain what they were since the outset we seek 
iraqs immediate and unconditional withdrawal from kuwait we seek 
the restoration of kuwaits legitimate government we seek the 
release of all hostages and the free functioning of all embassies 
and we seek the stability and security of this critical region of 
the world 
we are not alone in these goals and objectives the united 
nations invigorated with a new sense of purpose is in full 
agreement the united nations security council has endorsed 12 
resolutions to condemn iraqs unprovoked invasion and occupation of 
kuwait implement tough economic sanctions to stop all trade in and 
out of iraq and authorize the use of force to compel saddam to 
comply 
saddam hussein has tried every way he knows how to make this a 
fight between iraq and the united states and clearly he has 
failed forces of 26 other nations are standing 
shouldertoshoulder with our troops in the gulf the fact is that 
it is not the united states against iraq it is iraq against 
the world and theres never been a clearer demonstration of a 
world united against appeasement and aggression 
yesterdays united nations security council resolution was 
historic once again the security council has enhanced the 
legitimate peacekeeping function of the united nations until 
yesterday saddam may not have understood what hes up against in 
terms of world opinion and i am hopeful that now he will realize 
that he must leave kuwait immediately 
im continually asked how effective are the un sanctions those 
put into effect on august 6th and i dont know the answer to 
that question clearly the sanctions are having some effect but i 
cant tell you that the sanctions alone will get the job done 
and thus i welcome yesterdays united nations action the 
fledgling democracies in eastern europe are being severely damaged 
by the economic effects of saddams actions the developing 
countries of africa and in our hemisphere are being victimized by 
this dictators rape of his neighbor kuwait those who feel that 
there is no down side to waiting months and months must consider 
the devastating damage being done every day to the fragile 
economies of those countries that can afford it the least 
and as chairman alan greenspan testified just the other day 
the increase in oil prices resulting directly from saddams 
invasion is hurting our country too and our economy as i said 
the other day is at best in a serious slowdown and if uncertainty 
remains in the energy markets the slowdown will ge worse 
ive spelled out once again our reasons for sending troops to 
the gulf let me tell you the things that concern me most 
first i put the immorality of the invasion of kuwait itself no 
nation should rape pillage and brutalize its neighbor no nation 
should be able to wipe a member state of the united nations and the 
arab league off the face of the earth and im deeply concerned 
about all the hostages innocent people held against their will in 
direct contravention of international law 
and then theres this cynical and brutal policy forcing people 
to beg for their release parceling out human lives to families and 
traveling emissaries like so much chattel 
im deeply concerned about our own embassy in kuwait the flag 
is still flying there a handful of beleaguered americans remain 
inside the embassy unable to come and go this treatment of our 
embassy violates every civilized principle of diplomacy and it 
demeans our people it demeans our country and i am determined 
that this embassy as called for under security council resolution 
674 be fully replenished and our people free to come home

a scientists forecasts of possible earthquakes as 
earlyas this weekend have gone largely unnoticed in this 
quakeprone capital a striking contrast to the fear created in 
parts of the united states 
new mexico climatologist iben browning created a furor across 
the midwest when he said last summer that there was a 50 percent 
chance of a strong quake on the new madrid fault within 48 hours on 
either side of dec 3 
the fault runs from cairo ill to marked tree ark about 35 
miles east of memphis 
brownings daughter evelyn browning garriss has said that 
actually the scientist thinks a quake is more likely outside the 
united states especially in japan ms browning says he based his 
predictions on his observations of powerful high tides caused by 
the alignment of the earth moon and sun he says such forces can 
trigger earthquakes 
tokyo and there has been no outward sign of concern in japan 
during the past week 
the yen fell sharply against the dollar today but dealers 
attributed the decline to market players seeking a safe investment 
after the un security council adopted a resolution to permit the 
use of force to drive iraq from kuwait 
kaneo ogino a dealer at goldman sachs japan said of the 
earthquake rumors people overseas are overreacting i dont know 
why stupid people are talking about an earthquake were ignoring 
this bloody nuisance 
windowrattling earthquakes are common in japan and the country 
is obsessed with being properly prepared for the next great 
temblor buildings and infrastructure are all designed with 
earthquakes in mind 
the most destructive shock in modern history was the great 
kanto earthquake of sept 1 1923 that destroyed a third of 
tokyo and most of neighboring yokohama killing 140000 people 
many perished in fires that raged through the largely wooden 
cities 
the intensity of that quake is estimated at 79 on the richter 
scale 
the strongest recent japan quake was on march 6 1984 also 
registering 79 on the richter scale it caused only one death and 
neglibile damage because the epicenter was located deep below the 
pacific ocean seabed and well offshore

farmers homeowners and others recovering 
from some of the worst flooding in state history learned that 
washingtons rivers can be channeled only so much before they 
overflow and reclaim developed land 
the federal government thursday set aside 100 million in 
disaster relief for roads and bridges damaged during last weekends 
flooding which forced thousands from their homes killed hundreds 
of livestock and left two men dead including a man whose body was 
not found until thursday 
in earlier days the snoqualmie skykomish snohomish 
stillaguamish skagit nooksack and cedar rivers of northwestern 
washington splintered into rivulets and channels on the plains 
below the cascade mountains during heavy rain 
but farmers and later manufacturers and homeowners forced them 
and other rivers into fewer channels by erecting dikes and levees 
said robert j naiman director of the center for streamside 
studies at the university of washington 
that works until you get a major flow like last week and then 
rivers just go where theyve always gone naiman said thursday 
the red cross said thursday the floods destroyed at least 161 
homes mobile homes and apartment units and damaged more than 2400 
others in 13 counties figures for three other counties werent 
available 
the consequences of the flooding were made worse because so many 
people had built homes in areas downstream that flood maybe once 
every 50 to 100 years said bob beschta a hydrology professor at 
oregon state university 
an area hasnt flooded since anybody can remember its probably 
ok he said 
although some blamed forest clearcutting in the mountains 
naiman and beschta said the lack of trees was not a major factor 
trees reduce flooding by catching rain some of which evaporates 
and some of which is taken in for growth but beschta said trees 
would not be much help at this time of year 
its dark its humid and the forests capacity to hold 
water is small he said 
manmade surfaces such as logging roads and parking lots also 
contributed to the flooding but the greatest damage occurred along 
the rivers natural routes 
recognizing that the us government is considering buying up 
developed property near some annual flood zones and returning it to 
open space said chuck steele in charge of insurance claims for 
the federal emergency management agency

washington come home 
what kind of precedent will these actions set for the future if 
saddams violation of international law goes unchallenged im also 
deeply concerned about the future of kuwait itself 
the tales of rape and assassination of coldblooded murder and 
rampant looting are almost beyond belief the whole civilized 
world must unite and say this kind of treatment of people must end 
and those who violated the kuwaiti people must be brought to 
justice 
im deeply concerned about saddams efforts to acquire nuclear 
weapons imagine his ability to blackmail his neighbors should he 
possess a nuclear device weve seen him use chemical weapons on 
his own people weve seen him take his own country one that 
should be wealthy and prosperous and turn it into a poor country 
all because of insatiable appetite for military equipment and 
conquest 
ive been asked why i ordered more troops to the gulf i remain 
hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis but 
if force is required we and the other 26 countries who have 
troops in the area will have enough power to get the job done 
in our country i know that there are fears about another 
vietnam let me assure you should military action be required 
this will not be another vietnam this will not be a protracted 
drawnout war the forces arrayed are different the opposition is 
different the resupply of saddams military would be very 
different the countries united against him in the united nations 
are different the topography of kuwait is different and the 
motivation of our allvolunteer force is superb 
i want peace i want peace not war but if there must be war 
we will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their 
backs and i pledge to you there will not be any murky ending if 
one american soldier has to go into battle that soldier will have 
enough force behind him to win and then get out as soon as 
possible as soon as the un objectives have been achieved i will 
never ever agree to a halfway effort 
let me repeat we have no argument with the people of iraq 
indeed we have only friendship for the people there and further 
i repeat that we have no desire to keep one single american soldier 
in the gulf a single day longer than is necessary to achieve the 
objectives set out above 
no one wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis more than 
i do and at the same time no one is more determined than i am to 
see saddams aggression reversed 
and lastly people now caution patience the united states and 
the entire world have been patient i will continue to be patient 
but yesterdays unproperly says to saddam hussein time is running out 
you must 
leave kuwait and weve given you time to do just exactly that 
many people have talked directly to saddam hussein and to his 
foreign minister tariq aziz all have been frustrated by iraqs 
ironclad insistence that it will not leave kuwait 
however to go the extra mile for peace i will issue an 
invitation to foreign minister tariq aziz to come to washington at 
a mutually convenient time during the latter part of the week of 
december 10th to meet with me and ill invite ambassadors of 
several of our coalition partners in the gulf to join me at that 
meeting 
in addition i am asking secretary jim baker to go to baghdad to 
see saddam hussein and i will suggest to iraqs president that he 
receive the secretary of state at a mutually convenient time 
between december 15th and january 15th of next year 
within the mandate within the mandate of the united nations 
resolutions i will be prepared and so will secretary baker to 
discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis however to be very clear 
about these efforts to exhaust all means for achieving a political 
and diplomatic solution i am not suggesting discussions that will 
result in anything less than iraqs complete withdrawal from 
kuwait restoration of kuwaits legitimate government and freedom 
for all hostages 
thank you very much and i will be glad to respond to a few 
questions

the illinois supreme coanner in which local school councils are 
elected violated the constitutional principle of one person one 
vote by giving parents more power than other voters 
one of the seven high court justices dissented 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed in cook county circuit court 
in april 1989 by principals subdistrict superintendents and others 
upset with the chicago school reform act 
the landmark legislation was intended to decentralize the school 
systems topheavy bureaucracy and give parents more control over 
their childrens schools including a majority on the councils that 
hire and fire principals 
the state supreme court said however that it was 
unconstitutional to give more voting power to parents than to other 
citizens 
the chicago school system the nations thirdlargest has 604 
schools and more than 400000 students 
joan slay acting director of designs for change which helped 
shape the reform package said she is certain that the act can be 
revised to meet the courts objections 
we can resolve that we will resolve it said ms slay i 
dont consider it a blow what i think it does mean is that we have 
to go back and craft this carefully 
principals however praised the ruling school reform seemed 
to lay the blame for problems in chicago schools on the shoulders 
of the principals said bruce berndt president of the chicago 
principals association politicizing the principals position is 
not going to make kids learn better 
under the law the 11member local school councils include six 
members who must be parents of enrolled students and are elected 
solely by fellow parents the councils do not set tax rates but do 
have the power to hire and fire principals 
the other members are two people who are not parents of enrolled 
students who are elected by the public at large in the schools 
district two teachers at the school and the principal of the 
school 
last year the selection of principals by local school councils 
was hotly contested at many of the citys schools some principals 
charged they were dismissed by their schools council solely on the 
basis of race 
skirmishes in which police were called broke out at at least two 
schools where students and parents were dissatisfied with the 
councils actions 
in his dissent justice william g clark said the act is a 
unique and creative response to the education problems facing 
chicago 
he said the different treatment of parents and other voters 
should be evaluated by the court to see if there is a rational 
basis for it rather than just rejected out of hand under a 
strict reading of the oneperson onevote rule 
attorneys for the chicago board of education and other 
defendants in the case had argued that the oneperson onevote 
principle doesnt apply to subordinate panels of limited authority 
such as the local school councils

two american women say they are optimistic 
that saddam hussein will release their husbands after they arrive 
in iraq next week on a trip the state department has tried to 
discourage 
i am so sure he is coming out kim edwards of carson city 
nev said of her husband tony 
mrs edwards the mother of three small children plans to 
travel on monday to jordan and then baghdad iraq with a group of 
more than a dozen other people 
members of the group have husbands or relatives who have been 
held in iraq or kuwait since saddam invaded kuwait aug 2 
president bush criticized saddam for his treatment of the 
hostages and their families at a news conference today 
he condemned iraqs cynical and brutal policy of forcing 
people to beg for their the hostages release parceling out 
human lives to families and traveling emissaries like so much 
chattel 
bush also said he would dispatch secretary of state james a 
baker iii to baghdad in an effort to resolve the persian gulf 
crisis peacefully but bush insisted saddam must withdraw 
unconditionally from kuwait 
mrs edwards husband was working as a planner for a japanese 
company in baghdad at the time of the invasion she said she has 
talked with him several times 
barbara smiley of los angeles said she believes the only way 
saddam will free hostages is if the relatives ask for them in 
person saddam invited the families to come to baghdad saying 
people who arrive without guns will not leave emptyhanded 
mrs smiley said she was frustrated by the situation until she 
decided to travel to iraq 
when i made the decision to travel i was taking control 
she said her husband edward was working for a kuwaiti company as 
a database administrator when the invasion occurred 
she and the others opted to visit iraq because they feel the 
state department is not working hard enough to free the hostages 
the state department has repeatedly urged american families not 
to go to iraq us officials say it is dangerous and they cannot 
guarantee security 
moreover they say the families can expect to be used as 
propaganda pawns by saddam 
nevertheless at least four american families have traveled to 
iraq

washington few questions 
tom 
q mr president now that you have a clearcut un resolution on 
use of force doesnt that force you into a position if these 
talks between the secretary of state break down doesnt this 
force you into the position of having to use force on january 15th 
if saddam hussein hasnt left and if if not wont we be seen 
as the one that blinked first 
a no the date was not a date at which point force had to be 
used 
q if i could just follow up 
a yeah 
q with another question are you going to ask congress for 
approval of this this resolution would you like to see congress 
pass the same kind of resolution as the un 
a id id love to see congress pass a resolution 
enthusiastically endorsing what the united nations has done yes 
but were in consultation on that and i have no plans to call a 
special session im not opposed to it but we are involved in 
consultations right now i have talked to several members of 
congress ive talked to leaders in the house ive talked to 
several on the republican side and democratic side in the senate 
and i want to be sure that these consultations are complete 
some feel a lame duck session is not good that the new members 
should have a right to have a say others feel that we ought to 
move right now the congress as you know in their adjournment 
resolution had a provision in there that they could come back and 
take this up they are a coequal branch of government they can do 
that if they want to 
but i we will continue our consultations theyll follow 
incidentally today this with meeting with the leadership so 
ill get a little better feel for that as we go along 
q mr president you say youre confident that american troops 
will prevail against saddam if called upon 
a oh absolutely 
q but at what price how many americans 
a well i cant give you that i cant give you that any 
figures of course but i can say that the movement of this 
additional force safeguards the lives of every american and every 
one of our allies in the gulf 
yeah brit 
q mr president in recent days senior members of the 
administration have emphatically rejected the idea of any special 
emissaries or diplomatic envoys to or from iraq to discuss this on 
your part what changed your mind sir 
a the united nations resolution i think has a good chance of 
making saddam hussein understand what it is hes up against i have 
not felt that he got the message i hope this will do it but i am 
convinced that these two direct meetings that ive discussed here 
will guarantee to all the people of the world certainly to the 
american people that saddam hussein not misunderstand not 
misinterpret i keep hearing well people wont give him the 
news 
and bad news very faithfully i am told that saddam husseins 
troops dont bring him the bad news and im told that he is 
somewhat isolated and i think this un resolution will help in a 
sense to deisolate him and i think the two proposals that ive 
made here will help and so its just going the extra step brit 
thats what it is 
q well how 
a and its a decision that i personally made 
q you indicate that this date is not actually a deadline for 
the use of force merely a date after which force would be 
permissible how do you avoid the impression should that date come 
and go without military action that the usled coalition has in 
fact blinked 
a well weve got to look at events at the time but i dont 
think there will ever be a perception that the united states is 
going to blink in this situation thats why i had some of the 
words in this statement that i had yeah

prime minister john major was sworn into office 
friday by queen elizabeth ii at a privy council meeting at 
buckingham palace 
during the ceremony which has taken place since the middle 
ages major and the five new members of his 22cabinet in charge of 
government departments kissed the monarchs hand and were made 
lifetime members of the privy council a body of just under 400 
royal councilors 
a privy councilor man or woman is entitled to be called right 
honorable and remains a member for life 
the council is now very much a ceremonial body superseded by 
the cabinet but it was once the monarchs executive a group of 
about a dozen people who carried out the monarchs orders 
informally instead of formally with the monarch and that was the 
origin of cabinet government said geoffrey de deney clerk of the 
privy council 
but the privy council remains as the formal and dignified part 
of the constitution distinguishing between the elective part and 
the dignified part he said 
major succeeds margaret thatcher who stepped down after failing 
to defeat a challenge for the leadership of the conservative party

the two dolphinclass submarines would have been built for 570 
million at the hdw shipyard in kiel construction was to have

this at a time when our needs are growing especially because of 
the gulf crisis he said

budget was always the largest item in government spending but this 
year it is second to the 65 million earmarked for the immigration

americans who have been living off canned tuna 
and rice at the us embassy in kuwait have received fruit 
vegetables and a case of cigarettes from the iraqis president bush 
said today 
a group of iraqis who showed up with the goods thursday said 
they would return with a second delivery including soft drinks on 
saturday bush said during televised remarks on the persian gulf 
crisis 
bush said the iraqis told the americans to make a list of 
medical supplies they needed too 
he called the iraqis move an interesting development but 
noted that electricity was still cut off at the american embassy 
compound in iraqoccupied kuwait where eight us diplomats and 19 
private citizens are holding out 
this could be a positive sign but its so far short of 
compliance with international law that i cant be rejoicing bush 
said 
bush who said he had received the report of the delivery this 
morning said he had been asked what would happen if the iraqis 
provoked him regarding the americans still holding out at the us 
outpost 
consider me provoked when iand medical equipment bush said 
in the past bush has said iraqi president saddam hussein was 
trying to starve them out 
the grounds at the seaside compound are surrounded by iraqi 
troops and no one is permitted to enter or leave the four men and 
women picked by the state department to stay behind have kept the 
embassy operating despite the lack of electricity and water 
in the three weeks between the iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 
aug 24 iraqi deadline for shutting down all diplomatic facilities 
in the capital americans stocked up on nonperishable food and 
bottled water 
the americans have been surviving on canned tuna supplemented 
by rice and fresh dates that grow on the compound 
their main assignment is to keep in contact with the 600 or so 
americans who are still in hiding in kuwait to avoid being rounded 
up and added to the ranks of the human shield saddam has 
assembled to protect strategic installations from attack

washington had yeah 
q mr president youve youve just spoken about the weapons 
of mass destruction and nuclear weapons and also that one of your 
goals is to try to reach stability in the region can you reach 
stability in the region with saddam hussein in power 
a i think most countries members of the united nations feel 
that there have to be some safeguards put into effect in terms of 
guaranteeing the security and stability of the gulf and so i 
would think that the status quo ante will not be enough and i 
think there will be there are sanctions in place now and i think 
it would be very proper to discuss what those safeguards should be 
after there has been a a total compliance with the united nations 
resolutions 
q well you but sir could i just follow up 
a yeah 
q i just noticed that when you were originally when you 
outlined your goals you included stability in the region you you 
seemed to summarize them when you talk about these talks with 
saddam hussein but you didnt you only mentioned the first 
three you didnt mention stability in the region 
a well was i talking about the un resolution which security 
and stability i dont think was a part of the un resolution it is 
certainly part of the worlds objective however i think that may 
be the technical difference 
but look it is critical and it is very very important yeah 
q mr president i want to ask if your comments about the 
kuwaiti embassy whether its fair to conclude based on those 
that you will neither close the embassy nor permit those americans 
to be starved out 
a i will not say exactly what i will do or exactly what i wont 
do there is a very interesting report that we got in this morning 
saying that some iraqis showed up at the kuwaiti embassy our 
embassy in kuwait and had delivered fruit vegetables and a case 
of iraqi cigarettes to embassy kuwait and apparently theres going 
to be another delivery tomorrow including soda pop and they asked 
what medical supplies were required and 
q military 
a it doesnt say that and the embassy will apparently provide 
a list tomorrow and the electricity is still cut off so this is 
kind of an interesting little development but i somebody said 
to me well hey what about if theres some provocation they 
asked me in the leaderhship meeting i said consider me provoked 
when it comes to the united states embassy consider me provoked 
when i see americans without proper food and medical equipment 
q sir just 
q may i may i follow this 
a yes 
q do you take it from that from that communique that youve 
received there that the iraqis have the message and want to 
eliminate that as a potential tripwire 
a i dont know its too its the best question right on 
target one that we were discussing inside and i lets try to be 
optimistic and say this is this could be a positive sign but 
its so far short of compliance with international law that i cant 
be rejoicing but it is a very interesting development 
q sir 
a yeah 
q are you 
a im sorry yeah john 
q youve been getting some pretty negative comments up on the 
hill in these hearings as you know this week now this morning 
you said this would not be a long protracted vietnamtype war 
however general odom of the former head of the nsa testified 
just this morning before the senate armed serviceswed have to be there 
for decades now presumably he means even 
after military combat wed have to have people in place there as 
part of a peacekeeping force do you see our commitment there to 
extend that far 
a no i dont 
q let me ask you something else al gore yesterday takes issue 
with your comments and the comments of some of your aides such as 
brent scowcroft about saddam being able to churn out a nuclear 
weapon within a matter of months gore whos had some private 
briefings apparently from some of these people indicates that your 
administrations statements are misleading 
a i disagree with the senator and if he wants to gamble on the 
future about the construction of atomic weapons by saddam hussein 
i dont and i know what the intelligence says every bit of it 
and i cant share it obviously because we dont comment on 
intelligence matters but i am concerned and the very first time i 
spoke on this subject i think in august i mentioned weapons of 
mass destruction i believe but certainly early on 
and i am concerned about it and if senator gore has a 
difference of opinion and is not concerned about it we just have 
an honest difference there 
i am concerned about saddam husseins attempt to accelerate the 
possession of a construction or possession of a nuclear weapon and 
i might as well share that as honestly as i can

thousands of beijing schoolchildren are being 
taken to a museum exhibit that depicts us soldiers watching as 
nationalist chinese police torture communist prisoners in the 
1940s 
evidence americans had anything to do with mistreatment of 
prisoners by the nationalist chinese who were us allies in world 
war ii 
but that is never made clear in the popular exhibit of 
historical facts about the concentration camp at the place of 
chineseus cooperation which actually tells the story of two 
prisons in chinas wartime capital of chungking 
from the exhibit name to the photographs and statues depicting 
americans training nationalist chinese police the implication is 
that americans were responsible for the torture and deaths of 
hundreds of chinese communists at the hands of nationalists during 
the 1930s and 1940s 
the nationalists were manipulated by the americans said 
yuan shigui of the capital museum where the exhibit is being shown 
for nearly six weeks chungking in southwest china has a permanent 
memorial to the prisons inmates 
the exhibit seems out of step with the current warming trend in 
uschinese relations the friction triggered by chinas june 1989 
army attack on prodemocracy demonstrators has eased and most us 
sanctions against china have crumbled 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen was in washington on friday 
for the first official highlevel chinese visit since beijings 
crackdown 
still the official chinese media continues to level frequent 
criticism at the us political and social system and the us 
governmentrun radio station voice of america 
the communist party newspaper the peoples daily frequently 
carries editorials warning against hostile forces in the west 
who seek to convert socialist countries to capitalism other recent 
articles have derided us democracy as an illusion perpetrated by 
the rich upon the working class 
with the party urging better ideological training of the young 
the exhibit is being used as an educational tool not just for its 
criticism of us ties to the nationalists but for its praise of 
communist martyrs 
it includes dozen of photographs of party members tortured or 
killed by the nationalists it says the nationalists killed 180 
prisoners in one night in 1949 as communist troops prepared to 
capture chungking in the final stages of a civil war won by the 
communists 
this is a very important exhibit yuan said we held it in 
keeping with the needs of current education in patriotism and 
internationalism in order to carry out the excellent tradition 
of the slain communists 
about 33000 people mostly schoolchildren and workers on 
organized trips visited the exhibit in its opening week it has 
been shown in 18 chinese cities in the past two years 
the exhibit says that us naval intelligence officers and 
nationalist secret police set up a chineseus special technology 
cooperation institute in 1943 to share war intelligence and train 
nationalist police 
the us participants moved into a building that had been used 
as a prison since 1939 the exhibit said with their arrival the 
prison was moved to a nearby site when the americans left in 1947 
the building they had occupied again became a prison these two 
prisons are the concentration camp of the exhibit title 
us embassy spokesman sheridan w bell confirmed there was such 
a uschinese technology group but said he had no details of its 
activities the united states gave substantial loans and arms to 
the nationalists during the 1940s seeking to bolster them in the 
fight against japan 
the exhibit said the us officers in chungking also acted as 
accessories to the nationalists in smashing the communist 
revolutionary movement yuan accused them of supporting the 
establishment of the prisons 
however li hua director of the chungking memorial said in a 
telephone interview that there is no evidence of direct american 
involvement 
he said americanssaid the exhibits statues of us officers supervising 
torture 
sessions do not show something that actually happened in the 
prison he did not respond when asked the purpose of the statues 
li said the exhibit was not intended to arouse antiamerican 
sentiment or influence current uschinese relations 
the events of history need not affect today he said

washington i can 
q are you saying you think he could develop a warhead next 
year 
a im not giving you a time frame but there youve seen the 
estimates some of which itheres a lot of scientists that come down on 
different sides and 
senator gore im sure is an intelligence fellow and he but i 
dont think he has access to absolutely all maybe he does but i 
am not going to err on the side of on the side of underestimation 
when it comes to this question yes sir charlie 
q mr president your announcement about tariq aziz and 
secretary baker have you had any signals any indications from 
the iraqis that they would welcome this that they are indeed 
looking for this kind of communication 
a no the only thing ive heard is that they want to talk 
theres an opportunity but no i have not had any even 
diplomatic signals or signals of other kinds 
q and of those 26 nations that you list in the area how many 
of those are equally committed to offensive action rather than 
just defensive action 
a i cant give you the answer to that because i dont really 
know but i expect that there is enthusiasm in all quarters of 
those countries for the un action that was taken yesterday 
q with all respect shouldnt you know how many would follow 
your troops into battle 
a i know that what i said is true about the if we have to go 
into battle and i am satisfied i know enough about that i went 
over in detail as one well imagine a president should because i 
have the responsibility as commanderinchief what might happen if 
we have to use force i repeat i hope well never have to have one 
single shot fired in anger yeah 
q iraq has been constantly calling for dialogue arent you 
concerned that those two missions tariq aziz and james baker will 
lead saddam hussein to claim that the us is showing a sign of 
weakness 
a that what 
q that the us is weakening 
a because baker goes to baghdad 
q arent you concerned that that would be the position of 
saddam hussein 
a no im not im concerned some might say this is an 
ultimatum in which it is all it is is an effort to be sure that 
he understands the commitment of the united states that he 
understands that anything that is done must be done inside the 
confines of the united nations resolutions that have been passed 
that there will be no contingency 
there can be no face saving thats not what this is about this 
is to be sure that he understands how strongly the president of the 
united states feels about implementing to a tee without without 
concession the united nations position 
and some have told me that hes not getting the message of how 
determined we are and i cant think of any better way to do it at 
this juncture in the wake of the un resolution than this 
facetoface facetoface meeting im not sure hell agree to 
it yes ann 
q todays press conference seems to amount to again more talk 
of preparation for war can you describe what you think your 
responsibilities are in terms of congress as we head into thi 
period since they seem to think that and agree that youre 
consulting talking but not you seem reluctant to go and get a 
resolution that mimicks the un resolution what do you think your 
responsibilities are to congress and to the people that elected 
them 
a full consultation 
q any more than telling 
a get them in on the huh 
q any more than telling them before you do you do something 
a im leveling with them on where i think think matters are 
right now and i im youve put your interpretation on my 
remarks there was plenty of comments in there about hoping that we 
will have a peaceful resolution that the best answer to get a 
peaceful resolution is to have saddam hussein know how determined 
everybody is 
you see i think yesterdays un resolution was a step towards 
peace not a step towards war because ihussein finally gets the message 
and understands what hes up 
against in terms of world opinion and other things that that he 
will do that in kuwait which he did in in iran yes

alleged serial killer henry lee lucas 
scheduled to die monday for a 1979 slaying won a stay from the 
texas court of criminal appeals 
lucas was granted a reprieve thursday a day after the same 
court rejected a stay for the oneeyed drifter on other grounds 
lucas 54 had once claimed to have killed nearly 600 people in 
26 states touching off a flurry of headlines and visits from 
investigators from across the natiojn but he later recanted his 
confessions to all the slayings except one that of his mother 
the appeals court said thursday it would consider a claim by 
lucas attorneys that the trial jury should have been able to 
consider mitigating circumstances before sentencing him to death 
said assistant texas attorney general bob walt 
on wednesday the court had rejected a claim that the trial 
court did not have the authority to set lucas execution date 
he said wednesday that he might have confessed to as many as 
4000 crimes because of threats against him or promises made to 
him 
lucas was scheduled to die before dawn monday for the slaying of 
a woman known only as orange socks which is all she was 
wearing when her body was found oct 31 1979 next to a culvert 
near interstate 35 north of georgetown 
lucas contends he was in florida at the time of the orange socks 
slaying and was forced by police to confess 
the orange socks conviction is lucas only death sentence 
although he has at least six other life terms two 75year 
sentences and a 60year term for other texas convictions he also 
is wanted in florida on three firstdegree murder charges for 
slayings in 1980 and 1981

the handful of us diplomats holding out in 
the us embassy in iraqioccupied kuwait are receiving food 
deliveries from iraqis and have been promised medical supplies 
president bush said friday 
bush described the report as very interesting and said it 
could be a positive sign 
the president discussed the development at a news conference in 
which he invited iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to washington 
and said he would send secretary of state james a baker iii to 
baghdad in an effort to end the crisis peacefully and still get 
iraq out of kuwait 
there is a very interesting report that we got in this morning 
saying that some iraqis showed up at our embassy in kuwait and 
had delivered fruit vegetables and a case of iraqi cigarettes 
bush said 
the eight us diplomats and 19 private citizens holed up at the 
seaside compound have been surviving on canned tuna rice and fresh 
dates that grow there 
bush said the embassy was to provide a list of needed medical 
supplies and another delivery was expected on saturday to include 
soft drinks 
earlier in the news conference bush cited the treatment of the 
embassy as one reason for a tough stance against iraqi leader 
saddam hussein 
the flag is still flying there a handful of beleaguered 
americans remain inside the embassy unable to come and go this 
treatment of our embassy violates every civilized principle of 
diplomacy the president said adding that he was determined to 
replenish the embassy 
what kind of precedent will these actions set for the future 
if saddams violation of international law goes unchallenged 
bush asked 
in response to a later question he described the delivery 
so this is kind of an interesting little development he 
said lets try to be optimistic and say this is this 
could be a positive sign but its so far short of compliance with 
international law that i cant be rejoicing but it is a very 
interesting development

broadcasting from his citizens band radio 
pulpit a barberturnedpreacher dispenses guidance for the soul 
and directions for the road to his congregation of truckers 
they call the rev s anthony battaglia the chaplain man 
battaglia 60 found a new calling when the baltimore port truck 
plaza wanted to hire a citizens band radio buff to guide tired 
hungry and lost drivers on the busy interstate 95 corridor 
hes a right responsible fellow hes kind of a caretaker 
around here he helpsgguys who get into a bind said steve 
newton a former driver who is now a trucking agent in baltimore 
sandwiched between a gift shop complete with mud flap 
ornaments including the popular chrome reclining nude and a 
coinoperated laundry battaglia mans his radio pulpit in the 
security office of the truck stops motel 
every weekday from 7 am to 3 pm battaglia sits with his 
imitation leather bible at a desk piled with a 40channel cb radio 
police scanners atlases and phone books 
battaglia an ordained baptist minister is a chaplain at a 
suburban baltimore church and a volunteer chaplain for the 
baltimore county police and fire departments he wears his fire 
department uniform to the truck stop in case he gets a call 
he spent 30 years as a barber then switched directions and 
worked as a real estate agent 
now his congregation includes drivers with handles such as 
the rubber duck low rider and the destroyer 
how bout that chaplain man one driver calls out we got 
an abandoned trailer its an evergreen 
another driver leaving the fort mchenry tunnel wants directions 
to eastern avenue 
that driver coming out of the hole that exit is 59 
battaglia replies this is the baltimore port truck plaza 
welcoming you to baltimore 
that greeting is about as much as he is allowed to say on the 
air waves about the truck stop because federal communications 
commission regulations forbid advertisements over the radio 
basically were here to help the drivers when they come into 
baltimore its one big maze of streets battaglia said 
truckers are lonely too they have marital problems they can 
feel free to come in for counsel he said 
i tell them sometimes you just have to make a decision to go 
out on your own with your own truck or if things are slow they 
need someone to encourage them to tell them to just hang on

iraq today rejected the useofforce 
resolution approved by the security council but an iraqi 
ambassador welcomed president bushs offer to send his secretary of 
state to baghdad for talks 
in a nationally televised news conference today bush said he is 
willing to send secretary of state james a baker iii to baghdad on 
a diplomatic mission to negotiate iraqs unconditional withdrawal 
from kuwait 
bush said however that if military conflict does break out 
it will not be another vietnam this will not be another 
protracted drawnout war 
in baghdad the iraqi leadership was taken by surprise by bushs 
announcement about baker and went immediately into a meeting to 
discuss the development diplomats said it was not known who 
attended the meeting 
however iraqs ambassador to france abdul razzack al hashimi 
spke positively of the proposed baker visit 
this is a very important step really toward peace and we 
hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for 
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war i consider it 
very good news he said 
speaking in an interview with the british broadcasting corp 
the iraqi ambassador said the point is not kuwait the problem 
is much much bigger than that the whole security of the world is 
in jeopardy in the region today so lets talk about it in that 
sense thats what is important 
we are not accepting precondition negoatiations he told 
the bbc in paris lets wait and see and lets be optimistic 
and see what mr baker has in mind and not to speculate about such 
an important event 
bushs news conference came one day after the un security 
council voted 12 to 2 thursday to authorize the united states and 
its allies to use force to drive iraq from kuwait if saddam hussein 
has not withdrawn his troops by jan 15 china abstained yemen and 
cuba voted against 
it was only the second time in the 45year history of the united 
nations that the council authorized the use of force to counter 
aggression the first time was in 1950 during the korean conflict 
saddams ruling revolutionary command council today called the 
un measure illegal null and void saying it was imposed by 
the united states 
it is first and foremost an american decision in which certain 
powers participated only under american pressure it said the 
united states practiced all forms of pressure terrorism and 
bribes to pass the resolution 
the statement broadcast on staterun baghdad radio said iraq 
would teach the united states and its allies a hard lesson 
unprecedented in history 
in tokyo today misoji sakamoto the top government spokesman 
voiced support for the resolution and in madrid government 
spokeswoman rosa conde said spain also backed the measure the 
german government said today that peace in the mideast was in 
iraqs hands 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz would be welcome in washington 
for talks the week of dec 10 bush said baker would travel to 
baghdad between dec 15 and jan 15 
bush said however that he would not waiver in demanding a 
total iraqi withdrawal restoration of the kuwaiti government and 
release of all hostages 
th president combined his surprise diplomatic overture with 
words of warning for saddam he said that if hostilities occur i 
promise you there will not be any murky ending i will never agree 
to a halfway effort 
i dont think there has ever been a question that the united 
states is going to blink in this situation bush said 
oil prices tumbled this morning after bush held out the 
possibility of a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis oil 
dropped 211 per barrel to 3080 on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
thirteen foreign ministers attended thursdays extraordinary 
security council session with baker presiding making it one of 
the highestlevel meetings in council history 
the resolution however did not address whether the usled 
multinational force in the gulf could take action in the event of 
an iraqi provocation prior to jan 15 such as harming the western 
hostages it is holding 
it also made no mention of a un military command or any un 
role in overseeing any military operation the soviet union has 
said soviet forces only would be committed to a military operation 
under un auspices 
but in new york thursday soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said the only thing that could force moscow to 
intervene in the conflict would be a threat to the lives and 
security of soviet citizens in iraq 
we will take all the necessary steps in this case everybody 
should know that we will not hesitate to use force to protect our 
citizens shevardnadze told the soviet news agency tass in an 
interview from new york 
the council resolution strengthens bushs hand with congress and 
the american people in calling for offensive action against 
baghdad 
but hearings on the gulf crisis continued on capitol hill today 
with a former topranking intelligence official saying the united 
states should maintain a defensive posture in saudi arabia rather 
than wage war with iraq 
retired lt gen william e odom who headed the national 
security agency during the reagan administration said attacking 
iraqi forces in kuwait or iraq itself could mean a long us 
military presence in the region 
on thursday former navy secretary james webb added his voice to 
those questioning bushs plan to send 200000 more troops to saudi 
arabia to back up the 240000 already there 
the los angeles times said today the additional aircraft will 
include a second squadron of f117 stealth fighters and additional 
f15e groundattack jets f16 fighters a16 tankkillers 
refueling tankers and rf4c photoreconnaissance jets 
the deployment which will begin as early as this week will 
boost the number of us air force planes in the gulf to 1200 the 
times said

washington the hilt 
and thats why because of that question that weighs on my 
mind i added that language this morning about how this will not be 
a vietnam they can criticize me for moving force and if weve got 
one kid thats apt to be in harms way i want him backed up to the 
hilt by american firepower and others as well 
and thats why im working as hard as i am not only to hold 
this coalition together but to strengthen it and the best way to 
safeguard the lives of americans is for saddam hussein to do that 
which he should have done long ago and if force has to be used 
the best way to safeguard lives is to see that youve got the best 
and youre willing to use it and thats my posture now lets 
see sarah fire away 
q sir why do you seem to be avoiding the peoples 
representatives having an opportunity to talk on this and to 
express their opinion you know congress and yet youre avoiding 
it and you know that the constitution gives them power not only to 
declare war to provide the money and to say other things about 
what shall be done with troops thats the constitution yet you 
seem to be avoiding that the experts on capitol hill say that what 
you have done by prenotification calling two or three members and 
saying to them were on the way youve already made the 
decision youre just notifying them thats prenotification 
thats not consulting with congress they say you should sit down 
and have a backandforth with them 
a yes but 
q and i will remind you that when foley speaks as speaker of 
the house he may be speaker of the house but he sure as hell 
doesnt represent florida or texas 
a well now sarah therein you brought up the properly 
brought up the dilemma i face there are 435 members of the united 
states congress there are 100 
q well 
a may i finish please there are 100 members of the united 
states senate each one has a view as to what i ought not to do 
and thats fine they have the power under the resolution of 
adjournment to come back 20 seconds from now and to take a voice 
to stand to take a common position if they want to come back here 
and endorse what the president of the united states has done and 
what the united nations security council has done come on were 
ready id like to see it happen 
but what i dont want to do is have it come back and end up 
where you have 435 voices in one house and 100 on the other saying 
what not to do and saying kind of a handwringing operation that 
would send bad signals 
i welcome these hearings we are having hearings we are 
consulting ive told you im consulting ill be honest with you 
i cannot consult with 535 strongwilled individuals i cant do it 
nor does my responsibility under the constitution compel me to do 
that and i think everyone would agree that we have had more 
consultations than than previous administrations 
q sir we have a majority rule in this country and you seem to 
be afraid of it 
of government and i know my i know my strengths and i know the 
limitations on the presidency this is an interesting debate 
sarah laughter and chuckles and i and i know my 
limitations and i know what i can do and i know what previous 
presidents have done and i am still determined to consult the 
extra mile do you want to continue to debate youve 
q well sir you seem to give you and jim baker give the 
other countries a chance to talk and you give the united nations a 
chance to talk but you wont give the united states people a 
chance to debate with you 
q is there a question in there somewhere 
a well now thats an absurd comment sarah from a bright 
person like you that is absolutely absurd theyre holding 
hearings theyre talking they have the power under the 
adjournment resolution to reconvene this minute some in the house 
want to come back now some want to talk about it later on some in 
the senate want to come right back now and immediately endorse what 
the president has done and what the security council resolution is 
and im for that but some dont and so consultation is going on 
please do not assign to me improper motives were theyre 
talking right now theyre having endless hearings by endless 
experts up there each one with a slightly different view and 
thats the american way and thats fine and i know what the 
responsibilities of the president are and i am fulfilling those 
responsibilities 
q thank you 
q thank you 
q what about china what happened with china

lobbyists dubbed angels secretly 
provided cash meals and other gifts to legislators during a 
freewheeling political era led by a senator who is now a state 
supreme court justice documents allege 
prohibits lobbyists from providing and lawmakers from accepting 
any gifts including even a cup of coffee 
documents released thursday detailed allegations by lobbyist 
gary r goyke and others that justice william a bablitch was the 
inventor of a practice in the 1970s and 1980s that coerced 
lobbyists to pay for lawmakers food and liquor 
lobbyists would often be called at home and asked to be 
angels meaning they were expected to pay for lawmakers food 
drinks or lodging goyke told investigators 
after bablitch began the practice lawmakers sought such gifts 
as free meals and drinks 100 golf bags sporting event tickets 
lodging art pieces and even financial assistance for a movie deal 
the documents said 
bablitch a democrat who served as majority leader of the 
wisconsin senate from 1977 to 1981 before being elected to the 
states highes court denied the allegations 
majority leader there was not a hint of scandal 
released thursday by the state justice department with the 
completion of a twoyear investigation into influence peddling at 
the capitol the probe resulted in more than 35000 in fines 
against two dozen lawmakers and lobbyists only one person a state 
senator was sent to jail 
prosecutors have said some of the lobbyists and lawmakers 
implicated in the documents were not charged because the wrongdoing 
occurred too long ago to be prosecuted 
goyke who served in the senate before becoming a lobbyist was 
among those fined for providing illegal gifts to lawmakers 
he said he first became familiar with bablitchs practices as a 
freshman senator in 1974 when he and another lawmaker had dinner 
with bablitch and were told the bill would be covered by a coffee 
fund 
goyke said he later learned the fund was bankrolled by 
lobbyists goyke said after becoming a lobbyist he was frequently 
asked to be an angel and would agree to allow lawmakers to use 
his credit cards for bills 
weened his successor as senate majority leader timothy cullen to 
perpetuate the practice goyke said 
cullen who later became secretary of the department of health 
and social services now works for an insurance company a 
secretary in his office in evansville said he was unavailable for 
comment

president bush on friday said that he is dispatching secretary 
of state james baker iii to baghdad to discuss an ending to the 
gulf crisis and that the iraqi foreign minister would be welcome 
in washington for consultations the week of dec 10 he said baker 
would be available to travel to iraq between dec 15 and the jan 
15 united nations deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
 
saddams ruling revolutionary command council on friday called 
the un measure authorizing the united states and its allies to 
use force to drive iraq from kuwait illegal null and void 
saying it was imposed by the united states 
it is first and foremost an american decision in which certain

proposed baker visit this is a very important step really 
toward peace and we hope it is going to achieve what we are all 
striving for negotiations instead of beating the drums of war 
i consider it very good news

spokesman voiced support for the resolution and in madrid 
government spokeswoman rosa conde said spain also backed the 
measure the german government said on friday that peace in the 
mideast was in iraqs hands 
 
the handful of us diplomats holding out in the us embassy in 
iraqioccupied kuwait are receiving food deliveries from iraqis and 
have been promised medical supplies president bush said on friday 
there is a very interesting report that we got in this morning 
saying that some iraqis showed up at our embassy in kuwait and 
had delivered fruit vegetables and a case of iraqi cigarettes 
bush said 
the eight us diplomats and 19 priate citizens holed up at the 
seaside compound have been surviving on canned tuna rice and fresh 
dates that grow there 
 
oil prices tumbled friday morning after president bush held out 
the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the persian gulf 
crisis 
light sweet crude oil which had been down about 80 cents a 
barrel at the new york mercantile exchange before bush began his 
news conference fell sharply while the president was still on 
television 
crude dropped to 3080 per barrel down 211 on contracts for 
delivery in january 
 
retired lt gen william e odom who headed the national 
security agency during the reagan administration told congress on 
friday he had no doubt that we could win an offensive action 
against saddam husseins forces 
but odom said attacking iraqi forces in kuwait or iraq itself 
could mean an even longer us military presence in the region 
than envisioned with the defensive posture now established

the federal communications commission 
reprimanded a seattle radio station friday for failing to tell 
listeners they could be disqualified from a 10000 contest for 
flooding the station with duplicate entries 
at issue was a complaint by patricia mcbridenelson a seattle 
real estate broker and mortgage loan officer who had sent in more 
than 800 entries in a bid to win a contest in which listeners named 
four songs played in a row without interruption 
mcbridenelson who was disqualified before last springs 
drawing said she bought an electric typewriter to speed up her 
entries and listened to kseafm continuously sometimes until 
230 am 
i carried my radio everywhere with me i called in several 
times a day to the deejays to confirm song titles that i wasnt 
sure about she said 
i intended to do nothing else until the day of the drawing i 
intended to flood the barrel to give me the highest possible odds 
of winning i was made to feel like a fool for even 
participating in such an intense degree 
the fcc said the station repeatedly violated federal regulations 
when it failed to fully and accurately disclose rules 
prohibiting listeners from mailing in duplicate postcards that 
listed the same set of songs 
the commission decided a formal admonition was sufficient 
partly because ksea offered to compensate the woman for postage and 
stationary expenses she incurred entering the contest more than 800 
times 
bruce reese a lawyer for the radio stations parent company 
said the fccs ruling was appropriate 
short of throwing out the complaint we view this as the 
lowest rung on the ladder in disciplinary action the commission 
could give us reese said 
ksea hoped the complaint would be dismissed because the station 
took corrective steps and began broadcasting the rules more 
fully a week after the contest began march 30 reese said 
mcbridenelson who has an unlisted telephone number could not 
be reached for comment

researchers studying spinal arthritis and related 
diseases report they have bred genetically engineered rats that 
mimic the maladies in an important step toward developing 
treatments 
this is a significant piece of science said dr maxwell 
cowan vice president and chief scientific officer of the howard 
hughes medical institute at bethesda md the only reason that 
the diseases could be understood is by developing an animal 
model 
the institute and the harold c simmons arthritis research 
center funded the work by scientists at the university of texas 
southwestern medical center in dallas the findings were reported 
friday in the journal cell 
the rats were bred with human genes for a protein molecule 
called hlab27 it has been known since 1973 as a marker for a 
group of arthritic diseases called spondyloarthropathies said dr 
lawrence shuman director of the national institute of arthritis 
musculoskeletal and skin disorders 
when the rats given the genes got the symptoms researchers said 
they had confirmation hlab27 was a cause not just a marker of 
the diseases which affect about 200000 mostly younger americans 
no new treatments for people have been developed from the 
research but the future is bright said dr joel d taurog who 
developed the genetic link with dr robert hammer senior associate 
at the hughes institute 
you can look for gold but you cant plan to always find it 
taurog said we can only hope that the lines of research that 
lead from this development help prevent the diseases in the 
future 
among those optimistic about the research is the us secretary 
of health and human services 
this convincing animal model will help reveal the mechanisms 
that cause these arthritic disorders which affect hundreds of 
thousands of our young people dr louis w sullivan said

president bush said friday he would consider 
waiving us trade restrictions and provide the soviet union with 
export credits to help reduce food shortages this winter 
bush speaking at a news conference on the persian gulf crisis 
was asked whether recent soviet support for his gulf policies had 
made him more likely to offer food assistance to the soviets 
the president sad the two matters were totally separate and 
unrelated 
but he expressed a willingness to entertain proposals for 
food especially if the reports prove to be accurate in terms of 
the severe winter and the hardship that this will inflict on the 
soviet people 
bush said he has asked top aides for recommendations by next 
week on how to deal with a 1974 law that denies the soviets coveted 
mostfavorednation trade status because of their restrictions on 
emigration 
the president said he was undecided on whether to waive the 
socalled jacksonvanik amendment and then offer the soviets export 
credits through the agriculture departments commodity credit corp 
its an evolving question here i dont know exactly what 
i am going to do he said 
the jacksonvanik law barred all export credits or credit 
guarantees to soviet bloc countries that restricted emigration it 
also imposed tariffs on their exports to the united states 
it has been my position that the soviets should pass the 
necessary emigration legislation bush said that has not taken 
place but some are saying that i now have a clearer waiver 
authority than i thought 
a credit package for moscow would not be unprecedented former 
president nixon in 1972 unveiled a 750 million credit deal so the 
soviets could buy us grain over three years moscow used about 
550 million of the credit line before the jacksonvanik 
requirement halted further credit 
on friday bush said he felt that the us trade restrictions 
had been influential in increasing the emigration of soviet jews 
weve been steadfast in encouraging the exodus of soviet jews 
so that will weigh on my consideration when i get down to have to 
make this final decision on whether to waive jacksonvanik the 
president said 
bush said there were other unspecified agricultural programs to 
help the soviets that could go forward which are unaffected by the 
trade restrictions 
the united states already sells the soviets large amounts of 
wheat under a 1985 export enhancement program that subsidizes 
sales of some us commodities to certain foreign buyers 
under the socalled eep arrangement as of nov 15 moscow had 
bought more than 213 million metric tons of wheat at subsidized 
prices

the resignation of bulgarias socialist 
premier calmed raging anticommunist sentiment but it hasnt done 
anything to solve the countrys deep economic and political crisis 
unrelenting pressure from the opposition in parliament and from 
strikes and street demonstrations forced premier andrei lukanov and 
his government of former communists to leave office on thursday 
tens of thousands of people cheered in the streets of sofia an 
opposition stronghold 
but lukanovs demise may prove a pyrrhic victory the main 
opposition group the union of democratic forces must now prove it 
can help solve bulgarias social and economic woes 
not even jesus can fill bulgarian stores lukanov said in a 
recent speech 
a new coalition government probably will be announced next week 
so far nothing has been revealed about who will head it whether 
it will be a collection of nonpolitical experts or draw in equal 
numbers on opposition parties and the stillpowerful socialists 
the union of democratic forces opposition had long criticized 
lukanov for mismanagement demanding that he step down 
but it is questionable whether anybody could manage bulgarias 
economy which is so dependent on the collapsing soviet bloc that 
it can only reflect the chaos of that disintegrating alliance 
the opposition case against lukanov always seemed to rest more 
on a desire to get the former communists out of office 
the opposition and many of its western supporters seemed 
convinced it would win june elections 
when the socialists won the opposition formally accepted the 
result but has seemed unable to live with it since 
street demonstrations got under way almost immediately with 
students around the country occupying universities to force the 
resignation of socialist president petar mladenov 
mladenov bowed to the pressure in early july then it took three 
weeks of byzantine political wrangling to get zhelyu zhelev 
formerly the opposition leader appointed president 
lukanov seen by observers as one of the few capable politicians 
in bulgaria was widely credited with persuading the socialists to 
accept zhelev 
but the opposition never came through with the tacitly implied 
second part of the deal agreement to join the former communists in 
lukanovs government 
backed by some western diplomats the opposition apparently felt 
the socialists were a spent political force bound to disintegrate 
for his part lukanov refused to break with the socialist party 
arguing that it stood for his social democratic ideals 
lukanov eventually appointed an allsocialist government but 
continued to battle for broad support arguing this was vital to a 
vague but sweeping program of economic reform 
meanwhile the economy and society slid into chaos electricity 
and food rationing began in sofia and other cities in september 
stores have grown barer since power is now shut off two hours in 
every four in the capital 
the worst outburst of violence came in late august when an 
angry crowd invaded socialist party headquarters burning and 
pillaging several offices 
last week the opposition took the decisive step of walking out 
of parliament a general strike by the main opposition union this 
week proved the final blow to the socialist government 
although the political parties are said to have agreed on a 
transition government until new elections are held in may there is 
virtually no evidence of political unity 
the socialist party draws on 100 years of tradition and is even 
older than the soviet communist movement but remains severely 
split 
the unwieldy opposition coalition of 16 parties also is deeply 
divided and boasts few figures of lukanovs caliber 
on friday sofia returned to its bitter reality the shoppers 
glumly queuing for food know the new government is unlikely to make 
life much better 
even though i am stepping down my economic and social program 
has no alternative lukanov told the grand national assembly in 
his farewell speech friday 
in his last weeks before resigning lukanov pushed for radical 
marketoriented reforms including an austerity budget that would 
jack up many statecontrolled prices close down unprofitable firms 
and introduce guarantees for foreign investments 
if bulgaria does not carry out radical reforms soon it could 
find itself lagging far behind the european train of change 
lukanov told reporters 
im afraid we have already missed the train he added 
 
editors veselin toshkov ap correspondent in sofia has worked 
in posts in bulgaria and abroad for 15 years

count modest von korff now 81 had been accused of ordering the 
deportations of jews from the chalonssurmarne region of 
northeastern france where he served as the nazi gestapo chief in 
1942 and 1943 he was accused in the deaths of 177 deportees 
the karlsruhebased federal court of justice said it had 
reviewed the evidence and could not find any legal errors 
korffs case had attracted international attention and nazi 
hunter serge klarsfeld was among the spectators when a trial court 
acquitted the gestapo boss two years ago in bonn 
during his trial korff claimed he did not know about the 
extermination of jews when he served as the secret police boss 
the nazis killed millions including an estimated 6 million 
jews between 1933 and 1945 auschwitz located in modernday 
poland was the most infamous of the nazi concentration camps set 
up by adolf hitlers third reich 
klarsfeld the french nazi hunter had led prosecutors to korff 
who had held a rank equivalent to captain during the war 
the defendant served as an adviser to the west german economics 
ministry until his retirement in the early 1970s he lives in the 
the bonn suburb of koenigswinter 
about 20 relatives of the victims joined klarsfeld in the 
courtroom when the verdict was delivered in november 1988 
some of them cried out this is a nazi court and nazi 
murderer when judge martin lickfett read out the acquittal it 
was based on a finding that korff did not know the reason for the 
deportations and therefore was not guilty of the murderrelatd 
charges 
however the victims families had argued that korffs assertion 
that he thought the jewish deportees were only being sent to work 
details was simply not credible 
to back up that claim they told the court that korff had also 
deported children who were too young to be part of any work crews

the governments economic forecasting gauge on 
friday belatedly signaled the likelihood of a recession that most 
economists believe already has begun 
the commerce department reported its index of leading economic 
indicators plunged 12 percent in october on top of three previous 
monthly declines including july when the index was first reported 
to have been flat 
three consecutive declines in the index have been viewed as a 
fairly reliable although not infallible sign that a recession 
is approaching 
president bush speaking at a news conference confirmed the bad 
news and attributed at least part of the economic weakness to the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and the subsequent disruption of world oil 
supplies 
our economy as i said the other day is at best in a serious 
slowdown and if uncertainty remains in the energy makets the 
slowdown will get worse 
elliott platt an economist with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette a 
new york securities dealer said the leading indicators should 
remove any lingering doubts about whether the economy is in a 
recession 
economist allen sinai of the boston co said the report was 
another reminder that the economy is unravelling and sliding into 
a recession 
the gauge is designed to forecast economic conditions six to 
nine months in advance however recent surveys show that most 
economists believe the economy already was in a downturn 
it looks like the leading indicators are catching up with the 
economy said economist robert g dederick of the northern trust 
co in chicago the basic message is that we are in a recession 
and that the economy will continue to decline 
william k macreynolds forecasting director for the us 
chamber of commerce agreed 
instead of foretelling a recession that is a few months away 
those indicators show that it already has started and suggest 
that the economy will get even worse before recovering he said 
many analysts had expected the october decline but the 
department surprised some observers by revising the july index 
which originally was said to be unchanged to a 01 percent 
decline 
the gauge dropped 08 percent in september and 12 percent in 
august the steepest decline since a 14 percent plunge in the 
month following the october 1987 stock market crash 
eight of the 11 forwardlooking components were negative in 
october consumer confidence fell for the third straight month 
weekly unemployment claims rose for the fifth month the average 
workweek shortened and building permits declined for the fourth 
month 
at the same time the money supply shrunk for the sixth month 
stock prices were off for the fourth month the price of raw 
materials dropped meaning less demand and business deliveries 
sped up indicating fewer orders 
the only positive contributors were increases in orders for 
consumer goods and for new plants and equipment and in unfilled 
orders 
nevertheless dederick found a silver lining in the positive 
contributions he said they suggested that businesses apparently 
were not cutting back dramatically which would indicate a 
relatively mild downturn 
platt also predicted the recession would be mild saying the 
gross national product would decline no more than 1 percent before 
the recession ended next summer sinai said it could end by spring 
macreynolds on the other hand said the overall economy is 
falling rapidly on the heels of declines in the housing and 
construction industries and poor performance in the industrial 
sector 
predictions that the recession will be shortlived are based 
more on wishful thinking than sound economic analysis he said 
a recession generally is defined as two consecutive declines in 
the gnp the total output of the nations goods and services 
the various changes left the index at 1416 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and down 19 percent from its level a year ago the 
index has fallen during six of the 10 months so far this year 
there has not been a recession since world war ii without the 
index turning down for at least three consecutive months 
on the other hand the gauge was negative for six months in 1984 
and again for four months following the 1987 crash both times the 
economy escaped a recession

two women who are traveling to iraq against 
the us governments advice said friday their trip is the only way 
they will secure their husbands freedom 
were caught in the middle said barbara smiley of los 
angeles the us government says we are interfering in foreign 
policy but what is the foreign policy she said in an interview 
the women are part of a larger group of more than a dozen 
intending to fly from new york to jordan on monday before going to 
iraq saddam has invited the families of hostages to travel to 
iraq 
mrs smiley and kim edwards of carson city nevada said they 
have ignored the state departments warnings about traveling to 
iraq because they are confident their trip will achieve their 
objective their husbands 
this is the only way we are going to get them mrs smiley 
said saddam has said those who come without guns will not leave 
emptyhanded 
her husband edward 42 had been in kuwait on a new job for 
three days when saddam invaded on aug 2 smiley who was working 
as a database manager for a kuwaiti company has been held as a 
human shield at an undisclosed place in iraq 
she and the others opted to visit iraq because they feel the 
state department is not working hard enough to free the hostages 
aside from losing his glasses mrs smiley said her husband was 
faring alright in captivity but he wants his freedom 
at a news conference friday president bush said he was deeply 
concerned about the roughly 1000 hostages in kuwait and iraq 
he condemned saddam for cynical and brutal policy in 
inviting families to see their loved ones iraq is forcing people 
to beg for their the hostages release parceling out human lives 
to families and traveling emissaries like so much chattel he 
said 
bush also said he is dispatching secretary of state james baker 
iii to baghdad to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis with an 
eye toward resolving it peacefully 
i am so sure he is coming out mrs edwards said of her 
husband tony she said her 52yearold husband tony a planner 
with a japanese firm was trapped in baghdad at the time of the 
invasion 
while some members of the group intend to stay for only two 
weeks mrs edwards said her plans are to remain in iraq where she 
had lived previously with her husband until he is released 
the state department has repeatedly urged american families not 
to go to iraq us officials say the families are being used as 
pawns in iraqs propaganda war and they cannot guarantee their 
security 
nevertheless three americans were released this week after 
their relatives traveled to iraq to personally appeal to saddam 
hussein boxer mohammed ali is now in iraq and said he will return 
to the united states with 14 hostages the state department said it 
could not confirm the figure 
coming home a group formed in champaign ill by businessman 
michael saba helped coordinate the visit saba fled from iraq in a 
taxi on aug 9

president bush announced today he was sending 
secretary of state james baker iii to iraq but blended the 
lastditch diplomatic overture with a stern warning to saddam 
hussein that there would not be any murky ending if war breaks 
out in the middle east 
bush welcomed a united nations resolution that would allow for 
the use of force after jan 15 if iraq has not withdrawn its troops 
from kuwait i dont think there has ever been a question that 
the united states is going to blink in this situation he said 
in televised remarks from the white house bush said he hoped 
that saddam would receive baker at a mutually convenient time 
between dec 15 and jan 15 he also invited iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz to washington for consultations during the week of dec 
10 
shortly after bushs remarks the iraqi embassy said it had no 
reaction from baghdad to bushs surprise diplomatic move however 
iraqi ambassador to france abdul razzack al hashimi told bbc radio 
in london this is a very important step really toward peace 
and we hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for 
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war i consider it 
very good news 
but he added we are not accepting precondition 
negoatiations lets wait and see and lets be optimistic and see 
what mr baker has in mind 
bush said bakers trip would underscore for saddam americas 
determination the best way to get that across is one on one 
baker looking him in the eye it isnt a trip of concession the 
united states is increasing its troop commitment in the gulf to 
more than 400000 
he said baker would be prepared to discuss all aspects of the 
gulf crisis but said the united states would not waiver in his 
objectives of total iraqi withdrawal restoration of the kuwaiti 
government and release of all hostages 
in his speech and news conference afterwards bush also 
disclosed that iraqis have recently appeared unexpectedly at 
the besieged us embassy in kuwait with deliveries of cigarettes 
fruits and vegetables he said he understood there was another 
delivery on saturday including soda pop 
said he would not summon congress into special session to 
debate the persian gulf crisis he said he would not object to one 
but the democratic leaders of the house and senate have shown 
little interest in reconvening bush said he wanted to see congress 
pass a resolution enthusiastically endorsing the un vote 
disputed critics who have minimized the potential iraqi 
nuclear threat he said sen al gore might not be concerned about 
it but i am not going to err on the side of underestimation 
in new york oil prices tumbled more than 3 a barrel to just 
below 30 in the first hours after bush spoke including a drop of 
more than 1 a barrel in a span of several minutes while bush 
appered on television the dow jones average of 30 industrials was 
up nearly 40 points at 2 pm est 
bush acknowledged some american misgivings about the prospects 
of war and vowed that if hostilities erupt this will not be 
another vietnam this will not be a protracted drawn out war he 
said he saw no need for an american military draft 
he said allied forces will have the power to get the job 
done if prompted to confront the iraqi military 
bushs speech and news conference came against a backdrop of 
rising criticism of his policy he announced three weeks ago a 
further buildup of the 230000 american troops already in the 
region a roster of former government officials told senate 
hearings this week the president should exercise caution and give 
ecionomic sanctions a chance to work befoire committing the united 
states to military action 
a prominent congressional republican rep william broomfield of 
michigan said the diplomatic avenue would provide wiggle room 
for saddam and said anything the president can do to keep the 
focus of the crisis on diplomacy and not on war is all to the 
good 
bush said there could no compromise on his demands that iraq 
withdraw completely restore the kuwaiti government to power and 
release all hostages being held in the crisis 
he hailed the un resolution authorizing the use of force if 
iraq doesnt withdraw by jan 15 and pointedly observed that 
economic sanctions alone might not be sufficient to force saddam to 
withdraw his troops 
if hostilities break out he said allied troops will have the 
power to get the job done 
speaking of iraqi leader saddam hussein bush said i am 
hopeful that now he will realize he must leave kuwait 
immediately 
at the same time he stressed that he has no optimism that 
bakers mission will have any big results instead he said the 
overture demonstrated his desire to go the extra mile for a 
peaceful settlement of the crisis 
never has there been a clearer demonstration of a world united 
against appeasement and aggression the president said referring 
to a mulititude of un resolutions demanding iraqs withdrawal 
said bush i remain hopeful we can achieve a peaceful solution 
to this crisis but if force is required we have enough power 
to get the job done 
he cautioned iraq not to misread his motives in pursuing the 
diplomatic approach i dont think there has ever been a question 
that the united states is going to blink in this situation he 
said 
bushs comments appeared designed in part to raise the military 
stakes with saddam but also to respond to critics in congress who 
have said he should exercise patience and diplomacy allies 
especially the soviet union and china have pointedly emphasized 
the diplomatic approach 
he said there is talk of saddam of not fully understanding his 
determination to see that iraq withdraw from kuwait he said he 
wants to see the un resolutions implemented to a t 
that means iraqi withdrawl from kuwait restoration of the 
kuwaiti government and release of all hostages beind held in 
kuwait including those used as human shields to discourage 
military strikes against vital installations 
bush was asked about the potential toll of human lives in a gulf 
war 
he sighed and said he knew many people wondered how many 
lives is it worth i will do my level best to bring those kids 
home without one single shot being fired in anger 
bush said those who see no downside to waiting months and 
months must consider the damage being done every day to the 
fragile economies of the countries in the region

president bush met today with chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen here for the first time since chinas 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators and said they hoped to 
reduce differences between the two countries 
with qian at his side as they posed for photographers bush 
acknowledged that he has some differences with china on human 
rights but added that there are many positive and very important 
aspects to the relationship 
one purpose of this kind of meeting is to reduce the 
differences bush said 
bush and qian met after prolonged confusion over whether the 
meeting actually would take place the state department announced 
the meeting then issued a revised schedule suggesting it had been 
canceled but the meeting was held after qian met for more than two 
hours with secretary of state james a baker 
qian made the visit amid signs of new strains in sinoamerican 
relations 
chinese officials had led the bush administration to believe 
that qian would support the usbacked resolution approved 
thursday in the un security council the resolution authorizes 
the use of force against iraq 
but qian opted instead to abstain causing surprise and 
disappointment at the state department 
qian revealed he was not prepared to support the resolution as 
he was leaving beijing for new york he left the impression among 
some that his government was annoyed with speculation that the 
united states was inviting qian to washington to reward him for 
chinas support in the persian gulf crisis 
hours before the vote the chinese foreign ministry denied there 
was any link between chinas stand on the resolution and qians 
invitation to visit washington 
baker had wanted as lopsided a vote as possible to send a clear 
signal to iraqi president saddam hussein of international resolve 
on the gulf situation china had supported all 10 previous security 
council resolutions on that issue excluding chinas vote the 
tally thursday was 122 in support of the resolution 
there also are clear signs that human rights questions continue 
to be a sore point between the two countries since the crackdown on 
demonstrators in china a year and a half ago 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said in beijing it is 
not appropriate to interfere in some developing countries internal 
affairs with an excuse of human rights 
the bush administration has barred highlevel exchanges with 
china as a show of displeasure over its crackdown on demonstrators 
in tiananmen square in june 1989 
it has said qians visit does not violate that policy because 
his discussions in washington are regarded as contacts which 
are permitted meetings in the category of large ceremonial 
exchanges are barred 
the state department has noted that baker has met on a number of 
previous occasions with qian since the events at tiananmen square 
three of the meetings were in new york and the others were in paris 
and cairo

what do you make from flour the teacher at 
childrens boarding school no 24 asked her two dozen pupils on 
friday hoisting a kilogram sack from the first shipment of western 
food aid to arrive in moscow 
blini they chorused smiling at the prospect of sweet 
russian pancakes for dinner 
and what do you say their teacher continued 
thank you they responded 
as the first planeload of donated food from germany was 
distributed to orphanages and childrens hospitals the generosity 
spread in other western nations vienna promised 100000 food 
parcels for moscow children and organizations in the united 
states italy and the nordic countries prepared shipments of milk 
flour canned goods and other staples 
in leningrad pravda reported ambulances have been collecting 
victims of fainting from hunger heart attacks and broken ribs from 
the lines outside shops 
the price of carrots doubled as citizens braced for saturdays 
start of leningrads first rationing program since world war ii 
then it was besieged by nazi forces for 900 days and hundreds of 
thousands died many from hunger 
the moscow newspaper vechernaya moskva printed a plaintive 
appeal from a caller on friday my child is crying with hunger 
where can i buy just a little butter cereal and eggs a parent 
asked 
at childrens hospital no 3 in moscow warehouse clerk yulia 
bodganova gratefully received a german gift of beans chicken soup 
and flour even though the hospital has been better supplied than 
the city at large 
it was only this week that its food supplier warned that the 
young patients could no longer be spared the shortages 
weve received no sour cream or cottage cheese for three 
days she said by friday the usual deliveries of cheese and 
eggs also had evaporated 
a few blocks away engineer kim melkonian was the 170th person 
in a line for butter in the gathering dusk at 4 pm calculating 
one minute per customer he figured he would be waiting three hours 
in the darkened street before even entering the store 
he blamed the shortages on sabotage by bureaucrats struggling to 
hold onto their power in the face of growing democracy 
soviet officials have said the country has produced no less food 
this year than last despite the barren shelves that have panicked 
shoppers into hoarding and exacerbating the shortages 
but western governments are worried that frightened consumers 
could destabilize the government of president mikhail s gorbachev 
german chancellor helmut kohl has made aid to the soviets a top 
item on his international agenda arguing that without a stable 
soviet union reforms in eastern europe could be endangered 
we need the western aid melkonian said there is enough 
food but people are afraid we have to calm them down 
when gorbachev came to power people said mikhail 
sergeyevich we can do without butter just as long as there is no 
war now theres no longer any danger of war and everyone is 
saying give us bread melkonian said 
we do have wheat and bread in this country we do have the 
necessary food but where is it asked moscow mayor gavriil popov 
at a briefing friday its hidden by the stateowned farms 
collective farms which ones the best ones because the worst ones 
do not have anything 
they understand that when the land will be privatized there 
will be no place for them he said 
several republics and regions have cut off shipments of food 
beyond their borders leaving major cities like moscow with 
diminished supplies of milk and meat which have never been 
plentiful 
many farmers have stopped selling their crops through state 
stores at low official prices and switched to private farmers 
markets where prices are often 10 times as high 
theft is also rising prompting the national parliament to order 
the kgb to protect incoming shipments of humanitarian aid on 
friday the secretive police agency said it was forming a special 
unit for the task 
popov said muscovites will soon be given passes allowing them to 
purchase goods in specific stores at specific times to help people 
who complain that the shelves are empty when they get off work 
permits will specify the store date time and amount of money an 
individual can spend 
vienna mayor helmut zilk who announced his citys 2million 
aid program at the news conference in moscow with popov said this 
food should be given to the retirees to the most vulnerable 
groups of people the people who went through the war 
after the second world war all the allies helped us so we 
must now help you zilk said

the government department that is leading the 
federal fight against cigarette smoking was ordered friday to 
bargain with unionized employees over whether they may puff away on 
the job 
the department of health and human services which in 1987 
banned smoking by its 118000 employees in all of the agencys 
offices nationwide was ordered by the court to bargain with three 
union locals whose members want a place to smoke 
a federal labor relations authority order that hhs bargain with 
the three union locals was unanimously upheld in the decision by a 
threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the district of 
columbia 
there was no immediate comment from hhs 
but union attorney david f klein said the decision upholds an 
important principle that federal agencies must bargain with 
employees over working conditions unless they have a compelling 
reason not to negotiate 
hhss compelling reason not to was to set an example for the 
general public and the court didnt buy that klein said 
he said the decision will serve as a precedent for any other 
union locals that wish to challenge the hhs smoking ban 
after hhs promulgated the nosmoking rules in 1987 the three 
local chapters of the national treasury employees union sought to 
bargain over what the union argued was a change in working 
conditions 
the locals representing employees at the agencys washington 
headquarters the family support administration and the kansas 
city regional office proposed setting up designated smoking areas 
similar to those in other government agencies 
but hhs said it was not compelled to bargain with the union 
because the smoking ban was a crucialpart of its mission to 
persuade private companies to create smokefree environments for 
all workers 
the agency cited a 1986 report by the us surgeon general about 
the health risks to nonsmoking employees who breath the cigarette 
smoke of coworkers 
nothing less than a policy of a smokefree environment can 
assure adequate protection of the occupants in 
departmentcontrolled building space hhs said at the time 
but the appeals court noted a governmentwide regulation 
promulgated by the general services administration allows smoking 
in designated areas and also recognizes the collective bargaining 
obligations of government agencies on the question 
hhss healthbased argument is consequently a collateral 
attack on the governmentwide gsa regulation which the court 
noted requires that agencies accommodate the needs of smokers 
where feasible 
the court didnt dispute what it recognized as the agencys 
legitimate concern for the health of employees 
it is hard to see how it can be argued however that hhss 
concern for its employees can be qualitatively different from that 
of other government agencies the court said in an opinion by 
circuit judge laurence silberman 
the court upheld the federal labor panels determination that 
hhs had failed to prove a compelling need to declare its 
smoking rules offlimits to collective bargaining

president bush says hed love to see 
congress formally back the un resolution authorizing force 
against iraq but some on capitol hill say the lawmakers are much 
less receptive than the diplomats 
in any case bush said friday he has no plans to call congress 
into special session to address the issue and his announcement 
that hell send secretary of state james a baker iii on a 
diplomatic mission to baghdad seemed to make congressional action 
in the meantime all the less likely 
if congress were to take on the issue soon said house speaker 
thomas foley obviously its very difficult to tell what the 
response would be 
congress could amend it put conditions on it pass it by a 
narrow margin or defeat it by a narrow margin thats a matter the 
president will have to consider said foley dwash 
still senate republican leader bob dole renewing his call for 
a special session said there would be bipartisan backing for a 
resolution of support if it could be brought to a vote 
bush went on television declaring a willingness to go the 
extra mile in the quest for peace he offered to swap highlevel 
visits with iraq and was meeting later with senior members of 
congress to consult on his gulf policy 
one senior democratic aide said it would be pointless to 
hold a formal debate until after baker and iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz hold talks in each others capitals between now and jan 
15 
some leading republicans on capitol hill have suggested that 
bush quickly seek ratification by congress of the resolution 
approved by the united nations security council on thursday 
authorizing military action to liberate kuwait if iraq does not 
withdraw by jan 15 
such a move they say would demonstrate to iraqi president 
saddam hussein that the united states was united and determined 
that his aggression against kuwait would not be rewarded they want 
bush to act while his international momentum is high 
id love to see congress pass a resolution enthusiastically 
endorsing what the united nations has done bush said at a white 
house news conference 
what i dont want to do is have it come back and end up where 
you have 435 voices in one house and 100 in the other saying what 
not to do he said adding that he hopes to avoid a 
handwringing operation that would send bad signals 
i know my strengths and i know the limitations on the 
presidency bush said 
democrats in congress and some republicans are saying the 
president should not take support for granted all week sen sam 
nunn dga has paraded former military officials before his armed 
services committee criticizing bushs gulf policy 
congressional critics say bush still has not provided a coherent 
rationale for the latest escalation in us troop deployment and 
for the apparent shift to an offensive stance that it signals 
at this point i would not support it rep dan glickman 
dkan said of a possible resolution speaking in advance of the 
presidents speech 
we could see an extraordinarily messy situation created by a 
congressional vote one which portrays not the unity that bush 
seeks but division he said he must go and sell the american 
public as to why its necessary 
and rep william broomfield of michigan the senior republican 
on the foreign affairs committee cautioned bush to wait to develop 
a better consensus before asking congress to rule on his policy 
at its core the problem is relatively simple how does congress 
help bush amplify his threats to use force against iraq in the hope 
of forcing saddam to back down without at the same time giving up 
its right to decide whether ultimately to go to war 
many lawmakers fear that they would in voting for a resolution 
approving military action be giving bush a blank check for 
whatever moves he may choose 
an endorsement by congress would not be simply a vote of 
confidence in the same manner as the un resolution said house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo it ups the ante he 
said then you have changed the policy and force can happen 
gephardt welcomed bushs moves friday as a use of the un vote 
to give new life to diplomacy there is broad support in this 
country for moving in this direction and saddam hussein should 
know that america is united in our determination to see him end his 
brutal occupation gephardt said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass suggested that congress could 
pass a resolution that puts on the record what many democrats have 
been saying all week at senate hearings on the gulf crisis that 
economic sanctions should be allowed time to work even if it takes 
a year or more 
going to war now or in the next few months would be a mistake 
that could cost the lives of thousands of americans for no 
justifiable reason kennedy said 
but if there are risks for bush there are risks for congress as 
well in seeking to fence the presidents actions 
how can you vote against a resolution if youve got your boys 
on the front line shooting or being shot at said rep joseph 
moakley dmass we should be brought into the situation before 
that he said

the world almanac appears to have jumped the gun 
regarding the outcome of arizonas gubernatorial election 
according to the 1991 world almanac and book of facts fife 
symington is the new governor 
however after the nov 6 general election votes were counted 
neither republican symington nor his democratic opponent terry 
goddard received a majority and a runoff election was declared for 
feb 26 
two million copies of the almanac are hitting the bookstore 
shelves this week containing the wrong information 
we go to press practically as soon as the results are in on 
election day night said martha clarke publicity manager for 
pharos books a subsidiary of scripps howard which has published 
the almanac since 1986 
the governors of the states except in your case apparently 
are correct ms clarke said literally the editor in chief is 
writing down the results on his way to the printing press 
although there is no mention of a runoff a section titled the 
race for governor 1990 mentions that the results are 
preliminary 
the almanac shows symington with 519558 votes to goddards 
515999 
after all precincts were counted official election results show 
symington with 523984 to goddards 519691 votes out of more than 
109 million votes cast 
they got it wrong and theyll have to change it in february 
goddard said theyll have to buy a lot of whiteout 
symington who has referred to the runoff campaign as a 
reelection bid said i think its very amusing and 
hopefully its a good omen he said

the soldiers who shared 
thanksgiving dinner with president bush said friday they welcomed 
the ultimatum set by the un security council as the only way to 
get saddam hussein out of kuwait 
he better let the hostages go and he better leave or were 
coming to get him said sgt william r blocker 7 of 
sylacauga ala who chatted with barbara bush as he ate his turkey 
and trimmings 
a week after their commanderinchief told them he would not let 
saddam remain in kuwait indefinitely soldiers from the 197th 
infantry brigade gathered in their dusty desert camp to voice 
support for his latest success at the united nations 
several said the resolution authorizing the use of force if iraq 
fails to leave conquered kuwait by jan 15 should have been adopted 
months ago it was passed thursday 
i think its about 90 days too late but i can live with jan 
15 said sgt mark channer 25 of new york city who was mrs 
bushs escort 
his advice to saddam pack up and move out quick 
sgt james landreth 29 of new boston ohio who ate turkey 
with senate minority leader bob dole echoed channer saying it 
should have happened a while back as we got here they should 
already have figured that out 
for months blocker said the troops have been in limbo not 
knowing if they were going to stay here or go home 
now we know were going to be here til the end til he 
either leaves or we force him out its a good relief to hear 
something like that because basically they opened the door and let 
us out of the dark and they let us know what was going on 
blocker said 
cpl thomas cook 32 of granite city ill like the rest of 
the brigade has spent three months in a desolate patch of desert 
about an hours ride from the nearest paved highway in a fourwheel 
drive vehicle down a bumpy sand trail 
bush wants to put an end to the stalemate he said 
we cant just sit out here and just keep yelling at each other 
so somebodys got to do something cook said 
sgt 1st class steven campbell 37 of ft benning ga where 
the brigade is headquartered said its an indication again that 
were not going to back down from hussein i think it needed to be 
done and we did it and the un is the forum to do it 
id like to get home sooner to my wife and children but im 
not packing my bags yet said the 19year army veteran who 
introduced the president to the 1250 soldiers and politicians at 
thanksgiving dinner 
spec robert terry 23 of rehoboth beach del said bushs 
visit helped morale and the un resolution would also be a boost 
i think the guys out here now that they have a positive date 
that something will happen i think thatll help em out he 
said 
but truthfully i think husseinll pull out before that hes 
got more brains than that he said

the soviet union would not hesitate to use 
military force to protect its 3300 nationals held in iraq 
officials said friday edging away from their previous refusal to 
send troops to the region 
everybody should know that we will not hesitate to use force 
to protect our citizens foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
told the official tass news agency 
its high time to end inaction in situations when human life 
dignity and fate become expendable currency in an immoral political 
game he said in an interview in new york 
the kremlin has said iraq would face serious consequences if 
soviet citizens were harmed but until now it had not said 
specifically that its response could include military force 
shevardnadzes tough talk came a day after president mikhail s 
gorbachev hardened his stand in the persian gulf crisis calling 
for military pressure to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
concern about soviet citizens was also expressed by deputy 
foreign minister vladimir petrovsky who returned to moscow early 
friday following a 36hour visit to iran iraqs neighbor and enemy 
during their eightyear gulf war 
it is obvious that we would be prepared to take the most 
drastic measures to protect the life of every individual soviet 
citizen if the need arises petrovsky told a news briefing 
moscow sent two warships to the gulf soon after iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait to protect commercial ships but has repeatedly 
maintained it would not participate in a multinational force or 
naval blockade unless it were under the auspices of the united 
nations 
the soviet union voted thursday in favor of the un security 
council resolution giving iraq a jan 15 deadline to withdraw from 
kuwait and release all foreign hostages or risk military action 
asked whether that meant the soviet union now was prepared to 
send troops both shevardnadze and petrovsky couched their answers 
in terms of possible threats to soviet citizens stranded there the 
soviet nationals are not known to be held as human shields at 
potential military targets 
petrovsky said a decision to dispatch troops would require 
additional consultations and deliberations he did not elaborate 
petrovsky also warned iraq not to underestimate the global 
determination to dislodge him from kuwait 
iraq should not misinterpret the will of international 
security and should have no doubt that the world community is ready 
to act he said 
this choice is up to baghdad and it will shape the action of 
the world communityin the future 
petrovsky said he hoped thursdays un vote may serve as a 
serious signal to help iraq to understand the seriousness of the 
situation i would like to hope that iraq has not said its last 
word

where he had served for 19 months with bushs endorsement bennett 
is assured of election to the party post when the republican 
national committee meets in january

by a malignant brain tumor

chairman of the party a post that does not currently exist 
im delighted that lee atwater will continue to provide valued 
counsel as general chairman of the party said the president 
he has been as you all know a close adviser and political 
strategist chief political strategist and a good friend 
bennett began his government career as chairman of the national 
endowment for the humanities during the reagan administration and 
then served as secretary of education 
martinez served one term as governor of florida and was defeated 
on nov 6 by former sen lawton chiles

bulgaria will hold elections in six 
months to replace parliament which has been dominated by former 
premier andrei lukanovs unpopular governing socialist party 
according to news reports friday 
the trade union newspaper trud quoted president zhelyu zhelev as 
saying a may date for elections was set as part of an agreement 
reached between lukanov and other political leaders prior to 
lukanovs resignation on thursday 
during these consultations it was the common opinion that the 
grand national assembly should be retained until march zhelev 
said afterward it should disband and the elections should take 
place in may 
legislators on friday accepted lukanovs resignation which was 
provoked by weeks of antigovernment strikes and protests 
there was no evidence in sofia on friday of the strikes 
organized by the podkrepa trade union and other widespread protests 
that had disrupted the capital for weeks 
highplaced officials said a new premier probably would be named 
next week speaking on condition of anonymity they said top 
contenders were ginyo ganev the deputy chairman of parliament and 
krastyo petkov head of the main confederation of independent trade 
unions 
speaking to parliament lukanov said the agreement under which 
he stepped down offered this balkan nation of 9 million people a 
chance to end its worst postwar crisis that opportunity if 
missed may prove the last one he said 
even though i am stepping down my economic and social progra 
has no alternative lukanov told the grand national assembly in 
his last week as premier lukanov pushed through parliament an 
austerity budget calling for steep price increases 
the current parliament dominated by lukonovs socialist party 
was elected in june during bulgarias first free elections in 
decades at the time it was agreed the elected legislators would 
serve for a minimum of one year 
but the popularity of the socialists has fallen steadily since 
then and the opposition coalition union of democratic forces says 
it would win any new elections 
many bulgarians associate lukanov a reformed former communist 
with four decades of communism and tens of thousands of people 
gathered thursday night to cheer his resignation 
but he was one of the few bulgarian politicians with the 
government experience and stature for the premiership 
he had urged the socialist party under chairman alexander lilov 
to reform itself but lukanov apparently was unable to press 
changes on the party or to break entirely with it and ended up 
sharing the partys unpopularity 
a new government of largely inexperienced leaders will face 
daunting problems that have grown steadily worse in months of 
political inaction because of the stalemate between the socialists 
and the opposition 
electricity is rationed in sofia and elsewhere foodstuffs and 
many basic consumer items are either rationed or unavailable and 
the country cannot make payments on its 11 billion foreign debt 
lukanov said political leaders had agreed that a new coalition 
government would be formed soon and that his successor should not 
belong to his own party or the opposition alliance 
lukanov told a news conference that his resignation would not 
be fatal for the socialists but said changes were needed in the 
party 
now that we are not a governing party it gives us a chance to 
solve our internal problems and determine the collective and 
individual responsibility within the party for the countrys 
problems he said 
lukanov was one of a group of reformed communists who helped 
oust longtime communist leader todor zhivkov last november he was 
appointed premier in early february and then presided over the 
countrys increasing polarization deteriorating living standards 
and growing public anger

either nuclear or conventional arms and able to operate from 
treetop level to altitudes above 60000 feet f111s from

the chief soviet negotiator at talks on 
reducing conventional arms in europe said friday he believes new 
negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear weapons on the continent 
can start within two months 
his comment was believed to be the first time an official from 
either the warsaw pact or the north atlantic treaty organization 
had publicly mentioned a time frame for such negotiations 
the kremlin has long pushed for talks on reducing shortrange 
or tactical nuclear weapons the only nuclear arms in europe not 
so far reduced by treaty or under negotiation such weapons have a 
range of less than 300 miles 
the wests shortrange weapons most based in what was west 
germany would hit targets in what are now considered friendly east 
european countries 
until recently the west resisted negotiating away what nato has 
viewed as a vital element in its nuclear deterrence to counter the 
warsaw pacts massive ground forces in eastern europe 
in paris this month the leaders of the 22 nations in nato and 
the warsaw pact took historic steps toward reducing the danger of a 
surprise attack by those ground forces signing an accord that 
slashed tanks and other conventional arms in europe by 100000 
units and a formal declaration of nonaggression a second phase of 
negotiations aimed primarily at reducing the number of soldiers in 
europe opened in vienna nov 26 
however soviet president mikhail s gorbachev stressed at the 
paris summit that moscow wants naval forces and tactical nuclear 
weapons included either in the vienna talks or negotiated 
elsewhere 
i think that within two months we will be in a position to 
start such negotiations oleg grinevsky soviet ambassador to the 
vienna arms reduction talks told a new conference when asked about 
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons he declined to be more 
specific 
another soviet negotiator oleg khlestov said the situation 
is only in the process of defining ideas 
nato agreed last summer that talks on reducing tactical nuclear 
weapons could begin shortly after the treaty signed in paris 
was wrapped up but has not given a more specific date or place 
khlestov reiterated the kremlin view that naval forces should be 
included in vienna talks arguing that confrontation has moved to 
the naval arena now that substantial reductions have been 
negotiated in ground and air forces 
the west has resisted including naval forces saying this would 
require complex global talks rather than ones confined to north 
america and europe

iraq rejects the un security council 
ultimatum to withdraw from kuwait and will fight to keep the 
conquered emirate if necessary the ruling revolutionary command 
council said friday 
the sevenman council led by president saddam hussein said the 
un resolution authorizing military force if iraq doesnt leave 
kuwait by jan 15 is illegal null and void because it was 
imposed by the united states 
should the forces of evil launch aggression this nation of 
impossible missions will teach all those a hard lesson 
unprecedented in history the council said one day after the 
resolution was adopted by the security council 
however the revolutionary command council repeated a call for 
dialogue with the united states to resolve the persian gulf crisis 
and the palestinian question on the basis of equality and mutual 
respect 
saddam has repeatedly tried to link a resolution of the gulf 
crisis with a resolution of the palestinian uprising in israel the 
united states has repeatedly rejected such a linkage demanding an 
unconditional withdrawal 
on friday president bush unexpectedly offered to send secretary 
of state james a baker iii to baghdad to discuss the crisis 
in baghdad the iraqi leadership was taken by surprise by bushs 
announcement about baker and immediately went back into session to 
discuss the development diplomats said it was not known who 
attended the meeting 
on thursday saddam said iraq would not be intimidated by the 
un security council resolution he insisted his armed forces had 
the technology to defeat sophisticated american weapons such as 
stealth aircraft 
the americans are still influenced by rambo movies but this is 
not a rambo movie this is something different he said 
fridays revolutionary command council statement said the iraqi 
people reject ultimatums and threats and will never bow to 
tyranny and terrorism 
the resolution it said was first and foremost an american 
decision in which certain powers participated only under american 
pressure 
the united states mobilized all its resources in an 
unprecedented move to practice all forms pressure and terrorism and 
pay together with its agents the bribes to secure the votes 
the statement said 
cuba and yemen the only arab member on the 15member security 
council voted against the resolution on thursday china abstained 
it is a shameful resolution tarnished with the scandals that 
have transformed the security council into a cover for us 
hegemony and a theater for its dirty deals the revolutionary 
command council said 
it noted that the council had failed to end israeli occupation 
of arab territories and because of this arab masses would reject 
the latest resolution against iraq these nations which voted to 
give legitimacy to americas aggression against iraq made no move 
to confront the israeli aggression against palestine the 
statement said 
instead they maneuvered to slow down any effort against the 
rape of jerusalem and against the premeditated crimes committed by 
the zionist occupation forces it said 
the double standards these powers have become crystal clear 
after the latest resolution the iraqi leaders said

president saddam hussein and other iraqi 
leaders will be tried for war crimes just as the nazis were after 
world war ii a senior us official said friday 
secretary of state james a baker iii and the foreign ministers 
of britain france and the soviet union all stressed the individual 
liability of iraqs leaders in their addresses before the un 
security council on friday 
a senior us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the geneva conventions of 1949 on the protection of civilians 
and the 1925 geneva accords barring the use in war of chemical or 
biological weapons provide the legal basis for culpability 
iraq is a party to both agreements 
kuwaiti exiles horrified the security council on tuesday with 
their personal accounts of torture rape murder and other 
atrocities perpetrated by iraqi troops occupying kuwait 
their stories were backed with lurid color photographs of 
alleged torture victims and videotapes including a sequence in 
which iraqi troops appeared to fire on peaceful protesters 
iraq has denied reports of any systematic abuse by its soldiers 
no resolution dealing with the issue of war crimes is planned in 
the immediate future said the us senior official and a soviet 
diplomat partly because the geneva agreements cover the situation 
also they said under the use of force resolution adopted 
by the security council on thursday the world community pledged to 
take no new steps against baghdad until jan 15 as a pause of 
good will 
after that date nations allied with kuwaits 
governmentinexile are authorized by the resolution to use all 
necessary means to liberate the emirate and free the hostages 
held by baghdad 
all necessary means covers diplomatic efforts as well as a 
military strike to dislodge iraq and recover the hostages 
however the usled multinational forces massing in the gulf 
will not be ready to launch an attack until late january or 
february us officials say about 200000 us reinforcements are 
on their way to saudi arabia 
a senior soviet diplomat said there was logic in the concept 
of a resolution after jan 15 emphasizing the individual liability 
of the iraqi leaders if the allied nations do not wish to go to war 
immediately 
shevardnadze warned thursday that saddam would be held 
personally responsible for any use of chemical or biological 
weapons and breaches of the fourth geneva convention guaranteeing 
the rights of civilians in time of war 
french foreign minister roland dumas emphasized the individual 
responsibility of iraqs leaders for war crimes hinting at 
instituting a nurembergstyle tribunal 
all persons who would be inclined to use biological and 
chemical weapons will be personally responsible for that act that 
means well take other measures in that direction dumas said 
i think well meet in the next day and see what we can do in 
that direction it was an agreement among ourselves he aid 
the nuremberg trials of nazi war criminals held between 
194549 were the first time under international law that the 
leaders of a nation were tried for starting an aggressive war 
nineteen nazi leaders were sentenced to death by hanging 
the council members have now put iraq on notice that its leaders 
will be held liable the senior us official said 
a previous security council resolution invites nations to 
collect evidence of war crimes and submit it to the council

thousands of people defied 
stateofemergency restrictions in bangladeshs two largest cities 
friday holding mass protests demanding that president hussein 
muhammad ershad quit witness accounts said 
security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters 
armed with small bombs in dhaka the capital and the port city of 
chittagong according to other unofficial reports reaching india 
governmentcontrolled bangladesh radio said five people were 
killed since tuesday night when ershad decreed a state of emergency 
suspending civil liberties and imposed a curfew his action 
followed six weeks of unrest against his government 
the official radio monitored in the eastern indian city of 
calcutta said two curfew violators were killed by police on 
wednesday and two more people were shot dead in clashes between 
rival opposition groups the same day another was killed thursday 
also in a fight between rival groups the radio said 
opposition groups said on thursday that 50 people were killed 
independent verification was unobtainable because of a news 
blackout enforced by government censorship 
bangladesh radio accused foreign media of exaggerating the 
casualty reports it warned that stern action will be taken 
against any violation of the curfew 
opposition parties supported by university students demand 
that ershad resign in favor of a neutral government to supervise 
new elections ershad a former army general who seized power in a 
bloodless 1982 coup has refused to step aside 
defense analysts and diplomatic sources in india said they 
believe ershad could weather the crisis as long as the army remains 
loyal there has been no sign of revolt from the military in the 
latest protests they said 
the curfew was lifted for seven hours friday to allow people to 
buy food and attend prayers at mosques on the weekly islamic holy 
day about 10000 people poured out of mosques in both dhaka and 
chittagong and staged protest marches despite orders banning 
rallies or large assemblies 
in chittagong progovernment crowds burned the office of the 
opposition bangladesh nationalist party while govenment troops 
combed the city center following a bomb attack on one of their 
vehicles according to unofficial accounts no injuries were 
reported in the bombing 
the major opposition parties called for a dawntodusk 
nationwide strike on saturday bangladesh radio reported 
meanwhile that the curfew would be relaxed from 6 am to 4 pm 
saturday in dhaka chittagong and two other cities 
in dhaka the capital of 7 million people crowds streamed out 
of the baitul mukarram mosque in the city center denouncing the 
state of emergency and hurling bricks and stones at security 
forces said witness accounts reaching new delhi 
most people dispersed when the curfew was resumed at 3 pm 
police used bamboo staves to beat demonstrators who darted in small 
groups from side streets to taunt the authorities 
earlier police smashed batons on a group of 200 women who 
gathered outside the national press club in dhaka a favorite spot 
for public protests a few male journalists observing the scene 
also received blows 
no reports were available from khulna and rajshahi two other 
large cities where the curfew was lifted for seven hours 
newspaper editors who were summoned by a senior official of 
ershads government refused to suspend an indefinite strike called 
on tuesday to protest a decree that all news items about the unrest 
be submitted for prior censorship no newspapers have appeared 
since the emergency was imposed 
the latest antigovernment campaign began last month when two 
rival opposition groups the bangladesh national party and the 
awami league called a truce between themselves to challenge 
ershads announcement that he will run for reelection next year 
the opposition claims ershad rigged previous presidential and 
parliamentary elections they vowed to boycott the vote called for 
june unless he resigns 
ershad came to power following a succession of 
militaryinstalled governments which ruled bangladesh formerly 
east pakistan since it broke away from west pakistan in a 1971 
civil war 
analysts say he has stayed in office by balancing civilian 
bureaucrats against army generals and frequently shuffling the 
military command to block the emergence of any power centers within 
the establishment

samuel santiago couldnt leave his apartment 
without setting off an electronic ankle bracelet keeping him under 
house arrest but that didnt stop him from committing murder and 
armed robbery police said friday 
santiago 18 was being held without bond in cook county jail on 
charges that he shot and killed a man one day and robbed a pizza 
delivery man at gunpoint the next police say the crimes occurred 
within 100 feet of santiagos home 
the electronic monitoring device attached to santiagos ankle 
would have alerted authorities only if he were to go farther than 
100 feet from a telephone receiver in his apartment police said 
he knew just how far he could go without setting off the 
alarm said police sgt ron rewers 
santiago had served about a year of a threeyear prison term for 
auto theft because his record in prison was good he was assigned 
to the home monitoring program in october said nic howell a 
spokesman for the illinois corrections department 
authorities say santiago and federico conde 19 on monday lured 
rudy del castillo to a passageway outside santiagos home on the 
pretense of selling him cocaine 
they robbed the 18yearold victim of several gold chains and 
about 1300 in cash and then shot him rewers said 
police suspected santiago in the crime but did not arrest him 
until the next evening after he robed a pizza delivery man of 70 
and investigators searched his apartment rewers said 
they also arrested conde who was last seen with the shooting 
victim and charged him with murder he was being held in lieu of 
270000 bond a jail official said 
santiago is the first of 1800 inmates assigned to home 
monitoring since june 1989 to be charged with a serious offense 
howell said eleven people under home monitoring have been charged 
with lesser crimes and only two were convicted he said 
we do a lot of watching of these guys our concern is for the 
safety of the public and were not going to put someone on this 
program that we think is going to get into trouble howell said 
this one incident should not bear on the rest of the 
program he said noting that illinois prisons already are 
overcrowded with nearly 10000 more inmates than the 
maximumcapacity 18857 
a spokeswoman for gov james thompson also defended the home 
monitoring program saying it is necessary to relieve the states 
badly overcrowded prisons 
its a great system its just not a perfect system said 
spokeswoman jill fowler 
a recent federal report said illinois prison population rose 
more rapidly than any other state in the nation last year

president bush announced friday hes sending 
secretary of state james a baker iii to iraq in a lastditch 
diplomatic effort to persuade saddam hussein to leave kuwait 
but the president armed with a new un resolution authorizing 
force also said hes ready to wage war if the mission fails and 
with enough power to get the job done he declared there 
will not be any murky ending 
in addition to sending baker to meet with saddam bush said he 
has invited iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz for a middecember 
white house meeting on the persian gulf crisis 
he said the twopart diplomatic overture was an attempt to 
present the us case directly to iraqs leader i hope what it 
does is demonstrate that we are prepared to go facetoface and 
tell him how committed we are to the united nations resolutions 
insisting iraqi troops leave occupied kuwait 
bush announcing the decision in a statement from the white 
house briefing room at the opening of a news conference said 
bakers mission would be at a mutually convenient time between 
dec 15 and jan 15 
it isnt a trip of concession bush asserted even though it 
reverses the administrations previous opposition to sending 
emissaries to iraq 
there was no immediate word from baghdad on the development but 
the iraqi ambassador to france abdul razzack al hashimi called 
bushs announcement a very important step toward peace 
in an interview with bbc radio the iraqi official said we 
hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for 
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war and this is 
really i consider it very good news 
bush hailed thursdays united nations security council vote 
authorizing force and setting a deadline of jan 15 for iraqs 
troops to leave kuwait 
i remain hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to 
this crisis but if force is required we and the other 26 
countries who have troops in the area will have enough power to get 
the job done he said 
the president added that any such battle will not be another 
vietnam this will not be a protracted drawnout war i pledge 
to you there will not be any murky ending 
bush said he would continue to consult with congressional 
leaders but had no plans to convene a special session of congress 
rep william broomfield rmich senior republican on the house 
foreign affairs committee said the proposed diplomatic contacts 
would provide wiggle room for saddam and said anything the 
president can do to keep the focus of the crisis on diplomacy and 
not on war is all to the good 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said bushs opening of 
a highlevel diplomatic channel was a positive step 
i think its another indication that the president wants a 
peaceable settlement dole said 
bush defended anew his decision to send 430000 us troops into 
the region i want peace not war but if there must be a war we 
will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their 
backs he said 
the president removed his glasses and his eyes were moist as he 
was asked if as a father of four children he felt the need to 
drive iraq from kuwait was important enough to ask parents to 
sacrifice the lives of sons and daughters in the armed services 
people say to me how many lives how many lives can you 
expend each one is precious i know what its like to have 
fallen comrades and see young kids die in battle he said 
but he added if a shot is fired in anger i want to 
guarantee each person that their kid whose life is in harms way 
will have the maximum support will have their best chance to come 
home alive and will be backed up to the hilt 
in the past administration officials have opposed the sending 
of emissaries to baghdad to meet with saddam and bush was asked 
what made him change his mind 
the united nations resolution i think has a good chance of 
making saddam hussein understand what it is hes up against i have 
not felt that he got the message so its just going the extra 
step thats what it is and its a decision that i personally 
made 
bush said that his own meeting with aziz iraqs foreign 
minister would occur the week of dec 10 and that he would also 
invite foreign ministers from us allies in the gulf to attend 
he said he and baker at the later meeting with saddam will 
be prepared to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis 
a number of democrats and some republicans in congress have 
criticized bushs gulf policy and former military officials also 
have questioned his mideast buildup in hearings that continued 
friday but bush said if congress wanted a special session it 
would have to call one itself 
they have the power to come back 20 seconds from now he 
said if they want to come back here and endorse what the 
president of the united states has done and what the united nations 
secrity council has done come on were ready he said 
after his news conference bush telephoned saudi arabias king 
fahd egyptian president hosni mubarak turkeys president turgot 
ozal and the exiled emir of kuwait 
asked their reaction to his announcement he said later its 
all been very very positive 
in his speech and news conference afterward bush also 
disclosed that iraqis have recently appeared unexpectedly at 
the besieged us embassy in kuwait with deliveries of cigarettes 
fruits and vegetables he said he understood there would be another 
delivery on saturday including soft drinks 
disputed critics who have minimized the potential iraqi 
nuclear threat saying i am not going to err on the side of 
underestimation

next to the two front seats in the cramped soviet 
space capsule heading into orbit sunday is an extra chair thats 
turning out to be the kremlins ticket to cosmic profits 
the seat on the soyuz capsule has held pure spacegrown 
crystals worth millions of dollars and valuable products of space 
experiments as well as cosmonauts from other countries 
on sunday the seat will carry the first journalist and first 
japanese to space under a commercial agreement that officials 
hope will turn new profits for the soviet space program 
toyohiro akiyama of japans biggest television company tbs 
will ride on the soyuz tm11 under a contract between the company 
and the soviet union 
the network is paying about 11 million for the honor and is 
working out other agreements with agencies that are emerging as 
profitmaking arms of the soviet space industry 
the flight is part of a push to make the soviet space program 
more selfsufficient as the united states also has tried to do 
an overburdened national budget and a critically ailing economy 
have put tremendous pressure on soviet officials last year they 
suspended the soyuz flights and left the orbiting mir space station 
unoccupied for four months to save money 
the eightday soyuz tm11 flight will be the eighth to hook up 
with the mir space station since it was put up in 1986 soviet 
cosmonauts musa manarov and victor afanasyev have been designated 
to replace gennady manakov and gennady strekalov in the mir while 
akiyama delivers live exclusive radio and tv reports of his 
experience 
although soviet scientists and 14 foreign astronauts have ridden 
in the third seat akiyama will be the first nonscientific paying 
passenger 
he is scheduled to conduct experiments on japanese tree frogs 
an idea proposed by the japanese to see how they cope in the 
gravityfree environment 
back on earth hell deliver speeches and travel to talk about 
the experience which tbs has billed as a celebration of its 40th 
year on the air 
tbs is sending about 120 reporters cameramen and technicians to 
document the flight from baikonur cosmodrome a oncesecret complex 
1560 miles from moscow in the kazakhstan desert at least one top 
official a former aide to japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
will also witness the midday launch 
on friday the 161foottall soyuz rocket was rolled out to the 
launch pad in front of soviet japanese and other foreign 
journalists scores of space technicians in black coveralls and 
orange helmets scurried around the rocket to raise it to a 
standing position and prepare it for liftoff 
the deputy chief of testing maj gen alexei a shumilin told 
reporters the flight will have great political significance by 
setting a precedent for soviet cooperation with other countries 
the flight will make a profit although we are not sure how 
much he said but interest in this launch will give us a 
chance to see how profitable the flights can be 
standing in belowfreezing weather the soyuz rocket stood tall 
on the launch pad at the 35yearold space complex opened over two 
years ago to foreign visitors 
the complex where most soviet satellites and spaceships are 
launched is also the site of the countrys worst space disasters 
including an explosion that destroyed a satellite just seconds 
after liftoff in early october 
the japanese government has no official connection with sundays 
launch a tbs official in baikonur said but executive producer 
ichiro sasaki said the japanese people will have a better 
understanding of this country and we hope the soviets will 
understand us better 
tbs has declined to officially say how much akiyamas space 
flight is costing them but sasaki confirmed that the amount is 
roughly 11 million the figure quoted in the media 
he said disarray in the soviet space industry caused by 
economic reforms and government restructuring has complicated the 
joint project 
this is one of their the space industrys first attempts at 
business with foreigners but they are still using soviet ways of 
doing business sasaki said 
the soviets now are talking with china spain turkey and iran 
to send up paying passengers britain austria germany and france 
already are planning to pay for seats on a soviet capsule 
according to us space expert james oberg

an old bridge has risen from the 
water as the inundated town of monticello reemerges from a 
manmade lake thats receding after four years of drought 
with each dry day receding lake berryessa reveals more remains 
of the town once a thriving farming community before the 
government claimed it for a dam and reservoir in the 1950s 
there was almost nothing left when they got through 
remembered harold moskowitz 64 who was raised in monticello and 
now lives near the dwindling lake they paid us off gave 
buildings away tore some down and burned some what they couldnt 
burn they buried 
the only thing left would be some streets and foundations 
they didnt leave anything over 6 inches high even the trees it 
was a sad thing to lose that town 
now hundreds of tourists and former residents are trekking to 
the lake about 50 miles northeast of san francisco to glimpse the 
past and remember the towns century of life 
i was born in the valley and was about 10 years old when it 
went under said ronnie mcguinnis a maintenance worker for the 
us bureau of reclamation which manages the lake and recreational 
area 
i think people are coming back because they are still 
distressed and remember being uprooted they couldnt believe it 
was possible that this gigantic government could come in a tell 
them to get out its almost like we were indians and they wanted 
our land 
the valley originally was inhabited by indians pomo miwok and 
wappo tribes who retreated as europeans settled the valley and 
lake were named for jose and sisto berryessa brothers from spain 
who began the la putas rancho in 1943 in the area soon known for 
raising grain and cattle 
about 500 people lived in the valley but dwindled to about 125 
by the 1950s when water was getting scarce as northern california 
grew the federal government formed a plan with solano county to 
dam putah river to create a reservoir in the valley which sits 
mostly in adjacent napa county 
the 1000footlong 304foothigh monticello dam created a 
reservoir that supplies solano county and serves as a for seven 
resorts 
berryessa normally is three miles across at its widest point and 
26 miles long but is about onethird that size after losing 60 
percent of its water this week the lake surface fell to 377 feet 
above sea level nearly 12 feet lower than during the drought of 
197677 and 63 feet below normal the average 30 inches of rain a 
year at berryessa has dropped by half since the 1986 floods 
causing the lake level to fall 1520 feet annually 
if it doesnt rain this lake could dry up in a few years 
then youll really get to see the whole town said jim peterson 
maintenance foreman for the reclamation bureau 
downtown monticello remains under 50 to 60 feet of water but 
outlying areas are being revealed as the lake dries up a 
foundation here an old swimming pool there along with sunken 
boats motors fishing poles and tennis shoes indian artifacts 
also have been found 
roads unused for three decades have fresh tire tracks from 
explorers while a 1941 bridge under water until this summer is 
marked by muddy footprints as the span sits 6 feet above the lakes 
surface 
people can walk across if they want but it doesnt go 
anywhere peterson said for some reason though were getting 
a lot of visitors even though theres not much to see except a few 
concrete slabs 
park ranger arnold roessler whos busy these days telling 
visitors how to find the emerging bits of the past said people are 
searching for more 
its too bad about the drought but some people are hoping 
that it continues just so we can see whats really down there 
said ranger arnold roessler its like a developing mystery

president bush met friday with chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen and said differences over human rights 
continue to affect relations with beijing 18 months after the 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
bush also said there are many positive and very important 
aspects in relations between the two countries it was qians 
first visit to washington since china snuffed out the prodemocracy 
movement at tiananmen square in june 1989 
qian spent more than two hours with secretary of state james a 
baker iii before calling on bush at the white house 
i think the chinese government knows we have some differences 
on this whole broad question of human rights bush said as he and 
qian posed for photographers but we have many things in 
common 
one purpose of this kind of meeting is to reduce the 
differences bush said 
he said the us government has a very frank relationship 
with qian and the ability to discuss differences openly 
qian offered no public remarks but on thursday a foreign 
ministry spokesman in beijing said he felt that any discussion of 
human rights at fridays meetings was inappropriate interference in 
chinas internal affairs 
qian came here from new york where he cast an abstention 
thursday on the security council resolution authorizing the use of 
force against iraq 
state department officials were surprised and disappointed 
because chinese officials had led them to believe that qian would 
support the resolution 
nonetheless bush praised chinas willingness to stand up to 
aggression by iraq in kuwait an apparent reference to chinas 
support for all previous security council resolutions on iraq 
for unexplained reasons the state department announced the 
bushqian meeting friday morning then indicated it had been 
cancelled but qian turned up at the white house at the time 
initially announced by the state department and spent a little more 
than a half hour with bush 
in announcing qians visit here the state department insisted 
that the administrations policy of no highlevel exchanges with 
china was still in effect officials pointed out that baker has met 
with qian three times in new york and once each in cairo and paris 
the state department explained that contacts with chinese 
officials are permitted but not large ceremonial exchanges 
that prohibition was imposed after chinese authorities unleashed 
military forces against the tiananmen square demonstrators 
military sales also are banned 
as a permanent member of the security council china has been 
deeply involved in persian gulf diplomacy enabling it to overcome 
somewhat the relative diplomatic isolation it experienced in the 
aftermath of the suppression of the tiananmen square movement

iraq on friday blamed passage of the un useofforce 
resolution on pressure terrorism and bribes from washington 
president bush made a surprise diplomatic overture to saddam 
hussein but also issued a warning 
if military conflict does break out bush said it will not be 
another vietnam this will not be another protracted drawnout 
war 
in the fourth day of senate hearings on the persian gulf crisis 
a former us intelligence official urged washington not to rush 
toward war with iraq 
oil prices tumbled more than 3 a barrel to 2990 on the 
new york mercantile exchange after bush suggested sending secretary 
of state james a baker iii to baghdad to seek an end to the 
crisis 
before bushs remarks cooled temperatures saddams ruling 
revolutionary command council called the un security council 
resolution passed thursday illegal null and void saying it 
was imposed by the united states 
it is first and foremost an american decision in which certain 
powers participated only under american pressure it said the 
united states practiced all forms of pressure terrorism and 
bribes to pass the measure 
the statement broadcast on staterun baghdad radio said that 
if forced to fight iraq would teach the united states and its 
allies a hard lesson unprecedented in history 
the un resolution authorizes the united states and its allies 
to use force to drive iraq from kuwait unless saddam withdraws his 
troops by jan 15 iraq invaded the emirate on aug 2 in a dispute 
over oil land and money 
in a nationally televised speech bush said he was willing to 
send baker to baghdad to negotiate iraqs unconditional withdrawal 
from kuwait 
if iraq agrees baker would travel to baghdad between dec 15 
and jan 15 bush said iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz would 
be welcome in washington for talks the week of dec 10 he said 
bush said he was going the extra mile for peace 
the move does not mean however the united states is waivering 
in its demand for a total iraqi withdrawal restoration of the 
kuwaiti government and release of all western hostages from iraq 
and kuwait bush said 
the surprise diplomatic olive branch however was combined with 
a stern new warning for saddam 
i promise you there will not be any murky ending i will never 
agree to a halfway effort bush said i dont think there has 
ever been a question that the united states is going to blink 
iraqs leadership was taken by surprise by bushs announcement 
and immediately went into a meeting for consultations diplomats 
said in baghdad there were no immediate details on who attended 
the meeting 
but there was reaction to the proposed baker visit from abdul 
razzack al hashimi iraqs ambassador to france who spoke in an 
interview in paris with the british broadcasting corp 
this is a very important step really toward peace and we 
hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for 
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war i consider it 
very good news he said 
lets wait and see and lets be optimistic and see what mr 
baker has in mind and not to speculate about such an important 
event 
at the united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
welcomed bushs call for diplomatic contact with iraq 
i am persuaded that if these contacts take place they will be 
really really leading to a peaceful solution perez de cuellar 
told reporters 
and in dhahran saudi arabia saudi arabian and exiled kuwaiti 
officials applauded bushs lastditch effort 
bushs diplomatic move came amid growing criticism on capitol 
hill for the bush administrations gulf policy 
during the week a series of witnesses including two former 
joint chiefs of staff have underscored doubts among democratic 
senators about going to war with iraq 
on friday retired lt gen william e odom who headed the 
national security agency during the reagan administration said 
washington should continue its present defensive posture rather 
than wage war with iraq 
he said that attacking iraqi forces in kuwait or iraq itself 
could mean a long us military presence in the persian gulf 
region 
about 240000 us troops are deployed in saudi arabia as part 
of the 340000strong multinational force arrayed against iraq 
bush has promised to add 200000 more to the largest deployment 
abroad since the vietnam war 
the multinational force faces 430000 iraqi troops in southern 
iraq and kuwait 
in an another apparent conciliatory move friday a group of 
iraqis took fruit vegetables and a case of cigarettes to the 
besieged american embassy in kuwait bush said the americans were 
also told by the iraqis who were not identified to make a list of 
medical supplies they needed he said 
this could be a positive sign bush said 
shortly after the invasion saddam ordered all missions closed 
in kuwait which iraq considers its 19th province the embassies 
that refused to shut were surrounded by troops and utilities were 
cut 
only the us and british embassies still remain open but with 
muchreduced staffs at the us embassy the eight remaining 
personnel have been surviving on canned tuna and rice bush said

theyve been seeing the same posters and hearing 
the same speeches but the campaign for sundays allgerman 
elections strikes different chords among voters east and west 
for former west germans the candidates are familiar the vote 
itself routine and the major issue is just how severe the expected 
tax increases to finance unity will be 
in what used to be east germany the plethora of parties ranging 
from the rightwing republicans to the leftist greens is still a 
novelty for voters who lived in a oneparty communist state 
eastern germans need help in rebuilding their shattered economy 
and are looking for the best leaders to do it 
the elections are important for the future development of east 
germany said bodo hahnet director of a job retraining program 
in potsdam 
a voice from former west germany puts it differently 
these elections arent so important they wont change 
anything said helmut hilbig a doctor from the ruhr industrial 
area city of moenchengladbach 
just over a year ago hahnet and hilbig lived in separate worlds 
in separate countries 
now they are part of a pool of 60 million german voters to go to 
the polls sunday 12 million in the five new states in eastern 
germany and 48 million from former west germany 
they will choose a 656member parliament and a new chancellor in 
the first free elections in a united germany since 1932 
helmut kohl the incumbent chancellor who guided the two german 
states to unity after the berlin wall collapsed on nov 9 1989 is 
the clear favorite 
his campaign workers have slathered the country with large 
portraits of the beefy prosperouslooking leader that simply 
proclaims chancellor for germany 
that image is appealing in eastern germany where kohl is more 
popular than among his countrymen in the west who are sometimes 
embarrassed by the chancellors folksy ways 
a recent poll in the weekly der spiegel magazine showed that 20 
percent of eastern germans thought kohl was the greatest postwar 
chancellor against 10 percent of western germans 
overall kohls reception at campaign rallies in eastern germany 
has been warmer than in the west 
supporters of oskar lafontaine kohls social democratic rival 
have also been busy bringing the image of the youthful challenger 
to voters 
lafontaine 47 stands among a group of young people peering 
off into the distance under the slogan the new way in his main 
poster 
many eastern germans just seem to want a way that works 
for hilbig the western german kohl and lafontaine are old 
faces on a familiar political scene but even though he doesnt 
expect much to change as a result of the election he expects 
unification to have a serious impact on his income 
were going to end up paying like crazy he said a 
reference to expected tax increases needed to bring the backward 
east up to the standards of the west 
talks with other western germans at the brandenburg gate in 
berlin revealed similar concerns about the countrys finances 
kohl portraying himself as the kind of solid hardworking 
leader who can bring western prosperity to the east says no new 
taxes will be needed 
nonsense argues lafontaine who has pounded away with charges 
of hypocrisy he says the christian democrats have deceived voters 
by underestimating the real costs of unity 
nobody is telling the truth growled hahnet the eastern 
german the christian democrats dont really say what is 
happening 
politicians from the broad palette of opposition parties have a 
lot to say but many are so small their voices get lost despite 
access for all parties to television 
the free democrats are counting on foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher to pull in votes in his native eastern 
germany where he is extremely popular 
other parties push platforms rather than people with the greens 
for ecology and the rightwing republicans for restricting asylum 
rules 
although the messages differ for the first time in 58 years 
germans will choose freely their leaders in a safe and secure 
democracy

a us thrift regulator testified friday that 
sen dennis deconcini broke the bounds of propriety but four 
other senators did not when they intervened on behalf of savings 
and loan owner charles h keating jr 
regulator michael patriarca addressing the senate ethics 
committee drew the line between the behavior of deconcini dariz 
and four colleagues john mccain rariz donald w riegle jr 
dmich john glenn dohio and alan cranston dcalif 
patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to 
influence to change the outcome of an examination that was 
highly critical of keatings lincoln savings and loan 
my personal view is senator deconcini did that he said 
its not clear to me that any of the others did 
the regulator was referring to the senators conduct at an april 
9 1987 meeting with four san franciscobased regulators 
including patriarca who were responsible for the lincoln 
investigation 
patriarca also said he would fault the senators generally 
because they appeared to have made up their minds in advance 
that keating was right and the regulators were wrong in finding 
serious problems at lincoln 
patriarcas two days of testimony backed the assertion of his 
exboss former federal home loan bank board chairman edwin j 
gray that deconcini took the lead in trying to negotiate a deal on 
keatings behalf 
deconcini denied that he sought a waiver for lincoln of a rule 
prohibiting risky investments in return for the thrift 
establishing a home mortgage loan program 
patriarca was questioned by sen warren rudman rnh one of 
six ethics committee members who will judge whether the five 
senators improperly intervened for keating 
keating and associates donated 13 million to the campaigns and 
political causes of the five senators the committee has held nine 
days of hearings in an effort to determine whether the money 
influenced the intervention 
the hearing adjourned until monday after a former member of the 
federal home loan bank board testified he received calls from 
cranston and deconcini in april 1989 immediately before the 
government takeover of lincoln 
in those calls said roger martin both senators urged the board 
to approve a sale of lincoln rather than its seizure the requests 
were rejected 
all the senators except riegle met on keatings behalf with gray 
on april 2 1987 in deconcinis office when the chief regulator 
said he lacked details of the lincoln investigation the four san 
franciscobased regulators including patriarca were summoned to 
the april 9 meeting that also was in deconcinis office and this 
time riegle joined the group 
rudman asked patriarca whether he thought deconcini was out of 
line in the april 9 meeting when he sought the waiver for 
lincoln 
yes i did senator the regulator responded he said that 
the proper way to challenge the regulation was through the courts 
and lincoln had a retainer with every significant law firm in the 
country to do so 
lincoln in fact did shortly before the meetings with 
regulators file a court suit challenging the rule the suit was 
not successful 
patriarca said mccain showed the least prejudice toward 
regulators at the april 9 meeting deconcini and perhaps sen 
glenn seemed to have their minds made up pretty substantially and 
riegle was in the middle 
another member of the committee sen jesse helms rnc asked 
if the senators were hostile at the meeting 
i think it was hostile patriarca said we were being 
dressed down 
helms then asked whether the senators expressed surprise or 
shock after the regulators informed them that serious problems 
and possible criminality were found at lincoln of irvine calif 
we didnt seem to be getting through to the senators the 
regulator said they did not seem to appreciate the seriousness 
of the situation that we were trying to convey to them 
on thursday patriarca said the senators became less aggressive 
when regulators said they would make criminal referrals to the 
justice department

iben browning gets all the attention 
but he isnt the only one with notions about when a big earthquake 
will shake the midwest 
ted the rooster says it wont happen next week raymond coles 
radio says it might 
brownings theory that a quake is likely along the new madrid 
fault zone early next week has sent emotional shock waves from 
illinois to arkansas 
the uproar also brought new popularity to backyard prophets who 
base their predictions on such things as lost dogs radio waves and 
a prognosticating rooster 
the attempts to predict an earthquake have one thing in common 
scientists say they are worthless 
earthquakes are unpredictable said jill stevens 
spokeswoman for the center for earthquake research and information 
at memphis tenn state university they are one of the most 
mysterious natural events we have to deal with 
scientists have searched unsuccessfully for decades for reliable 
signs that a temblor is due the public is eager to join the hunt 
ms stevens said 
every year we hear from people with pet theories about 
earthquakes ms stevens said 
one woman in ohio says she has a television set that gets 
different patterns of snow before an earthquake she said 
theres a woman in memphis who monitors the classified ads to see 
if the number of lost pets is up because she thinks that means a 
quake is coming 
she said the number of people calling the center to offer or 
seek advice has skyrocketed since browning a selfproclaimed 
climatologist from new mexico projected of a 5050 chance for a 
midwest quake around dec 3 
browning 72 bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the 
sun and moon which he says will be particularly strong during the 
period 
ted the rooster is getting a lot of calls too 
the rooster locally famous for forecasting weather and the 
outcome of presidential elections says there will be no 
earthquake according to his owner dick frymire of irvington ky 
ive had hundreds of calls about it from all over the united 
states frymire said people are scared to death 
raymond cole of cape girardeau mo makes his quake predictions 
by charting slight changes in the location of am signals on his 
radio dial he believes the big one is coming soon 
because of interest stirred by browning cole makes his 
forecasts available free 24 hours a day on a special phone line 
connected to an answering machine at his home 
that answering machine goes constantly as fast as it can 
rewind cole said ive worn out four tapes in two months 
ms stevens said quake quackery is fueled by scientists 
inability to predict earthquakes combined with the accepted theory 
that a damaging quake will someday occur along the new madrid 
the fault which stretches from new madrid mo to marked tree 
ark produces numerous quakes a year including huge temblors in 
1811 and 1812 
the best scientists can do is chart probabilities based on 
statistical analysis of seismic activity along the fault since 
1811 she said and even those methods are uncertain 
a widely quoted study done at the memphis center puts the 
probability of an earthquake of magnitude 63 or greater on the 
richter scale within the next 15 years at between 40 percent and 63 
percent 
an independent study released this year by two scientists who 
work with the us geological survey put the risk lower setting a 
13 percent probability of a new madrid quake of 60 or greater 
within the next 10 years 
both are valid scientific studies using different methods 
ms stevens said 
still people along the fault are listening to the predictions 
among them is austin peay state university geology professor 
dms bhatia who is setting up camp along the fault with 25 
students to prove browning wrong 
were going to jump up and down on the fault and show theres 
no reason for all this panic said bhatia

need some oxtail meat a bottle of chivas 
regal or how about hair spray south korea is a good place to get 
them courtesy of uncle sam 
a report by the general accounting office has found widespread 
black marketing of goods sold to us military personnel and their 
dependents at dutyfree stores and commissaries in south korea 
a ration control system set up to prevent the goods from being 
resold on the black market has failed according to the report by 
the congressional watchdog agency the system it said costs 12 
million annually 
investigators said they could not put a dollar figure on the 
amount of goods diverted to the black market but said sales rates 
for many items could not be accounted for simply by the estimated 
70000 people authorized to buy them 
for example during fiscal year 1989 army and air force 
commissaries in south korea received about 12 million pounds of 
oxtail meat for sale that means about 16 pounds for every woman 
man and child authorized to buy commissary items 
and while oxtail meat is not a staple in americans diet its a 
popular korean dish used especially in soup 
chivas regal scotch especially 12yearold bottles is also a 
popular item in south korea the report found 
the investigators compared chivas sales among us military 
personnel in europe and south korea while the number of us 
military personnel in south korea was only 15 percent that in 
europe commissaries and stores sold more than six times as many 
bottles 
aqua net hair spray is also popular 33 cans per authorized 
females 
some of the black market sales are conducted by service 
personnel others by south korean employees at us stores and 
commissaries most of the items are paid for and then sold at two 
or three times the price on the black market 
highticket items such as refrigerators and video recorders 
diverted to the black market are often obtained with falsified 
ration cards the report said 
yet despite the widespread problem only 66 military personnel 
were courtmartialed for black market abuses in 1988 and an 
unknown number of others received less serious penalties the 
report said 
it recommended that the department of defense improve the ration 
control system and encourage the south korean government to crack 
down on black marketeers

the parliaments of the three baltic 
republics prepared to hold their first joint session saturday to 
show a unified front against recent threats from the soviet 
government 
in an interview lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said 
the baltics want their unity of position to be seen not only in 
the form of declarations and documents but in the meeting of 
lawmakers 
the parliaments of lithuania latvia and estonia were to meet in 
vilnius to discuss tough statements by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and defense minister dmitry yazov concerning the baltics 
independence drives 
on friday talks were held in moscow between soviet and 
lithuanian representatives on resolving an impasse that began march 
11 when the parliament of the baltic republic declared 
independence 
the talks however were unsuccessful deputy lithuanian prime 
minister romualdus ozolas told the baltic news service 
our position is based on international law and the position 
of the soviet side is based on soviet laws and our positions are 
so different that we could not reach a common formula he said 
ozolas and soviet deputy premier vitaly doguzhiyev were unable 
to set an agenda for more detailed talks but they did agree to 
meet next week according to the lithuanian news agency elta 
accepting an invitation from landsbergis the 220 members of the 
lithuanian parliament were to meet with about 200 latvian and 100 
estonian legislators in the lithuanian capital 
leaders of all three republics say they will refuse to sign 
gorbachevs proposed union treaty to unite the 15 soviet republics 
and grant broad economic and national security authority to the 
gorbachev government 
boris yeltsin the president of the russian federation the 
largest soviet republic also refuses to sign the union treaty 
until the republics can assert political autonomy and control over 
their economic affairs 
one lithuanian official said the union treaty was doomed 
algirdas brazauskas a deputy prime minister of the republic who 
also heads the branch of the lithuanian communist party that split 
with the soviet communist party nearly a year ago said i think 
that the union treaty will not succeed because it is too 
conservative it preserves the current political structure of the 
soviet union and gives too little to the republics 
lithuania must be independent or at least be a member of the 
soviet union by its own choice thats a minimum brazauskas 
said 
mindful of the economic blockade gorbachev slapped on lithuania 
for its independence drive last summer leaders of latvia and 
estonia have been more cautious the estonian parliament at first 
balked at taking part in the joint legislative session the 
estonian news agency eta reported 
but the republics parliament voted friday to send its senior 
leaders committee chairmen and other lawmakers to the meeting eta 
reported 
soviet leaders have taken a tough stand against secessionist 
republics a week ago gorbachev revived his demand that republics 
wishing to secede must first hold referendums 
and yazov his defense minister warned that soviet soldiers 
would fire on demonstrators who attack defense installations 
gorbachev and yazov also warned civilian authorities not to deny 
social benefits to soviet soldiers 
the warning appeared in part a response to an incident in 
vilnius in midnovember in which soviet soldiers fired over the 
heads of peaceful demonstrators said rita dapkus a lithuanian 
parliament spokeswoman 
tensions also seemed to be rising over the redeployment in 
lithuania of soviet army units withdrawing from eastern europe 
dapkus said 
moscow has to understand it cannot just bring in people and 
demand housing and not ask or even inform us dapkus said 
lithuania faces a severe housing shortage for its own citizens 
many lithuanians fear a military crackdown although landsbergis 
said such action would damage gorbachevs worldwide prestige as he 
seeks food and other aid for moscow and hardpressed soviet cities 
the use of open military force is less of a threat because mr 
gorbachev is still under the pressure of the international 
situation landsbergis said

a record 28000 soviet jews arrived in israel 
in november up 8000 from the previous high a senior israeli 
immigration official said friday 
the november influx brought to 150000 the number of soviet 
jewish immigrants this year immigration officials have said that 
more than 1 million soviet jews could arrive by the end of 1992 
simcha dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
which brings immigrants to israel said 12 million soviet jews 
have won approval to leave the soviet union 
there are no direct flights between moscow and tel aviv but 
dinitz said that even the more cumbersome routes via warsaw 
budapest and bucharest could handle 50000 immigrants a month 
the immigration is causing a strain in unemployment housing and 
government finances in israel 
in the 1991 state budget approved by the government this week 
israel has set aside 65 billion for immigrant absorption 
dinitz estimated it would cost about 35 billion to absorb 1 
million soviet immigrants and said israel and the world jewish 
community could not carry the burden alone 
israel will have to turn to other countries and foreign 
sources for assistance dinitiz told industrialists in tel aviv 
on friday 
he said a record 30000 immigrants from around the world arrived 
in november including 28000 from the soviet union the previous 
high was in october when 21000 immigrants came including 20000 
soviet jews 
the total number of immigrants from around the world has reached 
164500 so far this year

washington president bush on friday named outgoing florida 
gov bob martinez to head the nations war on drugs selecting a 
politician who stressed law enforcement in fighting his own states 
skyrocketing drug crimes 
in announcing his choice for director of the office of national 
drug control policy bush said he was giving martinez a 
battlefield promotion for a leader who has earned his stripes on 
the front lines of the drug war 
governor martinez can and will hit the ground running bush 
added 
in his four years as governor martinezs highprofile antidrug 
policies emphasized tough penalties law enforcement and prison 
construction over treatment and prevention meanwhile drug crimes 
escalated significantly during his tenure 
but bush praised him as an effective leader in the war on drugs 
hes been contributing to our national drug control strategy 
for over two years bush said 
he stiffened the florida code and then added the prison space 
to enforce it as a governor who signed more than 130 death 
warrants he understands tough choices bush said 
if confirmed by the senate martinez will replace william 
bennett the outspoken conservative who has served as drug czar 
for 19 months and now is bushs choice to head the republican 
national committee 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee said he was disappointed that bush selected 
martinez but promised to hold confirmation hearings shortly after 
congress convenes in january 
mr martinez lacks the background and record to suggest that 
he is wellsuited for this task biden said he said he looks 
forward to a debate with martinez on administration policies and 
whether he is willing to try new approaches 
martinez is expected to bring a more businesslike approach to 
the job than bennett who was noted for his feisty bullypulpit 
rhetoric in bringing national focus on the drug crisis 
martinez told reporters he will continue to emphasize tough 
enforcement measures the balance is always being debated 
between enforcement and treatment and prevention dollars he said 
bushs choice ofmartinez who lost his reelection bid this 
month to democratic former sen lawton chiles prompted criticism 
from some quarters that the president was more interested in giving 
his friend a job than choosing the best qualified person 
bush and his wife barbara made several campaign appearances for 
martinez in the tightly contested race and bushs floridaresident 
son jeb bush served as the governors campaign chairman 
martinez has a great resume when it comes to politics said 
rep charles rangel democratic chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics 
what experience does he have that qualified him directly and 
specifically for the post of national drug policy coordinator 
the drug policy foundation a nonprofit organization alleged 
that bush showed he would rather reward his political buddies 
than solve the drug abuse problem in the united states 
after four years of martinez leadership florida is awash 
with drugs crime corruption and violence said the 
organizations president arnold trebach 
martinez a former mayor of tampa became governor in 1987 as 
floridas involvement with drug trafficking was escalating and the 
crack cocaine epidemic became rampant 
the number of people imprisoned for drug crimes doubled during 
martinez tenure to 16169 in the 198990 fiscal year according 
to state department of correction figures 
overall drug crimes jumped from close to 57000 in 1986 to 
85525 in 1989 the first six months of 1990 had 37474 drug crimes 
compared to 32962 in the first six months of 1989 
martinez advocated drug testing for government employees and 
took a test himself to show that he was drug free 
he pushed through the legislature laws mandating the death 
penalty for drug kingpins in certain cases and requiring tougher 
penalties for drug dealers who traffic near schools 
he is chairman of the national governors association task force 
on substance abuse and drug trafficking he visited bolivia and 
colombia in 1988 with the national guard on a drug factfinding 
mission 
while democrats criticized martinez for embarking on a huge 
prison building program the governor has noted that spending on 
substance abuse treatment rose from 43 million in 198586 to 
almost 92 million 
in a report released earlier this month bennetts office listed 
florida seventh in the nation on spending per capita for drug 
treatment 
during the gubernatorial campaign chiles called martinezs 
prison construction program a primitive approach to the drug 
problem 
there are thousands of people on waiting lists for drug 
treatment and the need far outstrips any programs currently in 
place chiles said 
chiles has since said he supports martinez as drug czar

george bush got the body bag question at his 
news conference friday how many kids would you be willing to have 
die in the persian gulf mr president 
body bags a fact of war a vietnam residue the black plastic 
containers into which a corpse is zippered at the battlefield for 
transfer into a reusable metal case in the first step toward burial 
at home 
along with the soft drinks along with the gas masks the 
rations the videos the paperbacks the sunglasses and the 
ammunition that america is shipping to its troops in the desert 
body bags are being loaded aboard the transports 
we all know bushs questioner said how important your 
children are to you do you feel that this issue is important 
enough to you that you could conceive of giving up one of their 
lives for it 
it was the betweentheeyes question that any president must 
dread when he is about to put lives at risk whatever the cause 
the question confronts the country now that the un at bushs 
request has set a deadline for saddam hussein to pull out of 
kuwait 
bush sighed he grasped the lectern he fidgeted he gestured 
with his glasses he talked slowly he spent a few minutes with 
this question 
he said people have asked before people say to me how many 
lives how many lives can you expend 
its only the president that should be asked to make the 
decision is it worth it how many lives is it worth is it worth 
it to commit one life put one life in harms way to achieve these 
objectives 
somberly he continued in a rambling discourse 
he knows the horror of war he has been in war 
every life is precious if there is a war he has ordered 
maximum firepower to be applied to protect the lives of americans 
in combat 
saddam hussein can avoid war by complying with un demands 
but is it worth the loss of life 
its a tough question the president said but these are 
worldwide principles of moral importance 
how many lives 
experts make their gulf estimates from past wars and the 
situation on the ground the estimates vary widely 
on the record the pentagon will not say how many american lives 
it anticipates would be expended to achieve us objectives in a 
war with iraq at a news briefing thursday pentagon spokesman pete 
williams repeatedly refused to provide a projection i would 
dispute anyones ability now to accurately predict casualties 
without knowing what the scenario is 
the new york times citing pentagon sources reported on tuesday 
that several thousand american deaths would be likely over 
several weeks of an allout war retired gen george crist on cbs 
news said about 1000 us soldiers would be killed on the first 
day 
retired col trevor dupuy told cbs that casualties would range 
between 6000 and 16000 over the first 10 days of war but did not 
differentiate between dead and injured 
retired adm gene larocque director of the center for defense 
information and an outspoken opponent of bushs deployment has 
told congress there would be 10000 us deaths in a sixmonth war 
with iraq 
in vietnam 47244 americans were killed in action 10446 were 
killed in accidents or by disease 153329 were hospitalized with 
wounds 150375 received wounds that did not require 
hospitalization 
said bush i will do my level best to bring those kids home 
without one single shot fired in anger

saudi arabian and kuwaiti officials on friday 
welcomed president bushs offer to meet with iraqi leaders but 
stressed they are ready for war 
officials in britain jordan and italy also indicated support 
for talks 
bush offered to meet in washington with iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz and also send secretary of state james a baker iii to 
the iraqi capital of baghdad in advance of the jan 15 deadline set 
by the un security council for iraq to withdraw from kuwait

kicked out of kuwait said mohamed khayat an official with the 
saudi arabian ministry of information

to get acquainted with the causes of the crisis kassem said 
in london the foreign office issued a statement saying it

undated in another sign of a weakening economy the number of 
people on welfare rose in all but one state in the past year 
an associated press survey of welfare rolls in all 50 states 
found that only wisconsin had bucked the trend partly because it 
enacted pioneering programs to get people off welfare 
although a troubled economy was the villain in many states it 
was not the sole reason or even the most important one in 
others 
officials in some states attributed the increase to changes in 
immigration law or to programs that help poor people apply for 
welfare some mentioned changes in federal medicaid requirements 
that have brought more people into the welfare system

on judgment day after the angel gabriel has 
sounded his horn and the seas are merrily aboil some pbs viewers 
probably will tune in the macneillehrer newshour for a sober 
reasoned indepth report 
and there of course will be coanchors jim lehrer and robert 
macneil calmly popping questions at bemusedlooking matthew mark 
and in washington luke and john 
yes the canadian macneil will say with characteristic 
aplomb but what exactly does this mean in terms of say the 
afterlife 
well maybe not 
but tonights 90minute pbs special marking the 15th anniversary 
of the macneillehrer newshour helps explain how and why the 
two men became the longestlived news team on television winning 
five peabody awards four emmys and dozens of other awards along 
the way 
it also reveals human sides of two very smart funny creative 
fellows 
lehrer we learn is the author of five novels and several 
plays macneil the author of four nonfiction books said hes 
just finished the rough draft of his first novel just to keep up 
with him is something macneil said 
we also learn that the two men despite working in a business 
known for oversized egos and bitter internecine rivalries are each 
others best friend 
we are in many ways each others closest friend said 
macneil it is wonderful to have somebody you can tell most 
everything and be completely candid with we are business partners 
and friends macneil also noted that each has named the other as 
guardian of his children 
their nightly news show began here oct 20 1975 as a local 
program called the robert macneil report it supplemented 
commercial tv news by covering a single story each night in depth 
with lehrer as washington correspondent 
by 1976 the show was offered to all pbs stations and became 
the macneillehrer report with lehrer as coanchor in 1983 
it became the only hourlong national nightly newscast 
when we expanded to the hour it changed from being a 
supplement to an alternative lehrer said now we take the 
position that if youre looking for a place to go every 24 hours 
and find out whats happened and get some indepth treatment were 
the place he said 
macneil and lehrer got to that place from vastly disparate 
backgrounds 
macneil nicknamed robin a former reuters rewrite man went 
to work for the bbc in 1967 after seven years as a nbc 
correspondent and anchor he joined the nowdefunct national public 
affairs center for television in 1971 
lehrer a longtime dallas newspaperman and former city editor of 
the dallas times herald got into public television as onair host 
and editor of dallas public tv station keras nightly news 
lehrer a public affairs coordinator for pbs first met macneil 
in atlanta in 1972 neither man recalls the particulars of that 
meeting i think i called him bob lehrer admits 
the man who finally got them together on the air was richard 
nixon macneil and lehrers emmywinning coverage of the senate 
watergate hearings in 1973 was their first professional 
collaboration 
when that stint ended they agreed that there was an audience 
for indepth television news on pbs 
it was clear that the american people were depending on 
television more and more for news and public affairs on which to 
base their votes and their opinions lehrer said 
if they were going to depend on television for that it was 
incumbent on those of us who worked in public television to give 
them that he said 
lehrer said there are plans to refine their 15yearold nightly 
news show including a new fixture called conversations a 
12minute interview segment with a person in the news 
would those refinements include showing more of macneil and 
lehrer than just the head and shoulders 
i dont think were going to go that far lehrer allowed 
we think the public has already seen the best we have to offer 
 
elsewhere in television

perry farrell doesnt want his lyrics to be 
overanalyzed hes adamant about it in fact if the hyperkinetic 
singer of janes addiction were to have a motto it would be 
thats for me to know and you to find out 
farrells evasiveness about the exact subject matter of his 
material can be exasperating but whether he is that way because he 
is trying to maintain artistic integrity or is just trying to be 
enigmatic is a mystery 
their own conclusions without his help so he reduced the bands 
seeming complexity to basic terms 
i write down what gets me off he said in a telephone 
interview theres very little rational thought i dont want to 
come off sounding like a fool or a simpleton but i dont think 
that hard on purpose 
i simply just do it i jot it down and then if its good its 
good and if its not i try and fix it most of it is 
subconscious but i dont want you to think i dont think maybe 
im more impulsive than i am intellectual 
have caused controversy since the start of their career 
the cover art on the 1988 lp nothings shocking features two 
nude lifesize sculptures joined at the waist of singer perry 
farrells girlfriend casey a banal look is painted on their faces 
and their heads are aflame farrell created the sculpture 
eight of the nations major record distribution chains refused 
to carry the album later that year all but two agreed to 
distribute the record 
now janes addictions second release ritual de lo 
habitual has caused a similar furor the cover art this time 
depicts a fetish made up of sculptures of farrell casey and their 
late friend xiola all nude lying on a bed surrounded by various 
objects including tarot cards burning candles and photographs 
again distributors said they would not put out the album as it 
was s farrell created an alternative a plain white cover with a 
lengthy dissertation on freedom of speech some record stores carry 
the original some carry the whitecovered version 
but janes addiction is not explicit for the sake of being so 
look beyond the covers and see that farrells lyrics are brutally 
honest accounts of drugaddicted friends bigotry and the general 
deterioration of society set in a base of neopsychedelic guitar 
farrells reasons for his album covers are simple he likes 
nudity its just something that i enjoy looking at basically i 
dont think its very controversial 
ritual is a bit more lowkey musically than its predecessor 
but its subjects are as biting as ever the erotic three days 
is farrells discourse on the three natures of sexuality human 
beings are capable of bisexuality homosexuality and 
heterosexuality 
farrell is always looking to expand his understanding of the 
human condition he praises women in classic girl and 
empathizes the pain an interracial couple can face in no ones 
leaving 
in the liner notes on the whitecovered ritual he even 
writes i used to wish sometimes that igiving of love is fearless 
if i had been born female he said i would feel a little 
bit like i was starting from somewhat of a disadvantage although 
on the other side of the coin theres no one more powerful than a 
woman a beautiful woman can just rip a mans heart out 
farrell has a striking eye for detail and specifics in his 
lyrics in of course he tells of his big brother holding onto 
his hands and making me slap my own face of the incident he 
sings he was trying to teach me something 
most of the songs that are general are simply a style of 
writing he said its a great style of writing but its very 
hard for me to find generalities to write about 
farrell along with guitarist david navarro bassist eric a and 
drummer stephen perkins released their first selftitled album in 
1987 on the independent xxx label 
janes addiction doesnt look back on its past work and try to 
better it instead each album even each song is completely unto 
itself 
i dont go and interpret that it a song needs more of this 
or that farrell said every songs an original thing i dont 
try to change things up for changes sake because i think that 
might defeat the purpose of the song

the philippines is becoming a budget 
hollywood attracting foreign filmmakers despite deteriorating 
security and more than its share of natural disasters 
james glickenhaus producer director and writer of mcbain 
said varied locations a professional local work crew and an 
englishspeaking population also make filming here easier 
all in all it was an extremely attractive place for us to 
shoot glickenhaus 40 said i would recommend it to other 
film makers its a great place to shoot 
mcbain scheduled for completion this month is the latest 
in a series of foreign movies filmed here others include 
apocalypse now platoon born on the fourth of july 
the year of living dangerously and chuck norris delta 
force series 
the cheap cost of production in the philippines could become an 
even more attractive lure for leading moviemakers particularly 
because some of the biggest hollywood film studios are now 
foreignowned 
just last week for example mca inc parent of universal 
studios was purchased by matsushita a leading japanese 
electronics conglomerate the japanese have promised to give mca 
creative independence but are expected to look for economical ways 
to control production expenses 
mcbain stars christopher walken who won an academy award in 
1973 for the deer hunter and venezuelan actress maria conchita 
alonzo whose credits include moscow on the hudson with robin 
williams and running man with arnold schwarzenegger 
glickenhaus downplayed apprehensions about the security 
situation in the country which faces a 21yearold communist 
rebellion and the continuing threat from military extremists who 
have launched seven armed uprisings in the past five years 
if you read the papers in new york youd think it is unsafe 
and youre going to be shot and youre gonna be blown up 
glickenhaus said obviously when youre here i dont think i 
dont feel that im going to be shot or blown up 
as a mutiny led by a renegade army colonel erupted in th southern 
philippines 500 miles south of here 
the rebellion fizzled in three days 
a series of at least 40 bombing attacks by rightist and leftist 
extremists have occurred in the manila area since august 
early in november typhoon mike swept the central philippines 
killing about 470 people 
walken said foreign members of the film were unaffected by these 
incidents since they took place in areas far away from where they 
were filming 
uneventful here except for the typhoon walken said 
glickenhaus said he used several provinces just on the outskirts 
of manila to shoot scenes that depict parts of three countries 
was turned into the colombian presidential palace a forest in 
nearby cavite province depicted a vietnamese prison camp 
just west of manila the film crew built a jamaican white sand 
beach resort in the coast of zambales province 
most of whom worked in hollywood films shot here 
the high cost of production back home especially for 
independent american film producers working on a tight budget 
makes shooting in the philippines attractive 
glickenhaus said mcbain if shot in the united states would 
have cost at least double its 17 million budget 
heof extras were storming the colombian presidential palace that 
scene would have cost 2 million if shot in hollywood 
tom gray the films publicist said the widespread use of 
english one of the two official languages gives the philippines 
an advantage over other southeast asian countries 
he said it is easy to give directions to filipino actors and 
crew members because they understand english 
people still like making movies here glickenhaus said 
thats a good thing

when mary hoffman joined the army during world 
war ii she was a serious young woman who thought shed already 
missed her chance for a full life but the womens auxiliary army 
corps changed everything 
i thought i was going to be a spinster she recalled 47 
years later instead i married my first bedside patient 
mrs hoffman is one of the 350000 women who served in world war 
ii she is also the largest single donor to the foundation thats 
trying to build a memorial to americas women veterans mrs 
hoffman has contributed more than 60000 to the project all from 
disability payments she received after breast cancer forced her to 
leave the service in 1945 
mrs hoffman now an 83yearold widow says women veterans need 
their own memorial 
male war veterans have their monuments and memorials but we 
are the last group to unite she said from her home in 
hyattsville md i do feel its so well worth it 
mrs hoffman spent two years in the wac as an occupational 
therapist stationed at woodrow wilson hospital in staunton va 
her job was to go from bedside to bedside helping injured soldiers 
make wallets or belts or teaching them to type or knit 
i didnt have a sense of humor when i first went into the 
military she remembered i was a little oldfashioned wearing 
my hair up but the army made me over believe me 
mrs hoffmans small story is one of almost 50000 collected so 
far for a databank that will be part of the memorial said retired 
us air force brig gen wilma vaught president of the women in 
the military service of america foundation 
vaught is delighted with mrs hoffmans generosity but she 
needs a total of 25 million for the memorial and at the moment 
shes about 225 million short 
there are over 12 million living women veterans and 400000 
women on active duty and in the guard and reserve who are 
potential donors vaught said in a recent interview at the 
foundations arlington va offices 
part of vaughts problem is finding those women as well as the 
descendants of the thousands of american women who served in every 
war since the revolution as nurses scouts suppliers soldiers 
and saboteurs 
privacy laws prevent vaught from getting the addresses of 
veterans or activeduty military women from the government she has 
been relying on some 450 volunteers to find them 
the women in military service memorial also suffered a 
fundraising setback this year the foundation tried to raffle a 1 
million house in suburban centreville va only to see ticket 
sales fall far below target 
we saw this as a mechanism that in a really short period of 
time we could raise a lot of money vaught said 
but the kickoff coincided with the drug trial of dc mayor 
marion barry and media attention was nominal she said 
when the date for the drawing approached in early november the 
foundation had sold only about 24000 of the one million raffle 
tickets printed vaught was forced to postpone the drawing until 
feb 23 
theres been progress in other areas the site has been chosen 
the ceremonial entrance gate to arlington national cemetery the 
foundation conducted a design competition last year and selected a 
concept by marion g weiss and michael manfredi partners in a new 
york architecture firm 
their design sets 10 39foot glass spires into the top of the 
semicircular gate known as the hemicycle inside the entrance 
walls will be a museum portraying the history of women in the us 
military a 225seat auditorium and the databank 
at night the spires will be gently lit giving the effect of 
candles against the virginia hillside 
vaught is very conscious that time is essential under the law 
authorizing the memorial vaught has until november 1991 to raise 
the 25 million 
that date may be a little optimistic she said adding that 
she is prepared to go back to congress to ask for more time 
meanwhile as she travels the country meeting women veterans and 
promoting the memorial she is most impressed by the world war i 
veterans 
we still have a few world war i women left who can make it to 
the dedication she said if were going to do something to say 
thankyou to them its got to be now

federal regulators are exploring ways to 
streamline the process for getting stocks to the buyer and payment 
to the seller including a reform to replace paper stock 
certificates with computerized listings 
but investors who feel more comfortable holding on to those 
intricately engraved diplomasized pieces of paper may not have to 
swap them for a line on a blinking computer screen 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden 
says he supports the goal of cutting the completion time of stock 
trades from five days to three but it is my strong desire to 
preserve investors rights to choose between a tangible stock 
certificate and an electronic record 
at a roundtable discussion last week with industry leaders 
breeden and other sec officials heard several alternatives for 
accelerating the process of clearance and settlement 
simply put clearance and settlement is the system for clearing 
the transfer of securities going in one direction and money moving 
in the other in an orderly way to settle a transaction 
although it typically operates unseen and unnoticed by the 
average investor the clearance and settlement system is the 
essential infrastructure that supports the operation of the more 
visible elements of our capital markets breeden said 
but he also said that while the us clearance and settlement 
system processes 469 billion in securities transactions each day 
it still takes five business days to settle a transaction here 
while some foreign markets do it in three days or less 
anyone whos ever had to wait for their bank to clear an 
outofstate check knows the problems delay can cause 
stock transactions are complicated by the physical transfer of a 
check or cash to the seller and the paper stock certificates to the 
buyer multiply that by millions of shares worth billions of 
dollars on a busy trading day and the risk of delayed clearance and 
settlement becomes apparent 
three clearinghouses and three depositories handle the money and 
stock transfers for all of the nations seven stock exchanges 
during the 1987 stock market crash the system was overwhelmed 
tying up large amounts of cash that could have kept the trading 
process more fluid 
experts worry that in a market emergency the value of 
securities could rise or fall before trades are completed causing 
missed opportunities and losses on a massive scale and possibly 
leading if the problems are serious enough to defaults and a 
chain reaction collapse in the increasingly interdependent markets 
recent reform legislation passed by congress and signed by the 
president calls for the sec and other federal regulators to work 
out ways of improving clearance and settlement systems for stock 
bonds futures contracts and options which are now handled 
separately 
the group of 30 a londonbased privatesector group composed 
of international business and financial leaders pushing for ways to 
unify the the clearance and settlement process worldwide 
one method discussed at the round table is the replacement of 
stock certificates with a socalled book entry in a computer 
some countries such as japan have done away with the use of 
stock certificates but some retail brokerages fear that without 
paper documents they might lose the mom and pop investors that are 
their mainstay 
many of our retail customers enjoy the right to take physical 
possession of their certificates maintains ag edwards amp sons 
a st louisbased brokerage some customers tend to distrust any 
entity holding their certificates 
elimination of stock certificates is also opposed not 
surprisingly by the people who make the intricately engraved 
certificates 
a survey commissioned by the united states banknote corp one 
of the nations largest private printers of stamps banknotes and 
stock certificates found that four out of five shareholders 
queried opposed the proposed plan for eliminating stock 
certificates 
the survey of 750 individuals currently investing in th market 
found that 81 percent opposed replacing stock certificates with a 
book entry only system of computerized recordkeeping 
also opposing the proposal is the united shareholders 
association a shareholders rights group founded in 1986 by 
takeover strategist t boone pickens 
certificates represent perhaps the most direct link between 
corporations and their shareholders by depriving shareholders of 
this certificate a book entry only system would create one more 
gap between management and ownership usa president ralph v 
whitworth wrote breeden recently 
breeden said he favored a prochoice alternative allowing 
investors who want to to keep their certificates but encouraging 
the use of speedier electronic methods 
but small brokerages fret that giving investors a choice would 
be too expensive to maintain and could drive them out of business 
we have heard a great deal from our regional and smaller firms 
who are very concerned about the costbenefit analysis said 
edward kwalwasser a new york stock exchange official 
george mcnamee chairman of first albany corp said he strongly 
supported cutting the settlement process to three days but feared 
the additional cost only will be offset if we eliminate the 
certificates

the death threat was nothing new to the 
rubber tappers union in this amazon town 
ive been hired to kill you read a scrawled note slipped 
under the office door in november it said three union leaders and 
the locals truck driver cant make it to 1991 
the note was unsigned but there was little doubt at union 
headquarters who was behind it cattle ranchers the tappers 
enemies in a bloody dispute for land rights in brazils tropical 
rain forest 
since the union was founded in 1975 such threats have been 
common and deadly serious the local says pistoleiros gunmen 
hired by landowners have killed more than 150 tappers and indians 
one victim was chico mendes a rubber tapper and union leader 
who had become an internationally consulted expert on the amazon 
shotgun fire from ambush cut him down in december 1988 at his home 
in xapuri near the bolivian border 2650 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro 
a local rancher darli alves da silva and his son darci were 
arrested their trial is scheduled to begin wednesday in xapuri 
this is the land where they threaten and do it said 
osmarino amancio rodrigues president of the brasileia union local 
and one of those on the notes list no one has ever escaped 
he added with a laugh two of my bodyguards were threatened 
now ill have to get bodyguards for my bodyguards 
rodrigues 34 is widely regarded as the successor to chico 
mendes as the leader of a grassroots movement against destruction 
of the rain forest 
jose da silva pereira another tapper on the death list said 
when ranchers want to get rid of a tapper they come in shooting 
kill his livestock and burn his house if he doesnt leave he 
dies 
a new alliance of rubber tappers and amazon indians is 
challenging the notion that developing the forest means cutting 
it down for timber or burning it to make pasture 
uncontrolled slashandburn clearing already has destroyed more 
than 250000 square miles of rain forest an area the equal to 
texas a patch of jungle the size of a football field disappears 
every eight seconds adding to the greenhouse effect that is 
warming the planet 
those whose livelihoods come from the forest favor an 
alternative called extractivist reserves a new system of 
landholding in which the government expropriates rain forest to 
allow commercial harvesting of fruits nuts and other renewable 
products 
such reserves give tappers legal rights to the jungle where for 
years they were squatters on the huge feudal estates of cattle 
barons and big landowners the government now has 7 million acres 
of reserves in amazonia and plans to set aside 55 million more by 
1993 
one region of nearly 2 million acres is named for chico mendes 
there wont be peace in the forest without land reform said 
rodrigues a short swarthy man with a black beard in amazonia 
that means indian reservations and extractivist reserves 
the main argument for protecting the forest is simply that its 
more profitable alive 
aminded consumers in the united states and europe amazon fruits 
nuts oils and essences are heading north to make everything from 
ice cream and nut candy to cosmetics 
we have to prove the economic value of the rain forest and 
generate income to save it anthropologist jason clay said in an 
interview clay is research director of cultural survival a 
nonprofit group based in cambridge mass and visits brazil 
frequently 
cultural survival buys jungle products and resells them to 
companies abroad charging a 5 percent environmental premium 
used to help forest peoples 
clay said he showed samples of 350 rain forest products and 
businessmen were interested in 38 of them he reported orders worth 
4 million and said several companies pledged part of their 
profits to rain forest projects 
extractivist reserves are one of the few environmentally 
viable alternatives for the amazon he said 
we have to make the reserves more economically rewarding then 
we can use them to recover degraded areas and as buffer zones for 
the genetic hotspots the really fragile parts of amazonia that 
shouldnt be used 
brazil has tried for decades to tap the riches of the amazon a 
wilderness of two million square miles that is larger than europe 
without the soviet union 
amazonia contains 30 percent of the worlds rain forest 
onefifth of its fresh water 5 million species of plants animals 
and insects and rich deposits of gold diamonds iron tin and 
other minerals despite those riches most of its inhabitants live 
in grinding poverty 
attempts by the military regime of 19641985 to open up the 
amazon were an ecological nightmare 
huge development projects like the transamazon highway farm 
settlements and the balbina and tucurui hydroelectric dams wiped 
out huge tracts of forest and nearly destroyed some native tribes 
government incentives attracted cattle ranchers who kept 
burning the jungle off the sandy soil to replace pasture that 
lasted only two or three years experts say their productivity is secretary 
jose lutzenberger an internationally 
respected ecologist says brazil is trying to change its image as a 
destroyer of the environment 
extractivist reserves are extremely important he said in an 
interview we must create many more of them 
canada has pledged 10 million to the national rubber tappers 
council starting next year to develop extractivist reserves 
the newest and largest of the special areas is the chico mendes 
reserve which covers 24 million acres in the western amazon state 
of acre where the most violence has occurred 
on the reserves tappers associations sign longterm contracts 
with the government for the use and benefit of the land they 
must obey rules for protecting the environment or forfeit the area 
this was our great victory said nelson custodio da silva a 
rubber tapper we fought four years for this reserve 
problems remain most reserves have not yet been expropriated 
and the government foresees a long legal battle with landowners 
the chico mendes reserve was created by former president jose 
sarney three days before he left office in march 
it was a great party but the bill wasnt paid marco 
antonio mendes the acre state environment secretary said in an 
interview 
tappers also have not escaped exploitation by marreteiros 
middlemen who trade commercial goods like salt and cloth for rubber 
and nuts and routinely charge three or four times the regular 
price 
nearly all the profit from jungle produce is made elsewhere 
tappers earn only 3 to 4 cents a pound for brazil nuts about 2 
percent of the new york wholesale price 
acre states technology foundation is running a unique 
experiment in forest management on the remote border with amazonas 
state 
at the 166000acre antimari reserve technicians are studying 
how to densify the forest by planting without upsetting the 
natural balance they are concentrating on bamboo timber and more 
than 800 types of medicinal plants as well as rubber and brazil 
nuts 
this is a first for amazonia said gilberto siqueira the 
foundation president it will show us the limits of exploitation 
without disturbing the whole 
another experimental project is a cooperative in xapuri that 
shells packs and exports brazil nuts it is the first 
nutprocessing plant owned by the tappers 
paid a fair price said rolando polanco a worker at the 
cooperative were trying to give the tappers a better deal 
the plant built with a 25000 gift from cultural survival 
employs 78 people and processes 1100 pounds of nuts a day barely 
onetenth of the production in xapuri alone polanco said expansion 
depends on donations from environmental groups and businessmen

joao de almeida mello sat on his cabin 
floor in the rain forest and recalled when he lived in fear of 
expulsion or worse by landowners 
i was just a squatter he said i was at the mercy of 
ranchers i had no security no guarantees 
living on your own land makes all the difference he said 
and smiled 
mello is a rubber tapper on the chico mendes extractivist 
reserve in the western amazon state of acre nearly 3000 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
extractivist reserves are a new model of development for the 
amazon the government gives forest dwellers rights to their 
traditional lands and lets them harvest what the jungle grows 
rubber and nuts that provide his income for wood to build and game 
to help feed his wife and 10 children 
his day starts at 400 am when the rubbertree sap flows 
freely in the cool of the morning it slows when the amazon sun 
pushes the heat to or through the 90s 
on this morning he crossed a meadow and entered the forest 
walking on a carpet of broad dark leaves that covered the sandy 
soil bird songs filled the woods the loudest of them the 
threewhistle tune of what forest people call the twentyone 
walking among 1500yearold brazilnut and piqui trees towering 
130 feet mello approached a shinyleafed rubber tree drew his 
tapping knife and gently cut half a dozen diagonal slashes on the 
already scarred trunk 
milky white latex began to flow dripping into a hollowed 
brazilnut pod the size of a softball propped on a threepronged 
stick mello moved to the next tree 
this trail contains about 150 trees and he will tap them all in 
a day mello has five trails in the forest and works them in turn 
he retraces the route later to collect the latex dumping it 
into a large round can he carries in a cloth harness on his back 
at the cabin he empties the contents into a homemade wooden press 
where the latex congeals into rubber 
sugarcane liquor and other goods at exorbitant prices sugar that 
costs 20 cents a pound in a store often costs four times that at 
barter time 
the bill just keeps growing and you never finish paying 
said mello sitting on a splitlog bench in his cabin the room was 
bare except for three oiled shotguns hanging by their straps from 
nails on the wall 
collecting latex is difficult during the rainy season from 
december to april and tappers gather brazil nuts instead mello 
collects the pods in a backpack made of vines cracks them open and 
leaves the nuts in flour sacks along the rutted dirt road that 
leads out of the reserve 
he and other tappers pool their money to rent a tractor and take 
the nuts outside the reserve to sell thus avoiding the middlemen 
tappers deeper in the forest rely on ox cart and burro to get 
through the mud 
mello said he earned only 50000 cruzeiros last year less than 
1000 in brazils rapidly devaluating currency 
the reserve are less economic than political land rights and the 
freedom to unionize 
to help feed the family mello plants rice beans and manioc 
root he sells what is left over 
meat often means monkey armadillo or parrot now and then he 
slaughters a goat or a pig 
government environmental workers plan to build a dam near 
mellos cabin so he can raise fish 
they also teach those who live in the reserves how to renew 
degraded parts of the forest by planting avocado cashew orange 
tangerine and acai trees 
we used to ruin a lot of the forest and the second growth 
wasnt good for anything mello said now its full of fruit 
trees 
there still is no school although mellos district has 40 
schoolage children the reserve has no health station despite 
government promises to build one 
we get promises promises and nothing is done said mellos 
neighbor raimundo tavares ribeiro if you get sick either a 
group of neighbors carries you out in a hammock to a hospital or 
you stay there and die 
still he said the reserve has freed tappers from their 
greatest fear the ranchers and big landowners 
the landowners keep you under their feet tavares said if 
you work for them youre a slave they pay you what they want and 
take half of what you grow 
reserves give poor people conditions to work he said

romanians have achieved a fragile 
democracy a year after the bloody fall of communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu but not the prosperity and calm they hoped it 
would bring 
there is economic misery as the government tries to create a 
market economy and suspicion of political leaders who once served 
ceausescu 
an army of orphaned or abandoned children is warehoused in 
woeful institutions there are nagging questions about attitudes 
toward minority hungarians here in transylvania and toward jews 
and gypsies 
even the revolution which began in this western city is under 
a cloud some question whether it was really a revolution or just a 
communist palace coup 
the government that has installed itself in bucharest is 
neocommunist using the same people methods and even massacres 
as the one before said george serban an antigovernment 
activist 
he displayed a rippedopen envelope to emphasize his claim that 
someone still reads his mail and taps his telephone 
demonstrators who join weekly street protests apparently see 
nothing contradictory in accusing the new national salvation front 
government of being a front for unreformed communists and 
criticizing the marketoriented reforms of premier petre roman 
prices have doubled or tripled stores are empty industrial 
production is down 20 percent and the average monthly paycheck is 
worth only 20 on the black market 
in nationwide protests nov 15 more than 100000 romanians 
demanded the governments resignation 
the revolution began at a corner building that served as the 
hungarian reformed church and housed its pastor laszlo tokes it 
is about half a mile from where serban the 37yearold president 
of the antigovernment timisoara society spoke recently to a human 
rights conference 
it was dec 15 1989 hundreds of people gathered outside as 
tokes whose defiant anticommunism had made him a marked man 
waited for ceausescus police to banish him to the faroff village 
of mineu 
communists had been swept from power the previous month in 
czechoslovakia radical changes were occuring in the other former 
east bloc countries but ceausescu promised only more of the same 
there was something in the air a feeling that this could not 
continue and it was in that atmosphere that the people gathered 
outside the church said lajos varga a member of the 
congregation and a close friend of tokes 
demonstrators moved to the downtown communist party 
headquarters smashed windows and set fires inside police invaded 
the church beat tokes and took him away the revolution had begun 
first the army fired on demonstrators gathered again outside 
the party building varga recalled several dozen were killed 
that afternoon as the army pushed demonstrators down the main 
boulevard leaving a few dead at each junction 
tension spread to bucharest and ceausescu organized a mass 
rally several days later to condemn the hooligans in timisoara 
for the first time in his 24 years of power a booing crowd 
drowned him out police and soldiers began shooting 
bogdan preda an associated press reporter was in university 
square 
i jumped into a fountain outside the nearby architecture 
school building and that may have saved my life he recalled 
eventually we escaped through the southern end of the main 
boulevard which the police and army kept open 
ceausescu fled the next day dec 22 but was captured by the 
army which had turned against him he was tried secretly and 
executed on christmas day 
the national salvation front stepped in began running the 
country and rode its promise of painless reform to easy victory in 
romanias first free elections in five decades 
many people accuse the front of usurping their revolution 
president ion iliescu a top communist official before falling 
out with ceausescu passionately defended communism in his first 
television speech after the uprising iliescu now insists he no 
longer believes in it 
last spring students intellectuals former dissidents and 
others blocked traffic in university square for 53 days six people 
were killed when police tried to suppress the protest 
iliescu called in progovernment miners from the provinces they 
terrorized the capital for days beating and arresting people 
suspected of opposing the government 
other countries shunned romania after the violence but it has 
recovered some foreign support by backing un sanctions against 
iraq at the cost of billions of dollars in trade 
intellectuals have increased their attacks on iliescu since the 
passage of laws placing the army the new romanian intelligence 
service and even the government under his direct control and 
supervision 
iliescu is a potential dictator and he must be stopped 
said gabriel andreescu of the intellectual group for social 
dialogue a cornerstone of the nationwide civic alliance 
opposition 
the alliance accuses iliescu and the national salvation front of 
covering up what happened in the revolution 
no one is being tried for the random shooting that occurred in 
bucharest for several days between ceausescus flight and his 
execution most of the more than 1000 people killed in the 
revolution lost their lives in that period 
about 6000 members of ceausescus securitate security service 
have turned up in the new intelligence service the 9000 others 
along with members of the communist party central committee were 
retired with pensions 
although about 60 ceausescu aides and securitate officers have 
been tried the charges addressed only ceausescus attempt to 
repress the revolt not the violence after his flight 
most romanians appear satisfied with the freedoms introduced 
last december and are eager to improve their lot after four decades 
of increasing poverty under communism but romans reforms have 
begun to bite 
under the economic programs first phase introduced nov 1 
many prices have risen by up to 200 percent staple foods energy 
and rents remain protected but only temporarily 
moneylosing state enterprises have been told they face 
bankruptcy and the government has said it will stop providing 
industry with cheap energy while private homes are dark and cold 
the program has made enemies in the trade unions which 
officials see as potentially the strongest opposition force 
in a sign of possible divisions in the front itself iliescu has 
been lukewarm about romans reforms which the premier says will 
deliver an average european standard of living in five years 
doru mihiti of the timisoara society summed up the views of the 
critics 
there was a moment in which communism could have been 
eliminated for good in romania in the chaos right after the 
revolution the entire system and its personnel could have been 
overhauled instead we now must fight for the changes slowly and 
one at a time

uncertainty about what happened to the 
nicolae ceausescus hated secret police the securitate has cast a 
shadow over the revolution 
despite official accounting for about 9000 securitate officers 
who were retired or transferred to other jobs many romanians 
believe the organization is alive and well playing its old game of 
political terror and intrigue for new masters 
virgil magureanu chief of the new romanian intelligence 
service acknowledges hiring nearly 6000 uncompromised 
securitate officers for what he termed nonpolitical duties 
many critics of the government claim agents of the new service 
infiltrate opposition demonstrations collect information that 
later leads to arrests and occasionally try to provoke violence 
the political police still exists and we will not have 
liberty until it is gone sorin rosca of the civic alliance 
opposition declared at a recent antigovernment demonstration 
anxiety about the securitate derives partially from the 
continuing mystery surrounding the revolution of december 1989 
more than 1000 romanians were killed most of them after 
ceausescu fell dec 22 and the national salvation front government 
was installed ceausescu loyalists from securitate fought the army 
and shot citizens down in the streets 
who ordered and carried out the shootings still is not known 
and no one has been tried the issue is being avoided in the trial 
of the former securitate chief iulian vlad 
thousands of people were arrested during violence accompanying 
the revolution but officials say they were released in the 
confusion and there was no record of their names 
sen dan iosif a front member who led the occupation of 
ceausescus former headquarters in palace square said securitate 
agents captured there were either killed by the raiders or 
eliminated by other securitate members to keep them quiet 
president ion iliescu when asked in interviews acknowledges 
the existence of a very great mystery surrounding the uprising 
in a society where decades of governmentcontrolled media 
transformed wordofmouth into the only alternative source of 
information holes in the official version have been filled by 
rumors in dazzling variety 
some romanians believe the new authorities gave the securitate 
amnesty in exchange for a ceasefire 
coriolan sipos one of those who stormed ceausescus 
headquarters offered this it was a brilliant coup by the 
securitate itself to install iliescu pure and simple 
sipos a teacher claimed many of those who invaded the building 
had been been killed by plainclothes securitate agents posing as 
revolutionaries 
among those who survived only about 10 are left in romania 
the rest having been hounded out in one way or another he said 
gabriel andreescu of the intellectual group for social dialogue 
said i do not rule out the possibility that the revolution was 
entirely staged however diabolical it seems but all i can say for 
certain is that the official story is false

distorted world of japanese real estate where less is more and more 
is outrageous there is no more expensive land per inch in the 
world unless it might be a south african diamond mine heres a 
visit to japans real national treasure 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
many a tourist has wandered gapemouthed through 
tokyos ginza the shopping wonderland where such highpriced 
marvels as 450 neckties confound the senses next to it though 
lies a greater treasure 
it is a vacant lot 
for three years this 534acre asphalt wasteland in the heart 
of the most expensive real estate in the world has gone virtually 
unused 
governmentowned former rail yard is surrounded by headquarters of 
mighty banks and corporations it is a jarring sight somewhat as 
manhattan might look with an empty space where rockefeller center 
now stands yet no one can buy it 
to find out why entails a lewis carrolllike journey through 
land policies that western experts say defy economic logic and 
absurdly inflate tokyos land prices which run 30 to 100 times 
higher than in other major cities worldwide 
such government policies have left japans huge landholding 
corporations swimming in assets and many homeowners paper 
millionaires but they have also created a large class of havenots 
that threatens japans prosperity 
government officials say they cannot put the shiodome rail yard 
on the market just yet because it is too valuable the lot is as 
much as 50 times pricier than the approximately 850 million 
japans mitsubishi estate co paid for a share of the 22acre 
rockefeller center last year 
its sudden availability to speculators would bid up real estate 
prices to even more astronomical levels officials say although 
they acknowledge that such a policy runs contrary to the law of 
supply and demand 
normal economic theory doesnt seem to work when it comes to 
land in japan because there is overwhelmingly more demand for land 
than supply said hiroshi yoneda the transportation ministry 
official in charge of the yard 
aghast at such reasoning 
raising supply usually lowers prices anyone who doesnt know 
that should go back and take economics 101 scoffed robert 
feldman an economist at salomon bros a new york financial house 
but this is japan where an alchemy of postwar tax policy easy 
money and japanese herd behavior has turned land into gold 
like golds fabled ability to inspire greed the hunger for land 
on this small archipelago crowded with 120 million people has 
created rapacious speculators whove become the stuff of movies and 
tv dramas 
land sharks eager to resell properties hire thugs who spend 
months banging noisemakers or setting fires to hound families from 
buildings theyve occupied for generations real estate executives 
have been held hostage by extremists outraged over inadequate 
housing 
worst of all land fever has divided japan into two economic 
classes those who own land usually through an inheritance and 
those who cant afford it too often the landless are the younger 
babyproducing generation 
that looms as a potential disaster japan had the worlds lowest 
birthrate last year at 102 babies per 1000 people in surveys 
many women attribute their unwillingness to have children in part 
to the rented rabbit hutch apartments they must squeeze into 
with little room for family 
ultimately policymakers worry this socalled child shock 
could undermine the nations industrial might japan already 
suffering a labor shortage could become topheavy with too many 
elderly pensioners supported by too few younger workers 
up to now the longgoverning conservative liberal democratic 
party has had little motivation to act high land prices have been 
popular with its major constituencies the 60 percent of japanese 
who already own homes and the large corporations who have watched 
their portfolio assets swell 
but the catastrophic potential of the boom may nudge government 
into action 
on oct 30 a 1 percent tax on land holdings was suggested to 
gradually to drive down prices according to one survey high 
interest rates and an economic slowdown already have reduced 
residential land prices by 10 percent to 30 percent in recent 
months 
the government is moving gingerly fearful falling prices would 
jolt corporations with large holdings of real estate and stocks 
many are already reeling from the tokyo stock exchanges nosedive 
this year 
in addition the government must untangle 45 years of often 
bizarre tax and lending policies that have made tokyo a sea of 
twostory homes instead of desperately needed highrise 
redevelopment 
than small vegetable patches or rice paddies are exempt from 
property taxes if they declare their intention to farm for 10 
years banks offer 100year mortgages current landholding taxes 
are only as high as 02 percent allowing small owners to sit tight 
and watch values spiral upward 
as a result real estate experts say the main reason for the 
land inflation is probably not a lack of space but simply that so 
little is traded 
plans are also moving slowly for shiodome a remnant of the 
governments 1987 selloff of the stateowned railway to private 
companies 
hiroshi yoneda the transportation ministry official charged 
with developing a subdivision plan said it is to be gradually sold 
off for commercial use after march 1992 but that timetable may be 
impossible 
it is extraordinary if they had disposed of shiodome several 
years ago that land would have soaked up so much speculative 
money said gregory clark a sophia university economics 
professor who has advised the government on the land problem 
they genuinely believe that by keeping a supply of land off 
the market they lower prices clark said if you look at the 
situation with western eyes youd have to assume it was a 
government plot to keep prices high 
some westerners do an article in the october issue of the 
atlantic monthly for example accuses japans government of a 
conscious and even a brilliant strategy to maintain skyhigh land 
prices as a means of keeping foreign companies from buying into 
japan suppressing consumption of foreign goods and boosting 
savings 
most experts conclude however theres no evidence for such a 
scheme 
makoto utsumi vice minister of finance for international 
affairs looked surprised when asked whether his ministry was 
behind it all as some conspiracy theorists contend 
its totally wrong to think that finance ministry officials 
are happy to see higher land prices he retorted indeed the 
ministry has been urging banks to rein in real estate loans but to 
little avail 
clark said he would never rule out a plot entirely because 
there are depths of this society we never get to 
if its a plot theyre very clever if not theyre very 
stupid and i cant believe the japanese are so stupid

financial news network inc which operates a 
busiess channel on cable television but is embroiled in a 
financial controversy of its own said it expects to report a 725 
million loss for fiscal 1990 
the company whose biggest shareholder is the owner of the 
united press international wire service also said thursday it 
expects to report a loss of 25 million for the first quarter of 
its current fiscal year 
the company has been unable to report its financial results for 
the fiscal year ended june 30 because it replaced its auditing firm 
in a controversy over how fnn was reporting a 28 million 
investment in a new service 
the auditors deloitte amp touche contended the investment should 
have been deducted from quarterly earnings while fnn wanted to 
spread the costs over a few years 
deloitte left as fnns auditor in october and the firm coopers amp 
lybrand was brought in to study the fnn annual financial 
statements 
fnn said thursday that its new auditors had substantially 
completed their examination and said it expects to file its 
audited financial statements with the securities and exchange 
commission in early december 
fnn said the anticipated net loss for the year would leave it 
with a shareholders deficit of approximately 335 million at 
june 30 
the shareholders deficit represents an excess of liabilities 
over assets 
the company said it would probably file amended quarterly 
reports for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to reflect 
material changes deemed appropriate as a result of the audit 
in addition it said it expects to report within a few weeks a 
25 million loss for the first fiscal quarter ended sept 30 
fnn said that more than half of the anticipated losses for the 
year and the first quarter involves elimination of revenues derived 
from affiliated businesses 
the company did not identify the affiliates but it is 46 
percent owned by infotechnology inc which owns united press 
international and an assortment of other media and technology 
companies 
it was disclosed last month that the sec is investigating 
infotechnology for undisclosed reasons infotechnology and fnn have 
each said they do not have enough cash flow to cover operating 
expenses and are negotiating with those to whom they owe money 
in late october alan j hirschfield and allan r tessler were 
brought in to succeed earl brian as interim cochief executives at 
both infotechnology and financial news network 
in early november they said they were putting the companies 
principal operations up for sale including the fnn cable network 
and upi 
in thursdays announcement hirschfield and tessler said fnns 
investment banker wertheim amp schroder amp co inc is beginning the 
sale process for fnn 
a substantial number of inquires have been received from a 
broad representation of mediarelated companies and others 
concerning the proposed sale of fnn the statement said 
ms gordon said she could not identify who was interested or how 
many inquiries had been received she said the company hopes to 
conclude negotiations of the contracts for the sales by the end of 
the year 
fnn provides stock quotes business and financial news and 
sports information on a cable tv network to more than 35 million

if you can test pizzas at mcdonalds 
restaurants in kentucky and try out a 50sstyle diner with 
waiters lasagna and salisbury steak in tennessee why not 
mcburritos in california 
mcdonalds corp always looking for a way to spice up its 
fastfood menus is selling eggfilled breakfast burritos for 59 
cents at a halfdozen los angelesarea outlets the latest in a 
series of experiments 
theyre constantly testing new products said michael 
mueller an industry analyst with montgomery securities in san 
francisco 
the fastfood company pressed by competition has chewed 
through a slew of changes recently it trashed its styrofoam 
packaging at the urging of environmentalists its testing a 
healthier hamburger in which some of the fat is replaced by an 
algae derivative 
then came word that mcdonalds may cut prices permanently on 
some menu items to grab a bigger bite of the fastfood pie those 
rumors propelled its stock onto the new york stock exchanges 
mostactive list thursday falling 112 per share to 28 
investors apparently want profits as fast as their food but 
analysts say price cuts might help financial results in the long 
run 
the burritos similar to ones already sold at several smaller 
fastfood chains are a flour tortilla filled with scrambled eggs 
sausage and mild salsa 
its been selling ok but there hasnt been a huge demand for 
it edward wilcox manager of the mcdonalds in the woodland 
hills area of the san fernando valley said wednesday 
over the years such fare as salads mcdlts and chicken 
mcnuggets made the transition from test items to mcdonalds 
staples 
but not every experiment made the cut among the flops was the 
hulaburger two cheese slices with a slice of grilled pineapple on 
a toasted bun

debtburdened western union corp has taken 
a new tack to keep afloat by offering 50 cents cash on the dollar 
to its bondholders who rejected the companys first exchange 
offer 
meanwhile western union confirmed thursday that its top 
officials have been holding job talks with the companys 
controlling owner 
several major bondholders have threatened to force the 
communications company into bankruptcy if they dont get certain 
concessions during the companys restructuring effort 
after scrapping plans to extend its original bond exchange offer 
for a 13th time western union offered thursday to repurchase its 
junk bonds for 50 cents on the dollar 
the cash to fund the offer will come from the proceeds of 
western unions pending sale of most of its business services unit 
to american telephone amp telegraph co said spokesman warren 
bechtel 
by repurchasing the bonds western union would no longer have to 
pay the high rates of interest on them 
take the money and run was the advice to bondholders from 
c richard lehmann of the bond investors association its a case 
of a bird in the hand versus something mysterious in the bush 
theres very little value in the company and if it goes into 
bankruptcy the lawyers will suck out most of the value left in the 
company lehmann said 
several major bondholders have asked that bennett s lebow the 
new york financier whose brooke group controls western union 
refrain from selling to himself or to his affiliates businesses 
that will remain after atampt buys the business services unit 
they also asked for lebow to be prohibited from selling his 
notes and stock 
if such an agreement is not reached by dec 5 the bondholders 
said they begin steps to force the company into involuntary 
bankruptcy 
western union told the securities and exchange commission in a 
filing tuesday that its three top executives president robert 
amman chief financial officer stewart j paperin and general 
counsel john c walters have talked with the the brooke group 
about other jobs within the parent company 
bechtel said that despite the job talks the three are working 
full time to solve western unions liquidity crisis 
when asked why the three were discussing other jobs while the 
company teetered on the edge of financial collapse bechtel 
replied what do you want me to say 
the company based in upper saddle river in northern new jersey 
expects the closing of its transaction with atampt will occur 
simultaneously with the completion of its bond repurchase offer 
in the previous exchange offer western union offered to buy up 
to 530 million of its highyield junk bonds for a package of new 
notes cash and shares of common stock 
the company had sought to exchange at least 95 percent of its 
19 percent notes and 80 percent of its 16 percent notes the 
amount tendered was 64 percent of the 19 percent notes and 5 
percent of the 16 percent notes 
the 19 percent notes were selling at 21 cents on the dollar 
and the 16 percent notes at 40 cents 
western unions failure to make a profit since 1984 has 
apparently not dented the earnings of its top officials 
amman who took charge in 1988 received a 23 percent raise in 
1990 to 525000 paperin received a 26 percent raise to 
310000 
yearend bonuses have not been figured but in 1989 amman 
received a 237500 bonus and paperin a 120000 bonus 
in addition western union pays lebow a 200000 monthly 
management fee or 24 million a year 
western unions woes stem from missed opportunity and the march 
of technology lehmann said 
when atampt split up into regional baby bells western union 
had a telephone network in place and could have competed with atampt 
mci communications corp and us sprint for longdistance 
services 
they were a viable contender but they continued to plod along 
and focused on telex business and electronic mail lehmann said 
telex revenues plunged after the fax business exploded 
western unions bechtel voiced optimism that the company has a 
future but lehmann said the company has been so busy dismantling 
itself to raise cash that the chances are slim that a viable 
company will remain

general motors corp says it will suffer an 
operating loss in the current quarter its first quarterly red ink 
on operations since recessionwracked 1981 
while the automaker posted a record net loss of 2 billion in 
the third quarter that was due to a 21 billion writeoff for 
plant closings which overwhelmed a 109 million profit on 
continuing operations 
gm chairman robert stempel told a fort wayne ind business 
group thursday night that the worlds leading automaker expects its 
fourthquarter operating results will decline significantly 
from the third quarter 
stempel didnt say whether that would mean an operating loss 
but gm spokesman terrence sullivan in detroit said it certainly 
implies a loss in the fourth quarter 
sullivan said gm didnt have a prediction on the size of the 
loss the company also did not comment on whether it would post a 
net loss 
but analyst ronald glantz of dean witter reynolds inc in san 
francisco predicted gm would post a net loss of 150 million to 
250 million in the quarter 
analyst arvid jouppi of detroitbased arvid jouppi associates 
inc wasnt as pessimistic i think theres still a chance 
general motors will make money in the fourth quarter they and ford 
motor co to some degree will give up the rebate wars the fact 
is theyre not getting enough money for the cars they sell 
gms expected poor showing in the latest quarter comes despite a 
new round of production cutbacks stempel told the greater fort 
wayne chamber of commerce 
the lower production reflects an erosion of consumer confidence 
stemming in part from the persian gulf crisis stempel said 
gm said earlier this month that it was cutting fourthquarter 
production by 181000 vehicles stempel said thursday that the 
automaker was reducing production by an additional 111000 cars and 
trucks 
both reductions will leave gm with plans to build 107 million 
cars and trucks at its us and canadian plants during the quarter 
a total below that of the third quarter of 1990 and the fourth 
quarter of 1989 
the cutbacks might extend the christmastonew years day 
holiday break for some of gms 280000 hourly workers 
what gm is saying is that we are not going to get caught with 
a surplus of cars that we have to sell with extreme rebates and 
have to shut the plants down in january and february as they did 
in 1990 jouppi said 
theyre making a more realistic schedule for the 1991s than 
they did for the 1990s he said 
this is a much larger cut than i anticipated said analyst 
wendy needham of smith barney harris upham amp co basically they 
want to get as much of the pain behind them before 1991 starts 
gm last lost money on automotive operations in the second 
quarter of 1981 which according to stempel was roughly the 
midpoint of the last severe drop in consumer confidence 
other automakers also are affected by crumbling consumer 
confidence stempel said 
many people have been taking a wait and see attitude toward 
major purchase decisions for the auto industry this has 
translated into weaker automotive demand that has meant temporary 
plant shutdowns and layoffs he said 
while gms overall us market share continues to show gains 
as it has for the entire 1990 calendar year we are determined to 
keep our inventories in line with demand

the bush administration is beginning to 
prepare for what it used to say was unthinkable the possibility 
that the fouryear effort to overhaul the global trading system 
could end in failure 
the talks which involve 107 nations are scheduled to wind up 
next week with five days of marathon bargaining starting monday in 
brussels the united states will be represented by a 280member 
official delegation including four members of president bushs 
cabinet 
the talks being held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade are known as the uruguay round for 
the latin american nation where they were launched in 1986 
the talks are in danger of failing because of a wide split 
between the united states and the 12nation european community over 
the farm subsidy question the ec with its 10 million farmers has 
been unwilling to give up its complex system of subsidies 
while the president this week said we must not let the 
uruguay round fail other officials have begun to talk openly of 
what the united states will do if that occurs 
us trade representative carla hills and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter have discussed the possibility that the united 
states will more aggressively pursue unilateral measures using the 
threat of retaliation unless other countries open their markets to 
american goods 
we simply are not going to be tolerant of continued unfair 
trading practices where we believe those are disadvantageous to the 
united states yeutter said adding that failure of the uruguay 
round would cause the united states to very aggressively use 
the tools at its disposal to open markets 
yeutter said a gatt failure also would intensify the push to 
reach bilateral free trade agreements with various countries along 
the lines of the uscanada free trade deal 
some believe it was not a coincidence that bush spent two days 
this week visiting mexico to promote such an arrangement with 
americas southern neighbor 
the danger in these activities many economists believe is that 
world trade could begin to shrink as trade tensions intensify and 
countries split into warring trading blocs 
the unity achieved by the west in four decades of the cold war 
could disintegrate into a global trade war according to this 
doomsday scenario 
the gatt negotiating structure was created in 1947 as an effort 
to prevent a recurrence of the 1930s trade wars which played a 
part in the great depression and the global economic disputes that 
boiled over into world war ii 
in this round of talks the administration had high hopes of 
achieving a vastly expanded package to cover more than 1 trillion 
of world trade not now under global rules 
the administration sought to dramatically reduce farm subsidies 
that rob us and other farmers of foreign sales to remove 
barriers keeping american service companies such as banks and 
insurance firms out of foreign markets and to wipe out copyright 
piracy and counterfeiting which cost us businesses an estimated 
60 billion in lost sales annually 
the united states has insisted that without sharp reductions in 
farm subsidies farm exporting third world nations will not go 
along with other trade reforms in areas such as services and 
copyright protection 
we need fundamental reform in agriculture a minideal will 
not achieve either the international support or the us domestic 
support we need said an administration official who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity 
key members of congress including sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
and sen max baucus dmont have added their backing to the 
administrations hardline negotiating stance 
if the uruguay round were to fail we have many avenues to 
pursue in an attempt to open markets baucus said we should 
not be ideologically wedded only to a multilateral approach to 
trade issues we should take a more pragmatic approach and use 
whatever works best to open markets 
but some observers see danger in the willingness of us 
policymakers to walk away from the uruguay round especially with 
recessionary storm clouds building around the world 
with the threat of war uncertain financial markets the 
savings and loan crisis and everything else this is a lousy time 
to have a headline that would read world trade talks collapse 
said william brock former trade representative in the reagan 
administration i think we would take a terrible risk in economic 
terms

listeners tuned in to a radio station today that 
broadcasts digital signals to the entire nation from a satellite 
in what its developers say is a first 
unlike am and fm radio broadcasts which suffer from static 
hiss and limited frequency response the station beams signals 
directly from a satellite to listeners in digital form similar to 
the system used by compact discs 
that results in sound quality that is far better than fm 
radio and equals that on cds said tadanobu kishi an official 
in the ministry of posts and communications 
because the broadcasts are digital listeners with digital audio 
tape recorders can make recordings that are virtually perfect 
copies of the original master tapes 
but to receive the new digital station listeners need a small 
satellite dish and a special tuner that can be attached to a 
television set to receive tv broadcasts from the same satellite 
starting in april its commercialfree broadcasts will be 
scrambled and lengthened from 12 to 24 hours a day and consumers 
will need to buy a 200 decoder and pay a 460 monthly fee 
since were the first in the world we want to try to make it 
as popular as possible said yoko ogame a satellite digital 
audio broadcasting co official 
radio giga its frequency is measured in gigahertz began 
broadcasting today with a special earth symphony that featured 
the sounds of waves at the seychelle islands whale songs off maui 
island a moonlight walk in tennessee and midnight in a japanese 
forest 
the ministry of posts and communications hopes the station and 
18 other digital satellite stations to follow next year will offer 
a broader range of programming than current commercial broadcasts 
most areas in japan have few radio stations in part because of 
a ministry policy that required equal facilities for all parts of 
the archipelago 
tokyos 12 million people have only four fm stations two 
commercial one public and one that carries school lectures 
the company hopes to have up to 700000 paying customers within 
two years its radio format will consist of relaxing music from 
a variety of styles with a minimum of talk ms ogame said 
owned by a consortium of companies the station shares a 
sttellite channel or transponder with japan satellite 
broadcasting a private satellite tv station that also began 
broadcasting on friday and owns 10 percent of satellite digital 
japan has been a pioneer in directbroadcast satellites which 
are more powerful than regular communications satellites and beam 
signals directly to plattersize antennas at consumers homes 
the public japan broadcasting corp nhk operates the countrys 
two other satellite tv channels more commercial channels are 
expected when another satellite becomes operational next year 
that satellite also will boost the number of digital radio 
stations to 19 kishi said stations will be able to broadcast 
commercials if they wish but weve asked that they be 
commercialfree if they scramble more than half their broadcasts 
some cable tv systems in the united states have offered digital 
audio and a few tv stations have conducted localized test audio 
broadcasts on unused uhf channels 
nhk says about 32 million households pay about 770 a month to 
watch its unscrambled satellite tv broadcasts many more have 
purchased satellite tuners industry officials say 
we welcome additional stations as a step toward the coming era 
of satellite broadcasting nhk spokesman takehiko motohashi said 
but while satellites are good for unified national broadcasting 
regular landbased broadcasts are best for localized news and 
programming

drivers will pay as much as 51 cents a gallon 
more for gasoline starting saturday and they wont be able to 
blame saddam hussein 
a federal tax increase is taking effect and half of the 25 
billion it produces over the next five years will go for deficit 
reduction most of the rest will pay for highway and mass transit 
improvements 
a family that drives 12000 miles in a car that averages 22 
miles per gallon will pay about 28 more a year 
flying and shipping by air also will cost more beginning 
saturday the 8 percent federal tax on airline tickets will rise to 
10 percent and the 5 percent levy on air freight will go up to 625 
percent those increases when combined with higher taxes on 
noncommercial aviation fuel used by private planes will bring in 
almost 12 billion over five years 
nothing in the law says service station owners must pass along 
the higher gasoline and diesel tax to consumers but economics 
indicates they will 
prices will go up at 1201 am predicted dave haddad sr 
of pittsburgh president of the service station dealers of america 
half the retailers are making one two or three cents profit 
on a gallon he said how can they eat a nickel a gallon 
retailers have no alternative but to increase the price by five 
cents a gallon 
the new federal tax on gasoline used on highways or in 
motorboats will be 141 cents a gallon the tax on diesel for 
highway use 201 cents diesel used by trains will face a new 25 
cent tax the tax on noncommercial aviation gasoline will rise to 
151 cents and the levy on noncommercial jet fuel goes to 176 
cents a gallon 
the nickelagallon boost for gasoline follows the price runup 
that hit after aug 2 when iraqi president saddam invaded kuwait 
shutting off most of the oil from both those persian gulf nations 
jerry cheske of american automobile association headquarters in 
orlando fla said that as of tuesday the national average price 
of a gallon of customerpumped regular unleaded gasoline was 
1366 that was up 07 cents from a week earlier and 291 cents 
above the aug 1 average 
if most retailers boost their prices by the full 5 or 51 cents 
a gallon the nationwide average price would rise to about 141 a 
gallon 
before the tax was raised the congressional budget office 
estimated that almost 94 percent of households buy motor fuel and 
will pay an average of 990 for it this year 
with state taxes included the average tax on gasoline in the 
united states last year was 30 cents a gallon that compares with 
305 in italy 276 in denmark and 234 in france and ireland 
the last federal tax increase was 5 cents a gallon in 1983 
the latest increase was passed by congress in october as part of 
a plan to reduce the federal deficit by nearly 500 billion over 
the next five years the increase includes 5 cents that will be 
divided between highway improvements and deficit reduction and 01 
cent per gallon to clean up leaking underground storage tanks 
the highway trust fund which finances most federal highway and 
bridge construction will get 25 cents of the increase the mass 
transit side of the highway fund which has been getting 1 cent of 
the 9cent gas and diesel tax will get 1 cents of the 141cent 
levy 
the increased taxes on airline tickets and cargo expected to 
bring in about 4 billion over five years will go for deficit 
reduction for the next two years then into the trust fund that 
finances airport and airway improvements 
an estimated 50 million a year of taxes that otherwise would go 
to the highway fund will be drained off to finance restoration of 
wetlands that is the tax likely to be collected from the sale of 
gasoline used for such nonhighway machinery as lawn mowers snow 
blowers chain saws and leaf mulchers

a new york congressman says the federal deposit 
insurance corp did only half the right thing by deciding to 
pay depositors of the defunct freedom national bank 50 percent of 
their uninsured balances 
rep charles rangel dny announced on thursday night that 
the fdic had authorized payment to uninsured clients of the 
harlembased bank such as churches and charitable organizations 
freedom national the nations fourthlargest blackowned bank 
closed its doors earlier this month 
alan witney an fdic spokesman in washington confirmed 
rangels announcement 
thats a good first step but i still insist that when the 
government tells people their money is insured and that it is safe 
they really mean that rangel said the fdic has done half the 
right thing 
the fdic only insures deposits of up to 100000 many local 
charities including harlem and brooklynbased organizations 
providing day care foster care housing and victims assistance 
had multiple accounts in the bank with totals that exceeded that 
amount 
the fdic said checks would go out in a couple of days to 
depositors who had filed claims rangel said 
but the congressman whose district includes parts of harlem said 
the fdic has a long way to go to make things up to the depositors 
at freedom national and to the community whom they failed to give 
any time to either withdraw their money or to make other 
arrangements 
rangel said he would continue his efforts for full compensation 
to the depositors 
there is still a double standard between the treatment 
accorded the depositors at freedom and those at a number of larger 
banks said rangel in the cases of several large failing banks 
the fdic prevented any losses at all to the depositors 
freedom national was founded in 1964 as a financial resource for 
harlem it lost 4 million over the past two years before being 
closed down by federal regulators

federal regulators approved the sale of great 
american banks california operations to wells fargo amp co but 
also issued a caseanddesist order to the thrift in approving its 
revised capital plan 
the approval of the sale calls for great american to hand over 
130 retail branches in the state with 64 billion in deposits to 
wells fargo for approximately 491 million 
but the office of thrift supervision ots warned in the order 
issued thursday that a violation of the revised capital plan would 
result in possible seizure of what remains of great american or its 
submission to a merger or acquisition negotiated on behalf of the 
ots

the transaction with wells fargo and details great americans plans 
for achieving compliance with new capital requirements by the end 
of 1994 
great american chief executive robert kemper said approval of 
the revised capital plan was a major step forward for this 
institution and was confident it could meet the stringent 
provisions outlined under the plan 
we wouldnt have put together a capital plan if we felt we 
couldnt accomplish it kemper said 
the office of the comptroller of the currency wells fargos 
primary regulator approved the great american sale in late 
october the ots and the federal deposit insurance corp did not 
announce their approval until thursday 
great american will be left with roughly 9 billion in assets

of service station gasoline pumps said friday it will close its

people will be consolidated into the fort wayne fabrication and 
machining plant by the late summer of 1991 the company said

auto workers union at the fort wayne factory was a main factor in 
their decision to relocate the newbern operations to northeastern 
indiana the agreement extends to april 1997 and contains a 
nostrike provision until april 2000 
the new contract allows for much greater flexibility within 
our manufacturing group at a competitive labor cost said donald 
e rhodes senior vice president of manufacturing

to increase productivity and improve quality while reducing 
response time to customer orders 
the newbern plant will be sold workers who do not relocate to 
fort wayne or receive another position with the company will be 
provided with severance and placement programs 
fourthquarter net earnings will reflect a onetime after tax 
charge of about 11 million to 14 million or 17 to 22 cents per 
share representing the estimated net costs and expenses directly 
associated with the plant closing the company said 
because of the consolidation net earnings are expected to 
improve by up to 40 cents per share beginning in 1992

the gillette co is threatening to close the 
worlds largest razor blade plant in boston if the city bans 
ozonedepleting chemicals 
the city council is considering outlawing chemicals that when 
released into the atmosphere deplete the ozone layer protecting 
the earth from damaging rays from the sun 
at a hearing thursday gillette vice chairman joseph e mullaney 
said the ban would put the company at a significant competitive 
disadvantage and if the bill is adopted gillette will close its 
plant in the south boston section by january 1992 
a statement from the company this morning softpedaled the 
threat somewhat saying if the proposed ordinance is approved 
gillette will make any necessary decisions at that time joan 
fitzgerald a gillette spokeswoman said the company hoped a 
compromise wording for the ordinance could be worked out 
the gillette plant employs 3100 people 
mullaney said gillette uses the chemicals to coat the edges of 
razor blades and to clean equipment 
the du pont co which provides the bladecoating chemicals 
says it is searching for substitutes and gillette already has 
found some for the cleaning chemicals mullaney said 
the proposed law would cost the company money by requiring 
labels starting jan 1 on all razors and packages of blades made at 
the plant saying they were made with chemicals harmful to ozone a 
year later the substances would be banned 
mullaney said the company supports efforts to save the ozone but 
the boston ban coming on top of national and international 
efforts would create varying standards and confusion 
gillette reformulated all of its domestic aerosol products in 
1977 to replace chlorofluorocarbon propellants with propellants 
that do not affect the upper atmosphere mullaney said 
mark sommer an activist with the greenpeace environmental 
organization said similar bans in newark nj and irvine 
calif havent resulted in one job loss or company relocation 
secretary of state michael j connolly submitted testimony 
through an aide saying he supported the ban if it allows companies 
to seek exemptions on a hardship basis 
greater boston chamber of commerce president james l sullivan 
said the ban would have a catastrophic effect on businesses and a 
negligible impact on saving the ozone layer

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge fell in october for the fourth straight month signaling a 
recession that many economists say already has arrived president 
bush said today the economy is at best in a serious slowdown 
that could worsen 
leading economic indicators was the latest in a string of gloomy 
reports on the economy 
eight of the 11 forwardlooking components in the index fell in 
addition the department said the index actually dropped 01 
percent in july rather than remaining unchanged as first reported 
three consecutive declines in the index have been viewed as a 
fairly reliable although not infallible sign that a recession 
is approaching the gauge is designed to forecast economic 
conditions six to nine months in advance 
bush linked the economic downturn to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
and said the new democracies in eastern europe also have been hurt 
by saddam husseins actions 
the increase in oil prices resulting directly from saddam is 
hurting our country too bush said at a nationally televised 
news conference our economy as i said the other day is at best 
in a serious slowdown and if uncertainty remains in the energy 
markets the slowdown will get worse 
they believe a recession already has started even federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan usually cautious about characterizing the 
economy said this week it now is in a meaningful downturn 
the october leading indicators contained clear classical 
signs that we are in a recession said william k macreynolds 
forecasting director for the us chamber of commerce instead of 
foretelling a recession that is a few months away those indicators 
show that it already has started 
bush told a group of bankers thursday that the slowdown or the 
recession or whatever one would call exactly what were in now 
will be a short one 
the index also sank 12 percent in august the steepest decline 
since a 14 percent drop a month after the october 1987 stock 
market crash it slid an additional 08 percent in september 
there has not been a recession since world war ii without the 
index turning down for at least three consecutive months 
on the other hand the gauge was negative for six months in 1984 
and again for four months following the 1987 crash both times the 
economy escaped a recession 
pulling the index down were a dropin a figure measuring 
consumer confidence an increase in weekly unemployment claims a 
decline in the average workweek a drop in building permits a 
decline in the money supply falling stock prices a decrease in 
the price of raw materials and faster business delivery times 
the only positive contributors were increases in orders for 
consumer goods orders for new plants and equipment and in unfilled 
orders 
the various changes left the index at 1416 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and down 19 percent from its level a year ago 
the index has fallen during six of the 10 months so far this 
year 
since most of the components are announced earlier many 
economists view the index more as a useful statistic in summarizing 
economic events than a genuine leading indicator 
i would not say its gospel in forecasting recessions said 
economist robert brusca of nikko securities co international we 
should never think there is one single measure that can capture all 
of the flavor of the modern sophisticated economy 
its like asking a painter to paint the most beautiful picture 
in the world using only one color brusca added the painter 
might find it to be a very interesting challenge but i doubt the 
work would be without serious shortfalls 
laurence h meyer economist for a st louis economic 
forecasting firm maintains the persian gulf crisis preempted the 
advance warning this time 
what we had was an economy thatsliding toward a recession then 
got hit with a series of 
adverse shocks which pushed it over the edge very abruptly he 
said 
meyer and other economists also note that better inventory 
management has cut into the indexs leadtime in recent years 
production cutbacks are following demand much more closely so 
were not seeing inventory pile up as demand softens he said 
were not getting the normal lead time 
in past recessions there were major inventory accumulations 
which caused severe production cutbacks as businesses attempted to 
sell their backlogs that in turn caused the loss of jobs and 
worsened the downturn

orin e atkins the former chairman of ashland 
oil inc was sentenced friday to probation and community service 
for trying to sell confidential company documents to iran 
us district judge charles s haight of manhattan said that 
although he felt atkins had committed a serious crime he decided 
prison time was not warranted because atkins cooperated with 
prosecutors and agreed to pay restitution to ashland 
the restitution settlement announced in court by ashland 
attorney john c elam calls for atkins to forgo more than 2 
million in consulting fees and pension benefits and repay 250000 
haight sentenced atkins to two years probation and 600 hours of 
community service the judge imposed no additional fine citing 
atkins diminished finances 
atkins 66 of north palm beach fla pleaded guilty in 
september 1989 to conspiracy and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate 
with the government 
he had faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 
500000 fine 
atkins admitted that after he resigned as chairman in 1981 but 
remained as a paid ashland consultant he obtained confidential 
documents involving the companys decision not to pay the national 
iranian oil co for 283 million in crude oil purchased in 1979 
the company said it withheld payment because of a trade ban on 
iran that the united states imposed following the taking of 
american hostages at the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 
atkins and others involved in the scheme offered to sell the 
documents to the iranian company for use in a possible lawsuit 
against ashland over its nonpayment 
the documents were offered at various times for 20 million or a 
25 percent contingency fee 
while the iranians never bought the documents they later sued 
ashland and last year obtained a 325 million settlement which 
with interest was worth more than 500 million 
in a statement to the court before sentencing atkins described 
the embarrassment and anguish his acts caused his family and 
friends 
i have no excuses for my actions other than i think anger or 
some resentment obviously shortcircuited my brain atkins said 
his attorney james moss asked haight to impose only probation 
saying atkins had been punished enough moss said the restitution 
agreement with ashland had left his client in almost financial 
destitution 
the judge said he believed atkins role in the scheme was an 
isolated occurrence 
this act of venal criminality was aberrational haight said 
it stands in stark contrast to everything else he had done said 
or attempted to do 
as part of his cooperation with prosecutors atkins testified 
earlier this year at the trial of an attorney charles barnett who 
was accused of participating in the scheme to sell the ashland 
documents to the iranian company 
barnett of palm beach fla was acquitted 
a third defendant oil broker roy furmark pleaded guilty to a 
role in the conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced in federal 
court on monday

bond investors association inc is offering some 
advice to junk bond mutual fund investors get out before its too 
late 
the nonprofit organization tracks bond defaults and predicts 
50 billion in junk bonds will go bad in 1991 and 1992 mutual 
funds that invested in the dismal junk bond market are holding many 
bonds they would happily sell if they could find buyers the miami 
lakes flabased association said 
because the funds have been forced to sell their liquid holdings 
as investors cash in shares the funds are left with 
defaultvulnerable and hardtosell issues said c richard lehman 
bia president 
that leads to a number of problems according to lehman 
including the possibility that the bond funds will default at a 
rate higher than the market as a whole 
on top of that the group says the bond funds daily net asset 
values or their net worth are routinely overstated if the bond 
funds could actually sell their unwanted securities the bonds 
market prices would likely plummet bringing down the net asset 
value bia said 
a fund holder who is selling his shares is being overpaid 
relative to the realizable value of the portfolio bia said in 
the december edition of the defaulted bonds newsletter 
the only benefit fund holders still have is the ability to 
liquidate their holdings even while their fund cannot the 
association said 
bia did not mention particular mutual funds 
we decided not to try to finger the specific candidates 
although we could lehman said 
junk bond fund managers were not willing to talk about the 
report 
a spokeswoman for the investment company institute betty hart 
said investors frequently hedge their risk by diversifying 
investments 
there are a number of different types of mutual funds with 
varying objectives and generally speaking for any fund that is 
highly aggressive whether it be equities or bonds good financial 
planning principles suggest people have more than one investment 
ms hart said 
bia also takes the bond funds to task for their accounting 
methods the group wants the securities and exchange commission to 
force the funds to set aside some of the interest income to cover 
losses expect from defaults 
this is not unlike a business concern that sells its products 
on credit to high risk customers without booking a provision for 
uncollectible accounts receivable the newsletter said 
there is good news though 
if the junk bond market is going to recover the gains could be 
huge 
bia suggests investors who want to stay in junk bonds should 
sell their current fund holding and buy into a newly established 
fund or one with assets of less than 100 million 
bia says go ahead and pay the typical 5 percent frontend load 
a new fund should outperform an existing fund by many times 
this cost the newsletter said 
the junk funds have been feeling heat lately 
the collapse of the market has sent prices reeling and their 
corresponding yields soaring 
the securities and exchange commission in october asked the 
funds to make it clear to potential investors that high yield means 
high risk 
the bonds prices have been beaten down as the market has become 
more worrisome that a recession will make it hard if not 
impossible for some issuers to make interest and principal 
payments

wheat and corn futures prices closed higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade after president bush said he 
would consider waiving us export restrictions and grant food 
export credits to the soviet union 
soybean futures ended mixed as profittaking erased gains that 
were posted immediately after bushs remarks 
the soviets have been seeking export credits to enable them to 
buy us grain including about 12 million metric tons of wheat 
and 600000 metric tons of corn they are obligated to purchase by 
years end under a longterm grain agreement 
the bush administration has maintained it cannot grant export 
credits without violating a 1974 law that denies the soviets 
coveted mostfavorednation trade status because of their 
restrictions on emigration 
but bush told a news conference friday that he may have clearer 
authority to waive the trade restrictions than he had thought and 
that he would consider doing so 
a lot of the trade now is assuming its a done deal said 
dan cekander a grain analyst with the chicago trading company 
rodman amp renshaw inc 
at the close wheat futures were cent lower to 6 cents higher

to the persian gulf crisis 
contracts for light sweet crude fell more than 1 per barrel in 
a span of several minutes while bush was on television giving his 
assessment of the crisis his remarks followed a vote late thursday 
in which the un security council authorized the use of force to 
push iraqi troops out of oilrich kuwait if iraqi president saddam 
hussein does not withdraw them by jan 15

bush said he would invite iraqis foreign minister tariq aziz 
to come to washington in december to discuss the situation bush

state james a baker iii to baghdad the iraqi capital 
the reaction is very much to his inviting tariq aziz to 
washington and baker to baghdad said annlouise hittle a senior 
oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
the market had moved up earlier in the week in anticipation of 
the un resolution so bushs comments indicating that he would 
send troops into combat if necessary did not move the market the 
president said he would accept nothing less than a complete 
withdrawal of iraqi troops and freedom for hostages held by saddam 
this has been a war premium market hittle said we rose 
on expectation of the un resolution being passed with his 
comment today were losing that war premium and backing off 
as oil plummeted prices for refined petroleum products also

the nations economy has entered an major slump 
our economy as i said the other day is at best in a serious 
slowdown and if uncertainty remains in the energy markets the 
slowdown will get worse he said

morning that also indicated a looming recession the commerce 
department said its index of leading economic indicators fell 12 
percent in october on top of three previous monthly declines 
including july when the index was first reported to have been 
flat

a federal judge said friday he will approve a 
plan to liquidate the assets of charles keating jrs american 
continental corp the former parent company of lincoln savings and 
loan 
under the plan american continentals assets would be 
liquidated over three years to provide partial payment to the 
companys 25000 creditors who are owed 365 million 
more than 9200 creditors participated in a recent vote on the 
proposal and 95 percent approved it said donald gaffney an 
attorney for unsecured creditors he said the plan also was 
accepted by all classes of creditors 
the plan was opposed by keating and some of his former top 
executives who invested in the companys securities they said it 
would push them to the end of the creditors line and make it 
unlikely they would receive any money 
but no one spoke against the plan when gaffney outlined it to 
district judge richard bilby the judge said he would approve the 
plan but didnt specify when 
youve accomplished the impossible bilby told lawyers in 
the case its like almost any settlement ive known there aint 
much in it for anybody 
lincoln savings based in irvine calif was seized by federal 
regulators in april 1989 just one day after american continental 
and 11 lincoln savings subsidiaries filed for protection under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
federal officials have said lincolns failure could cost 
taxpayers 2 billion 
the case has become symbolic of the national sampl debacle 
keating and other lincoln executives are the subject of a 
classaction lawsuit alleging they misled investors about the 
safety of junk bonds issued by american continental nearly 18000 
investors lost 250 million authorities allege 
in addition the senate ethics committee is holding hearings on 
whether five senators dennis deconcini dariz alan cranston 
dcalif john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and donald w 
riegle jr dmich improperly intervened with federal regulators 
on keatings behalf because of the 13 million he and associates 
contributed to their campaigns and favorite causes 
unsecured creditors of american continental can expect to 
receive their first payments by the end of january said gaffney 
who represents the unsecured creditors committee 
some 22000 unsecured creditors hold american continental bonds 
gaffney said the bondholders first checks probably will amount 
to pennies on the dollar on their investment 
the timing and amount of later checks would depend on 
liquidation of american continental assets now valued at 9 
million and outcome of suits filed by creditors against keating 
keating associates and legal and accounting firms which advised 
american continental 
a proposal approved by bilby nov 16 to allow the lincoln 
savings subsidiaries to pay their creditors would go into effect 
with the liquidation plan the subsidiaries creditors will receive 
virtually all the 120 million they are owed 
under the liquidation proposal thomas arnold jr a phoenix 
consultant who was appointed by bilby to head american continental 
and three other members of a steering committee would wind down the 
companys operations over a threeyear period 
the plan is a compromise between the creditors and the federal 
resolution trust corp the agency set up to handle the nations 
sampl bailout it includes an agreement by the rtc to pay 21 million 
into american continentals bankruptcy estate in exchange for being 
allowed to become a party in civil lawsuits filed by bondholders 
against keating and his associates

top officials from both the bush 
administration and wall street declared friday that major surgery 
is needed to treat the ills of the nations banking and financial 
system 
and they stepped up their calls for action by congress to deal 
with financial problems they say go beyond the current slump in the 
economy and the savings and loan crisis 
the legal and regulatory structure of our financial system is 
outmoded burdensome and inefficient said treasury secretary 
nicholas brady addressing the annual convention of the securities 
industry association wall streets main trade group fundamental 
reforms are needed 
the issue is not whether we should reform the financial 
system asserted richard breeden chairman of the securities and 
exchange commission the question is how 
we need to have a financial summit said gedale horowitz 
senior executive director of salomon brothers inc who took over 
friday as chairman of the sia for 1991 
their statements came a day after president bush indicated his 
support for a drive to rewrite the rules under which american 
banks investment firms and other financial businesses operate 
the treasury is working on a detailed proposal due out in 
january for changes in the financial laws bush said thursday he 
would take a leadership role in bringing the matter before 
congress 
among the prime subjects being examined is reform of the federal 
deposit insurance system which has been cited by many observers as 
a key factor in the sampl crisis 
brady also spoke friday of giving close scrutiny to decadesold 
rules that set barriers between banks and brokerage firms and that 
restrict interstate activities by banks 
prospects for early action on any of these ideas by congress 
remain hazy especially given the apparent onset of a recession and 
uncertainties raised by the showdown in the persian gulf 
but proponents of prompt action on financial reform say economic 
woes and competition from financial institutions based in other 
countries among other things are only likely to worsen the 
situation as time passes 
if we dont bring about this change in 1991 then when 
horowitz said 
every day we read about layoffs in securities firms another 
troubled bank a higher estimate of the cost of the savings and 
loan bailout every day without financial systems reform costs 
american taxpayers more money
