czechoslovakias new ambassador to the united 
states has an early form of leukemia and is trying to decide 
whether to remain in this country or return to her own the 
washington post said in its wednesday editions 
its not that we dont have good doctors at home ambassador 
rita klimova told the newspaper but we dont have the ability to 
protect patients from infection that requires a high degree of 
sophistication in the hospitals 
the ambassador who assumed her diplomatic post five months ago 
said her government will pay her medical bills but she is 
concerned about the finances and does not want to run up a big tab 
she said her decision on whether to stay in the united states 
will depend on finding treatment that fits in with someones 
research plans 
ms klimova became ill in may but the leukemia diagnosis is 
recent the newspaper said 
leukemia is a form of cancer of the bloodcell forming system 
though the disease once was considered invariably fatal treatment 
has improved dramatically in recent decades and years and complete 
remissions may be obtained for some types

imagine you paid a company to move your 
belongings from california to new york in kansas the truck breaks 
down you end up paying someone else to haul your stuff the rest of 
the way but it takes another couple of years 
to add insult to injury the first mover goes to court to 
forestall any attempt to get your money back 
farfetched well thats about what is happening in the nervous 
competitive megabucks business of launching satellites for profit 
and the moving company in this case the giant martin marietta 
corp claims it may have to get out of the commercial launching 
business if it loses in court 
martin marietta is one of only three major american companies in 
that infant of private enterprise and the only one lifting the 
heaviest satellites should martin mariettas prediction come true 
the european consortium arianespace the chinese the soviets and 
someday the japanese all will be waiting rockets at the ready 
here is what happened 
for 1115 million martin marietta agreed to launch a satellite 
for intelsat the international communications consortium the 
satellite valued at 157 million lifted off from cape canaveral 
fla on march 14 aboard martin mariettas titan 3 rocket 
once in orbit the satellite and the spent titan were to 
separate and a much smaller booster attached to the intelsat 6 was 
to take it on the next 22000 miles of its journey to its work 
station but martin marietta had miswired the rocket the 
separation didnt take place and the satellite was trapped in a 
useless orbit 
engineers were finally able to split the two and intelsat 6 is 
awaiting a 1992 visit by nasa astronauts who will attach a new 
booster rocket and send the satellite on its way this will cost 
intelsat another 90 million 
according to a suit filed by bethesda mdbased martin marietta 
in federal court in baltimore intelsat demanded damages martin 
marietta called that unlawfully coercive demands 
the launch firm said its contract called only for a replacement 
launch at an undisclosed price in the event the titan 3 mission 
fails for any reason intelsat could have bought insurance but 
didnt 
i dont want to call it a preemptive strike said martin 
marietta corporate spokesman elliott h miller we did this 
because it became clear they were going to file a civil damage 
suit we are asking the court to essentially declare that the 
provisions of our contract are enforceable 
a question at the heart of the suit filed by martin marietta is 
what constitutes a launch miller says that under terms of the 
contract with intelsat when the engines are fired that 
constituted a launch 
intelsat has until sept 4 to file an answer a spokesman tony 
trujillo said the dispute is unfortunate because we dont have 
an ax to grind he would not comment on the suit 
in its complaint martin marietta said that if it is forced to 
pay damages on the failed launch it may have to raise prices to an 
uncompetitive level or terminate its commercial launch business 
to date martin marietta has sold only four launches on the 
titan 3 and its competitors say privately that the company might be 
getting out of the commercial launch business anyway it has plenty 
of military customers 
its been a very competitive business said spokesman 
miller one of the differences in competition has been the entry 
of foreign really governmentowned and supported competitors 
such as china and now the soviet union 
to put that competition on a level playing field president bush 
this week is expected to sign a new space policy setting forth 
conditions under which other countries can enter us launch 
markets 
the president also is expected to sign an agreement under which 
a subsidiary of united technologies corp will be allowed to help 
build a launch facility in australia that might someday be used by 
the soviets 
such technical assistance requires an export license and that 
has led to erroneous reports that the united states will be 
agreeing to send up americanbuilt satellites on soviet rockets 
the real competition in launching heavyweight satellites is 
between ourselves and general dynamics said douglas heydon 
president of arianespaces american subsidiary general dynamics 
markets the atlas 
spokesman trujillo said intelsat would have no hesitancy in 
purchasing launches from china or the soviet union a diversity 
of suppliers is a situation we like to encourage he said 
intelsat is a cooperative of 119 nations including china the 
soviets are not members but they use intelsats services

it cant be easy being jeff sagansky these 
days 
six months on the job in charge of entertainment for the 
bottomrated tv network and everyone looking to you for a failsafe 
way to rocket out of last place 
so there he stood before the nations tv critics at their annual 
press tour this past weekend proudly hyping cbs new fall shows 
the reporters wanted to talk about sex 
and morality and questionable dialogue uttered by children 
during peak primetime family viewing hours 
specifically the reporters wanted to know why a 6yearold girl 
will be delivering lines such as you suck at 8 pm on mondays 
the show in question is uncle buck a fall tv spinoff of the 
john candy film in the pilot the blond cherubic child star also 
explains the crankiness of a female family member by saying shes 
ovulating 
some of the reporters at the century plaza hotel news conference 
sunday appeared righteously indignant 
how can you say mr sagansky that the networks are more 
sensitive now when you do have programs like uncle buck coming on 
the air demanded one critic 
looking a bit uneasy sagansky replied ill tell you 
something believe it or not kids say that in homes all over 
america and i dont think we can go and put on shows which have no 
relationship to reality 
besides sagansky added the child is immediately reprimanded 
for such talk and future episodes do not consistently contain that 
kind of dialogue 
the reporters were unappeased and the 37yearold 
harvardeducated programming executive spent much of the 45minute 
press conference defending his networks standards 
or lack thereof as some critics grumbled 
although a lot of time was spent dissecting the social value of 
uncle buck many questions also concerned saganskys strategy 
for boosting ratings 
sagansky admitted his work is cut out for him part of his game 
plan for enhancing cbs schedule has focused on wooing top writers 
and producers 
that included giving carte blanche to linda bloodworththomason 
and harry thomason creators of the networks hit designing 
women 
what the thomasons came up with was evening shade a comedy 
about life in a small arkansas town that debuts with a onehour 
pilot on sept 21 
starring burt reynolds evening shade was one of three shows 
that sagansky touted as having the fall schedules most unique 
voice 
the others were wiou a drama about a tv news operation in 
chicago and lenny a bluecollar situation comedy starring 
standup comic lenny clarke a former boston janitor 
sagansky also was asked about the wisdom of putting the 
flash a new fantasy action thriller about a man who moves so 
fast his feet nearly catch fire on thursdays at 8 pm 
the time period has been dominated for years by nbcs toprated 
the cosby show and fox broadcasting co recently announced a 
gutsy decision to move the phenomenally successful simpsons 
family to the same halfhour slot 
i knew that we had a great idea when we went in thursday at 
8 sagansky said unfortunately we werent the only ones who 
had that idea 
fox has admitted that if the simpsons bomb in their new time 
period they will probably be sent back to sunday nights sagansky 
said 
so i dont want to run away from them particularly if theyre 
not going to be there 
on the subject of the streetsmart alternative network sagansky 
was asked if fox could ever beat one of the big three in the 
overall nielsen ratings 
not during my watch sagansky replied absolutely not 
another crucial aspect of saganskys vision he said is to lure 
younger viewers to cbs 
when we talk about younger viewers for cbs were talking 
about people you know less than 60 he told reporters who 
erupted in laughter 
look for cbs im a younger viewer

here is a look at how a 100 billion spending 
cut would be triggered by the grammrudman law and what it would 
mean 
how it works 
the white houses office of management and budget estimated 
monday that the fiscal 1991 deficit will hit 1688 billion or 
2314 billion if the savings and loan bailout is counted between 
now and oct 1 the start of the new fiscal year omb will 
monitor any new laws that affect spending or government revenue 
collections and take them into account if the projected deficit 
exceeds 74 billion on oct 1 10 billion above the target 
spending is cut temporarily by whatever amount is needed to reduce 
the shortfall to 64 billion the cuts take effect permanently on 
oct 15 
savings and loan rescue spending is included in the deficit 
calculations under current law but many in congress and the bush 
administration want to exclude those costs 
distribution of cuts 
50 percent to defense 50 percent to domestic programs but 
portions are exempt in full or in part 
defense about onethird of the 300 billion defense budget is 
exempt from grammrudman cuts because it has already been committed 
to longterm contracts of the remaining amount the law allows the 
president to exempt personnel costs such as salaries 
he chose not to exempt personnel last year if he made the same 
choice this time according to omb this could mean dismissal of 
about 1 million troops about half of the activeduty force 
layoffs or dismissals of up to half the militarys 11 million 
civilian employees and a cut in weapon acquisition programs such 
as reducing the request for major new naval ships from 15 to 11 
if personnel costs were exempted remaining programs would be 
slashed by 413 percent this would mean that the amount of flight 
time for aircraft and steaming time for ships would be cut by half 
and about 80 percent of the militarys civilian workers could lose 
their jobs 
domestic completely exempt from cuts are interest on the 
national debt social security and several federal retirement and 
disability programs several lowincome programs including food 
stamps medicaid and child nutrition aid and many veterans 
programs 
several other programs can be cut only partially cuts in 
medicare and some health programs for veterans and migrants are 
limited to 2 percent reductions there are also special rules for 
support payments to farmers and for guaranteed student loans 
spending on those programs subject to the full brunt of the cuts 
would be reduced by 384 percent according to omb that could mean 
a oneyear delay in hazardous waste cleanups at energy department 
sites elimination of vaccines for polio measles and other 
diseases for 1 million children a 20 percent cut for fbi 
investigations into organized crime and prevention of government 
plans to upgrade airline security overseas 
duration of cuts 
by law they remain in effect for the entire fiscal year once 
oct 15 passes but permanent grammrudman cuts have been 
rolled back before most recently just last fall

the bush administration is threatening a veto 
of the 1990 farm bill if the crop support programs in the version 
expected to be debated this week in the senate reaches the white 
house 
the announcement came in a letter monday to the senate from 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who said the programs were 
too costly at a time when the government is trying to cut the 
budget deficit 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the agriculture 
committee immediately criticized the letter as an eleventhhour 
threat aimed at killing the fiveyear bill as part of an 
international trade negotiating strategy being pursued by president 
bush and yeutter 
senate leaders have said they would try to begin debate on the 
bill by wednesday 
leahys committee has estimated that the commodity programs in 
the bill would cost 55 billion over five years but yeutter said 
its spending requirements amount to 59 billion 
this compares with an estimated 794 billion spent over the 
last five years under the 1985 law that expires this year 
the veto threat follows efforts by bush at the sevennation 
economic summit in houston last week to get the europeans to reduce 
subsidies on farm products that the united states considers 
distorting to the international marketplace 
a fiveyear farm bill could be viewed as limiting the promises 
negotiators could make to the other countries about us policy 
but members of the senate and house agriculture committees have 
said they would make necessary adjustments based on the outcome of 
the ongoing talks over the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
in geneva switzerland 
the administration has indicated support for a oneyear 
extension of the current farm law senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas said on friday he would offer such legislation if 
the spending in the bill going to the floor is not reduced 
the administrations veto threat is a thinly veiled effort to 
kill the farm bill so the administration can cut a backroom deal 
in geneva out of sight of the american farmer said leahy 
yeutter didnt mention the trade talks in his letter he dwelled 
instead on the budget implications of the senates farm bill 
criticizing every subsidy program in the legislation 
from a budget standpoint the cost of the bill is excessive 
he said 
yeutter said that if the bill is sent to the president before 
budget talks with congress are completed and without substantial 
savings and a change in the price and income support programs 
the secretary of agriculture and the presidents other senior 
advisers would recommend that he bush veto the bill 
the government subsidizes farmers who produce wheat corn rice 
cotton soybeans sugar dairy products wool and mohair honey and 
peanuts either by direct payment or manipulation of the marketplace 
leahy said the administration had cooked up new numbers in 
estimating the bills impact on the budget 
the reality is that the senate farm bill is over 6 billion 
less than what the president proposed in january for current 
services he said

whether marie antoinette ever really said let 
them eat cake remains in doubt but 17 pastry chefs have created 
in wondrous constructions of chocolate and marzipan the cake she 
might have had in mind 
cakes that no peasant in prerevolutionary france likely ever 
got to taste surrounded a lifesize ice sculpture of a guillotine 
and two cannons at the plaza hotel on monday 
pastry chef martin howard of the hudson river club in new york 
designed three necklaces of chocolate jewels spilling out of 
chocolate jewel boxes pascal scirrotto of restaurant dejavu in 
philadelphia made a croquembouche a towering traditional wedding 
cake then and now in france 
there even was a cake of three kinds of caviar cream cheeses 
and scotch salmon from bruce sobol of caviarteria in new york 
the fifth annual bastille day celebration though two days late 
ended with the selection of three of the chefs as the us team for 
the international world cup pastry competition next january in 
lyon france 
one of them mary cech from jackson at montgomery in san 
francisco prepared a fanciful tea party in chocolate with a 
teapot of chocolate elaborate place mats and lace napkins of white 
chocolate and a cake of chocolate and strawberry 
i went for a theme that was light and frilly cech said as 
she handed out tastes of her cake for judges and guests 
the two other chefs going to france are gil renusson executive 
pastry chef at the amway grand plaza in grand rapids mich and 
pastry chef eric bedoucha of the restaurant adrienne at the 
peninsula hotel in new york 
in a second competition celebrity judges were given sheets to 
score their favorites some of the judges attracted as much 
attention as the cakes a crowd pressed around judge ivana trump 
the estranged wife of donald trump wherever she stopped other 
judges included designer mary mcfadden and robin leach of 
lifestyles of the rich and famous 
perhaps the plainest jane cake was a chocolate sheet cake 
presented by pastry chef chad gilchrist of the plaza hotel 
he had made a 2foothigh replica of versailles with marie 
antoinette throwing cake to a crowd 
but earlier in the day a door hit gilchrist and the cake went 
flying 
it was destroyed 
it was most disappointing he said two days of work ended 
on a sour note

while most of europe is on the 
threshold of unification yugoslavias deeply divided states cannot 
agree on how to remain together the troubled balkan country is on 
the brink of disintegration 
some politicians maintain that yugoslavia has already falle 
apart 
yugoslavia no longer exists said dimitrij rupel foreign 
minister of slovenia the republic leading the rebellion against 
yugoslavia as the world has known it for the last 70 years 
the country was formed as a joint kingdom of serbs croats and 
slovenes in the aftermath of world war i 
after being occupied and dismembered by the germans in 1941 it 
reemerged as a communiststyle federation of six peoples 
republics with macedonia montenegro and bosniahercegovina added 
to the three prewar states under yugoslavias communist founder 
josip broz tito 
during the cold war titos nationalist politics were useful to 
the west which provided significant financial and other support to 
nonaligned yugoslavia as a check on soviet influence in the 
sensitive balkans 
this in turn helped tito impose unity and the rule of a 
communist party that ostensibly rose above yugoslavias traditional 
ethnic rivalries 
but traditional ethnic and regional rivalries began to bubble 
after titos death in 1980 and the message of greater democracy 
and human rights that spurred last years revolutions in eastern 
europe also worked against the oldstyle centralized rule from 
belgrade 
on july 2 slovenia proclaimed its full sovereignty 
establishing an independent legal system and asserting the right to 
control all armed forces stationed on its territory 
on the same day ethnic albanian deputies of the volatile 
southern province of kosovo announced plans to secede from serbia 
the largest of yugoslavias six republics 
croatia the secondlargest republic has already demanded 
radical reshaping of the federal system bequeathed by tito 
president franjo tudjmans centerright party won a landslide 
victory in the republics free elections this spring 
slovenias freely elected president milan kucan said this 
month that his republic will secede either alone or with croatia 
if the country does not swiftly become a loose confederation of 
fully independent states 
the only thing that could keep us together is constant and 
brutal repression rupel said an apparent reference to repeated 
warnings by the communistrun armed forces that the battle for 
yugoslavia will not be fought without the military 
in contrast the communist leaders of serbia want a federal 
system with a strong central authority and they oppose free 
elections 
slobodan milosevic serbias president has effectively ruled 
out confederation he has said serbia would agree only if its 
present borders are revised to include the estimated 2 million 
serbs in croatia and the central region of bosniahercegovina 
retaining kosovo an ancient serbian heartland now dominated by 
ethnic albanians and the assertion of serbian nationalism appear 
to take precedence over ties with slovenia and traditional rival 
croatia 
many yugoslavs fear that milosevics demands which brought him 
wide popularity among the serbs could trigger ethnic violence 
rupel described milosevics aspirations as lunatic 
behind the ethnic divisions lurk other clashes over introducing 
democacy and integrating yugoslavia with western europe 
slovenia and croatia want to join the integration processes 
going on throughout europe in july their officials held 
exploratory talks with the european community on eventually joining 
the grouping 
the ec and the united states however view yugoslavia as a 
single country and would like it to remain that way 
it is difficult to see how the yugoslavs can reconcile their 
deep differences to meet western demands for unity and for an 
improved human rights record 
amnesty international and the european parliament repeatedly 
have condemned what they see as gross human rights violations by 
serbia against kosovos ethnic albanians 
at least 60 kosovo albanians who demand full autonomy and free 
elections have died in clashes with serbian security forces since 
march 1989 when serbia virtually abolished the regions 
selfgovernment thousands have spent time in jail and serbia has 
muzzled ethnic albanian media 
for many yugoslavs federal premier ante markovic remains the 
only integrating factor among the feuding republics 
markovic won widespread admiration for a remarkably swift 
economic turnaround and his marketoriented programs have received 
wide support from western governments and financial institutions 
but optimism only a month ago that markovic could translate his 
economic success into political clout and use it to form a new 
party has evaporated in the face of slovenias declaration of 
sovereignty and serbias reaction 
even yugoslavias collective presidency nominally in charge of 
the country seems unwilling or unable to stop the disintegration 
borisav jovic the serb now heading the countrys collective 
presidency has suggested a referendum to determine whether 
individual nationalities want to remain united in one country

forty miles and a halfcentury away from 
italy citizens of this albanian coastal city dream about a life 
without communism 
we all dream of italy sighed a waiter at a governmentrun 
restaurant 
residents interviewed monday by a reporter on a oneday ferry 
trip from italy all expressed a desire to go abroad 
some appeared to want to live better others longed to escape 
the grip of europes last hardline communist government 
their quick whispered comments suggested that the discontent 
that drove thousands of albanians to seek refuge this month in 
embassies in the capital city of tirana is no isolated phenomemon 
in this tiny balkan nation 
theres nothing in this country to live for a young 
economist said angrily 
like the others interviewed he spoke on condition of anonymity 
albanians can receive harsh punishments for contacts with 
foreigners 
vlore 60 miles southwest of tirana and just 40 miles across the 
adriatic sea from italy provides a glimpse of life in europes 
poorest and most isolated country 
most of the 70000 residents live in fivestory apartment 
buildings lined up like matchboxes laundry flaps from the 
balconies in the rocky white dirt lots around the buildings thin 
children in patched clothes and rubber thongs play in a baking sun 
asked whether residents had problems getting enough food a 
mechanic looked around to see if anyone was listening then nodded 
a silence hangs over the city because of an absence of cars 
which individuals are not allowed to own on the broad palmlined 
road to the vlore port horses and wagons rattle past bicyclists 
but nearly every building has a television antenna allowing 
residents to watch italian television 
several residents spotting a group of italian tourists on 
monday called out the names of italian soccer players a few 
debated the merits of italian pop stars 
one student a member of the roman catholic minority said he 
liked to watch pope john paul ii on italian television until 
recently religious observances were banned in albania 
when i see him i cry he said 
it was through italian tv that many albanians learned about the 
revolutions in eastern europe last year as well as the boatlift 
that carried about 4500 albanian asylumseekers to italy and 
france last week many had spent more than a week packed into 
embassies in the capital before the government decided to let them 
leave under the supervision of foreign diplomats 
those interviewed monday spoke of widespread discontent in the 
country of 3 million people but they said they did not expect a 
revolution like the ones that overtook other eastern european 
countries 
there are so many simple people here said the economist 
a university student said that most people would be content once 
the communist government carried out the limited reforms it has 
announced since spring they include giving everyone over 16 the 
right to a passport and foreign travel albanians have not had such 
a privilege for 45 years 
limited reform seemed unlikely however to appease a group of 
factory workers standing outside their plant 
asked about living conditions they laughed bitterly and one 
uttered an expletive then they asked about the possibility of jobs 
in italy 
most of those interviewed spoke quietly and looked around 
nervously showing the widespread fear of the powerful sigurimi 
secret police 
at one point a van of police pulled up at the governmentrun 
restaurant all but one of a group of youths talking to a western 
reporter shrank away 
i havent done anything wrong declared the youth as police 
glared at him 
a moment later several officers approached and ordered him off 
he slunk down the road to a tree from which he watched the 
foreigners and apparently continued to ponder life across the sea

a pair of neighbors feared they would be 
taking a bath on bills for more than 140000 gallons of water but 
the local water company says it wasnt trying to soak them 
the lemont water co billed eugene emerick for 79000 gallons of 
water during the second quarter of 1989 for john paul devereaux 
it was a 64000gallon question 
i was wondering what i did with all that water emerick 
said i think id have to bathe three times a day and drink water 
all day to use that much 
when devereaux got his bill the first thing i did was go 
downstairs and look at the cellar to see if it was flooded 
devereaux said his normal water bill totaled 17 per quarter 
the inaccurate bill he received this month was for 7015 
emerick said his bill was 80 before the mistake was caught his 
real bill totaled 1754 
cindy rose a spokeswoman for the 2000customer water company 
said computer errors were responsible 
there were too many zeroes on there rose said 
what made the bills even harder to understand was that centre 
county had 1242 inches of rain during the apriljune period 
covered by the bill 98 percent above normal 
devereaux did win three swimming events at the centre county 
senior games this summer but he said he didnt have a pool to 
account for his big bill 
with this rain we havent even watered the garden he said

an annual market survey by the agriculture 
department shows the rate of farmland sales through financial 
failure declined last year 
nationally voluntary and estate sales accounted for 70 percent 
of the farmland transfers in the latter part of 1989 compared with 
66 percent in the same period of 1988 
sales or transfers among family members accounted for 16 percent 
of the land transactions about the same as the preceding year the 
departments economic research service said 
another 11 percent represented foreclosure bankruptcy and 
condemnation sales and transfers against 15 percent in 1988 
while 3 percent fell into the other sales and transfers category 
the same as in 1988 the report said 
officials said the survey included information on nearly 6600 
farmland sales involving more than 2 million acres 
the research agencys annual farmland market survey was 
described in a new agricultural resources outlook report 
elaborating on figures announced in april that showed us farmland 
prices rose 4 percent in 1989 
a further gain of between 3 percent and 4 percent is forecast 
for 1990 based upon the current economic outlook 
the report said other farmers continue to buy most of the land 
sold during the year accounting for 59 percent of the purchases 
last year compared with 57 percent in 1988 
tenants made 12 percent of the purchases compared with 11 
percent the previous year nonfarmers accounted for 27 percent 
down from 29 percent in 1988 and retired farmers 2 percent 
unchanged 
shares among buyer groups have been fairly stable over the 
past several years the report said ten years ago 
owneroperators were involved in 50 percent of the reported 
purchases with tenants 15 percent retired farmers 2 percent 
and nonfarmers 33 percent accounting for the rest 
the report also noted that nearly 41 percent of all us 
farmland operated in 1989 was rented according to another survey 
on farm costs and returns 
leasing was most widespread in the corn belt northern plains 
southern plains and mississippi delta states where 50 to 55 
percent of all land operated was leased the report said in 
other regions the proportion of leasing ranged from 28 percent in 
the southeast to 35 percent in the mountain region 
tenants most often leased land on a cashrent basis accounting 
for 66 percent of all rented land last year thirty percent was 
rented for shares of production and 4 percent was rentfree

the structure and volume of japans 
agricultural trade has changed substantially over the long haul 
despite a popular perception of inflexibility according to an 
agriculture department analyst 
rapidly changing economies in then soviet union and eastern 
europe have dominated the worlds attention says william coyle of 
usdas economic research service 
japan by contrast often appears reluctant to change because 
of persistent and large trade surpluses an inhospitable attitude 
about foreign investment and imports and a political system 
dominated for 35 years by one party he said 
but changes do occur in japan but they sometimes go unnoticed 
because they are slow and incremental 
bulk commodities such as grain soybeans cotton and tobacco 
still make up most of japans agricultural imports but coyle said 
valueadded products are accounting for a growing share 
tariff reductions deregulation of foreign cigarette imports and 
more beef and citrus since 1985 helped push japans valueadded 
imports to 12 billion in 1988 up 20 percent from 1970 
in 1988 when japans agricultural imports were valued at 272 
billion bulk commodities made up 554 percent of the total in 
1970 when they were worth 42 billion grains and other bulk 
items accounted for 798 percent 
coyle writing in a new outlook report on world agriculture 
said the changes have meant more meat less imported grain more 
cigarettes less leaf tobacco more finished textile products less 
raw fibers and more pasta and less wheat

at a rally in his honor nelson 
mandela received a souvenir from the past a framed copy of an 
arrest warrant issued for him in 1962 by the portuguese colonial 
rulers of mozambique 
amid much laughter from the crowd president joaquim chissano 
presented the memento to mandela on monday the south african black 
nationalist leader is on the last stop of a 14nation tour of 
africa europe and north america 
the warrant described mandela as a black agitator in south 
africa last seen wearing a long beard and a chauffeurs uniform 
with a peaked cap the national news agency aim reported 
the warrant said mandela the underground leader of a newly 
organized guerrilla campaign at the time could be on his way to 
mozambique south africas eastern neighbor 
mandela was captured by south african authorities in 1962 and 
sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow 
the whiteled government he was released in february 
mozambique gained independence from portugal in 1975 and has 
been governed for the last 15 years by the leftist frelimo party 
which supports mandelas african national congress the anc is the 
leading black opposition group in south africa and the guerrilla 
movement is an arm of the group 
the struggle of the anc is our struggle said chissano who 
described mandela as a man of peace 
mandela said he would seek to end the violence in south africa 
anc supporters have been locked in a power struggle with 
inkatha a relatively conservative zulu organization four years of 
factional fighting in the eastern province of natal has claimed 
more than 4000 lives 
also rightwing whites have claimed responsibility for a recent 
series of bomb attacks aimed at blacks and whites who oppose 
apartheid 
the violence threatens efforts by south african president fw 
de klerk to end white domination and negotiate a new constitution 
that would give political rights to the countrys 30 million black 
majority 
mandela is to return to south africa on wednesday his 72nd 
birthday and is expected to meet de klerk soon afterward 
mandelas tour has raised millions of dollars for the anc which 
is trying to establish itself as a major force inside south africa 
after being banned from 1960 until february 
he also has helped convince foreign leaders to maintain economic 
sanctions against south africa despite de klerks reforms 
mozambique has been devastated by a 13yearold civil war 
pitting the government and against guerrillas who have been accused 
of widespread atrocities the south african government openly 
supported the mozambican guerrillas until the nations signed a 
peace pact in 1984 
the war has left mozambique one of the worlds poorest nations 
annual per capita income is about 200 and almost half of the 
countrys 15 million people require some level of food assistance

the senate is deciding whether to force a vote 
on civil rights legislation with critics still warning that it 
would inevitably lead to racial and ethnic hiring quotas 
bargaining among the white house bill sponsors and conservative 
senators stretched into the early evening monday but failed to 
produce an agreement on the embattled civil rights bill 
provisions of the measure range from a ban on racial harassment 
in the workplace to punitive damages for victims of discrimination 
the most controversy has surrounded a provision that would 
require employers to end practices shown to be statistically 
discriminatory or prove in court that they were justified by 
business necessity 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said talks over the 
last three weeks have produced many areas of common ground 
between the administration and the bills proponents here in 
congress 
but this common ground is shaky ground and it will collapse 
if the bills proponents do not show some willingness to address 
in very meaningful ways some very legitimate concerns raised by 
the president and his advisers dole added 
he said he favored a civil rights bill but could not accept the 
version currently under debate 
meanwhile majority leader george mitchell dmaine laid the 
groundwork for a vote today on whether to limit debate to 30 hours 
it would take 60 votes to succeed in such a move 
sen edward m kennedy dmass and other sponsors have been 
holding off on trying to force a vote while negotiating with the 
administration 
it appeared friday that kennedy and the administration might be 
close to an agreement friday and the massachusetts senator said one 
was likely this week before leaving for his camp david retreat 
friday president bush said he was encouraged by the turn the talks 
had taken 
the bill is aimed at reversing five supreme court decisions last 
year that civil rights forces say represented a severe setback for 
their cause 
before last years decision in the case of wards cove vs 
antonio involving hiring at a salmon cannery in alaska it was up 
to the employer to prove in court that a practice shown to be 
discriminatory was a matter of business necessity and therefore 
justified 
the wards cove decision reversed that and said those filing 
discrimination suits must prove that the practices involved were 
not matters of business necessity 
kennedys bill would place the burden back on the employer but 
critics say it would make it even easier to win a job 
discrimination suit than before the wards cove decision they say 
employers would be guaranteed to turn to the use of quotas to 
protect themselves from such suits 
business groups also are upset over a provision of the bill that 
would allow courts to award punitive damages to victims of bias in 
the workplace 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan on monday introduced a proposed 
compromise that appeared likely to gain support from lawmakers 
holding out against the kennedy version but wanting to prove that 
they were not opponents of civil rights 
kassebaum said in a statement that her measure would reinstate 
the legal language in use before the wards cove decision she said 
that provision forms an appropriate balance between the concerns 
voiced on both sides avoiding quotas and excessive litigation 
versus ensuring equal opportunity in the workplace 
she said her measure was designed to restore our civil rights 
laws to the same strength and clarity that existed before a series 
of supreme court decisions last year 
those decisions have significantly increased the difficulty of 
proving discrimination and if they are allowed to stand they will 
weaken our civil rights laws she said 
she said the other goal of her bill was to maintain the 
balance first struck by the 1964 civil rights act and to preserve 
the basic philosophy of conciliation cooperation and equitable 
relief that are the foundation of all of our civil rights laws

the federal communications commission will 
examine information from 30 major market television and radio 
stations asked to show that they are offering political candidates 
the lowest possible advertising rates 
the fcc on monday began its firstever audits of broadcasters 
prompted by what an agency news release called an obligation to 
assure that broadcast stations are complying with political 
programming laws and rules especially in an election year 
the audits were not the result of any complaint said milton 
graves chief of the fccs political division 
this is just a part of overseeing how the stations are 
complying he said we want to know what their practices are 
the fcc sent field inspectors to stations in cincinnati 
dallasft worth philadelphia san francisco and portland ore in 
each city they visited four television stations an am radio 
station and an fm radio station 
these cities were selected because they are geographically 
diverse and also because in some instances the stations serve 
more than one state the fcc said 
inspectors asked the stations for political files for the 1990 
elections rate cards for political and commercial advertisers 
commercial invoices program logs and statements from the stations 
regarding pricing structures and methods of calculating lowest 
unit charges for political candidates 
they were given 20 days to send the fcc data on rates for 
nonpolitical advertisers but were asked to provide the political 
information immediately graves said 
he said auditors in the agencys washington office will 
examine all the information thats provided to us 
under fcc regulations the lowest unit charge is available to 
political candidates 45 days before primary balloting and six days 
before a general election candidates may purchase single broadcast 
advertisements for the same price as commercial advertisers who buy 
a number of spots in the same time period 
graves said most of the field auditors completed their work 
monday but that their jobs were just the beginning of the 
auditing process 
spokeswoman briana gowing said the action was an unusual one 
apparently the fcc has never before done anything like this 
before she said

a un relief agency has halted delivery 
of emergency food in northeastern uganda after unidentified gunmen 
ambushed its convoy and killed a driver 
lee tommi the world food program representative in uganda said 
the romebased organization would resume deliveries if the 
government provides armed escorts into the arid region where 
people are reported dying of starvation 
the situation is serious tommi said monday we talked to 
the authorities and elders in moroto and kotido who reported that 
at least 300 people have died of starvation in the past couple of 
weeks 
moroto and kotido are trading towns about 310 miles from 
ugandas capital kampala an estimated 220000 people are 
threatened with famine caused by drought tommi said 
he said a driver was killed and two people hired as truck 
loaders were injured in the july 7 ambush 
new vision newspaper described the gunmen as about 70 shabbily 
dressed bandits they stole the corn and burned two trucks a 
third truck escaped 
tommi said president yoweri musevenis government had not 
officially appealed for emergency food but that the world food 
program decided to deliver 5000 tons of corn the operation began 
in may and about 3000 tons of the grain have since been delivered 
he said 
this is a drop in the bucket he said it is hardly 
enough people are going without food for days 
in 1980 starvation caused by a severe drought killed thousands 
of people in the same region known as karamonja 
the region is also home to remnants of insurgencies that took up 
arms against museveni after he took power early 1986

fish oil sellers are under orders from the 
food and drug administration to stop claiming their capsules can 
help lower cholesterol and the chance of heart attacks 
fda spokesman bill grigg said the agency concluded after 
consulting with the national institutes of health that although 
some studies have suggested fish oil might be useful for 
cholesterol lowering there wasnt sufficient evidence for them 
to make these claims regarding the amount found in capsules 
the letters sent to 60 fish oil capsule makers monday are an 
extension of an earlier fda warning for them to stop claiming the 
capsules were good for arthritis and other disorders the companies 
agreed with that but argued that the cardiovascular benefits were 
wellenough established to justify the claim 
several studies in recent years have suggested that fish oils 
containing a component called omega3 such as those from mackerel 
and herring can lower blood pressure and cholesterol reduce 
damage from inflammatory processes such as arthritis and lower the 
chances of other problems such as diabetes and heart attacks 
grigg said the fda agrees that there are studies that show 
fish diets may be helpful 
we said its quite conceivable that further research might 
justify an assertion that the capsules provide health benefits 
grigg said 
but such results are several months if not more down the 
road he added 
it is the assertion of a health benefit that brings fish oil 
capsules under stringent drug regulation rules the manufacturers 
can continue selling their capsules as foods without health claims 
if the faa accepts them as generally recognized as safe grigg 
said 
this might be a simple matter for some products because for 
codliver oil and some of the others there is a good record 
grigg said

all but two of 13 studies conducted for 
generic drug manufacturers by a pittsburgh lab violated food and 
drug administration regulations or fell short of accepted 
laboratory practice the agency says 
the lab biodecision laboratories promised to correct the flaws 
fda headquarters is analyzing the inspection reports to see 
whether they affect any drugs recently approved or waiting for 
approval spokesman don mclearn said monday 
he said he did not know what drugs were involved but noted that 
this is not a product issue but how a lab conducts its 
business 
biodecision is one of the more heavily used laboratories in the 
generic drug industry mclearn said 
the studies were socalled bioequivalence studies aimed at 
showing that a candidate generic drug reaches the same 
concentration in the bloodstream as the patented drug for which it 
will be sold as a substitute 
mclearn said an example of violation of standards of good 
practice would be starting an analysis before validation of the 
method being used 
the agency can refuse to accept data from labs it deems 
unreliable but mclearn said the company is not in that kind of 
jeopardy at this point 
the inspection was conducted in january and the company reported 
its plans for corrective action in march at some point fda 
probably will approve or disapprove those plans mclearn said 
the agency has been wrestling with problems in the generic drug 
industry for more than a year with some drug manufacturers having 
been found to have cheated on their lab tests and bribed fda 
officials 
in pittsburgh a man answering the companys telephone who 
identified himself as a guard said no one was available to comment 
in tuesday editions the washington post quoted the company 
president robert lecher as saying we view the entire process 
as very constructive and have taken it extremely seriously we 
dont take issue or disagree with any of the observations

this impoverished town in the eastern 
kentucky coalfields was shocked when 23 men and women were indicted 
four years ago for sexually and physically abusing more than two 
dozen children 
four trials have come and gone and a fifth opens this week but 
the unwelcome spotlight of the nations media has dimmed 
nevertheless for some residents the stigma is proving hard to bear 
well never live it down said sheriff chalmer wireman 
investigators concluded that 26 children ranging in age from 1 
to 11 had been abused the accused included their fathers 
grandfathers uncles and mothers and charges ranged from rape and 
sodomy to torture with burning cigarettes 
nineteen of the defendants were members of an extended family 
supported largely by work as lowincome laborers 
one defendant was convicted eight others pleaded guilty and 
five won acquittals none of the victimized children was returned 
home and 10 have either been adopted by new families or have 
adoptions pending 
impoverished living conditions common in an area with 20 percent 
unemployment came to light at the recent trial of herbert hub 
gipson when his 12yearold son testified that he fabricated tales 
of abuse because i wanted to live in a better place gipson was 
acquitted 
despite the five acquittals assistant attorney general barbara 
whaley says she thinks prosecutors have excelled because winning 
convictions in child sexual abuse cases is among the hardest of 
legal tasks 
medical evidence and witnesses to confirm child allegations are 
frequently lacking and the pressures of court testimony on alleged 
child victims makes pursuing such cases difficult said ms whaley 
a special prosecutor assigned to the case 
children recanted in gipsons trial she said because its 
almost impossible to ask those kids to come in here 
gipson an unemployed former tobacco farmer with a seventhgrade 
education had been charged with eight felony counts for allegedly 
sexually abusing three of his children and a cousin 
gipson thinks the acquittal will enable him to clear his name 
but said the 3year wait for trial was an ordeal 
it hurts and everything getting jobs and things like 
that he said the investigation began in august 1986 when state 
police and social workers interviewed a young incest victim the 
case snowballed when the child said other youngsters had been 
molested 
seventeen of the original 23 cases have been resolved brack 
nickles 64 of masons creek received the maximum sentence of 20 
years after being found guilty last summer of rape and sodomy 
the eight defendants who pleaded guilty to various misdemeanor 
and felony counts have all received probation three cases ended 
when one man died one womans charges were dismissed and 
prosecutors realized that one person named didnt actually exist 
in the next trial scheduled to begin thursday 27yearold 
della adkins is charged with three felony child abuse counts for 
allegedly acting as an accomplice in the molestations of two girls 
and a boy 
some local residents defended the accused and about 50 rallied 
in front of the county courthouse in november 1986 to demand 
charges be dropped and that children be returned to their families 
but now many are eager to forget 
id say its just fading away except for the damage thats 
done to a few kids said jim wadges an unemployed millwright

a new astronaut on track to 
becoming nasas first female shuttle commander said she welcomes 
the bush administrations scrutiny of the beleaguered agency 
the administration on monday ordered a review by outside experts 
of the nations longterm space goals the same day the astronaut 
candidate class of 1990 reported to work for the first time 
the national aeronautics and space administration has endured a 
spate of recent embarrassments including trouble with the 15 
billion hubble space telescope and hydrogen leaks that have 
grounded the space shuttle fleet 
air force maj eileen collins one of 23 new astronauts selected 
earlier this year told reporters she is not unnerved by problems 
with sophisticated machines the new astronauts were chosen from 
more than 2000 applicants 
there are high points and low points in any airplane or weapon 
system ms collins said monday you learn to get through the 
bad times 
if our president feels its something that needs to be done 
it needs to be done she said 
if all goes according to plan ms collins would become the 
first woman to command a shuttle mission she said she hopes to be 
flying shuttle missions to help construct the planned space station 
freedom 
the candidates will become fullfledged astronauts a year from 
now after undergoing advanced training and evaluation in the 
history of the program only one candidate has dropped out during 
this last leg officials said 
an assignment on a space shuttle would probably take at least 
two years after that 
besides the seven pilots the 1990 class includes 16 mission 
specialists eleven of the 23 are civilians and 12 are military 
pilots 
of the five women selected three are military officers 
including ms collins the class also includes ellen ochoa of los 
altos calif the first hispanic woman to be selected

the nations first program allocating state 
money to poor parents so their children can attend private schools 
is nearing its autumn startup but critics are planning a 
lastditch effort to block it 
the school choice plan which has drawn praise from the bush 
administration and republican gov tommy g thompson faces a court 
hearing this month that could determine its immediate fate 
the hearing is the result of a lawsuit urged by state school 
superintendent herbert grover and filed by opponents of the plan 
that challenges the constitutionality of using state money for 
private schools 
the wisconsin supreme court declined to immediately review the 
lawsuit and referred it to dane county circuit court which has 
scheduled a july 28 hearing 
if the court blocks the program it will start a legal battle 
that will probably delay implementation 
the arguments theyre making amount to grasping at 
constitutional strawssaid clint bolick spokesman for the 
landmark legal foundation center a washingtonbased advocacy group 
assisting in the fight against the lawsuit 
even if they win the court battle program organizers still face 
a battle with grover over requirements for the 10 private schools 
that have applied to accept the students that battle has prompted 
a second lawsuit challenging grovers authority 
plans that allow parents more choice over where to send their 
children to school have gained momentum in the last five years 
minnesota and iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to 
parents sending their children to private schools wisconsins 
voucher system would be the nations first to directly provide 
government money for the purpose 
the program was approved by the legislature in april and signed 
into law by thompson it has been hailed by bush administration 
officials as a national model for overhauling public education 
it provides as much as 2500 to each of nearly 1000 poor 
milwaukee students to help them leave the public schools and enroll 
in nonsectarian private schools the average yearly tuition at the 
private schools is 3200 
the experiment would affect about the poorest 1 percent of the 
citys estimated 97000 students the money used would be deducted 
from the citys school budget 
critics such as grover and the wisconsin education association 
council teachers union claim the plan undermines public education 
and puts students in private schools that arent fully accountable 
to the state 
grover devised a series of forms for the schools to complete 
before they would be allowed to participate two of the schools 
completed the forms the others refused and filed a lawsuit 
claiming the forms were too complex and would force the schools to 
meet numerous requirements not specified in the law 
none of these schools are capable of providing those kinds of 
services said attorney william levit who represents the private 
schools the city of milwaukee doesnt even provide them on a 
schoolbyschool basis the district provides them

loida gabwats class had 
just finished a math test when the earth shook bringing her 
sixstory school down in crumbling concrete on hundreds of students 
and teachers 
we were kidding each other we were saying the test was so 
easy said the 14yearold then suddenly the walls trembled 
the ceiling collapsed and there was total darkness we embraced 
each other we were very scared 
survivors groped for one another in the darkened rubble and 
prayed aloud 
we were calling out our classmates names but they did not 
respond any more miss gabwat told a reporter while being taken 
to a provincial hospital then we groped for their hands but felt 
that they were cold each time we wept 
we were scared and some were screaming but then later on 
they said they wanted to sleep already and rest then there was 
silence 
ms gabwat lost so many of her friends 
mommy mommy come here she had screamed when she was 
pulled from the rubble of the christian college of the philippines 
after mondays quake i cant go through this alone my friends 
are dead inside 
mayor honorato perez said about 50 people remained buried today 
in the rubble of the school which included first grade through 
the senior year of college but fewer than half were believed 
still alive 
the quake was centered 20 miles northwest of cabanatuan a city 
of 80000 people 
the rescue efforts that followed were undertaken largely by 
local volunteers there was little sign of experienced supervision 
president corazon aquino flew to cabanatuan from manila early 
today to console families and visit survivors 
while she was present a rescuer crawled from the rubble and 
told reporters he found four boys all alive but he said one was 
pinned under the ruins in such pain he amputated his own leg with 
a jagged piece of concrete 
lt benbol moralde part of an army contingent sent from nearby 
fort magsaysay said he believed few remained alive beneath the 
debris 
moralde said victims cries grew fainter and fainter and that he 
could see bodies and parts of bodies when he surveyed the 
destruction 
hours after the temblor hundreds of family members and friends 
watched and prayed as rescuers dug through the school rubble 
each time someone was brought out alive relatives crowded 
around the survivor begging for news of those still missing 
they told me shes still alive said rosa de los reyes who 
was waiting word of her daughter maria lisa 14 im very happy 
but if it turns out she has died i think im going to die too 
throughout the night boys as young as seven scrambled between 
slabs of concrete carrying water to victims still trapped 
sixteenyearold florencio alano crawled through the wreckage 
looking for his 13yearold brother cesario only to find out he 
was dead 
florencio who eventually led three survivors to safety said 
at first i couldnt believe that he was already dead so i 
crawled through the passageway i saw his face and felt him what 
else can one feel but just accept it 
rescuers could hear the anguished screams during the night of 
those buried under tons of debris most begged for water one girl 
shrieked for rescuers to cut off my legs to free her 
cenando memping whose 14th birthday was monday said he had 
just invited his three best friends to join him after class at a 
restaurant when the quake hit 
cenando and his friends were trapped beneath tons of rubble he 
said there were 54 students in his class more than 10 hours after 
the quake he was the only one of them who had been rescued 
i prayed to god that if i survive ill hear mass every day 
he said from his hospital bed he said his friend michael nuevo 
joked that he would never go to a high school again 
moments later michael died cenando said 
we were kidding each other comforting each other cenando 
said softly then suddenly he stopped breathing he said 
praise the lord our father our father our father then he was 
silent

the speaker system at the empire state building 
may have been faulty when a smoky fire erupted halfway up the 
102story landmark forcing many of the 1000 people inside to seek 
their own way out 
some people said they heard the alarms others said they 
didnt but we get that in every fire said fire department 
spokesman john mulligan theres a speaker system and we are 
investigating to see how well it worked 
at least four civilians and 34 firefighters were hurt mostly 
from inhaling smoke in the monday evening fire mulligan said the 
blaze was confined to four unoccupied offices on the 51st floor 
but smoke spread throughout the upper floors 
sixteen people were sent to hospitals for treatment a 
firefighter who suffered minor burns was the only one to be 
hospitalized 
about 1000 people evacuated the building down the stairways and 
elevators said fire department capt charles kasper although 
10000 people work in the building more than 80 percent of them 
leave the building at 5 pm officials said 
the cause of the fire was not immediately known we are trying 
to find out now who was the last person in the room mulligan 
said 
there were nothing but tourists up there and there were no 
announcements said josephine danielson of new york who was on 
the observation deck with five friends from spain no one really 
knew what was going on not even the employees 
we started smelling smoke and we saw on the east side of the 
building dense black smoke coming from below the tower said 
danielson a pan am stewardess whoever runs the observation deck 
is tremendously unorganized you would think they would have had 
some kind of recorded announcement 
paula schnorbus of hoboken nj who was on the observation 
deck with her boyfriend stephen giradi also complained that 
there was no one up there to tell us where to go 
tourists who stayed on the observation deck were eventually 
evacuated by elevator 15 at a time the last civilian came out at 
about 1020 pm mulligan said 
the fire was reported at 630 pm and by 845 pm the blaze 
was out and the danger passed fire officials said

at about 915 pm with her husband and five children 
some people were crying and having nervous trembling fits 
she said her husband said added we were praying to god that 
he would help us we are safe and we thank the fire department of 
the municipality 
fire department officials reported heavy fire damage on the 51st 
floor water damage on lower floors and smoke damage above

hundreds of lucy and desi wannabes hoping 
to play the comedy duo in a television movie flooded cbs 
television city with red hair and broken english as a nationwide 
casting search began 
the desi arnaz warning you gotta lotta splainin to do got 
a workout monday before a producer and a casting director who 
smiled cheerfully through some painfully amateurish readings 
one truth seemed evident the more the performers looked like 
lucy and desi the worse their acting was 
some women dyed their hair red for their slim chance to be in 
lucy and desi before the laughter a few men wore white suits 
most every fake lucy wore a 1950sstyle dress and heels several 
looked just like the zany comedian while others bore more of a 
resemblance to carol burnett 
one couple danced the rumba while waiting for their names to be 
called 
what are my chances not great there are like tons of people 
here said randy aguirre an engineer who missed a staff meeting 
to audition for the part of the cuban band leader 
a woman named tahoe castle i was born there died her hair 
red and drove 300 miles for a stab at the lead role 
its just a rinse so i can wash it right out she said 
fingering her tresses for her shot at stardom castle performed a 
song from the musical a chorus line as lucy might have 
interpreted it 
i feel like im really her said castle who came from san 
martin in northern california to be one of the first in line i 
watch all of her old shows 
castle also planned a trip to disneyland as part of her southern 
california visit 
the cbs movie will cover the late lucille ball and desi arnazs 
life from when they met in 1940 while making the movie too many 
girls to 1951 the year televisions i love lucy premiered 
id like to play her but its so hard to fill her shoes 
said dianalynn pfennig who drove from her makeover salon in san 
jose to perform lucys famous drunken sales pitch for the 
alcohollaced vita meta vegamin nutritional supplement 
in addition to false eyelashes and the heavy makeup shed been 
wearing since 2 am pfennig brought a stage prop a bottle of 
multivitamin liquid extract from which she drank during her 
twominute monologue 
this stuff tastes awful she said after her performance 
her audition was scarcely the most offbeat 
one desi gave a streamofconsciousness monologue ricky ricardo 
as scripted by hunter s thompson one actress audition consisted 
entirely of her impression on how lucy would eat a crumb 
a few lucy simulations came from as far away as dallas and el 
paso the first lucy in line arrived at 3 am after finishing her 
shift as a waitress at a latenight restaurant 
tony rael who was born in havana and came to the united states 
when he was 2 was one of the few the producers wanted to see 
again he sang the shows theme song for his tryout 
i love desi arnaz rael said hes a hero to the hispanic 
people 
producer larry thompson said the television movie due to be 
broadcast next february will be a loving but honest portrayal 
of the relationship between lucy and desi 
he deflected criticism from daughter lucie arnaz who said i 
believe that the climate is wrong to try and tell my parents story 
accurately no matter who tells it 
cbs entertainment president jeff sagansky said were not 
going to desecrate all the wonderful things lucy and desi did for 
cbs

in a move sure to anger cocaine bosses 
the colombian government has extradited to the united states two 
more men accused of drug trafficking one a native texan police 
say 
both were sent to the united states on monday night bringing to 
19 the number of suspects extradited since august when the 
government declared war on cocaine traffickers 
presidentelect cesar gaviria promised monday to fight poverty 
in medellin slums where drug traffickers are hiring teenagers as 
assassins in their war to stop extraditions the fate they fear 
most 
the texas native extradited was identified as eduard george 
mitchell a us citizen wanted on drug smuggling charges in 
wisconsin 
the other suspect jose gil zapata is a colombian charged in a 
florida court with cocaine trafficking a police spokesman said in 
a telephone interview 
gil zapata was arrested on jan 15 in medellin headquarters of 
the medellin cocaine cartel the spokesman said 
mitchell 44 was arrested in northern colombia on jan 22 
no further details were given on the arrests 
eleven other drug smuggling suspects are still in colombian 
jails awaiting extradition to the united states 
the government of president virgilio barco reinstated the 
nations extradition policy in august after drug traffickers were 
blamed for murdering a leading presidential candidate luis carlos 
galan 
the policy is not popular in colombia where many believe 
sending citizens to be tried in a foreign country is an insult to 
national pride 
many drug bosses have been able to bribe or threaten their way 
out of colombian jails 
one of the main cities where the drug traffickers are carrying 
on their bombing and murder campaign against the government 
crackdown is medellin home of the drug cartel by the same name 
drug barons often hire teenagers from medellins poor 
neighborhoods to carry out their campaigns of bombings and 
assassinations authorities say 
an estimated 3000 people have been murdered in the city this 
year including about 150 police officers with 2 million people 
medellin is colombias secondlargest city after the capital 
gaviria who becomes colombias next president on aug 7 said 
at a news conference in bogota that the government will have to 
attack medellins poverty if it hopes to make a dent in 
drugrelated violence 
the countrys gravest problem now is violence in medellin and 
this will require special treatment from my government a treatment 
that transcends just military police and public order measures 
gaviria said in his first public appearance since returning sunday 
from europe the united states and venezuela he met with president 
bush during his trip to washington last week 
he also said the drug raids now taking place in northeastern 
colombia have not been a failure as suggested in many news reports 
last week about 2000 policemen and soldiers began combing the 
area in search of pablo escobar reputed head of the medellin 
cocaine cartel 
police said they had escobar surrounded but the fugitive drug 
lord managed to slip away for the third time in a year

japans discount rate now stands at 525 percent one of the 
lowest among industrialized nations the country has been under 
pressure from its trading partners to raise the rate to stem the 
yens weakness against the dollar and other major currencies

rite aid corp and its president have been 
acquitted on charges of bribing a member of ohios pharmacy board 
in an effort to fill his job with someone more favorable to the 
drugstore chain 
prosecutors contended that rite aid president martin l grass 
36 gave board of pharmacy member melvin wilczynski a 33000 
company check to get him to resign the company wanted to push its 
own member into the job they said 
but when the prosecution rested its case monday two weeks into 
the trial cuyahoga county common pleas judge lillian greene 
granted a defense motion for acquittal 
the judge said prosecution evidence was circumstantial and did 
not prove any willful intent to bribe 
the ruling was met by courtroom applause supporters hugged the 
smiling grass or shook his hand 
i never had a doubt it was a ridiculous prosecution grass 
said 
grass and rite aid based in shiremanstown pa were charged in 
an indictment unsealed in august with bribery and possession of 
criminal tools described as a corporate aircraft 
assistant county prosecutor william caine refused to comment 
wilczynski 61 said he was offered a rite aid check for just 
over 33000 plus ongoing insurance benefits 
rite aids lawyers claimed the payment was a legal buyout of 
wilczynskis consulting contract for another drug store company 
lane drug co a division of peoples drug stores inc acquired by 
rite aid last year 
wilczynski testified that grass offered the buyout only if he 
would step down as a voting member of the board 
prosecutors said rite aid had complained that the pharmacy board 
harassed the company when enforcing state regulations over 
drugstores 
but defense attorneys argued that the board had a vendetta 
against rite aid because the company challenged some rules and 
decisions that it thought unreasonable 
the prosecutors had the jury hear and watch two secretlymade 
tapes a recorded telephone conversation between wilczynski and 
grass on april 26 1989 and a videotape the following day in a 
cleveland hotel room 
in the telephone tape wilczynski is heard arranging the 
followingday meeting with grass at the hotel to discuss the 
contract buyout 
in the videotape wilczynski and grass are seen in the motel 
room leafing through papers some of which wilczynski signs 
prosecutors said the papers included six undated letters of 
resignation 
wilczynski remains a voting member of the pharmacy board 
the bribery charge carried a maximum 10year prison sentence and 
a fine of up to 5000

a federal judge sentenced a wealthy 
proisrael activist to 90 days in prison for making an illegal 
120000 campaign contribution to aid the reelection of alan 
cranston in the 1986 senate race 
you must be made an example us district judge ronald sw 
lew told michael goland during sentencing monday there must be 
deterrence 
goland 43 was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of making the 
illegal contribution in the tight race between cranston and his 
republican challenger ed zschau of los altos 
goland was accused of paying for a 120000 television 
advertisement for american independent party candidate ed vallen to 
help split the conservative vote between he and zschau to aid 
cranston who is considered liberal 
cranston is a longtime supporter of israel and goland felt 
zschau might be less supportive of continued aid for the middle 
east nation the candidates were not implicated in the case 
cranston beat zschau by about 100000 votes 
the contribution was illegal because the commercial claimed it 
was financed by the vallen for senate committee a group that did 
not exist and it failed to note goland was the actual backer 
prosecutors said 
goland was acquitted of three felony counts including 
conspiracy and making a false statement to a federal agency

long island sound is a notoriously dirty 
waterway and thats precisely why skip storch is making a 150mile 
swim across it 
storch dove in monday and completed the first leg of the 
weeklong swim that will take him to to the statue of liberty 
hes braving the pollution and 58degree water to publicize 
fouled beaches and environmental damage to underwater habitats the 
activist calls himself a modernday johnny appleseed 
instead of planting tree seeds i plant seeds of 
consciousness storch said everybody has to work together 
around the world efforts are being made to clean up and save our 
planet 
wary of waterborn germs storch said he had been inoculated 
against hepatitis there are all kinds of dangers out there he 
said adding that he would wear a bodysuit to protect against the 
cold 
storch a recreation director from spring valley ny swam to 
new london conn where he stopped for the night 
a boat carrying volunteer supporters will accompany him on the 
trip 
the chilly water sapped most of my energy in the first two 
hours storch said he plans to swim about 17 miles a day and end 
the week at the statue of liberty in new york harbor 
twenty million people live work or play on or near the sound 
swim organizers said the waterway extends from new york harbor to 
the southwestern tip of rhode island 
herm hannah of the long island sound taskforce said it once was 
an important commercial fishing area where beachgoers could take a 
dip without getting a booster shot first 
unfortunately it has also been a dumping ground hannah 
said skip storch is going to highlight the good things he sees 
and try to make us very much aware what needs to be done to keep 
this sound clean and usable 
terry backer of the long island soundkeeper fund said ignoring 
cleanup efforts could be costly 
the coastal environment for rhode island connecticut and new 
york is the source of billions of dollars of revenue he said 
when people feel the waters are open sewers were going to 
lose that revenue 
it wasnt the first time storch has embarked on a long swim to 
heighten awareness about water pollution 
last summer he swam from atlantic city nj to new york harbor 
and the summer before he swam down the hudson river from albany 
ny to the statue of liberty

israels supreme court today overturned 
emergency regulations by housing minister ariel sharon to speed the 
construction of homes for thousands of soviet immigrants 
the threejudge panel ruled sharon could have sought approval 
for the programs from parliament instead of using the emergency 
powers 
it was the first time the court challenged the governments use 
of such regulations which date from israels 1948 independence war 
up to 150000 soviet immigrants are expected to arrive this 
year tent cities are springing up across the country as part of 
protests by israelis who say subsidies for immigrants are driving 
up rents and pricing others out of the housing market 
sharon who also serves as cabinet coordinator of immigration 
had asked to use emergency regulations to allow the purchase of 
3000 prefabricated homes either locally or abroad the cabinet 
approved it july 1 
there is no doubt that this is a revolutionary decision 
said moshe negbi a legal expert for the hebrew daily newspaper 
hadashot 
he said the procedure for emergency powers was introduced during 
war in 1948 when there was a fear the knesset or parliament could 
not always be convened because of the fighting 
for the first time the supreme court clearly says that the 
government must not use these radical powers when there is no 
problem in convening the parliament negbi said it must not 
get around the parliament and adopt its authority 
under the emergency regulations the cabinet authorized the 
prefabricated housing units to be set up near nine israeli towns 
most in the galilee in the north and in the southern negev desert 
some politicians expressed fear that sharon would try to take 
undemocratic actions assuming powers delegated to planning 
councils and zoning boards sharon was accused as defense minister 
in 1982 of concealing military plans from the government that led 
to the armys invasion of lebanon 
the high court panel issued its ruling after a liberal 
legislator abraham poraz of the shinui party appealed sharons 
use of emergency regulations 
in his appeal poraz argued sharon used emergency regulations at 
a time when the knesset was debating the housing crisis last week 
the knesset passed a law that shortened housing license procedures 
emergency regulations are an antidemocratic act that 
should be used only in difficult exceptional situations when 
there is no other choice poraz said on israel army radio 
the government argued in its court response that emergency 
regulations were needed to ease the housing crisis created by the 
mass influx of soviet jews 
according to figures submitted by the government israels 
20000 available rental apartments will be filled by the end of 
september

hezbollah fighters dislodged their amal 
militia rivals from a key hilltop village in southern lebanon in 
fierce fighting leaving the village square littered with 
bodies police said today 
palestine liberation organization fighters moved in to block the 
fundamentalist hezbollahs push to expand its territory and later 
came under mortar fire from hezbollah which overran the village of 
jarjou 
at least eight people were killed and 27 wounded in fighting 
during the night police said that raised the casualty toll since 
fighting began early monday to at least 20 killed and 77 wounded 
the plo said it intervened to block the apparent drive by 
hezbollah or party of god to the mediterranean coast 
hezbollah or party of god is a proiranian shiite moslem group 
while amal is a syrianbacked group comprised of more secular 
shiites the rival militias have been fighting off and on for three 
years for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys 
largest sect 
police said hezbollah fighters broke through amals defenses 
around the village of jajrou and were advancing toward nabatiyeh 
the main town in the central sector of southern lebanon 
jarjou is five miles north of nabatiyeh which has been 
controlled by amal since an offensive against hezbollah two years 
ago 
it was closequarter combat in jarjou the village square is 
littered with bodies that couldnt be evacuated by the red cross 
because of the savage fighting a police spokesman said 
police said several hundred heavily armed guerrillas from fatah 
yasser arafats faction in the plo moved in to halt the 
bloodletting this morning it deployed along a twomile front 
between amal and hezbollah along the southwestern edge of the 
disputed zone in the villages of sarba and houmine overlooking 
jarjou 
four hours later hezbollah fighters shelled the palestinians in 
sarba with 82mm and 120mm mortars police said 
lt col anwar madi commander of the plo force in sarba 
reported no casualties in the barrage 
the police spokesman said madi shouted at the hezbollah fighters 
through a bullhorn stop shooting or well respond 
the shelling sharply decreased about 15 minutes later the 
spokesman said 
the plo has about 5000 fighters in the south based in refugee 
camps around sidon 
irans islamic revolutionary guards corps has an estimated 3000 
men deployed in the bekaa valley of eastern lebanon the guards 
were moved there in 1982 during israels invasion of lebanon 
the plo fears that hezbollahs aim is to seize control of sidon 
the southern provincial capital to gain an outlet to the 
mediterranean a move that would dramatically alter the strategic 
balance in the region north of israel 
hezbollah badly needs a coastal outlet because its supply lines 
from the bekaa valley northeast of the battle zone are vulnerable 
to interdiction by syria and its lebanese allies 
a plo source speaking on condition of anonymity said if 
hezbollah was allowed to control any part of the coast theyll 
have a port to ship in weapons ammunition and fighters and 
establish their own islamic republic modeled on iran 
the plo also is determined to prevent iran from establishing 
control through hezbollah of strategic terrain east of the 
palestinian camps in sidon 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
palestinian deployment today was personally ordered by arafat in 
a message received overnight 
shortly after the plo force was deployed israeli warplanes made 
several lowlevel passes over the battle zone 
theyre apparently monitoring the palestinian deployment 
the police spokesman said 
in january a battalionsize plo force intervened to separate 
amal and hezbollah units in the region that halted a hezbollah 
advance saved amal from a decisive defeat and at the same time 
enlarged the plos area of control 
by police count 1069 people have been killed and 3228 wounded 
in amalhezbollah fighting since late 1986

left the czechoslovak embassy in havana and one report said the 
cuban government promised to help them leave the country 
however cubas official news agency reported the release 
without any mention of a promise to help the cubans leave 
at least eight other wouldbe emigrants were reported still 
holed up in diplomatic compounds 
the east german news agency adn in a dispatch from havana

asylumseekers left monday night after the countrys communist 
government promised to help them find asylum abroad czechoslovak

a czechoslovak foreign ministry official jindrich opava said 
by telephone that he had no details on the circumstances of the 
asylumseekers leaving 
the cuban agency prensa latina also quoting an official 
statement said the asylumseekers would be returned to their homes 
upon completion of an investigation of the incident 
it made no mention of any cuban promise to the asylum seekers 
the spanish news agency efe also quoted the cuban statement as 
saying 11 of the cubans left the embassy voluntarily and 
unconditionally monday night the twelfth according to 
czechoslovak sources was evacuated earlier monday in an ambulance 
after his blood pressure went up efe said 
on monday evening the mexican news agency notimex quoted the 
cuban foreign ministry as saying it would not give in to the

believed to be unarmed 
czechoslovak television reported later that the diplomats had 
been released 
five refugees remained at the residence of czechoslovak charge 
daffaires jan doemoek adn said it said the diplomat has asked 
cuban authorities to eject the five from his home but the cubans 
have so far refused 
it said czechoslovakia was refusing to grant asylum to the five 
because they used violence to break into the diplomats home 
in addition three wouldbe emigrants took refuge in the spanish 
embassy last week madrid lodged a protest after cuban authorities 
chased a fourth onto the grounds of the spanish embassy and hauled 
him away sunday 
adn said tumultuous scenes occurred at the czechoslovak 
embassy compound monday with furniture and other objects being 
thrown from the windows 
the affair has soured cubas relations with czechoslovakia the 
countries had been close allies before last falls velvet 
revolution toppled pragues hardline communist leaders 
cuban president fidel castro has defied the reformist trend 
sweeping eastern europe refusing to abandon socialism 
castro in his first official statement on the affair called 
the asylumseekers antisocial elements encouraged by czechoslovak 
diplomats the czechoslovak newspaper lidova demokracie said 
monday

agreement on diplomatic asylum with european countries and the 
embassies of these countries have no right to grant asylum 
czechoslovak television quoted foreign ministry spokesman lubos 
dobrovsky on monday as saying a deputy foreign minister would leave 
for havana immediately because it is necessary to protect the 
safety of czechoslovak citizens

a jubilant chancellor helmut kohl said 
today that he and mikhail s gorbachev have solved all practical 
problems in the way of german unification and that elections for an 
allgerman parliament are expected on dec 2 
kohl met with reporters a day after returning from a twoday 
trip to the soviet union where he and the soviet president 
announced gorbachev had dropped his objections to nato membership 
for a united germany 
the soviet objections had been the most significant obstacle to 
unification 
the practical problems which lay before us on the way to 
german unity have been solved kohl said 
he said joint german elections were expected dec 2 but whether 
east germany merges with the west before or after elections had to 
be decided by east berlin 
he also reiterated his position that the capital of a united 
germany must be decided by the new parliament 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere who is pushing 
for berlin over bonn as united germanys capital has said the 
capital must be stipulated in a unification treaty now in 
preparation 
kohl said that during his visit he had offered no specific 
economic aid to the soviets but he emphasized that gorbachev needs 
financial help if his program of economic restructuring is to 
succeed 
he said he could envision the west germans helping the soviets 
retrain the thousands of soldiers who would return from east 
germany and possibly face unemployment as well as help in 
supplying housing but not for a certain category of soviet 
residents 
west german officials worry about the political fallout at home 
of building housing specifically for returning soviet troops 
kohl ruled out the possibility that west germany would be the 
sole source of financial aid to the soviets saying the burden 
would be too great 
at the houston summit of the worlds industrial leaders last 
week kohl had pushed for a 15 billion international aid package 
for the soviet union instead the leaders asked the international 
monetary fund to study exactly what kind of aid would be most 
beneficial 
west germany has already backed a 3 billion bank credit to help 
the soviet union shift its economy to a free market and has agreed 
to pay 780 million toward the upkeep of soviet soldiers stationed 
in east germany in the second half of this year 
kohl said he hoped a bilateral treaty with the soviet union that 
covered all areas and provided for regular meetings could be ready 
by next summer he set the same time frame for a treaty with 
poland and said he wanted it to be wideranging not just focusing 
on the border question 
poland has been pushing for a formal written guarantee that 
germany will never try to reclaim territory it lost after world war 
ii onethird of modern day poland was once german land 
among the kohl and gorbachev agreements announced monday were 
plans to reduce the size of a united german army to 370000 
soldiers within three to four years after unification currently 
the two germanys have about 600000 soldiers under arms 
east german foreign minister markus meckel today rejected the 
idea of one german army he said east germany should retain its 
army and its own command structure and called for even deeper cuts 
in the combined armed forces

western countries are praising soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs decision to allow a united germany the 
freedom to join nato calling it a turning point in european 
history 
the decision announced monday by gorbachev and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl was an extremely positive development in 
soviet thinking britains foreign office said 
we have throughout argued that a united germany in nato would 
be in the best interests of all those concerned it said in a 
statement 
in washington president bush said gorbachevs action 
strengthens efforts to build enduring relationships based on 
cooperation 
by dropping its objection to nato membership for a united 
germany the soviet union removed the last big obstacle to german 
unification 
a beaming kohl said today in bonn that he and gorbachev have 
solved all practical problems in the way of unification and that 
elections for an allgerman parliament are expected on dec 2 
gorbachev and kohl announced the agreement in a televised news 
conference in gorbachevs home region stavropol in the soviet 
republic of russia the area was one of the deepest points of 
german penetration during world war ii 
the announcement capped several months of intense diplomatic 
maneuvering during which germany backed a 3 billion bank loan to 
moscow and pushed its allies for a comprehensive plan to bail out 
the crumbling soviet economy 
the foreign office said gorbachev was evidently swayed by the 
july 56 nato summit in london at which the 16 leaders of the 
western alliance committed themselves to limiting the size of the 
german army a prime soviet concern 
leaders of north atlantic treaty organization also offered a 
nonaggression pact to the soviet union and other eastern european 
countries and said nuclear arms would only be weapons of last 
resort 
france a major west european power that belongs to nato but 
keeps its military forces outside the alliances command had no 
immediate comment foreign minister roland dumas said he was 
waiting to hear the news personally from west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher 
in rome an italian foreign ministry spokesman praised 
gorbachevs position at first glance we look on it with extreme 
favor said the spokesman who declined to be identified 
austria which is not a member of nato said the agreement was 
a historic hour for europe and for the world 
the long journey of european history in this century has 
reached a very positive station said austrian chancellor franz 
vranitzky it is the foundation for building a peaceful europe 
the soviet union took the heaviest casualties of any nation in 
world war ii with some 20 million people killed 
in tokyo prime minister toshiki kaifu today hailed the 
development as big progress japan is not a nato member by has 
expressed its intention to send officials as observers to meetings

rescuers perched in dinghies 
worked for three hours to untangle a whale from a fishing net then 
whooped and cheered as the humpback swam free 
the rescuers were nearly capsized monday when they came within 
inches of the 38foot whales breathing hole the whale named 
mallard was discovered earlier in the day thrashing in the atlantic 
ocean 30 miles from boston 
boy did these guys have guts said captain tom hill of the 
yankee captains one of the vessels dispatched to try to save the 
5yearold whale all it would take is one good swipe with a 
flipper to kill them 
but with patience and daring the rescuers untangled the net 
from mallards flippers mouth and tail the 25ton humpback 
spouting and breaching joined a throng of whales that had remained 
nearby 
once the sight of a helpless whale would have been considered a 
bounty for sailors who plied the atlantic in search of whales 
today the ships that roam this area are filled with people longing 
for a glimpse of the creatures 
rescue workers attached buoys to the trailing ends of the net 
wrapped around mallard and waited for the humpback to tire and rest 
on the surface the other whales kept a safe distance expect for 
one that came up alongside the entangled mammal and rubbed its head 
leading a crew of four rescuers charles stormy mayo head 
of the center for coastal studies in provincetown mass launched 
two inflatable and motorized dinghies and floated on top of the two 
whales 
when mallard suddenly reared its head mayos boat nearly 
overturned 
finally we were able to cut the lines with some of our 
specialized equipment rough weather made this rescue quite 
difficult mayo said later 
the whale seemed to work in harmony with our efforts to free 
it 
the rescue mission began after a fisherman radioed that he was 
awakened in the morning by a whale thrashing next to his boat 
the whale named by whale watchers when it was first recorded in 
1986 was identified by scars and coloring on its tail and flukes 
mallard sex unknown was tangled in one of the 
quartermilelong gill nets set on the lucrative stellwagen bank 
fishing grounds about 17 miles off gloucester and 25 miles from 
provincetown whales come to the area to feed on cod haddock and 
other fish plentiful this time of year

records detailing radiation exposure of 
50000 nuclear weapons workers are being sent to researchers who 
were denied access to the information in the late 1970s after they 
detected high cancer rates 
the federal energy department said monday that the computer 
tapes containing data on the workers at the hanford wash nuclear 
reservation would be in the mail today at the latest they would 
have been mailed monday but for a minor glitch in preparing the 
tapes department spokesman robert griffin said today 
it wont be very dramatic but its a great moment in history 
of this research said alice stewart one of three radiation 
scientists awaiting the records 
last month after resisting for years the energy department 
agreed to release the data in a settlement with a 
philadelphiabased group that monitors plant safety the three mile 
island public health fund 
its been a long struggle and im very gratified that weve 
been successful said daniel berger a lawyer for the group 
researchers thomas mancuso of the university of pittsburgh and 
stewart and george kneale of birmingham university in england 
studied hanford records in the late 1970s for the energy department 
but were discharged after publishing preliminary findings showing 
high cancer rates 
we left the story rather abruptly because we produced a risk 
estimate that was considered impossibly high stewart recalled 
the release is important she said because it shows that 
whoever owns the industry must never be totally in charge of 
health records 
in washington energy department spokesman bob griffin said 
officials in hanford were making lastminute adjustments working 
feverishly to prepare the tapes for delivery 
the department agreed to release records of workers at 10 
weapons plants in four batches over the next 10 months all told 
the information will cover 200000 of the 300000 current and 
former workers at the plants since world war ii 
the energy department stopped financing the research and denied 
access to the records citing patient confidentiality the three 
mile island public health fund sued for access and the department 
agreed to reopen the files 
it enabled the resumption of research done more than 10 years 
ago stewart said 
were hoping that say by the end of year well establish 
some very firm points she said 
stewart estimated cancer rates may be shown to be three to five 
times higher than most experts previously thought in line with the 
preliminary findings of 13 years ago 
the next batch of records to be released will over workers from 
these plants rocky flats colo los alamos national laboratory 
nm mound laboratory miamisburg ohio and the pantex facility 
in amarillo texas 
after that records will be released from plants at oak ridge 
tenn and savannah river sc followed by records from the 
fernald feed plant fernald ohio the mallinckrodt chemical works 
in st louis and the k25 plant in oak ridge

andrew young put his bid to become georgias 
first black governor before the voters today and a federal judge 
refused to throw out georgias runoff election system 
late polls showed young running slightly behind lt gov zell 
miller in the fiveway democratic primary with neither of them 
likely to gain the majority vote required to avoid an aug 7 runoff 
black leaders acting without youngs support had filed a lawsuit 
arguing the runoff system is unfair to blacks who make up about 22 
percent of georgias registered voters 
they asked us district judge richard freeman to declare 
todays top finisher the democratic nominee even if he did not have 
a majority 
but the judge who held a fiveday hearing on the request last 
week today refused to interfere saying he would not issue a 
temporary restraining order that would have immediately blocked the 
runoff he did not set a trial date to consider the issue further 
it was cloudy in atlanta and elsewhere but there was no rain to 
discourage voters early today election officials predicted that 33 
percent of registered voters would cast ballots 
young the former atlanta mayor un ambassador and 
congressman predicted monday he would run more strongly in 
predominantly white areas today than pollsters and other observers 
expect 
a lot of people who say i couldnt get votes in south georgia 
have implied theres something backward about south georgia and i 
think theyve underestimated south georgia again he said in 
columbus were going to surprise people in where we get votes 
miller and state sen roy barnes also expressed optimism as 
they crisscrossed the state monday both are white 
i feel better about this campaign and this race than any of 
the others miller said at a rally in suburban atlanta 
barnes refused to concede defeat despite youngs prediction 
earlier monday that the state senator would support him in a runoff 
against miller 
andy and i have deep philosophical differences said barnes 
who portrayed himself as the conservative alternative to 
taxandspend liberals 
polls have shown state rep johnny isakson with a strong lead in 
the fourman republican gubernatorial race 
gov joe frank harris a democrat is completing his second term 
and cannot seek reelection 
despite the closeness of the race the democratic campaign has 
been a gentlemanly affair free of negative advertising and racial 
appeals even former gov lester maddox a longtime segregationist 
running a longshot campaign deemphasized race as an issue 
young said he didnt attribute the positive nature of the 
campaign to any altruism on the candidates part rather he said 
negative campaigns dont seem to work these days 
i think they would fire away if they thought it would work 
he said 
miller who has made a lottery to raise money for schools his 
signature issue attributed the positive atmosphere to the 
character of the candidates 
and i think it has been good for the state of georgia 
racially miller said you cant get elected in georgia without 
a strong coalition of urban and rural and black and white 
in event of a runoff young will be battling for white support 
a recent poll by the atlanta journalconstitution showed 36 percent 
of likely democratic voters favored miller 30 percent young and 16 
percent barnes the poll had a margin of error of 3 points 
but the poll found that only 14 percent of white voters 
supported young while 45 percent supported miller 
three seats in the us house also are being contested today 
but only one incumbent rep doug barnard has opposition barnard 
a democrat from augusta is a member of the house banking committee 
and has been accused of being too cozy with savings and loan 
officials he faces journalism student scott a starling 
jb stoner a white supremacist who served time for the bombing 
of a black church in alabama is running for lieutenant governor 
but is considered the longest shot of nine candidates in the 
democratic primary

a federal judge today refused to halt georgias 
aug 7 primary runoff despite a challenge by blacks to the states 
majority vote rule saying the opponents had filed too late to 
disrupt this years elections 
the 16page ruling which came as voters were going to the polls 
to choose democratic and republican nominees for governor allows 
the state to hold runoffs if they are needed after todays vote 
an attorney for the black plaintiffs said he could not rule out 
a future court challenge to the outcome of the runoff 
granting an injunction to halt the runoff at this late date 
would significantly disrupt elections at all levels in georgia 
us district judge richard c freeman said in his order 
candidates who signed up for todays primary reasonably 
believed that the majority vote requirement would govern the 1990 
elections freeman said 
but he also said the plaintiffs had raised a legitimate point 
that would have to be decided later 
a coalition of black political and community leaders filed a 
lawsuit in may seeking to abolish georgias majority vote 
requirement on grounds that it discriminates against black voters 
they asked freeman for a preliminary injunction that would have 
halted the aug 7 runoff such a runoff is expected in the 
democratic gubernatorial primary where preelection polls indicate 
no one is likely to get an absolute majority a runoff is 
considered less likely in the republican primary 
among the five democrats in todays governors race was andrew 
young the former atlanta mayor seeking to become georgias first 
black governor a ruling halting the runoff could have favored 
young most observers believe although young did not support the 
lawsuit 
the judge who held a fiveday hearing on the request last week 
did not address the merits of the lawsuit itself in his ruling 
today but he wrote given the evidence presently before the 
court it appears to be a close question as to whether plaintiffs 
will ultimately prevail on the merits of their claims 
laughlin mcdonald an american civil liberties union attorney 
who helped file the suit for the black plaintiffs said the group 
was not likely to appeal freemans decision but he did not rule 
out the possibility of a challenge to the results of the runoff 
when attorneys argue the merits of the case before the judge 
freeman has not set a trial date for the lawsuit 
in his ruling freeman noted that the group filed the lawsuit 
only three months before the aug 7 runoff and at least five years 
after state rep tyrone brooks the lead plaintiff said he had 
viewed the majority vote requirement as racially discriminatory 
brooks testified during the hearing that he had considered the 
requirement discriminatory since 1984 
freeman said he was sympathetic to testimony that the group was 
unable to obtain representation earlier but added the court 
cannot ignore the timing of the filing of plaintiffs suit in 
assessing the equities of this case 
he also said the group had failed to support its contention that 
the court would have to call a special election and unseat 
incumbents who were not plurality winners if it later found that 
the majority vote requirement caused irreparable injury to the 
plaintiffs 
mcdonald said he was not disappointed with todays ruling 
we had two purposes he said one was to try to get an 
injunction to stop the runoff the second was to make certain we 
raised a legally valid objection to the use of the runoff we 
accomplished half of that

the declaration of a tie in the republican 
primary for in a suburban legislative district has forced a lottery 
to determine the winner and ensured an appeal from the loser 
cook county circuit judge francis barth declared the march 20 
primary race which pitted a strongly antiabortion incumbent 
against a prochoice challenger a tie monday after reviewing a 
recount 
the original primary results showed mary mulligan a paralegal 
from des plaines had defeated incumbent rep penny pullen by 31 
votes in the 55th district race 
pullen sued for a recount which barth ordered july 3 the 
recount was conducted last week 
at mondays hearing barth threw out 39 ballots that had not 
registered on the electronic computer system used in punchcard 
voting mat delort an attorney for mulligan said today that with 
the 39 ballots pullen probably would have been ahead 
under illinois law the state board of elections must hold a 
lottery to determine the winner of a tied election the race could 
be decided by the flip of a coin or by pulling a name from a hat 
the board of elections was expected to conduct the lottery this 
week 
but the lottery is not likely to be the final step 
both sides agree there definitely will be an appeal said 
pullens lawyer michael lavelle 
mulligans attorney said each candidate is proceeding with 
campaign plans on the assumption that she will be declared the 
winner 
im very pleased said pullen a seventerm representative 
we live to fight another day 
i think we have a lot of issues that are appealable in our 
favor if it the lottery shouldnt go the right way mulligan 
said in a telephone interview 
lavelle former chairman of the chicago board of election 
commissioners argued monday that the threeday recount completed 
wednesday at the cook county warehouse showed pullen winning by 17 
votes but lawyers for mulligan contended the recount showed a tie 
the victor in the heavily republican district in chicagos north 
suburbs will face democrat robert mucci in the november election

ruling united national independence party the only legal political 
organization in this southern african nation of 75 million people 
ngulube told zambians their vote in the referendum will 
determine the nations future 
this is a critical moment in our historythe future of our

president kenneth kaunda today turned over 
to british officials a british nurse freed at his request from an 
iraqi prison where she was jailed for helping a journalist who was 
hanged as a spy 
daphne parish 53 was driven to the home of british high 
commissioner peter henchliffe after spending the night at state 
house kaundas official residence in the capital lusaka 
she was freed monday after pleas from kaunda 
at a brief ceremony kaunda prevented mrs parish from answering 
reporters questions 
but looking tired and drawn the softspoken nurse thanked 
kaunda for his role in her release from abu ghraib prison in iraq 
the british nurse was sentenced to 15 years in prison as an 
accomplice to farzad bazoft an iranianborn british journalist who 
worked for the observer newspaper 
mrs parish was arrested in september after driving bazoft to 
the aliskandaria military installation outside baghdad 
the observer said bazoft who lived in britain and traveled on 
british documents was trying to check out reports of an explosion 
but iraq said he was a spy and hanged him on march 15 
iraq later confirmed 19 people died in an explosion at a 
military installation 
when asked by reporters about her visit to the military 
installation with bazoft mrs parish said it didnt appear 
improper at the time we didnt do anything i considered illegal 
she said other british journalists had already visited the scene 
and had climbed over a perimeter fence 
we didnt climb over any fences she said as we were 
driving around we saw what appeared like coal dust on the side of 
the road 
bazoft wanted to collect some of the dust and she gave him a 
bottle to put it in 
we did this in full view of cars going up and down we did 
nothing secretly she said 
iraq accused bazoft of collecting soil samples to establish the 
nature of weapons used at the military installation 
parish said she was told by prison guards of her release 
midmorning monday 
i just laughed she said 
she said in the prison where she shared a cell with four other 
inmates prisoners played fortunetelling games by reading tea 
leaves in each others cups 
we said oh yes youll be released this afternoon it was 
a joke so i thought this was just another joke 
kaunda said he sought mrs parishs release on humanitarian 
grounds he did not question the validity of the sentence passed by 
the iraqi court 
kaunda said in a letter to iraqi president saddam hussein dated 
march 11 he also asked for the death sentence passed on bazoft to 
be commuted 
in his letter kaunda said he referred to the deep feelings 
of love and confidence he shared with hussein and asked for the 
release of both mrs parish and bazoft 
at his news conference kaunda also lashed out at the british 
press for what he termed its outrageous coverage of mrs 
parishs release 
he claimed the british press reported that iraqi president 
saddam hussein and myself are using daphne parish to cleanse 
ourselves zambia was never dirty this was a genuine humanitarian 
appeal 
last month the worst civil unrest since zambias independence 
in 1964 erupted over food prices and calls for a westernstyle 
multiparty democracy 
rioting and a bungled coup attempt by mutinous soldiers june 30 
left at least 26 people dead

news that the white house boosted its projection 
of next years budget deficit caused barely a blip in the bond 
market while the stock markets roared ahead to a recordhigh close 
a whisper away from the 3000 mark 
the reaction monday or lack of one wasnt unusual corporate 
economists say considering the executive branchs horrendous track 
record on deficit figures 
private estimates both on wall street and elsewhere have been 
very large and the market knew that said james l kochan chief 
bond market strategist at merrill lynch amp co 
kochan said white house budget reports have always been viewed 
with a high degree of skepticism as being somewhat tainted or being 
overly optimistic 
the white house increased its forecast of the deficit for the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 to 1688 billion 2314 billion if 
savings and loan bailout costs are counted 
the figure is 10 billion higher than the bush administrations 
informal estimate of a month ago and up sharply from januarys 
1005 billion estimate 
news of a greater deficit often weakens bond prices because it 
implies the need for more government borrowing which in turn can 
drive up interest rates higher rates tend to decrease the value of 
fixedreturn investments such as bonds 
but bond prices closed virtually unchanged monday and remained 
flat this morning the stock market meanwhile continued its 
rally the dow jones industrial average closed monday at 299975 
up 1955 and gained an additional 743 points in early trading 
this morning standing at 300718 as of 11 am 
analysts said the stock market was driven by prospects of lower 
interest rates as well as by a belief that corporate profits for 
the second quarter will be higher 
jerry jordan chief economist at first interstate bancorp in los 
angeles said wall street typically has two reactions to white 
house projections of budget shortfalls both a yawn for the 
marke 
if the white house is simply coming up with projections that 
are in line with what private forecasters have been saying then it 
doesnt affect the market he said if its different than what 
the consensus is then we just disregard it because its politics 
besides everyone knows the white house doesnt have any 
authority on budgetary matters jordan said adding the real work 
takes place in congress 
irwin l kellner chief economist for manufacturers hanover 
trust co said the congressional budget office came out with 
figures in may that are similar to those released monday by the 
administration 
the markets have learned to believe the congressional budget 
office they tend to be more accurate he said 
the markets view the white house budget report as more of a 
political than economic document kellner said 
for example he said the report contains what he called an 
optimistic rate of economic growth for next fiscal year along with 
lower interest rates 
white house documents always seem to be rosy scenarios he 
said 
kochan of merrill lynch said the bond market in particular has 
more on its mind these days than the budget shortfall chiefly it 
is concerned with remarks last week by federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan who indicated the central bank may ease interest 
rates to compensate for a perceived credit crunch in the banking 
system 
the bond markets have known for some time about how large the 
budget deficit was going to be kochan said

olympic diving champion greg louganis sets a 
good athletic example for many youngsters for starters he 
cautions that they not just plunge in but think ahead 
know the water depth before you dive tops the list of 
louganis diving tips 
that sounds simple and in pools the water depth may be marked 
on the sid but just looking into the water can be deceptive and 
in lakes and ponds care is especially important 
rocks partly sunken logs and other hidden obstructions can lurk 
beneath the surface and the water may simply not be as deep as 
people think 
never dive where you dont know the depth or where there may be 
obstructions once a dive is started there is no time to change or 
think 
remember when diving down into water steer up with hands 
never dive into an aboveground pool or into the shallow end of 
any pool nine out of 10 diving injuries occur when people dive 
into water less than six feet deep according to the national 
swimming pool foundation 
often injuries follow when inexperienced people do back dives 
dive through objects such as inner tubes or try fancy dives 
one crucial warning never dive or swim alone 
anyone can get into trouble in the water and the best insurance 
policy is a friend to pull you out if necessary 
children are particularly vulnerable according to the national 
spa and pool institute but the safety measure that best protects 
them is simple a watchful adult on hand at all times 
nothing can replace a watchful parent grandparent neighbor or 
babysitter when it comes to make sure a child is safe in the water 
its easy for horseplay to get out of hand so the american 
academy of pediatrics urges setting rules around water running 
pushing and similar roughhousing should be banned 
be sure everyone leaves the water and finds a safe shelter in 
the event of a thunderstorm also 
good fences make safe pools ensuring that people cant get to 
the pool fall in and drown when no one is available to save them 
many communities have laws setting minimum sizes for pool 
fences at the least the spa and pool institute recommends a 
barrier tall enough to prevent youngsters from climbing over and 
dont place tables chairs and other items nearby that could be 
used to climb over the fence 
doors gates and other entry points need secure latches 
finally post the number for emergency assistance near the 
telephone and learn to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
just in case in fact make sure anyone who supervises the pool 
knows cpr

evicted from her twoyear campsite 
protester jacqueline smith has set up a new sidewalk residence near 
the memphis motel where martin luther king jr was murdered but 
authorities said today that she may be evicted from there too 
police inspector david dugger said police have issued a summons 
accusing ms smith of blocking a city sidewalk ms smith will have 
a court hearing sept 5 and the city will seek an order for her 
removal if she is found guilty he said 
before the summons was announced ms smith had said she was 
setting up a new camp because this protest must continue 
on monday sheriffs deputies enforcing a court order evicted 
ms smith from the construction site of a museum being built at the 
lorraine motel the construction company obtained the order last 
week after convincing a judge that she was in the way 
she had camped in front of the lorraine since deputies evicted 
her from the motel itself on march 2 1988 
the motel was shut down in january 1988 to make way for the 
national civil rights center scheduled to open july 4 1991 
ms smith 39 contends that kings memory would be better 
served if the lorraine were used as housing for the homeless or 
other social purpose rather than as a museum 
a halfdozen sheriffs deputies waded through about 50 gawkers 
news reporters and supporters of ms smith to pluck her from a lawn 
chair at her camp two female carried her across the street and 
deposited her at the curb there 
she did not resist and no one was arrested 
tom marshall a deputy chief with the shelby county sheriffs 
department said the court order required only that she leave the 
construction site 
construction workers moved her tent and other belongings into 
the street and closed in a chainlink fence behind her 
shortly after the eviction ms smith reestablished her camp 
but on the opposite side of the small side street which runs in 
front of the lorraine 
the lorraine was crumbling in disrepair in 1982 when a group of 
citizens brought it at a foreclosure auction they spent the next 
several years persuading the state county and city governments to 
built the museum

more than 160 members of congress expressed 
support tuesday for irans opposition movement criticizing what 
they called tehrans medieval dictatorship 
rep mervyn m dymally dcalif initiated the letter to 
massoud rajavi leader of the iraqibased peoples mujahedeen of 
iran it was signed by 100 house democrats and 62 republicans 
the lawmakers offered condolences to rajavi over the april 
machinegun killing of his brother kazem rajavi by an iranian squad 
in switzerland 
swiss police have said that one or more iranian government 
services were involved in the assassination but are continuing the 
investigation 
rajavis widow michelle met here last week with dymally and 
other members of congress to discuss allegations of the iranian 
governments involvement in the killing 
dr rajavis assassination is but more proof of tehrans 
continuing insistence to use terrorism as the principal and 
indispensable pillar of its foreign policy the letter said 
decisiveness is required to confront tehrans medieval 
dictatorship 
the lawmakers asked rajavi to assure your countrymen that we 
support their peaceful and democratic aims of replacing the 
government 
the us administration has had occasional contacts with the 
mujahedeen partly in an effort to obtain information about events 
in iran but it has refused to officially endorse the organization 
or any other opposition group despite its acrimonious relationship 
with the government in tehran 
diplomatic ties with iran were severed after the us embassy 
staff was taken hostage in 1979 by the islamic revolutionaries who 
overthrew the prowestern government of the late shah reza pahlavi 
since then the relationship has been confined to us efforts 
to obtain the release of american hostages held by tehransponsored 
moslem shiite extremists in lebanon 
us officials have been disappointed that the death of irans 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has not seemed 
to moderate the enmity toward the united states 
the united states joined other countries in providing supplies 
to help victims of the earthquake that killed an estimated 40000 
people last month but iranian officials said the us help while 
appreciated would not improve overall ties 
one year after the death of khomeini the iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani has proven that he is as immoderate as khomeini 
by continuing the repressive and terrorist policies of his 
mentor the lawmakers wrote 
they also denounced a report issued last year by a special un 
envoy sent to investigate accusations of gross human rights 
violations by the iranian government the teams findings were 
described in the letter as a whitewash and a disgrace to the 
united nations 
among those who signed the letter were republican whip newt 
gingrich of georgia and reps ron dellums dcalif edward 
feighan dohio and jan meyers rkan

president bush today gave nasa administrator 
richard truly a vote of confidence for running the troubled agency 
truly predicted space shuttle flights will resume within a month 
now that scientists have identified unrelated hydrogen leaks on two 
of the vehicles 
i have great confidence in dick truly so lay that part of 
the question to rest bush said explaining the administrations 
decision to have a panel of outside experts look at nasas 
longrange plans 
i have confidence in nasa bush added its a perilous 
business i guess anytime you put people up there into space but 
the record has been very good 
bush spoke at a questionandanswer session with magazine 
publishers separately truly appeared on abcs good morning 
america and discussed problems leading to the grounding of the 
space shuttles 
the president said he went semiballistic when he read 
weekend news reports suggesting there would be an investigation of 
nasa 
what we are doing is asking him truly to form an outside 
committee of the best minds he can find to look at the future not 
go try to assign blame because a mission is delayed getting off the 
ground bush said 
these shots are highly complex the president added we 
have been the leaders in space and i want to see us continue to be 
the leaders in space 
truly said recent problems with the space shuttle turned out to 
be less complicated than originally feared 
as it turned out it was just the terrible coincidence of two 
separate specific leaks we have found them both and now since it 
did involve two orbiters and two payloads were now just looking 
at schedules to see what is the most effective way to get back to 
flight 
he said a new flight schedule probably will be announced later 
today or tomorrow and predicted that flights will resume by 
midaugust or the first of september 
the system didnt go down for three years like it did after 
challenger it went down for three or four weeks he said 
nasa grounded the space shuttle fleet after a hydrogen leak was 
found in columbia in may and another leak was found on atlantis 
last month columbia which had been poised for launch on an 
astronomy mission was rolled back to the hanger and partially 
dismantled the part that was leaking has now been replaced 
atlantis remains on the pad and nasa officials said its leak may be 
repaired without taking the shuttle back to the hangar 
truly acknowledged that problems with the shuttle and the hubble 
telescope could prompt the public to question nasas competence 
but said a management review panel announced monday is intended to 
look at longrange plans rather than secondguess recent problems 
he said vice president dan quayle fully understands that these 
recent events have been separate events that didnt have anything 
to do with each other 
what we talked about most was the future where were going in 
future years and how a nasa of the future might be structured and 
how we could get advice on where it would move to said truly 
we agreed to do something we both thought was the right thing to 
do and that is get in a few people that have some real top 
experience in both government and industry management and report to 
me and take a look at where we might go in the future 
however the bush administrations decision to have an outside 
panel study the nations longterm space goals is getting a cool 
reception from some lawmakers 
after a weekend of rumors that the administration was going to 
ask some fundamental questions about nasa we now find it will 
create yet another group said sen albert gore dtenn 
chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the space program 
the panel which is being appointed in response to a spate of 
recent embarrassments to the national aeronautics and space 
administration will report to quayle head of the national space 
council 
is it too much to ask that in the wake of these multiple 
mistakes that president bush should do what president reagan did 
not do after the challenger tragedy give personal attention to 
the problems at nasa gore sad 
rep michael andrews dtexas also said strong leadership not 
another study is needed to solve the problems in the space program 
sen barbara mikulski dmd chairwoman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee that has oversight responsibility for 
nasa summoned truly and former space agency administrator james 
beggs to a hearing wednesday 
nasa needs congressional support to continue the 32 billion 
space station scheduled for a critical design review this year a 
planned earth study called mission to planet earth and the 
presidents announced goal of a permanent manned base on the moon 
and an expedition to mars 
the agencys setbacks in recent months included the finding that 
one or both of the mirrors on the hubble space telescope were 
ground incorrectly making a precise focus of the telescope 
impossible in addition the space shuttle fleet has been grounded 
while engineers pursue leaks that were discovered when two of the 
three orbiters were being fueled 
there were reports last weekend that bush planned to restructure 
the agency but the decision announced by quayles office was far 
less sweeping a study by experts who have not yet been named 
contrary to some published reports there is no white house 
investigation of nasa the statement said 
it said the administration was calling for the outside study 
because we all want the best ideas on how we can move into the 
next century maintaining our leadership in space

andrew young bidding to become georgias first 
black governor competed tuesday in a genteel fiveway democratic 
primary that seemed likely to send him into a runoff against lt 
gov zell miller 
young a onetime aide to martin luther king jr who went on to 
be a congressman ambassador to the united nations and mayor of 
atlanta hoped to follow in the footseps of l douglas wilder of 
virginia wilder last year became the nations first elected black 
governor 
early indications tuesday pointed to a moderate turnout 
election officials had predicted about a third of the states 
registered voters would take part in the primary 
the campaign was notably short on mudslinging or negative 
advertising race was mentioned far less than such issues as 
abortion legalized gambling and the economy 
recent polls showed young running slightly behind miller a 
moderate who has enjoyed black support in his 16 years in the 
states no 2 job 
georgia law provides for an aug 7 runoff between the top two 
candidates unless one wins a majority in the primary 
young predicted monday he would run more strongly in 
predominantly white areas than pollsters and other observers 
expected 
a lot of people who say i couldnt get votes in south georgia 
have implied theres something backward about south georgia and i 
think theyve underestimated south georgia again he said in 
columbus were going to surprise people in where we get votes 
about 25 percent of georgias voting age population is black 
miller 58 made himself the principal advocate of an issue of 
growing popularity in the state legalization of a state lottery 
young also 58 stressed his experience traveling the world to 
bring business to atlanta and said economic development was a cause 
that could bring blacks and whites together 
on monday young suggested that miller was too combative to get 
his lottery proposal through the legislature young said he would 
persuade the legislature to let voters decide the idea although he 
personally opposes it 
young and miller supported abortion rights state sen roy 
barnes 42 third in opinion polls advocated restrictions on 
abortion and called young and miller tax and spend liberals 
the democratic field also included state rep lauren bubba 
mcdonald 51 and former gov lester maddox the 74yearold 
onetime arch segregationist 
black officials supported by the american civil liberties union 
but not by young had sued to block a runoff complaining that it 
discriminated against blacks but us district judge richard 
freeman on tuesday rejected their request to halt runoffs until the 
lawsuit is decided 
in the republican primary state rep johnny isakson 45 a real 
estate executive from the north atlanta suburbs was a heavy 
favorite against three challengers the wellfinanced isakson is 
regarded as the most serious republican threat in years to the 
democratic lock on the governors mansion 
the only congressional incumbent with primary opposition was 
rep doug barnard a democrat from augusta who serves on the house 
banking committee and was accused by opponents of being too cozy 
with savings and loan officials barnard was opposed by journalism 
student scott a starling of athens two republicans sought to 
oppose him in november 
jb stoner a white supremacist who served time in prison for 
the bombing of a black church in alabama ran for the democratic 
nomination for lieutenant governor but he was not regarded as a 
serious contender eight other democrats were in the race

democratic gov joe frank harris is completing the state limit 
of two fouryear terms and remained neutral in the primary 
young borrowing from wilders strategy in virginia linked 
himself strongly to the prochoice cause using television ads late 
in the campaign to go after votes of abortion rights supporters 
miller too staked out a prochoice position as did mcdonald 
only maddox and barnes positioned themselves against abortion 
rights 
barnes attacked miller with a willie horton tactic he 
accused the lieutenant governor of voting 16 years ago as a member 
of the state clemency board to free a prisoner who later committed 
murder 
miller said he acted on 4000 cases and didnt remember that one 
horton a convicted murderer in massachusetts who fled while on 
a weekend furlough and later was accused of rape was used by 
republicans during the 1988 presidential campaign to depict gov 
michael dukakis as soft on crime

and perjury trial that she started giving cocaine to the mayor in 
1983 and last provided it to him a week or two before his jan 18 
arrest in an fbi sting operation 
the reluctant prosecution witness bettye smith flew to 
washington earlier in the day by order of a us magistrate in 
chattanooga tenn where she had been undergoing treatment for 
stress at a psychiatric hospital 
testifying under a court order smith told the jury at barrys 
trial that she and the mayor snorted cocaine powder at her 
residence on capitol hill maybe five times in 1983 and up to 
half a dozen times in each succeeding year 
but she said we skipped the latter part of 1987 and all of 
1988 after press coverage surrounding a thanksgiving 1987 trip 
barry made to the bahamas smith was in the bahamas with barry and 
other friends 
i didnt see him for a while after that trip she said in 
the earlier years she said barry used cocaine in front of her in 
her home starting in 1986 she said the mayor took it into the 
bathroom alone 
early this january was the last time she offered cocaine to him 
she said the mayor took a package of cocaine into the bathroom and 
after a short time came out again and handed the package back to 
her she said 
on jan 18 former model rasheeda moore persuaded barry to come 
to her room at the vista hotel where the mayor was arrested after 
being videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
moore was a former girlfriend of barrys smith said that she 
and barry were close friends but that their relationship was not 
a sexual friendship 
on crossexamination by barrys lawyers sh said she never saw 
barry use or have possession of cocaine in the bahamas and she 
said she never provided the mayor with crack a particular form of 
cocaine 
smiths attorney had asked that the magistrate delay her 
transfer to washington he presented a letter from her doctor 
stating that travel might be dangerous because of her mental and 
emotional state 
in washington us district court judge thomas penfield jackson 
on monday ordered the execution of a bench warrant for smith who 
had been scheduled to testify last week until she was hospitalized 
in chattanooga 
testimony by the woman a friend of barry would relate to one 
of the 14 criminal charges against barry that he possessed cocaine

conspiracy and three counts of lying to a grand jury the first 11 
are misdemeanors the last three felonies 
prosecutors say they will end their case with the testimony of 
smith and doris crenshaw another friend of the mayor 
the defense is preparing to open its case wednesday and plans 
testimony from 10 to 15 witnesses said mundy 
attorneys outside the case said the only effective way to defend 
the mayor is to focus on the aggressive tactics the government used 
to prosecute him several said emphatically that barry himself 
should not take the stand 
the defense should emphasize the contention that if he werent 
the mayor they wouldnt have come after him said g allen dale 
a private attorney who handles drug cases 
former us attorney joseph digenova who pursued several 
criminal investigations of barry said the mayor would be 
destroyed on crossexamination if put on the witness stand in his 
own defense digenova now is a lawyer in private practice barrys

the united states on tuesday pledged 3 million to 
help libya fight a deadly fly infestation that is a potential 
threat to wildlife and livestock in much of africa 
the united states led other nations in committing funds but the 
fundraising effort fell far short of the money needed to carry out 
the eradication un officials said 
so far the screwworm fly has not spread beyond northern libya 
where it was first spotted in july 1988 but experts say it could 
spread quickly 
a conference had aimed at raising 917 million according to 
its organizers the un food and agriculture organization and the 
international fund for agricultural development 
but only 31 million was pledged at the conference which was 
attended by representatives from 26 nations a statement by the two 
romebased agencies said 
in addition to the money sought by the conference libya will 
provide 25 million organizers said 
the eradication plan calls for unleashing tens of millions of 
sterilized screwworm flies in libya matings then will yield no 
offspring and the insect which eats away at the flesh of its 
victims will die out 
despite the failure to raise all the funds the sterile fly 
release is expected to get under way in september a fao official 
said 
us sanctions against libya including a ban on american travel 
there complicated planning to wipe out the fly us technology is 
needed to carry out the program and supervision by american 
experts was considered essential to its success 
after delicate discussions washington agreed to allow both the 
technology and personnel to go to libya 
us officials said they agreed to help for humanitarian reasons 
and because an international organization will carry it out 
west germany pledged the equivalent of 27 million followed by 
britain with a 18million pledge

a woman who was nearly killed in an attack in 
central park climbed unsteadily onto the witness stand to describe 
the lasting effects of an assault she does not remember 
the 30yearold investment banker testified monday that her 
battered body gives her constant reminders of the attack 15 months 
ago as the trial continued today a detective testified that one 
of the defendants admitted participating but said he did not rape 
the woman 
the woman whose identify is not being disclosed by the media 
because of the nature of the assault was making her first public 
appearance at the trial of three teenagers accused of taking part 
in the socalled wilding attack 
on the witness stand she listed lingering physical problems 
including impaired balance loss of her sense of smell and vision 
troubles despite plastic surgery she has long jagged scar on the 
side of her face where she was beaten into submission 
antron mccray raymond santana and yusef salaam all 16 are 
charged with attempted murder rape sexual abuse assault robbery 
and riot in separate attacks on the woman and two men who were 
jogging through the park on the night of april 19 1989 
today police detective humberto arroyo testified that he took a 
statement from santana in the presence of his grandmother the day 
after the attack 
santana said that kevin richardson threw the jogger to the 
ground and had sex with her and that steven lopez beat her with a 
brick richardson and lopez are among three youths who are to be 
tried later 
when she was on the floor i grabbed her breasts santana 
said in the statement i did not have sex with her 
in the statement as recounted by arroyo santana told how he and 
other youths convened northeast of central park the evening of the 
attack with the plan of robbing joggers and cyclists 
in crossexamination the defense said the boy should not have 
been questioned only in the presence of his grandmother because she 
does not speak english well but arroyo said he read santana his 
rights in spanish as well as english 
as the woman testified monday the defendants looked at their 
hands fiddled with pens or stared into space she was on the stand 
about 10 minutes 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer showed the woman 
the tshirt she was wearing when she was attacked it is now almost 
completely brown with dried blood 
thats the shirt that i used to wear the woman said 
police have testified that the tshirt was used to bind and gag 
the woman while she was raped and bludgeoned 
the woman has recovered enough to return to work at salomon 
brothers inc 
state judge thomas b galligan told the sketch artists in court 
not to portray the woman clearly he said her worries about being 
identified from sketches were justified 
she said she did not remember entering the park to run the night 
she was assaulted and her first memory afterward was waking up in 
the hospital on memorial day weekend 
defense attorneys did not crossexamine the woman 
in the long run i think her testimony helps us the fact that 
she came in and couldnt identify any of the defendants and could 
not even remember going to the park santanas lawyer peter 
rivera said outside court 
the three youths are being tried in an adult court but if 
convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10 
years in prison

the court that oversees independent counsels 
today widened the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor 
investigating allegations of political favoritism by former housing 
secretary samuel r pierce jr 
the jurisdiction of independent counsel arlin m adams was 
widened to include pierces administration of the urban development 
action grant program and the secretarys discretionary fund for 
technical assistance and special projects 
adams was appointed march 1 to investigate allegations that 
pierce and top aides conspired to defraud the government by showing 
political favoritism in the operation of the moderate 
rehabilitation program 
the courts order made public today expanded adams jurisdiction 
along the lines requested by attorney general dick thornburgh to 
include the operation of the two other programs 
thornburgh sought the expanded jurisdiction after the justice 
department reviewed the congressional testimony of dubois l 
gilliam a former assistant hud secretary who told lawmakers that 
politics was an important criteria for awarding grants through udag 
and the discretionary fund 
the court said in a statement that it had also moderately 
expanded adams jurisdiction to investigate the moderate 
rehabilitation program the statement did not specify how that 
jurisdiction was changed 
pierce who headed the department of housing and urban 
development under president reagan has denied any wrongdoing in 
the award of grants or rent subsidies 
but gilliam and other witnesses told a house government 
operations subcommittee that grants went to politically connected 
developers

no more adding in your head trying to 
figure whether that last 10 bill will cover five frozen dinners 
and a bag of dog food 
supermarkets in three states have been testing grocery carts 
equipped with calculators to help couponclipping consumers keep 
within their budgets that is if they can get the gadgets to work 
publix which owns 370 florida supermarkets bolted 200 
calculators to cart handles at a new store in lakeland and 156 
others to baskets at an established clearwater store near a 
sprawling retirement complex 
the sites were picked for their diverse customers said bob 
mcdermott spokesman for publix the nations eighthlargest 
supermarket chain 
in a random sampling of some 30 shoppers at the clearwater 
store people said they liked the idea but often found the gadget 
a hassle 
some shoppers didnt know how to use the checkbooksize device 
which has a keypad and display window on one side and advertising 
space on the other others got it to work but with mixed results 
i tried using it said vicki bartholomew an insurance 
worker with six items in her basket a melon cat food potatoes 
grapes coffee and cottage cheese 
my total came up to 10930 and i run a computer at work 
she said 
julie snider a retiree who moved to florida from denver 10 
years ago said theyd be great if they worked properly 
three times i started the darn thing and something screws up 
and its back to zero she said they shouldnt do that to 
aggravate the old people 
but coupon shopper gail schueren is a believer 
i love them she said i dont have to worry about whether 
i have a scrap of paper and a pencil to keep track of the 
discounts and so far in a couple of weeks ive only run into one 
that didnt work right 
the shopper calculator is marketed by addvantage media group of 
tulsa okla which during the past two years has tested the device 
in oklahoma and alaska the florida tests began about two months 
ago 
the retailer pays from 13 to 25 for each calculator depending 
on how many it buys the advertising space is meant to make up for 
the cost 
the calculators being tested in florida are already obsolete and 
upgraded ones should arrive in august or september said mike 
brennan vice president of addvantage 
weve researched it and we also have to have instructional 
posters to help people understand what to do he said weve 
made significant changes the new ones have a new keypad new chip 
and new design

six army soldiers missing from their 
posts with an intelligence unit in west germany have been 
apprehended in florida as a result of a traffic violation and are 
under investigation authorities said 
due to the fact they had access to classified materials within 
the last six months a counterintelligence investigation has been 
initiated maj joe padilla an army spokesman at the pentagon 
said monday 
bob hall a spokesman for defense secretary dick cheney said 
the counterintelligence investigation was routine in the sense 
that it is required in cases involving people with access to 
classified information he said he could not comment beyond saying 
the army says this does not appear to be an espionage case 
no charges had yet been filed against the six soldiers padilla 
said he said no decision had been made on whether the 
absentwithoutauthorization allegation would encompass absent 
without leave or the more serious charge of desertion 
all six were from the 701st military intelligence brigade at 
augsburg west germany padilla said he could not say exactly what 
jobs they performed at the 701st but said their training was in 
analyzing foreign communications 
hall said the disappearance of the six came to our attention 
on july 9 he would not say whether that was when they left west 
germany he and padilla both said they did not know how the six got 
to florida from west germany or what they were doing in gulf breeze 
padilla said the six are believed to belong to an organization 
called the end of the world but he said he had no information 
about the group and could not say if it had any significance in the 
investigation 
the soldiers were taken to the stockade at fort benning ga 
said padilla 
a police officer in this florida panhandle city stopped a van 
late friday because its tail lights were not working said police 
chief jerry brown 
the driver of the van had no drivers license and warrants

the school board has appointed william anton 
a longtime administrator as superintendent he is the first latino 
to head the nations secondlargest school district 
at a closed meeting monday the board also approved spending an 
estimated 225000 to buy out the remaining 11 months of 
superintendent leonard brittons contract 
britton 59 announced last week he was quitting the 
164555ayear job he said he would leave as of june 30 1991 
the buyout would include salary and unused vacation time 
anton a 65yearold deputy superintendent accepted a 
threeyear contract and will take over friday 
i believe he has good leadership skills and that is 
important said mark slavkin one of six board members who voted 
for anton if anyone can bring this district together at this 
critical time bill is the one to do that 
julie korenstein was the lone board member to vote against the 
appointment 
it was simply railroaded through she said the board did 
not do any interviewing except for one person i think the process 
stunk 
the district also should not have bought out brittons contract 
during the current budget crisis she said the board recently cut 
220 million from its 199091 budget 
britton who previously was superintendent of the dade county 
fla school system was the first superintendent to be hired from 
outside the los angeles district in 40 years 
anton who began his career in the district as a teacher in 
1952 was passed up as superintendent in favor of britton three 
years ago 
in november anton announced he was retiring but withdrew the 
letter at the urging of many district workers teachers parents 
and community members 
as superintendent he will have to contend with the budget an 
ethnically diverse student population overcrowded schools and 
calls to break up the 610000student district into smaller units 
one of my big challenges is to be sure it doesnt happen he

subliminal messages such as try suicide 
lets be dead and do it in a song by the heavy metal band 
judas priest led two young men to shoot themselves in a suicide 
pact their parents lawyers say 
members of the british rock group deny any such messages were 
hidden in their music 
they and cbs records are being sued by parents of the men 
raymond belknap and james vance 
the parents contend the young men hatched the suicide plot as 
they drank smoked marijuana and listened to the album stained 
class and particularly the song better by you better than 
me in 1985 
what pushed the boys over the edge to eternity was the 
subliminal push vivian lynch the vance familys attorney said 
during opening arguments monday this was not a suicide this was 
an adventure a journey to a better place what they planned was 
good because judas priest said it was good 
there is no subliminal content on the stained class album 
countered defense attorney suellen fulstone i say that 
unequivocally and we will prove that unequivocally 
the nonjury trial is being heard by state district judge jerry 
carr whitehead 
vances mother phyllis testified today that her son found 
religion in 1983 at a christian camp and threw away his collection 
of rock albums 
but she said he turned belligerent when he again began listening 
to judas priests music 
hed attack me like a dog when she tried to turn off the 
music which he played so loud it could be heard down the street 
she said 
i was embarrassed she said i told him i thought it was 
garbage 
previously in similar lawsuits across the country judges have 
dismissed cases after ruling that artistic messages are protected 
by the first amendment but those cases did not involve alleged 
subliminal messages which are said to influence people not even 
aware they heard them 
whitehead has ruled that freedom of speech protections would not 
apply to subliminal messages he said he was not convinced the 
hidden messages actually exist on the album but left the argument 
to attorneys 
the lawsuit is proceeding as a products liability case with the 
band and record company accused of negligence and reckless conduct 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages 
two days before christmas 1985 belknap 18 held a sawedoff 
shotgun to his chin and died instantly from a single blast vance 
20 blew away the lower portion of his face he died three years 
later of complications from his injuries and a reaction to 
medication 
ken mckenna the belknaps attorney said vance and belknap were 
chanting do it do it before heading for the church playground 
where the shooting took place and that vance again chanted it 
moments before he pulled the trigger

their suicide pact

better by you better than me is not a suicide song there are no 
suicide songs on this album 
she said that the two young men did not have time to listen to 
the album repeatedly as claimed and that belknap initiated the 
shooting because he was depressed over losing his job

he said he and other band members were disturbed by the deaths 
but could not be held responsible

prosecutors will not file charges against 
two earth first activists arrested in connection with a pipe bomb 
explosion that injured them two months ago a defense lawyer said 
today 
douglas horngrad a lawyer for darryl cherney said alameda 
county deputy district attorney chris carpenter told him in a 
telephone conversation that no charges would be filed against 
either cherney or judi bari 
i cant speak for the prosecutors but we view their action as 
confirmation of judi and darryls innocence horngrad said we 
believe the oakland police department never had the evidence 
against them 
a spokeswoman for carpenter said the prosecutor would not 
comment until later today 
bari and cherney have contended that the car bomb explosion may 
24 in oakland was in retaliation for their work in organizing 
redwood summer protests against the lumber industry 
authorities had suggested that to the contrary it had been 
their own bomb that accidentally went off while they were driving 
and cherney and bari were initially arrested for investigation of 
explosives possession 
from the moment the bomb went off under judis seat the 
oakland police department launched an investigation directed at 
them solely because they are political activists according to a 
joint statement issued by horngrad and susan jordan a lawyer 
representing bari 
the oakland police department has conducted an unprecedented 
and outrageous smear campaign in an attempt to discredit earth 
first and redwood summer the statement said 
bari who suffered a broken pelvis in the explosion was 
released from oaklands highland hospital last week but is 
receiving medical treatment at an undisclosed medical facility 
a hospital spokeswoman said tuesday 
horngrad said he has not been able to reach cherney with the 
news 
i hope hes heard the news he should be gratified but not 
relieved because the person who put the bomb in the car is still at 
large horngrad said 
authorities have not publicly identified any other suspects 
mike roselle a founder of the environmental group said he 
understood the prosecution decided against filing charges because 
nails used to construct the homemade bomb did not match those found 
in baris house 
he did not say that was the only reason roselle said

a confidential report on sen dave 
durenberger submitted to the ethics committee by its special 
counsel gives substantial weight to statements by his close 
associates in concluding he should be denounced for financial 
misconduct 
key documents highlighted in the report by robert s bennett 
were described to the associated press by sources who had read it 
the sources commented only on condition of anonymity 
the report is expected to figure prominently in the sixmember 
committees deliberations on durenberger rminn 
were meeting wednesday stay tuned committee vice 
chairman warren b rudman rnh said tuesday 
durenberger commenting meanwhile on wcco radio in minneapolis 
said the committee ought to do what ive done acknowledge 
that ive done wrong and they ought to characterize it for people 
so that it can guide others conduct in the future 
bennetts report supports an oral presentation he gave the 
committee last month when he said durenberger had broken senate 
rules and should be denounced 
if the committee finds that durenberger broke senate rules or 
federal law it could rebuke him in a letter or recommend that the 
full senate do so in a formal vote 
such a move by the senate would have no surface effect on his 
duties but could generate severe political damage back home the 
ethics committee also could recommend to durenbergers republican 
colleagues in the senate that they strip him of seniority or 
positions of responsibility such as key committee assignments 
according to those who have seen the lengthy report key 
statements cited by bennett include those of charles kahn iii 
durenbergers legislative assistant for health policy anne kelly 
planning the former personal secretary and scheduler michael c 
mahoney his personal attorney and paul overgaard his onetime 
campaign manager 
bennett also focused on statements from a tobacco institute 
representative former republican sen marlow cook of kentucky 
and other trade association representatives who invited durenberger 
to speak for a fee according to the sources 
the investigation centers on allegations that durenberger 
violated senate rules and federal law by disguising regular fee 
speeches as promotions for his two books accepting free limousine 
rides in excess of gift limits accepting reimbursements for 
staying in a minneapolis condominium that he partly owned and later 
arranging a bogus sale of the condo unit 
durenberger has acknowledged breaking some rules but said he 
never intended to do so and asked that any punishment be light 
ms planning the former secretary and scheduler said she did 
not recall any group inviting the senator to give a book promotion 
speech 
she said she placed all speaking invitations into the same 
folder and the senator would indicate whether the speech was to 
be treated as an honorarium speech or a piranha press speech 
piranha press published durenbergers books 
bennett also cited an affidavit from cook who as a tobacco 
institute representative invited durenberger to one of the first 
appearances after the book promotion deal became operational 
there was no discussion of the senators books or publisher 
during the conversation cook said adding that durenberger never 
mentioned or displayed the books during the address 
bennett mentioned kahn the former health policy aide for 
saying he didnt recall any group inviting the senator to promote 
his books and was not aware of the criteria used to 
differentiate between a book promotion and a speech for honoraria 
honoraria speeches are subject to the limits that durenberger is 
accused of exceeding legitimate bookpromotion appearances would 
be exempt 
in several appearances before health care groups kahn told the 
committee durenberger had to acknowledge he hadnt even completed 
the health care book he was supposed to be promoting he told the 
organizations that his earlier book on defense policy was for sale 
in concluding that durenberger deceived the senate to protect 
his condominium reimbursements bennett cited statements by 
mahoney acting as the senators attorney by overgaard whose 
company bought the condominium and durenbergers own writings 
bennett noted that mahoney told the committee he cautioned 
durenberger in 1986 that he couldnt find any support for 
reimbursements the lawmaker had been receiving from the senate 
since 1983 durenberger at the time owned the condominium with a 
friend 
bennett also noted that in july 1987 durenberger himself 
confided to two friends in a letter than he believed he had relied 
on shaky or misleading legal advice in establishing the 
condominium arrangement 
bennett cited statements by overgaard to conclude that the 1987 
sale of the condominium was a sham concocted to let the payments 
continue overgaard said the sale became effective in april 1987 
through an oral agreement between himself and the senator 
but bennett included documents showing the legal papers 
completing the deal werent signed for another 2 years 
one document showed that overgaard was so frustrated with 
durenbergers delays in sending him the papers to finalize the deal 
that he threatened to pull out of the sale 
in a september 1989 letter to the senator overgaard wrote 
the last thing i need is to get involved in your ethics 
investigation and be accused of participating in a sham transaction 
by which you collect per diem on a residence you actually own

the soviet media left many citizens in the dark 
tuesday about president mikhail s gorbachevs agreement to allow a 
united germany to join nato 
muscovites interviewed in a city park who were aware of the 
development said they approved but admitted to doubts about the 
nation they fought during world war ii 
its good for stabilizing the situation in europe said a 
72yearold retired engineer but on the other hand if i am to 
speak openly i fought for five years and i fear the germans 
despite a recent press law banning censorship most newspapers 
limited their coverage to a sketchy report by the official tass 
news agency 
tass reported that west germany had agreed that troops would be 
cut following the reunification of east germany and west germany 
but did not mention gorbachevs reversal on the thorny issue of a 
unified germanys membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the government newspaper izvestia published the barebones tass 
report but it also printed an article by its own berlin 
correspondent titled the route to unification is open 
the dispatch quoted west german chancellor helmut kohl as saying 
the soviet union had given the longawaited green light for a 
united germanys membership in nato 
the joint news conference at which kohl announced the 
breakthrough was televised live but subsequent television reports 
about the monday meeting between gorbachev and kohl were no more 
informative than most of tuesdays newspapers 
state television broadcast an interview with kohl and gorbachev 
offering optimistic comments just before their final session both 
were comfortably clad in sweaters unusual informality for 
gorbachev 
the lengthy report then showed the two leaders walking in a 
mountain meadow driving to a news conference and saying goodbye 
at the airport the announcer said results of their negotiations 
were revealed at the news conference which had been broadcast live 
earlier 
but the announcer left those who had not seen the conference 
guessing about what had happened 
i heard only that they met and then went for a walk said a 
23yearold woman enjoying the sunshine between rainstorms tuesday 
afternoon but what they said on the walk its not known to 
anybody 
radio moscows english broadcast did say the united germany 
will be able to decide what blocs or alliances it wants to belong 
to and admitted that it would likely be nato 
the emphasis in all soviet media was on sections of the 
agreement that promise a reduction in german troops and a future 
nonaggression pact between nato and the sovietled warsaw pact 
military alliance 
a commentary tuesday by tass signed by alexander antsiferov 
noted the soviet change of heart and said it came only after nato 
and the warsaw pact took steps away from confrontation last week 
nato issued a declaration that it was ready to sign a 
nonaggression pact and no longer regarded the soviet union as an 
adversary 
the change also came just a few days after gorbachev defeated 
communist party hardliners who had accused him of undermining the 
countrys security by relaxing controls on eastern europe 
at a party congress which ended last week gorbachev succeeded 
in replacing nearly the entire party leadership 
some muscovites expressed doubts about a reunited germany 
twenty million soviets died in world war ii according to 
official soviet counts the war in which the red army repelled a 
german invasion that brought nazi troops hundreds of miles inside 
the soviet union is known in the soviet union as the great 
patriotic war 
although the leaders of modern germany are not aggressive 
well today its fine but tomorrow a second hitler could appear 
and it could start again said the 72yearold engineer who 
refused to give his name 
for a 77yearold moscow woman who still has the letters her 
husband wrote to her before disapearing on a world war ii 
battlefield the thought of german membership in nato is 
terrifying 
but still she did not object 
i think that a war will not happen well trade and well help 
each other she said i hope everything will be all right

israels supreme court on tuesday overturned 
housing minister ariel sharons use of emergency regulations to 
speed up construction of housing for thousands of soviet immigrants 
sharon was also dealt another blow as tourism minister gideon 
patt opposed a second crash program for the immigrants under which 
the soviet jews would live temporarily in hotels and youth hostels 
the threejudge supreme court panel ruled sharon could have 
sought approval from the parliament or knesset instead of using 
emergency powers 
tent camps are springing up across the country as a protest by 
israelis who say subsidies for immigrants are driving up rents and 
pricing others out of the housing market 
more than 63000 soviet jews have arrived since 1989 and the 
total this year is expected to reach 150000 
sharon who is also cabinet coordinator for immigration led the 
government to approve emergency regulations july 1 that allow the 
purchase and establishment of 3000 prefabricated units in israel 
some politicians criticized the move saying sharon might take 
undemocratic steps and assume powers delegated to planning councils 
and zoning boards sharon was accused as defense minister in 1982 
of concealing military plans from the government during the armys 
invasion of lebanon 
the supreme court decision followed an appeal by a liberal 
legislator abraham poraz of the shinui party 
poraz argued that sharon used emergency regulations at a time 
when the knesset was debating the housing crisis last week it 
passed a law shortening housing license procedures 
emergency regulations are an antidemocratic act that 
should be used only in difficult exceptional situations when 
there is no other choice poraz said on israel army radio 
the housing ministry said in a short statement it will respect 
the courts decision 
it was the first time the court challenged the governments use 
of emergency powers which date from israels 1948 war for 
independence the procedure was introduced because there was fear 
that the knesset could not always be convened because of the 
fighting 
there is no doubt that this is a revolutionary decision 
said moshe negbi a legal expert for the hebrew daily newspaper 
hadashot for the first time the supreme court clearly says that 
the government must not use these radical powers when there is 
no problem in convening the parliament 
the importance of this decision is that is again stresses the 
superiority of the knesset over the government negbi said 
the government argued that emergency regulations were needed to 
ease the housing crisis and stated israels 20000 available 
rental apartments will be filled by the end of september 
sharons other emergency plan was approved sunday by the 
governments ministerial immigration committee headed by him that 
plan would direct soviet immigrants to lowrate hotels and youth 
hostels where they would rent rooms but would not get the 
customary hotel service 
but patt told reporters tuesday that the plan devised without 
prior consultations with the tourism ministry was doomed to 
fail 
he said the program would get sharon a few rooms here and 
there perhaps 400 to 500 
the government says it needs 7000 to 8000 units each month to 
house the immigrants

authorities set off a blast today in a house 
where a powerful explosive was found saying the substance was too 
dangerous to move the house was described as heavily damaged but 
no surrounding buildings were affected 
at least 2000 people had been evacuated from the area after an 
undetermined amount of nitroglycerin was found in a home monday 
there were no injuries 
there was definitely nitroglycerin exploded in the basement 
said fbi spokesman ed boldt the house even though it doesnt 
look like it from the outside has been pretty heavily damaged 
apparently there wasnt as much nitro as we feared there might be 
tests had indicated that a shot glass and syringe found in the 
basement of the onestory frame house monday contained 
nitroglycerin a flammable oil used in medicine and explosives 
said police chief donald white authorities had feared larger 
containers nearby might contain the same substance 
authorities charged a man who had lived in the house until 
recently 
before the chemical was set off with a timedelay blast the 
containers were surrounded by sandbags windows in the house were 
opened and surrounding homes were boarded up authorities said 
the blast was set off shortly after 130 pm within a 
halfhour evacuees began returning home 
boldt said it was the first time he knew of in his 11 years with 
the fbi that authorities resorted to exploding a home 
officials decided not to try to move the materials because they 
considered that even more dangerous he said they had considered 
taking the containers to a gravel pit 
authorities found the liquid monday while responding to a report 
of a domestic dispute in this city of 20000 about 30 miles north 
of dayton residents in a 12block area around the home and along 
the threemile route to the gravel pit were urged to leave their 
homes 
before exploding the substance today authorities extended the 
evacuation area by two blocks as a further precaution before that 
decision city spokesman michael hemm had estimated that 2000 
people were out of their homes 
oakley gover and his wife left their home after police told them 
there was danger of an explosion 
we took them at their word grabbed our dog and left gover 
said 
steve jackson of the american red cross miami valley chapter 
said about 12 people stayed overnight at an elementary school 
workers boarded up homes in the immediate area shut off utility 
service and marked the ground where naturalgas lines were buried 
according to hemm and white dana taylor 25 was charged with 
possessing dangerous ordnance and was being held in the miami 
county jail in troy 
we do know that the ingredients to make nitro are there 
white said and we know from other sources that he taylor has 
been setting off explosives in town or in the area 
white said taylor had maintained that there were no explosives 
in the house and that he knew little or nothing about explosives 
but hemm said police have received information that taylor has 
experimented with explosives in the past 
white declined to say what triggered the domestic dispute only 
that taylor and his wife had been involved in an argument he said 
taylor had recently moved out of the house

raymond dunn jr turned 16 tuesday but 
the profoundly retarded birthday boy feasted not on cake to which 
he is allergic but on the days greatest gift the bland brown 
infant formula that keeps him alive 
gerber products co which stopped making the meatbased formula 
in 1985 resumed production two months ago after raymonds doctors 
said he would die without it gerber employees volunteered to make 
a batch on their own time and on june 26 the dunns received a 
twoyear supply free of charge 
gerber says babies are our business but raymonds their 
business too said carol dunn who spent five years trying to 
get the company to retool for a market of one 
the dunns celebrate raymonds birthdays quietly yet thankfully 
because each is one more than they were told to expect after 
raymond was born with a broken skull and a brain that had been 
deprived of oxygen 
at 16 raymond is getting mail from navy recruiters and college 
admissions offices but he rarely leaves his house in this village 
in the catskills 
as he sits in his wheelchair or lies on his special floor mat 
raymond moves only with the help of others and sees only shadows 
his expression ranges from a painful grimace to a slight smile he 
snorts gurgles wheezes and occasionally burps 
he weighs 32 pounds and his twisted cramped body is 4 feet 
long he suffers 15 to 20 major seizures a day and sleeps two or 
three hours a night if at all his asthma makes each breath a 
struggle phlegm plugs repeatedly hospitalize him and threaten to 
kill him 
raymond the dunns only child also is allergic to the foods 
that help most children grow but he always was sustained by 
gerbers mbf meatbased formula 
when gerber decided to drop the product five years ago mrs 
dunn was unable to find or create any substitute that did not make 
raymond sick frantic she hunted down every can she could find 
and gerber kept passing along its own backlog 
by july 1988 gerber ran out of mbf leaving raymond with less 
than two years supply 
supported by the state association for retarded children mrs 
dunn begged gerber to make more mbf and began a mail campaign 
asking others to pressure the company finally the companys 
research director gave in 
since the nation learned of how a mothers devotion moved a 
large corporation mrs dunn and her husband raymond sr a car 
salesman have received a shopping bag full of mail a sunday 
school class sent a check for 28 a dealer in rare baseball cards 
offered raymond any card he wanted the rev raymond dunn no 
relation told mrs dunn that when her son finally dies you will 
have a saint in heaven 
meanwhile at gerber volunteers in the research division put 
their own projects on hold hauled out old equipment and devoted 
several thousand square feet and several days of production space 
and time to raymonds supply of mbf 
it arrived in yankee lake just in time the dunns had about two 
dozen cans of the old formula enough to last through the end of 
july 
each july 17 mrs dunn worries that this birthday will be 
raymonds last so she follows the same ritual 
she takes last years birthday number candles from the tea cup 
over the sink and burns them down then she takes the candle 
numbers from this years cake and places them in the cup where 
they sit for the next 12 months raymond wears the same gold 
cardboard kings crown with each year marked on a point on the 
crown 
but even these rituals are touched by sadness there are only 
two points left on the crown and mrs dunn has not had to let it 
out in many years because raymonds head grows very little 
what is most remarkable about raymond is not his condition but 
the care he receives his mother and a platoon of teachers and 
helpers caress him almost constantly they feed him seven times 
daily and brush his teeth after each feeding 
raymond sleeps in his parents bed often between them he 
receives about a dozen different medications some several times a 
day his mothers calendar has no luncheon dates or hairdressers 
appointments it is devoted entirely to charting the times and 
dosages of just one asthma remedy 
but the dunns say his birthday reminds them that life at its 
most marginal at its most precarious is life at its most 
meaningful 
when raymond was an infant they were urged to institutionalize 
him told that keeping him home would burn them out and ruin their 
marriage 
we knew wed have to pay a price and the price has been 
hard mrs dunn says ive given up a normal life but raymond 
gives me a lot of joy does it outweigh the sorrow no but he is 
my son and if i had put raymond away the price would have been 
even higher

in a memorable episode of the british tv sitcom 
fawlty towers a bumbling hotel owner goes to absurd lengths 
not to mention the war to his german guests then proceeds to 
do just that over and over 
that episode from the 1970s which had actor john cleese 
goosestepping and heilhitlering in hilarious fashion is being 
recalled these days as british commentators wrestle anew with the 
complexities of anglogerman relations 
first there was nicholas ridley trade secretary and close 
confidant of prime minister margaret thatcher sounding off last 
week about uppity germans trying to take over europe 
then came publication sunday of the summary of a secret seminar 
hosted by mrs thatcher in which leading academics put germany on 
the psychiatrists couch analyzing such stereotypical traits as 
bullying angst and sentimentality 
ridley resigned and mrs thatchers office vowed to find out 
who leaked the summary to the press but as most observers agreed 
the two episodes served to bring a delicate issue into the open 
the issue is the mix of suspicion envy and scholarly 
fascination that characterizes britains attitude to germany 
steeped in memories of world war ii 
today whatever hostility remains is usually expressed in jokes 
about earlyrising german holidaymakers grabbing the best beaches 
or basil fawlty screaming at his staff whatever you do dont 
mention the war 
but lately things have gotten serious germany is a formidable 
economic power and after it reunites the deutschmark looks 
certain to dominate the european community 
thus argue supporters of ridley and mrs thatcher surely a 
small island nation like britain with chronic economic problems has 
the right to ask what sort of europe it is going into 
the trouble as in fawltys case is in the presentation 
ridley expressed a genuine popular concern which is shared by 
mrs thatcher but his references to the ec bureaucracy as hitler 
and to britain being bossed by a german were widely criticized 
the seminar was a freeranging session covering many opinions 
according to participants it only looked controversial when it was 
boiled down to a 2000word summary by mrs thatchers private 
secretary for foreign affairs charles powell 
if chancellor kohl himself had sat in on that meeting he 
would have agreed with or at least accepted as fair comment 90 
percent of what was said timothy garton ash a german affairs 
scholar who attended the seminar wrote in the independent 
opposition labor party lawmakers accused powell of slanting the 
summary to match mrs thatcher and got no straight answer when 
they asked her whether she repudiated ridleys remarks 
some german commentators find the uproar symptomatic of a 
british identity crisis rooted in memories of its lost empire and 
world war ii when it stood alone but united against hitler 
in the independent on sunday neal ascherson noted a german 
tendency to regard britain as a twilight world on the fringes of 
europe a raft being pulled away into the sunset by a mad queen 
whose shouts grow gradually fainter 
he said that when he lived in germany 20 years ago attacks like 
ridleys would have provoked panicstricken selfquestioning 
about why the ugly germans were still so ugly now they are just 
laughing at us 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd was also critical of his 
nations tendency just to draw down the blinds shut out the real 
world swear at the present world and pretend that we can go on 
just living in the past 
he pointed out that germany had prospered by working hard 
producing manufactured goods holding down inflation all the 
things we failed to do 
garton ash blamed history and geography 
america he wrote is far enough away and still big and 
powerful enough to be quite relaxed about the reemergence of 
germany as a great power in central europe france let alone 
poland is too small and too relatively weak to be anything but 
deadly serious about it 
but britain is somewhere in between close enough to be 
worried and weak enough to be resentful who won the war 
anyway yet also far enough away and still selfconfident 
enough to be outspoken and outrageous

drug traffickers are finding cocaine in short 
supply nearly everywhere in the united states a top us drug 
official said tuesday 
ronald caffrey told the senate judiciary committee that the 
shortage was the first positive development in domestic wholesale 
cocaine availability and prices since the onset of the cocaine 
epidemic 
caffrey the drug enforcement administrations deputy assistant 
administrator for operations said cocaine prices had reached their 
highest level since mid1985 and that purity levels had dropped 
the combination of high prices and low purity generally 
indicates a shortage in the drug he said 
some of the shortages caffrey said may be due to stockpiling 
by cocaine traffickers and price gouging by those playing on fears 
of a shortage 
he said law enforcement efforts at home and in latin america 
have had a major impact on the drugs availability but 
acknowledged that it could be temporary 
one way the dea knew shortages existed was because of its 
undercover agents dealings with drug traffickers 
normally when we do our undercover work we go out and we buy 
drugs at certain prices that are quoted to us caffrey said 
when the market starts to dry up a little bit suddenly people 
are asking us to sell them drugs and then sting operations occur 
caffrey said wholesale price increased in los angeles new york 
city houston chicago and miami between december and june in new 
york for example prices ranged from 14000 to 20000 per kilo 
in december but increased to 21000 to 35000 per kilo by june 
however caffrey said prices remain far below the 55000 to 
65000 price per kilo in 1982 
at the same time the level of cocaine purity has dropped 
steadily since 1988 he said 
the agency found that purity at the kilo level decreased from 90 
percent two years ago to 74 percent in june at the gram or 
streetbuy level purity dropped from 70 percent two years ago to 
55 percent last month the dea said 
asked outside the hearing about the results of an unreleased 
cocaine price and purity survey of all 19 dea field offices 
caffrey said the trend toward increased prices and decreased purity 
of wholesale quantities of cocaine was almost nationwide 
florida is a little bit different in the sense that yeah 
prices have gone up since last year at this time but i would say 
that it is still fairly stable he said 
that he said would indicate to us that at least in florida 
there is a fair amount of wholesale cocaine available 
until tuesday the dea had been unwilling to say there was a 
shortage in wholesale level cocaine in most of the united states 
despite information on price and purity changes national drug 
policy director william j bennett had hailed those changes as 
indications of a shortage

a british nurse on her first full day of 
freedom from an iraqi jail professed her innocence tuesday and said 
she did not believe executed journalist farzad bazoft was a spy 
daphne parish 53 acknowledged that she drove bazoft to the 
site of an explosion near an iraqi military installation and saw no 
wrong in their action 
it didnt appear improper at the time we didnt do anything i 
considered illegal she told reporters in the zambian capital 
lusaka 
earlier tuesday president kenneth kaunda handed mrs parish 
over to british officials in lusaka 
kaunda who secured mrs parishs release on humanitarian 
grounds said he blamed british press coverage of events in iraq 
and official british hostility toward iraqi president saddam 
hussein for bazofts death 
he said an appeal sent by him before bazofts execution on may 
15 also sought the iranianborn reporters release 
if it were not for what he described as britains vicious 
attitude to iraq that man might have lived might have been here 
with daphne he said 
the british foreign office declined to comment on kaundas 
remarks 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher sent personal 
messages of thanks to kaunda and saddam her office said tuesday 
bazoft who traveled on british documents but did not have 
british nationality was on assignment for the london sunday 
newspaper the observer at the time of his arrest 
his colleagues have insisted he was not a spy but merely an 
enthusiastic reporter 
speaking with reporters at the lusaka home of british high

the us trade deficit widened to 773 
billion in may as a big jump in imports of oil and foreign cars 
offset the secondhighest level of exports on record the commerce 
department reported tuesday 
the may deficit was 58 percent higher than a revised april 
trade gap of 731 billion but most economists discounted the 
report as a small worsening of the deficit 
they pointed out us export sales remained strong and they 
predicted the trend would continue as economic growth overseas 
helps prop up a sluggish american market 
thank goodness for trade it remains the brightest spot in the 
economy said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the small increase in the may deficit is not of concern because 
we believe that strong growth overseas will keep us exports 
rising 
many analysts believe export sales are the only thing keeping 
the country out of a recession in the first three months of the 
year fully half of total economic growth was supplied by the rise 
in overseas sales 
in a separate report tuesday the federal reserve said 
industrial output rose by 04 percent in june helping push the 
operating rate at the nations factories mines and utilities to 
835 percent of capacity the highest level this year 
much of the june increase reflected a spurt in auto production 
in advance of a possible strike this fall and a heat wave which 
boosted utility demand but analysts said a growing portion of us 
manufacturing output is being shipped to overseas markets 
the bush administration which is counting on strong foreign 
demand to continue propping up the economy was pleased with the 
may trade report 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher noted the us trade deficit 
for the first five months of the year was almost 6 billion less 
than the same period a year ago 
we can be encouraged by our continuing steady export growth of 
8 percent this year which is more than double the overall growth 
of imports mosbacher said 
however lawrence chimerine a senior economic adviser at 
drimcgraw hill inc said import demand has been depressed by the 
sluggish us economy he said once the economy picks up the trade 
deficit would resume climbing especially given americas growing 
dependence on foreign oil 
so far this year the merchandise trade deficit has been running 
at an annual rate of 9768 billion surprising many analysts who 
had predicted little change from the 1989 deficit of 1094 billion 
bruce steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch said that 
deficit for all of 1990 should end up between 90 billion and 95 
billion marking the first time since 1983 the country has had a 
deficit below 100 billion 
for may imports climbed by 29 percent to 4052 billion 
offsetting a 23 percent rise in us exports which totaled 3279 
billion the trade deficit is the difference between imports and 
exports 
the export level second highest in history after a march figure 
of 333 billion was bolstered by gains in various areas including 
automotive parts capital goods and consumer products 
close to half of the total import increase came from a 152 
percent increase in oil shipments during may americas foreign oil 
bill totaled 432 billion during the month as the volume rose to 
895 million barrels a day up from 755 million barrels daily in 
april the price per barrel dropped by 1 to 1557 in may 
analysts said that with domestic oil production dropping to its 
lowest level in more than a quarter of a century the dependence on 
foreign oil is certain to rise even higher in coming months 
much of the rest of the increase in imports in may came from a 
10 percent jump in shipments of foreign motor vehicles and parts 
which climbed to 622 billion 
the united states continued to enjoy a trade surplus with the 
countries of western europe of 812 million in may 
the biggest deficit was as usual with japan a 297 billion 
imbalance down from an april gap of 395 billion

two of presidentelect alberto fujimoris top 
economic advisers have resigned raising speculation the new 
government is planning an economic shock program to fix perus 
battered economy 
fujimori vigorously denied he would create such a program during 
his campaign but the resignations monday of adolfo figueroa and 
santiago roca leave fujimoris advisers dominated by proponents of 
a shock plan 
fujimori has been meeting in private for the last week with the 
advisers to iron out policies and form a cabinet they have been 
meeting at a military base in lima for security reasons and have 
not disclosed details of their meetings 
in a joint resignation letter roca and figueroa said they 
wanted to allow fujimori complete freedom to make the appropriate 
decisions for the countrys best interests 
political analyst manuel dornellas writing in newspaper 
expreso on tuesday said fujimori no longer has internal 
opposition to his adjustment program but outside hell face a 
mountain of it 
fujimoris opponent in the election novelist mario vargas 
llosa bluntly proposed the need for drastic changes to revive 
perus economy burdened by 3000 percent annual inflation and high 
unemployment 
analysts and pollsters said much of fujimoris support came from 
poorer people who feared vargas llosas austerity plans many now 
attack fujimori for abandoning his supporters by adopting some of 
vargas llosas ideas 
since his election june 10 fujimori has emphasized his desire 
to reestablish relations with international lending agencies such 
as the international monetary fund 
the imf and other lending organizations cut off credit to peru 
after president alan garcia stopped foreign debt repayments in 1986 
in late june fujimori met in new york with leaders of the imf 
the world bank and the interamerican development bank he 
expressed his willingness to cooperate on economic policies to 
secure new loans to help peru cope with its 20 billion foreign 
debt 
many interpreted that as his acceptance of the need for more 
serious measures to stop inflation and promote growth 
since his trip in which he also visited japan his ancestral 
homeland fujimori has said he will dismantle price subsidy 
programs and exchange rate controls 
many blame the weak economy on garcias populist programs of 
deficit spending and price controls on basic goods and services 
prices for water electricity and telephone service are among 
the lowest in the region gasoline costs the equivalent of 20 us 
cents for a gallon less than what the government oil company pays 
to produce it many stateowned companies are broke and press 
reports say the central bank is 129 million in the red 
roca and figueroa were not the first to depart from fujimoris 
economic team over policy differences oscar ugarteche who served 
on a commission studying the foreign debt problem resigned because 
of disagreements over debt policies and rejoining the imf 
fujimori is scheduled to take office july 28 his 52nd birthday

the senate brushed aside veto threats by 
president bush and voted tuesday to restrict the growth of us 
imports of textiles and apparel to 1 percent a year and freeze 
imports of shoes at 1989 levels 
by a potentially vetooverriding 6832 vote the senate approved 
a textileimport bill nearly identical to measures passed by 
congress in 1985 and 1988 but successfully vetoed by thenpresident 
reagan 
they do not want to do anything for the textile industry 
sen jesse helms rnc said of the bush administration if we 
do nothing it is safe to predict the demise of the industry is at 
hand 
since 1980 the us trade deficit on textiles and apparel has 
jumped from 47 billion to 265 billion making it the second 
largest component of the nations trade deficit behind oil 
over the same time more than 1800 textile and apparel plants 
have closed and employment has dropped by 400000 to just over 19 
million jobs despite an 18 billion modernization effort 
opponents claimed the bill would cost consumers 25 billion to 
27 billion a year in higher prices 
you do not notice it much said sen bob packwood rore 
just 50 cents a shirt here a dollar two dollars a pair of 
shoes but add that up by 250 million consumers in this country 
that is a lot of money 
bush rejected a lastminute appeal tuesday from senators from 
textileproducing states to back off his threatened veto 
i cant do that he said i cant say that i think the 
answer to the problem of textiles is further protection 
the administration contended any further restrictions placed by 
the united states on textile imports would virtually destroy any 
chance of a successful conclusion by the end of this year to the 
4yearold uruguay round of 100nation trade negotiations in geneva 
but lawmakers from textile apparel and shoeproducing states 
said they fear the administration will sacrifice textile concerns 
in those talks to win concessions from trading partners on 
protecting us copyrights and patents and to secure a lowering of 
those countries barriers to american farm exports and service 
suppliers 
sen ernest hollings dsc said the major us trading 
partners have shown no willingness to yield on the major issues in 
the geneva negotiations on the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade gatt 
we are about to lose our shirt he predicted they will 
not yield on agriculture in europe they will not yield on 
intellectual property rights and computers in south america 
the senates vote was well beyond the twothirds needed to 
override a veto and more lopsided than the 5936 vote by which the 
senate approved nearly identical legislation a year ago 
a similar bill in the house is being sponsored by 234 of its 435 
members but faces some difficulty because of opposition from rep 
sam gibbons dfla chairman of the house ways and means 
committees subcommittee on trade 
the bill would establish nationbynation quotas on us imports 
of textiles apparel and nonrubber footwear beginning this year 
except for certain products from canada and israel which have 
freetrade agreements with the united states 
textile and apparel imports which have tripled in the last 
decade would be allowed to grow only 1 percent a year while shoe 
imports would be frozen at their 1989 level 
however to reduce opposition from farm interests who fear 
retaliation the bill would provide increases in quotas to 
countries that increase their purchases of us agricultural 
products 
several attempts to weaken the bill through amendments were 
defeated by better than 2to1 margins

palestine liberation organization 
guerrillas moved in tuesday to block proiranian fundamentalists 
attack on a rival faction in south lebanon police said 52 people 
were killed and 167 wounded 
a police spokesman said yasser arafats guerrillas intervened 
after hezbollah or party of god overran the village of jarjou 
monday night that stripped the syrianbacked shiite moslem amal of 
its main stronghold in iqlim altuffah or the apple province 
a police spokesman called it the bloodiest battle in six months 
in the mountainous regions above sidon provincial capital of south 
lebanon jarjou is 10 miles southeast of sidon 
the spokesman who could not be named in line with standing 
regulations said that in the final push that ended just before 
midnight 40 people were killed and 117 wounded twelve people were 
killed and 50 wounded in clashes earlier in the day 
it was closequarter combat the village square is littered 
with bodies that couldnt be evacuated by the red cross because of 
the savage fighting the spokesman said 
he said the fatalities included 30 amal fighters and 10 from 
hezbollah 
an estimated 600 plo fighters entered iqlim altuffah at 4 am 
on orders from arafat 
their deployment blocked hezbollahs advance toward nabatiyeh 
the main shiite town in south lebanon some five miles south of 
jarjou 
it also left the fundamentalists bottled up in a mountain 
enclave with no access west to the mediterrnean coast or south 
toward the major shiite cities and towns 
a hezbollah official in sidon provincial capital of south 
lebanon rejected what he described as palestinian expansion 
and vowed to confront it 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
palestinian move would lead to largescale violence but he 
refused to say what hezbollah planned to do about it 
zeid wehbe the plos representative in lebanon said arafat 
appealed to iranian president hashemi rafsanjani to throw his 
weight behind the plo intervention to stop the intrashiite 
bloodshed 
the plo has about 5000 hardcore fighters based in refugee camps 
around sidon 
it fears hezbollah might try to seize control of sidon to gain 
an outlet to the mediterranean a move that would dramatically 
alter the strategic balance in the region north of israel 
hezbollah needs a coastal outlet because its supply lines from 
the bekaa valley northeast of the battle zone are vulnerable to 
interdiction by syria and its lebanese allies 
a plo source said that if hezbollah controlled any part of the 
coast theyll have a port to ship in weapons ammunition and 
fighters and establish their own islamic republic modeled on iran 
this cannot be permitted no one wants iran to become a 
key partner to the middle east conflict he explained 
the source also speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
palestinian deployment tuesday was personally ordered by arafat 
in a message received overnight 
shortly after the plo move israeli warplanes made several 
lowlevel passes over the battle zone they repeatedly broke the 
sound barrier but did not open fire 
amal and hezbollah have been fighting off and on for three years 
for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect 
by police count 1069 people have been killed and 3228 wounded 
in the conflict

participants in 1979 it caters mainly to performers looking for 
their big break and to indies independent record producers who 
seek unsigned artists musicians without a record contract

obsolescence because the program brings together the neophyte and 
insurgent elements said mark jacobsen 32 executive director of 
new music seminar 
during the fiveday convention which ends wednesday panel 
discussions covered distribution publishing stage presence video

a jubilant chancellor helmut kohl said 
tuesday that all major obstacles to german unification had been 
swept aside and said elections for a united german parliament were 
likely in december 
speaking to reporters the day after he returned from the soviet 
union with guarantees that a united germany was free to join nato 
kohl also said he hoped bilateral treaties with the soviet union 
and poland could be concluded by early next summer 
the practical problems which lay before us on the way to 
german unity have been solved kohl said 
he said elections for a united german parliament on dec 2 were 
presumable but whether east germany merged with the west 
before or after the elections had to be decided by east berlin he 
added 
the deputy chairman of the largest faction in the east german 
parliament said east germany could vote to join west germany under 
its constitution on dec 1 
udo kamm of the christian democratic coalition said his faction 
would vote for such a proposal in a committee thursday the 
proposal would then go to the full parliament 
in washington president bush said soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs consent for a united germany in nato was very very 
significant and very important bush said the united states 
deserves a lot of credit 
i take pride in the way europe is moving into this new era of 
freedom he said its a goal that we americans have long 
worked to achieve 
in a 40minute telephone call to gorbachev bush assured him 
that nato poses no threat to the soviet union and that the united 
states is ready to move toward warmer relations officials said 
kohl also tried tuesday to reassure germanys neighbors 
we are no world power he said emphasizing that the new 
germany would be embedded in the european security architecture 
he said he was sensitive to the concerns of fellow europeans he 
noted that britain had gambled its very existence in battling 
hitler he said it was no accident germany had agreed to reduce the 
size of a united army to 370000 and cut compulsory military 
service from 15 to 12 months 
east german foreign minister markus meckel however rejected 
the idea of one german army and said east germany needed its own 
military currently the two germanys have about 600000 men under 
arms 480000 of them in west germany 
in paris meanwhile the nations negotiating german unification 
reached a historic agreement confirming polands border with east 
germany and clearing the way for one germany by years end 
west germany also agreed to hold economic assistance talks with 
poland later in the summer 
terms of the border settlement were not announced polish 
foreign minister krysztof skubiszewski said they were confidential 
but all the foreign ministers stressed the border would be the line 
between poland and east germany that was drawn at the end of the 
war 
we are very happy with the results skubiszewski said the 
border has been confirmed 
the border settlement should serve to allay polish concerns that 
a merged germany would revive old claims on territory given to 
poland in partial compensation for a larger area taken over by the 
soviet union 
in evaluating the role of the new germany in central europe 
kohl said he envisioned it as a transit point for ideas and 
perspectives between west and east 
the treaty with the soviets kohl said could include economic 
aid but he said no specific financial aid was offered during his 
weekend visit to induce the soviets to remove one of their biggest 
obstacles to german unification objections to a united germany in 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who accompanied kohl 
and finance minister theo waigel on the trip to moscow also said 
west gemany and the soviet union reached agreement on cooperation 
without west germany giving specific aid promises 
we reached agreement on longterm cooperation but we have 
not discussed any numbers genscher said in paris 
waigel said the soviets presented no bill for their 
acceptance of german reunification but he said it was in the 
german interest for the soviet reform process to succeed 
west germany has already backed a 3 billion bank credit to help 
the soviet union revamp its economy and has agreed to pay 780 
million toward the upkeep of soviet soldiers stationed in east 
germany in the second half of this year 
at last weeks houston summit of western industrial powers kohl 
had pushed for a 15 billion international aid package for the 
soviet union instead the leaders asked the international monetary 
fund to study what kind of aid would be most beneficial 
kohl ruled out the possibility that west germany would be the 
sole future source of financial aid to the soviets saying the 
burden would be too great 
however he said he could envision west germany helping the 
soviets retrain thousands of soldiers returning from east germany 
who could face unemployment back home 
it was also possible he said for west germany to help in 
supplying housing but not for a certain category of soviet 
residents west german officials are concerned about the domestic 
political fallout of building housing specifically for returning 
soviet troops

president bush called soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev on tuesday and said his consent for a united germany in 
nato was very very significant and very important 
bush also said the united states deserves a lot of credit for 
helping remove the last major obstacle to german unity 
i take pride in the way europe is moving into this new era of 
freedom the president said its a goal that we americans have 
long worked to achieve 
in a 40minute telephone call to gorbachev bush assured the 
soviet president that nato poses no threat to moscow and that the 
united states is ready to move toward warmer relations officials 
said 
bush also briefed gorbachev on last weeks sevennation economic 
summit and the decision not to block any western nation from 
providing cash assistance to moscow said the officials who 
requested anonymity bush explained that the united states is 
willing to provide technical help but not money 
it was the fourth telephone call to gorbachev by bush in his 18 
months in office 
separately bush also called west german chancellor helmut kohl 
and congratulated him on his talks with gorbachev and the dropping 
of soviet objections to east germany joining west germany under the 
umbrella of the western alliance 
amid a glow of triumph in the west bush made a deliberate 
effort to highlight his own role in promoting german unity 
there was an apparent feeling in the white house that mondays 
announcement of a deal between gorbachev and kohl failed to give 
proper credit to other western leaders when good things happen 
as a result of the combined efforts of the allies it makes sense 
to take note of that one administration official said speaking 
privately 
bush addressing a gathering of magazine publishers said the 
gorbachevkohl statements about a unified germany were very very 
significant and very important and let me reflect on how we got 
here 
he said i remember telling the press last october before the 
berlin wall came down that when we said we supported german unity 
we really meant that and we meant it without qualifications 
i know the german people have appreciated that stand by the 
united states 
the president recalled that he had held separate meetings with 
kohl french president francois mitterrand and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher to forge a unified position and then 
discussed the subject at length with gorbachev particularly during 
a meeting at camp david on june 2 
bush noted that he had said at a wrapup news conference with 
gorbachev that they had agreed that germany should be free to 
choose its own alliance president gorbachev if you remember 
didnt challenge that and i we all thought that that was a good 
sign then 
bush said we also had to show him that the nato alliance was 
not his enemy but was a force for stability that could adapt could 
indeed change adapt to the new realities in europe 
on that point bush noted that it was the united states that 
drafted the natorestructuring plan adopted at a summit of alliance 
leaders in london july 6 
bush quoted gorbachev as having said monday that it would have 
been difficult to make headway on germany with the very important 
impulse from nato 
bush said that gorbachev and kohl have displayed i think 
exceptional qualities of leadership during this challenging 
period 
a senior white house official said bush had no misgivings about 
kohl and gorbachev striking a deal themselves without involving 
other western leaders 
the official said its clear that the whole process of 
diplomatic efforts of mitterrand thatcher kohl and bush visits 
with gorbachev then the nato summit and then the economic summit 
were a very strong and powerful impetus towards gorbachev moving in 
this direction 
basically everybody was in it together he said 
as for kohl and gorbachev announcing the breakthrough he added 
thats where it should have been thats where the front line is 
thats where these two leaders have got to work out their 
relationship

popular historical novelist valentin pikul whose 
books focused on russias sweeping upheavals has died the tass 
news agency reported tuesday he was 62 
the dispatch from riga which quoted the union of latvian 
writers did not give the date or the cause of death 
pikuls novels often delved into topics that were long taboo 
such as the downfall of the russian royalty and the influence of 
the monk grigory rasputin over the family of czar nicholas ii 
in some of his historical novels he was accused of being 
antisemitic in his 1979 novel at the final frontier he 
tried to show that rasputin was a tool of zionists 
other literary critics accused him of a nonchalant attitude 
toward historical facts 
the novel is the form of selfexpression that i love he 
once wrote i love a novel with a multitude of characters and a 
furious succession of events i hate those feeble little novels in 
which the author pokes around in the intimate psychology of 
characters that are depressed and bored by life 
during the world war ii german blockade of his native leningrad 
pikul was evacuated to archangelsk where he entered the navy and 
served on the destroyer groznyi his first novel ocean patrol 
published in 1954 was about the soviet fleet 
in 1961 he published bayazet about the russoturkish war 
of 187778 other books included with pen and rapier

the social security administrations new 
telephone system is leaving many people waiting in vain for their 
calls to be returned government auditors said tuesday 
the general accounting office said that in some types of cases 
42 percent of callers never received the followup calls they were 
promised when they dialed social securitys tollfree 800 number 
social security follows up 97 percent of the time in other 
categories the report said 
it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the social 
security 800 system is not a working number or at least that it is 
not working very well said rep andy jacobs jr dind 
chairman of the house ways and means social security subcommittee 
gao an arm of congress began investigating the phone system 
after social security blocked telephone access to its local field 
offices social security officials insisted that requiring that all 
calls be made to the 800 number would improve service 
jacobs said the gao study offered proof that service had not 
been improved 
while it may save time for social security workers jacobs said 
it wastes the time of people the government is supposed to be 
serving 
he said 800number operators lack training and expertise to 
answer nonroutine calls although its far easier to get through 
to the 800 number than it was earlier this year jacobs said a 
caller still will get a busy signal 35 percent of the time 
social security spokesman frank battistelli said the agency 
would not comment because it had not been given a copy of the gao 
report 
however he said that at least 80 percent of problems or 
questions posed in calls to the 800 number are settled on the spot 
without the need for any call back or referral to a field office 
even after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get back to a 
caller social security offices dont let a case slip through the 
cracks battistelli said 
we then send a letter asking the caller to get back in touch 
with us he said 
social security expects to receive as many as 70 million calls 
this year gao estimated that only about 5 percent require 
referrals 
gao acknowledged the difficulty in trying to get back to a 
caller in doing its survey gao said its workers were unable to 
make contact in five attempts with many of those who had called the

british opposition leader neil kinnock 
discussed with president bush on tuesday the growing momentum 
toward german unification and pressed for western aid to the soviet 
union 
kinnock on a twoday visit to the united states hopes to 
convince us officials and lawmakers that his labor party would be 
a more reliable partner for washington in the new europe than the 
government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
i hope we were able to present a prospective government of the 
united kingdom as a reliable partner in nato and within the 
european economic community said gerald kaufman the labor partys 
shadow foreign minister he spoke to reporters after kinnocks 
30minute meeting with bush which he described as extremely 
useful and amicable 
kinnock and bush talked about mondays announcement by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev that the soviet union would allow a 
united germany in nato the two also talked about aiding eastern 
europe and the soviets with kinnock emphasizing the need to 
provide frustrated soviet consumers with goods 
we talked about how to help the soviets without being 
patronizing said kaufman 
kinnock differs from thatcher and bush in believing europe 
should help the soviet union with more than just technical advice 
the aid from britain should be loans and investment resulting in 
the purchase of british goods he emphasized in a speech monday to 
the council on foreign relations in new york he said it was 
premature to assign a monetary figure to aid at this time 
kaufman said kinnock congratulated bush on his role in bringing 
about a relaxation of natos defense strategy at the 16nation 
alliance summit in london earlier this month 
the changed strategy enabled gorbachev to make his decision 
about nato membership for a united germany kaufman quoted kinnock 
as saying

the united states is putting more pressure on 
the european economic community to negotiate the elimination of 
export subsidies from world trade administration farm officials 
said tuesday 
one of the weapons in the us trade arsenal is the 5yearold 
export enhancement program which provides bonuses or subsidies 
to make us commodities cheaper for selected foreign buyers 
but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the us subsidy 
program was modest compared with the 10 billion annually spent by 
the 12nation european trade bloc on farm export subsidies 
further he said the house appropriations committee recently 
cut the subsidies under eep to 500 million from the 900 million 
the administration had requested 
yeutter said export subsidies were probably the most important 
part of the ongoing trade negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the 97member gatt is scheduled to conclude the current uruguay 
round of talks by the end of this year 
if we can have a successful negotiation on export subsidies a 
lot of countries around the world will benefit including the 
united states yeutter told a telephone news conference with a 
group of farm broadcasters 
undersecretary richard t crowder who oversees international 
and commodity programs in the agriculture department said eep 
programs were in place for all the major targeted customers and 
markets of american farmers 
crowder said the subsidy programs served a dual purpose 
achieving and maintaining a market share for us agricultural 
exports and for the trade policy effect that it will have on the 
eec particularly as we enter the critical phase of the trade 
talks 
so we are prepared to use eep as aggressively as possible to 
ensure our competitiveness in the world market against those 10 
billion of export subsidies he said 
yeutter asked if eec policies had changed as a result of 
trading pressure over the years said there has been very 
little so far 
they have been bringing their domestic price support levels 
down in a modest way over the last two or three years but not 
enough to have very much effect on production thus far he said 
weve been pointing out to them they need to bring those 
stratospheric supports down much closer to world market prices 
the high supports stimulate production and the surpluses are 
dumped on the world market through eec export subsidies yeutter 
said 
yeutter was asked if the united states had backed off at last 
weeks economic summit in houston from an earlier position calling 
for the elimination of export subsidies 
we have by no means altered the us position yeutter said 
we did not have to change it one iota in houston 
the key language used in the houston agreement was worked out a 
year or so ago and remained unchanged he said it calls for a 
substantial progressive reduction in subsidies 
we believe that calls for ultimate elimination yeutter 
said the eec knows thats our interpretation 
but how long that might require is another matter he said the 
united states has proposed a fiveyear phaseout of export 
subsidies but the eec objects vigorously to that timetable 
yeutter said

a former armored car guard who stole 
651000 from a truck and claimed he gambled it away during two 
years on the lam was sentenced to eight years in prison tuesday by 
a skeptical judge 
us district judge louis c bechtle imposed a stiffer sentence 
on edward leigh hunt jr than guidelines suggested because hunt 
refused to detail how the money was spent 
i have some concerns about the gaps in information as to what 
happened to the money bechtle said 
guidelines indicated a sentence of 27 to 33 months but the 
sentencing commissions intent was thwarted by a refusal of the 
defendant to cooperate the judge said 
the system i believe is being used he said 
hunt 26 stole the money on jan 20 1988 from a brooks 
armored car service truck parked outside a center city bank 
he said said he spent the next two years in hollywood gambling 
illegally on sports and buying california lottery tickets 
sometimes a hundred at a time 
two years later i was broke so i turned myself in he told 
bechtle 
hunt surrendered jan 20 he pleaded guilty in april to one 
count of interstate theft in a plea agreement that required him to 
tell investigators where the money went 
hunt a wilmington del resident and son of a former delaware 
deputy attorney general told the judge he feared facing additional 
illegal gambling charges if he detailed where the money went 
assistant us attorney frederick herold said the judge made it 
clear when hunt pleaded guilty that participating in the 
investigation into the whereabouts of the money was very important 
the big question in this case from the governments point of 
view herold told the judge is did he really gamble the money 
away 
hunt was also fined 3000 and ordered to make restititution to 
brooks the maximum sentence allowed was 10 years and herold said 
hunt would probably serve nearly all eight years unless he gets 
time off for good behavior there is no parole he said 
hunt showed no emotion as bechtle pronounced sentence his 
attorney albert j raman put his hand on hunts shoulder raman 
declined to comment on the sentencing 
hunt spoke briefly telling the judge that jails a terrifying 
experience and suggested his sentence include outside work 
id like to help philadelphia by picking up garbage or 
removing graffiti some kind of public service hunt told 
bechtle 
the day after his theft hunt said he got on a train and three 
days later was at a holiday inn in hollywood 
they wouldnt take anyone who didnt have credit cards and i 
only had cash hunt told the judge prompting chuckles from 
spectators he said he lived in a hotel and an apartment on the 
same block as the holiday inn 
hunt claimed he planned to use a gambling system to 
quadruple his stake and pay back the company half his proceeds he 
said he bet heavily on football and basketball through bookmakers 
because legal gambling in las vegas was too risky 
as a fugitive i wouldnt have lasted a week there he said 
referring to surveillance at legal gambling parlors and 
requirements to report winnings over 10000 
he said he spent 50000 on state lottery tickets

flaws in the food and drug administrations 
regulation of medical devices may allow unsafe products on the 
market witnesses told a house panel on tuesday 
investigations by the inspector general of the health and human 
services department suggest the fdas regulatory system may prevent 
the agency from detecting device problems early and acting 
promptly inspector general richard kusserow said 
kusserow said the problems with the medical device approval 
process parallel what we encountered in our extensive reviews of 
the generic drug division which turned up evidence that generic 
drug companies had cheated on tests required to win fda approval 
and bribed fda officials 
although our findings here are similar we have no evidence of 
these vulnerabilities manifesting themselves in any detected 
criminal wrongdoing kusserow told the house energy and commerce 
health subcommittee 
the inspector general said that in addition to needing more 
internal controls over the approval system the fda also needs 
stronger authority to remove defective devices from the marketplace 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the committee said 
it is clear that the current statute does not adequately protect 
the public from unnecessary risks in addition the fda lacks the 
resources and the authority to enforce the law 
dingell and rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the health 
subcommittee have introduced legislation to overhaul the law 
governing regulation of medical devices 
it would require closer scrutiny of the most dangerous devices 
and require hospitals and other major medical device users to 
report deaths and other serious problems with medical devices to 
the fda it also would give the fda more authority to remove 
products from the market 
more than 1700 medical devices are available in the united 
states representing an industry of more than 17 billion a year 
said carl wisler of the general accounting office 
fda acting commissioner james benson said in his statement to 
the subcommittee that reporting the provision of the dingellwaxman 
bill is neither necessary nor feasible 
he said he also opposes another provision that would require 
more devices to undergo more intensive scrutiny even though they 
were similar to devices already on the market he said this 
provision would lengthen product review times raise health care 
costs and impede the introduction of new technologies to the 
market

prosecutors neared the end of their monthlong 
drug and perjury case against mayor marion barry on tuesday after 
two women a former carter administration aide and a barry friend 
testifying under court order outlined a history of drug use with 
him 
they were the ninth and tenth witnesses to testify they saw 
barry use illegal drugs 
doris crenshaw who was a white house small business aide said 
she had snorted cocaine powder smoked crack cocaine and used 
cocainelaced cigarettes with barry including an episode at the 
1988 democratic national convention she said she began using drugs 
with him in 1985 
bettye lynn smith who was flown in from tennessee under court 
order testified she had used cocaine with barry many times and 
supplied him with it for years including less than a month before 
his jan 18 arrest in an fbi sting operation 
reluctant to testify against barry whom she described as a 
close personal friend of mine smith appeared in court only after 
being ordered by a us magistrate to return to the nations 
capital to testify she had been undergoing treatment for stress at 
a psychiatric hospital in chattanooga 
crenshaw said she and the mayor used cocaine at the democratic 
convention in atlanta where barry was heading the district of 
columbias delegation 
we used it at the hotel crenshaw said it was powder 
cocaine 
crenshaw who met barry when both were active in the civil 
rights movement described him as a very kind and understanding 
and sympathetic person 
she said she first offered the mayor powder cocaine at her 
capitol hill home where we snorted it off business cards 
crenshaw also testified that she used drugs with barry on dec 
22 1988 the day barrys ties to charles lewis who later pleaded 
guilty to drug charges became public 
she said she visited the mayor that day at the washington hotel 
room of willie davis a former aide to birmingham mayor richard 
arrington 
there barry smoked crack cocaine out of a pipe fashioned from a 
drinking glass and tin foil said crenshaw testified she said she 
also used the drug 
prosecutors expected to conclude their case wednesday with 
testimony on barry telephone records the defense will then open 
its case which could include testimony from 10 to 15 witnesses 
said barry attorney r kenneth mundy 
since testimony in the case began june 19 10 witnesses have 
said they saw barry use drugs at a total of 14 hotels 20 private 
residences two businesses and on four boats in a period ranging 
from 1984 to the mayors jan 18 arrest at a downtown washington 
hotel 
on tuesday smith was questioned about her fitness to testify by 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson who had demanded 
her return pending the dawn magistrates hearing in chattanooga 
ill try smith said choking back tears 
once the trial questioning began smith described in a soft 
calm voice a long history of drug use with barry 
smith told the jury that she and the mayor snorted cocaine 
powder at her capitol hill home maybe five times in 1983 and up 
to half a dozen times a year after that until 1986 when she stopped 
using the drug with him she continued to supply him she said 
on the other hand smith also testified she never saw barry use 
or possess cocaine in the bahamas even though other witnesses 
have testified that she and the mayor used drugs during a 
thanksgiving 1987 trip there 
early this january was the last time she offered cocaine to the 
mayor she said he went in the bathroom and was in there long 
enough to use the cocaine but i dont know if he ingested it 
smith said 
on jan 18 former model rasheeda moore persuaded barry to come 
to her room at the vista hotel where the mayor was arrested after 
being videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
during crossexamination by mundy smith said prescription 
antidepressants she had taken tuesday morning prevented her from 
recalling exact dates on which she supplied the mayor with drugs 
barry is accused of 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession counts 
one misdemeanor count of conspiracy and three felony counts of 
lying to a grand jury 
attending tuesdays court proceedings was nation of islam leader 
louis farrakhan who was allowed access to the trial last week

the federal limit on workplace exposure to 
asbestos would be cut in half under a change proposed tuesday by 
the labor department 
about 700000 american workers in general industry mostly in 
auto repair operations and up to another 14 million construction 
and building renovation workers would be affected by the revised 
guideline said the occupational safety and health administration 
now osha rules permit workers to be exposed to no more than 02 
fibers of asbestos per cubic centimeter of air over an 8hour 
period the proposed change would cut that limit to 01 fiber per 
cubic centimeter of air over an 8hour shift 
osha believes that the proposals will significantly reduce 
worker deaths from cancer resulting from exposure to asbestos 
said gerard scannell the assistant labor secretary who heads osha 
the revision to the osha standard will not take effect until 
after a public comment period and a hearing in october 
the change also calls for 
expanding the notification provision for owners of buildings 
where demolition renovation and asbestos removal activities are 
taking place under the change they would have to notify occupants 
of asbestosdisturbing activities and steps being taken to reduce 
exposure risks 
all employers engaged in demolition renovation and removal 
operations other than smallscale shortterm operations would have 
to notify osha before starting work 
the environmental protection agency is phasing out between this 
august and 1996 the future manufacture importation processing 
and distribution of asbestos in almost all products 
oshas proposal would allow employers to meet the new 01 fiber 
requirement without additional engineering control costs by using 
respiratory protection for workers until the new epa guidelines 
take effect 
the change comes from a 1988 federal appeals court ruling that 
generally upheld the current standard but asked osha to reexamine 
several issues relating to asbestos

beijing universitys freshman class completed a 
year of training at an army base and was welcomed back to campus on 
tuesday by happy parents and curious upperclassmen 
the 728 students were the first freshmen at the university since 
last years mass prodemocracy movement beijing university 
students helped lead those protests which were crushed by the 
army hundreds perhaps thousands of people died when the army 
moved in on the beijing demonstrators june 34 1989 
the freshmen were ordered to undergo a year of military training 
and political education at shijiazhuang military academy before 
starting their regular fouryear classes 
they lived the lives of soldiers rising at 6 am for marches 
and drills on marching saluting shooting and throwing grenades 
they attended political study classes where they read the works 
of marx lenin and mao tsetung and heard lectures about the error 
of last years protests 
the class graduated from the academy last saturday and will 
spend three days on campus for welcoming activities and orientation 
before going home 
upperclassmen watched the new students with interest some with 
bemused expressions 
a law school senior keep shaking his head and repeating 
theyre so young they look so wellbehaved 
one mother who waited more than an hour for the freshmen to 
arrive tuesday said she and other parents took turns making weekly 
visits to the army base about 170 miles south of beijing the 
capital 
we went to give them emotional support they were really 
lonely out there she said 
as she spoke a caravan of buses carrying the students dressed 
in army uniforms rolled through the school gate under a red banner 
reading warmly welcome the class of 1989 from the military 
academy 
the mother anxiously scanned the faces waving a brightly 
colored skirt she had brought for her youngest daughter 
whats the matter with them they looked dumbfounded she 
said 
but other students were hanging out the windows waving happily 
to the crowd two even flashed v signs 
a man and a woman took turns announcing flowery words of welcome 
on the schools public address system between military marches 
friends embraced and parents rushed to take heavy backpacks from 
their children in an open area near a cafeteria 
happy of course im happy one father said while loading 
his daughters belongings on his bicycle to take to her dormitory 
i havent seen her since spring festival or chinese new year 
in late february 
his daughter wearing her army uniform of olive shirt and dark 
blue skirt said of the year of military training well at least 
its over 
the state council chinas cabinet last week announced that the 
new freshmen class this fall at beijing university and shanghais 
fudan university would also undergo a year of military training at 
other schools shorter periods of army training have been organized 
the renewed emphasis on military training reflects leadership 
belief that weak ideological education was to blame for last years

president saddam hussein said tuesday he 
hopes iraqs direct talks with iran will lead to peace between the 
two nations and irans hashemi rafsanjani also expressed optimism 
that a settlement was possible 
the two persian gulf neighbors fought for eight years before the 
guns fell silent under a united nationssponsored ceasefire in 
august 1988 
foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of iran and tariq aziz of 
iraq met in geneva this month for their first facetoface talks 
since the ceasefire 
the iranians responded favorably to our proposal for a summit 
meeting and we hope that recent diplomatic and ministerial meetings 
will pave the way for progress toward peace saddam said in a 
speech broadcast on state baghdad radio 
his address marked the 22nd anniversary of the coup that put his 
baath arab socialist party in power 
on tuesday tehran radio monitored in cyprus quoted rafsanjani 
as telling tehrans assembly of experts the talks have been 
fruitful and the two countries are expected to move toward peace 
the iraqis too have adopted a more positive stand toward the 
establishment of peace 
rafsanjani was quoted as saying both iran and iraq realize now 
only the arrogant powers a common iranian reference to the 
united states and its western allies benefit from the nowar 
nopeace situation in the gulf 
the englishlanguage tehran times a newspaper close to 
rafsanjani urged that future meetings be held in baghdad or tehran 
iraq has been pushing for a saddamrafsanjani summit 
the tehran times said nothing was achieved at geneva beyond 
creating an amiable atmosphere 
unbrokered talks began five days after the ceasefire but 
quickly collapsed iran insisted iraq withdraw from territories 
occupied in the last weeks of the war iraq said iran must agree 
first to dredge the shattalarab waterway confluence of the 
tigris and euphrates rivers of war debris 
a 1975 treaty drew the border down the middle of the 120mile 
channel giving iran navigation rights to the strategic waterway 
for the first time 
iraq unilaterally abrogated that treaty when it invaded iran in 
september 1980 following border clashes and demanded full 
sovereignty over the waterway 
but velayati told theologians in qom on tuesday the talks were 
being held within the framework of that treaty irans islamic 
republic news agency said 
it quoted him as saying iran would welcome goodwill gestures 
from iraqi officials

president bush on tuesday described his 
administration as a catalyst for dialogue in south africa saying 
it is important that president f w de klerk now visit the white 
house after nelson mandelas recent trip 
no date has been set for a de klerk visit although bush 
extended an invitation earlier this year mandela the african 
national congress leader freed by de klerk after 27 years in 
prison met with bush during a nationwide tour last month 
bush predicted that de klerks visit will be somewhat 
controversial because of widespread opposition to pretorias 
apartheid policies of racial separation 
there will be a lot of picketers out here i think theyre 
wrong bush told a gathering of magazine publishers at the white 
house 
i think in de klerk you have a new kind of leader in south 
africa bush said adding that he had detected in mandela quite 
a respect for de klerk 
bush reiterated that us economic sanctions against south 
africa will not be lifted until there is more movement toward 
ending apartheid but he also said he does not want the sanctions 
toughened 
he said mandela called him before he left the united states 
with a feeling that the united states government had been 
responsive and certainly interested 
i think more than any of the european countries we can be 
catalytic we were not a colonial power and we are united in our 
opposition to apartheid bush said and then we have an 
afroamerican population here that feels fervently this is a gut 
issue and i think thats a good thing that might not be quite as 
prominent in other countries as well 
those ingredients make our country uniquely able to serve as a 
catalyst between the various factors in south africa and thats 
what i want to try to do

an attorney for a black woman who lost her fight 
to prove she was fired from her irs job because of her light skin 
tone says it was a difficult case to prove and he doesnt know 
whether his client will appeal 
she seemed confident not totally surprised about it a little 
upset and said its time to move on with her life attorney 
hillard j flint said after talking to tracy l morrow 
us district judge charles a moye jr ruled monday that ms 
morrow lost her job because she had a poor attitude that eventually 
led to her dismissal not because of her skin color 
ms morrow had contended she was targeted for harassment by her 
boss ruby lewis and was fired from her job as a clerktypist for 
the internal revenue service because of her lighter skin tone 
ms lewis had said that ms morrow was errorprone belligerent 
frequently late and dishonest 
in his ruling moye said there was considerable testimony 
not only from ms lewis but from others that the plaintiff 
unlike her fellow employees may have been insubordinate immature 
impatient disrespectful and unmanageable 
flint said that without testimony to support ms morrows 
claims it was a difficult case to prove 
ms morrow a former irs temporary employee in seattle was 
hired in atlanta as a clerk typist in 1985 she entered probation 
for a permanent position on dec 9 1985 but was fired on march 
14 1986 
moye last year ruled that such light vs dark blackonblack 
discrimination is possible and that the issue should be decided in 
court 
a nonjury trial was held earlier this year on ms morrows 
claims 
moye who made his ruling after examining closing briefs filed 
by both sides said ms morrow failed to prove anything other than 
that there was animosity between the two women 
other than the testimony by plaintiff the record is devoid of 
any testimony or evidence that would lead this court to believe 
that ms lewis would be likely colorbiased the order said 
curtis e anderson head of the us attorneys civil division 
said he was pleased with the decision 
ms morrow reached at her union city home indicated she did 
not know about the judges ruling 
wow hmm wow she said before hanging up 
ms morrow had sought up to 60000 in back pay and other 
payments plus reinstatement to her job

thousands of drivers lined up at 
dawn tuesday at pumps nationwide to buy cheap soviet gasoline ahead 
of an anticipated price increase of at least 50 percent 
the oil shock has hit the country a little sooner and in a 
more dramatic way than we have expected finance minister vaclav 
klaus said 
he told journalists oil supplies from the soviet union have 
dropped by onethird since jan 1 and said prospects for the rest 
of the year were very uncertain 
czechoslovakia imports 166 million tons of crude per year from 
the soviet union the sole source of oil and natural gas for the 
country 
the lower supplies of oil just happened that is a fact and 
the only way to cut consumption is to increase the prices klaus 
said 
pressed for figures klaus said the price rise would be 
probably more than 50 percent but he refused to be more 
specific saying the new prices would be announced later 
klaus did not say when the new prices would become effective 
but economics minister vladimir dlouhy said monday it would be a 
matter of days 
the current price of gasoline in czechoslovakia is about 110 
per gallon the average monthly income is about 200 
during four decades of communist rule czechoslovakia like 
other east bloc nations was fully dependent on the soviet union 
for oil this spared them the oil crises the west suffered through 
in the 1970s 
right now and especially at the beginning of next year when 
imports from the soviet union will be payable in hard currency we 
are going to pay for those two crises we have managed to ignore 
klaus said 
comecon the sovietled eastern trading bloc has agreed to 
switch to hard currency accounting as of jan 1 
klaus said talks were underway with venezuela iran and iraq to 
try to secure other sources of oil 
planned radical economic reforms to begin next year are to raise 
prices in the country to approximate world levels while lowering 
the exchange rate and making the currency convertible

six soldiers who disappeared from a 
classified intelligence unit in west germany and believed to be 
members of a mysterious group called the end of the world have 
been caught in florida 
the five men and one woman caught over the weekend in this 
florida panhandle city were being held at fort benning ga 
pending a counterintelligence investigation 
however bob hall a spokesman for defense secretary dick 
cheney said the counterintelligence investigation is being 
conducted as a matter of routine because the soldiers had access to 
classified information 
the army says this does not appear to be an espionage case 
said hall 
maj joe padilla an army spokesman at the pentagon said he had 
no information about the end of the world group except that the 
six are apparently members he could not say if it has any 
significance in the investigation or how and when the army came to 
know of their affiliation 
ive heard of a lot of cults but this is a new wrinkle said 
gulf breeze police chief jerry brown 
dallas blanchard a sociology professor and cult expert at the 
university of west florida in nearby pensacola said he hadnt 
heard of the group 
all six soldiers were army intelligence specialists assigned to 
the 701st military intelligence brigade at augsburg west germany 
padilla said he wouldnt say exactly what jobs they performed but 
that their training was in analyzing foreign communications 
the army hasnt filed charges against the six soldiers padilla 
said 
he said an absentwithoutauthorization allegation could 
encompass either absent without leave or the more serious charge of 
desertion 
the disappearance came to the attention of military authorities 
on july 9 hall said brown said that is the date they arrived in 
gulf breeze 
hall and padilla said they didnt know how the six got to 
florida from germany 
the absent soldiers had been staying with two gulf breeze women 
brown said one of the women had met one of the male soldiers last 
year in gulf breeze and struck up a friendship he called her and 
asked if the group could stay with them for a few days brown said 
they were caught after one of the men was stopped by a police 
officer friday night because the taillights on the van he was 
driving werent working brown said 
the man had no drivers license and warrants showed he had been 
listed on thursday as wanted for desertion from the army the chief 
said 
after officers called security police at the pensacola naval air 
station to pick up the man the navy called back to say he was 
traveling with five other soldiers also wanted for desertion or 
being absent without leave brown said 
soon after representatives of the fbi the cia and the national 
security agency called his department as well brown said 
police learned that the five suspects might be at the home of 
the gulf breeze women officers arrested the four men saturday 
at the home police learned the woman was staying at a nearby 
campground on the gulf island national seashore near fort pickens 
where she was arrested brown said 
the two gulf breeze women are not suspected of any wrongdoing 
but brown said he may ask them some more questions after being told 
of the apparent cult connection 
they are just scared to death he said 
he said the soldiers did little more than sleep and watch 
television while at the womens home it sounds like they were 
just resting up and then they were out brown said

the driver of the truck that hit a texas 
school bus last fall sending it into a waterfilled pit and 
killing 21 students should have been able to stop despite faulty 
brakes the national transportation safety board said tuesday 
fortynine other students were injured in the accident near 
alton last september it was the nations worst school bus accident 
since 1976 
the lack of emergency exits there were only two contributed 
to the number of deaths the board said 
ntsb chairman james kolstad said that there were clear 
deficiencies in the trucks brakes but that driver ruben perez 
did not respond soon enough and he did not respond aggressively 
enough 
investigators found the trucks brakes were operating at about 
twothirds strength which should been enough to stop the truck 
perez had said he began applying the brakes 300 feet before the 
collision 
perez said that the brakes failed and that he began to use those 
on the trucks trailer then downshifted gears to try to stop 
perez attorney bob binder of austin texas said the board was 
compounding a tragedy to put the blame on the driver when he was 
given a truck with bad brakes 
the brakes were failing they were not in complete failure but 
they were failing so he perez downshifted which is the proper 
procedure and applied the trailer brakes by hand binder said 
perez watched the ntsb hearing impassively binder would not let 
perez talk to reporters citing a lawsuit perez has filed against 
valley cocacola bottling co which owned the truck 
the ntsb urged the bottling company to improve its 
drivertraining and fleetmaintenance programs 
most of the victims drowned because they couldnt get out of the 
submerged bus the ntsb said calling for more emergency exits on 
school buses 
it made a similar recommendation last year in its report of the 
may 1988 bus and truck collision in kentucky that killed 27 that 
accident involved a school bus converted for use by a church 
the texas collision was the worst us school bus accident since 
may 1976 when 29 were killed in a bus that plunged from a freeway 
ramp near martinez calif 
in the texas accident the bus fell 25 feet into a waterfilled 
pit flipped on its front end and settled the windshield was 
forced out and water rushed into the bus the way the bus settled 
rendered the rear emergency door useless 
the ntsb recommended federal regulations requiring emergency bus 
exits that would not close once they are opened

prime minister vp singhs battle with 
his chief rival in the cabinet showed tuesday that oldstyle 
patronage still plays a big role in indias political life 
but singhs victory in the fourday government crisis also 
demonstrated that indias traditional power politics may be 
changing as the democracy matures 
in last years election singh ousted the nehrugandhi family 
which had governed india virtually since independence in 1947 over 
the weekend he forced the deputy prime minister devi lal to 
rescind the appointment of his son to a powerful local post 
singh a selfstyled champion of clean politics emerged from 
the fight slightly muddied 
no doubt vp singhs image has suffered the events have 
damaged his reputation but he will come out of it predicted 
bhabani sengupta a political commentator for the center for policy 
research 
what happened was a clash between the old style of politics 
and the new style singh wanted to be democratic but devi lal 
played the bad old game and he lost sengupta said in an 
interview 
the crisis erupted last thursday when devi lal engineered the 
reappointment of his eldest son om prakash chautala as chief 
minister of the northern state of haryana 
chautala 55 previously held the post but was accused of 
indirect responsibility for election violence in his constituency 
that killed at least 12 people including an independent candidate 
he was forced to quit may 22 but the violence was never 
investigated 
news reports said his reappointment was part of a deal between 
singh and devi lal to end a cold war between them denials from 
both failed to dispel all suspicion 
challenged by devi lal singh resorted to a threat to resign 
many commentators thought it was a ploy and he retracted the 
threat within 24 hours 
before the conflict was resolved 13 ministers in the 38member 
cabinet or council of ministers resigned and the workings of 
government came to a halt air force planes flew leaders from 
around the nation to new delhi where about 100 meetings took place 
in four days 
the crisis ended monday when chautala agreed to step down for 
the good of the party his father remained in the cabinet and 
the 13 ministers who quit were reinstated 
but few believe the game has been decided the skirmish exposed 
the deep cracks in the governing janata dal party which dominates 
the fiveparty minority coalition and underlined the personal 
hostility between devi lal and singh 
after all this mudslinging it looks they all are friends 
again said mool chand jain a political analyst in haryana 
for them political survival is more important than clean 
politics 
chautala inherited the post of haryanas chief minister when it 
was vacated by devi lal a former wrestler and landowner who built 
a power base on profarmer populism and political handouts 
indian news reports say that as many as 135 family members of 
devi lal received government favors in one form or the other 
dynasty is natural devi lal said in a magazine interview 
recently everyone learns from the head of the family 
he added i appoint my relatives because i have got control 
over them they will go by my directives 
former prime minister rajiv gandhi called the crisis an internal 
affair of the janata dal party but gandhis supporters enjoyed 
watching singhs difficulties 
the events since thursday have made it clear that the clean 
government mr singh had offered us is just a mirage said one 
official of gandhis congress party

people who eat too much fat and salt and dont 
exercise enough already may know better but a fiveyear research 
project shows these destructive habits can be discouraged 
scientists said 
there may be as many as 525 people alive today in salinas and 
monterey calif who would have died during the past 10 years if 
it hadnt been for specially designed health education programs 
there said dr john w farquhar of stanford universitys school of 
medicine 
methods do exist for selfimprovement farquhar said in a 
telephone interview monday 
after five years of community education farquhar said the 
average plasma cholesterol level among residents in salinas and 
monterey was 2 percent below that of people in modesto and san luis 
obispo which were used for comparison he said the pulse rate was 
3 percent lower the smoking rate 13 percent lower 
these figures mask the studys true importance farquhar said 
because people with higher levels would have experienced more 
dramatic declines 
using a method developed by other researchers the data from 
salinas and monterey translates to a 15 percent improvement in the 
mortality rate and a 16 percent decline in heart attack risks 
billions of dollars could be saved annually by this kind of 
reduction in heart attacks nationally said researchers who 
reported their findings in wednesdays issue of the journal of the 
american medical association 
because so many people continue their unhealthy habits despite 
the risks farquhar and his associates reasoned that a program 
going beyond mere education was needed 
so they prepared a special series of radio television and 
newspaper announcements and developed classes meetings mailings 
and other approaches for delivering their message 
the idea was not only to instruct residents on whats healthy 
but also to train them on how to make changes 
if you want to start a walking program where to you get the 
shoes what kind of shoes do you get and how do you get the friend 
down the block to go with you farquhar said illustrating the 
kinds of practical questions his program sought to answer 
or how do you get a healthy meal at a restaurant without 
being obnoxious he said we got down to these kinds of 
specifics 
twice a week for a little more than five years residents of 
salinas and monterey were indoctrinated with this kind of 
information 
if the 15 percent decline in mortality rate proves accurate 
its far better than farquhars expectation we would have been 
satisfied by 5 percent he said 
the stanford researchers plan to count the number of deaths in 
monterey salinas modesto and san luis obispo to establish a more 
precise mortality rate the 15 percent cited in the study is an 
estimate based on the improvement in cholesterol blood pressure 
and other health data 
the study is very impressive said thomas m lasater a 
community health educator at brown university involved in similar 
research at memorial hospital of rhode island in pawtucket 
he said the direct medical costs for people with heart disease 
is equivalent to 300 to 400 a year for every person in the united 
states 
lasater said that if the improvement in mortality rate proves 
accurate the nation could save 11 billion or more a year if 
farquhars methods could be applied across the country 
the cost of farquhars program came to about 4 per person in 
the cities each year farquhar estimated that this is 4 percent of 
the annual per capita expenditure for cigarettes 
what were trying to do is get out a message of hope to policy 
planners health specialists educators and others that methods do 
exist to help communities help themselves he said

the mystery of the missing manhole covers was 
apparently solved tuesday when some of the more than 185 purloined 
lids turned up at a scrapmetal yard 
the case had police and city workers scratching their heads as 
covers disappeared at a rate of more than 25 a day for the past 
week they even considering the possibility of some bizarre new fad 
among children 
but on tuesday castiron manhole covers ranging in weight from 
50 pounds to 200 pounds were found to have been sneaked into 
truckloads of higher grade iron sold to the downtown metal center 
the higher weight brought a higher price said center manager 
robert kelman 
the manhole covers are pretty flat so they can hide them 
well said kelman basically they just used them to weigh down 
the load 
no arrests had been made as of late tuesday afternoon 
police are still pursuing additional leads said anna sklar 
spokeswoman for the city bureau of sanitation 
the discovery of los angeles city manhole covers in piles of old 
pipes truck bodies and reinforcement bars solved the biggest 
mystery in the disappearances what use were the things 
since the covers by themselves were worth only 150 each at 
scrap yards police and city officials couldnt figure out why 
anyone would bother trying to steal the heavy unwieldy covers 
the thief was dubbed manhole man but police dont know 
whether it was a man even a single person or a gang of thieves 
one of the more unusual theories was the covers were being 
stolen by fans of the teenage mutant ninja turtles stars of tv 
cartoons mass merchandising and a hit movie the turtles use 
manhole covers for shields 
most of the covers reported stolen were 2foot diameter 
castiron covers placed over sidewalk storm drains but the metals 
center received even larger middleofthe road covers 
detectives and workers at the metals center were digging through 
heaps of metal to find out how many manhole covers were in the yard 
and looking through files to trace the origin of the scrap metal 
containing the manhole covers they didnt immediately report how 
many they had turned up 
there is some kind of paper trail that can hopefully lead to 
people who did this said kelman 
loads of scrap metal arent checked closely the yard simply 
weighs the truck full then empty by weighing down the load of 
higher grade iron with the lowergrade cast iron manhole covers 
the thieves stood to make about 10 more a ton said kelman 
not a lot but it was something he said 
it had cost the city more than 15000 to buy new covers and to 
pay labor costs to replace them or cover the holes with plywood 
officials were also worried a pedestrian could fall into the 2foot 
holes but so far no injuries have been reported

the independent counsel investigating former 
housing secretary samuel r pierce jr was given a significantly 
broader jurisdiction tuesday to probe developers who received 
federal housing grants during the reagan administration 
the court that supervises the work of independent counsel arlin 
m adams issued an order authorizing him to scrutinize developers 
lobbyists or others who sought and obtained grants from three 
programs run by the department of housing and urban development 
from 1984 through 1988 
adams was appointed in march to investigate allegations that 
pierce and other hud officials had showed illegal political 
favoritism in awarding lucrative rent subsidies under the moderate 
rehabilitation program 
the order by the independent counsel panel of the us circuit 
court of appeals here also authorizes adams to investigate 
allegations of political favoritism in the operation of the urban 
development action grant program and the secretarys discretionary 
fund for technical assistance and special projects 
it also widens the circle of people who may be investigated to 
include officials of other government agencies or other persons 
and entities 
adamss review of the operation of the two additional programs 
was sought by attorney general dick thornburgh in a may 25 letter 
to the independent counsel 
thornburgh referred to allegations made by dubois l gilliam a 
deputy assistant secretary at hud that political considerations 
were an important factor in the award of udag and discretionary 
funds 
gilliam who is serving an 18month sentence for corruption 
told the house government operations employment and housing 
subcommittee that pierce had ordered hud to award grants to 
politically connected developers 
in one instance gilliam said pierce had ordered the approval 
of a 56 million udag grant because his former executive 
assistant lance h wilson was a private consultant for the 
developer of the florida project 
the original mandate authorized adams himself a former federal 
appellate judge to investigate whether pierce and other hud 
officials may have committed the crime of conspiracy to defraud 
the united states or any other federal crimes in selecting 
developers to receive subsidies from the moderate rehabilitation 
program 
the broader mandate issued tuesday empowers adams to fully 
investigate and prosecute all government officials or other 
persons and entities for any federal crimes including conspiracy 
and aiding and abetting in connection with the operation of all 
three programs 
pierce who ran hud for all eight years of the reagan 
administration has denied any wrongdoing he also told congress 
that he did not participate in the daytoday operation of specific 
programs and did not order his aides to award grants 
but gilliam offered a conflicting account in his congressional 
testimony telling lawmakers that pierce had ordered him to 
intervene in projects in nashville cleveland and miami that were 
backed by influential republicans 
gilliam who pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate the 
award of a grant and accepting 8000 in illegal gratuities is 
cooperating with adams investigation under a grant of immunity 
from prosecution according to sources who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
the investigation of the house subcommittee chaired by rep tom 
lantos dcalif also focused on the work of republican 
consultants and lobbyists who helped clients deal with hud 
these consultants included paul manafort a partner in the 
political consulting firm of black manafort stone amp kelly and 
james watt an interior secretary in the reagan administration 
manafort a leading campaign strategist for president bush 
acknowledged to the panel that he engaged in influence peddling 
to help steer millions of dollars worth of hud funds to a project 
he partly owned manafort said his firm was also paid 326000 to 
help developers get hud backing for a project in new jersey 
watt said he met with pierce to help developers win 28 million 
worth of moderate rehabilitation program subsidies for a suburban 
baltimore project

us sen john east committed suicide because 
government doctors failed to diagnose and treat him for a thyroid 
disorder attorneys for the north carolina republicans widow told 
a federal judge tuesday 
this is a case about a death that never should have 
occurred attorney james hourihan said in closing arguments in 
priscilla easts 35 million wrongful death lawsuit against the 
federal government 
east convinced that late diagnosis of his condition had 
permanently impaired his intellect killed himself in his garage on 
june 29 1986 with carbon monoxide from a running car he left a 
note blaming his doctors saying they ruined my health 
but federal attorneys said east 55 freely chose to end his 
life and had been pronounced cured of hypothyroidism for 11 months 
when he died in greenville nc 
this man was able to control himself was lucid in the last 
six months of his life said assistant us attorney ira oring 
us district judge walter black jr who heard the case without 
a jury took it under submission saying he would rule in a timely 
manner he did not set a date 
during an eightweek trial mrs easts attorneys tried to prove 
that navy doctors who provide medical care for congress members 
were negligent in john easts care hourihan said that if 
physicians had administered a simple blood test as early as april 
1983 they would have detected easts thyroid deficiency 
hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce 
the hormone needed to regulate the bodys metabolism 
hourihan noted that for 52 years east had overcome such 
obstacles as partial paralysis by polio his brothers suicide and 
parents deaths he pointed out that east was a lawyer and 
political science professor at east carolina university before 
being tapped to run for the senate in 1980 by the national 
congressional club the political organization of sen jesse helms 
rnc 
east lapsed into a coma when he was admitted to bethesda naval 
medical center in april 1985 not long after he regained 
consciousness east tried to kill himself by ramming a chair leg 
down his throat a manifestation of the psychotic state induced by 
extreme hypothyroidism 
easts condition was diagnosed when a hospital resident ordered 
the appropriate blood test 
hourihan said that whether or not easts thinking abilities 
actually were damaged after his metabolism was returned to normal 
the senator believed they were beyond repair hourihan said the 
fact or the belief created in east an irresistible impulse to kill 
himself attributable to navy doctors failure to treat the senator 
according to medical standards 
hourihan faulted rear adm freeman cary head of the 
congressional medical office who hourihan said treated east for a 
myriad of symptoms over two years 
dr cary treated each of these problems separately he never 
put them together and tried to evaluate them hourihan said 
but government defense attorney oring contended that mrs easts 
attorneys failed to show easts suicide was inevitable and a direct 
result of the late diagnosis of his thyroid disorder 
oring showed a portion of a onehour cable television interview 
with the senator in may 1986 a month before his death in which a 
poised and articulate east discussed national politics

two cosmonauts took a walk in space tuesday to try 
to repair a thermal blanket that has partially ripped apart and 
could interfere with their safe return to earth soviet media 
reported 
cosmonauts anatoly solovyev and alexander balandin opened the 
hatch of the mir space station as the orbiting spacecraft entered 
the shadow of the earth radio moscow reported 
they moved along the outside of the station to their soyuz tm9 
capsule which is docked to the mir to inspect and make decisions 
on whether they could repair the thermal insulation the radio 
report said 
according to the results we have gotten so far we can 
almost definitely state that it the thermal insulation problem 
will not affect the landing vladimir a solovyev a former 
cosmonaut and the flight controller said in a live report from 
baikonur space center on the evening news program vremya 
he said the landing would take place on aug 9 as scheduled 
the cosmonauts experienced some delays during their space walk 
but caught up to their schedule and the time spent on the walk 
would total more than 4 hours the controller reported 
there were no further reports immediately in the soviet media on 
whether they actually repaired the thermal insulation or other 
results of their space walk 
vremya showed a fuzzy picture of the spacecraft with what 
appeared to be flapping thermal insulation part of the insulation 
has been flapping uselessly for months 
earlier tuesday a correspondent for vremya displayed some 
of the tools the cosmonauts would use including what looked liked 
a large pair of shears 
soviet officials extended the cosmonauts flight until aug 9 to 
give them extra time to make the repairs soviet newspapers 
reported last month they had been scheduled to return july 30 
after nearly six months in space 
it was the latest in a series of problems in the soviet unions 
manned space program which for decades has been a source of 
national pride for the past two years the program has been 
plagued by docking equipment malfunctions human error and budget 
cuts 
soviet officials have minimized the danger saying the capsule 
could withstand such damage to its thermal blanket the newsaper 
izvestia reported james oberg an american specialist on the 
soviet space program agreed 
i dont think theres danger i think theres anxiety over 
something more going wrong oberg said last month in an interview 
nearly half the thermal blanket has separated from the capsule 
and a 6footlong section is hanging off attached only on one 
side the newspaper trud reported the damage probably occurred 
during launch of the capsule feb 11 when a ground rescue structure 
scratched the thermal blanket according to deputy flight director 
viktor blagov 
the american magazine aviation week and space technology 
reported may 21 that because of the damage the soyuz spacecraft 
had cooled and moisture built up inside izvestia said temperature 
changes could damage equipment needed for reentry 
the space station is being turned twice daily to keep the 
damaged section in the sunlight so it stays warm and hot air is 
being pumped from mir into the capsule to prevent a moisture 
buildup izvestia said 
but izvestia also said part of the ripped shield is blocking an 
infrared sensor used for navigation meaning a manually controlled 
landing might be necessary in addition izvestia said the ripped 
section might catch on an antenna attached to the mir as the soyuz 
capsule undocks 
oberg said there was little threat the capsule would burn up 
during its reentry into the atmosphere because the thermal 
blankets are separate from the shield used to protect the craft in 
that phase of the flight 
a new crew is scheduled to be launched aug 1 to occupy mir 
after solovyev and balandin leave

could be no lasting peace in the southern african region until 
apartheid was ended in his homeland 
the black south african leader said his countrys whiteminority 
government bore a large responsibility for the civil wars in 
mozambique and angola that have continued since the mid1970s the 
mozambican national news agency aim reported 
as long as apartheid exists there can be no lasting peace in 
mozambique or anywhere else in the region mandela told a rally 
in the coastal city of beira 
a peace based on democracy and justice for all in south africa 
will result in establishing permanent peace in southern africa

a protester who was just evicted from her 
campsite at the motel where the rev martin luther king jr was 
killed faced a new threat tuesday a summons for blocking the 
sidewalk at her new protest camp 
jacqueline smith had camped in front the lorraine motel for more 
than two years ever since deputies evicted her from the motel 
itself to protest the construction of a civil rights museum there 
ms smith pitched her tent on the other side of the street after 
sheriffs deputies acting on a court order carried her from the 
original campsite monday 
she had hardly settled in however before city police handed 
her a summons for blocking the sidewalk 
she was scheduled to appear in court sept 5 and a police 
commander said the city would order her to move if she is convicted 
i intend to remain right here said ms smith 39 a former 
motel employee who wants a homeless shelter or medical clinic built 
on the site 
much of the small downtown motel has already been demolished to 
make way for the national civil rights center which is to open 
next year 
the wing where the civil rights leader was shot to death on 
april 4 1968 is being restored and will serve as the museums 
centerpiece 
inspector david dugger commander of the neighborhoods police 
precinct said ms smith is charged with blocking a sidewalk with 
her tent and other belongings 
well leave her there until such time as she has her day in 
court he said 
ms smiths first camp was on state property but she moved onto 
city land monday after her eviction dugger said 
the court order to evict was issued last week after the 
construction company said ms smith was in the way 
the lorraine was in disrepair when when it was sold at a 
foreclosure auction in 1982 
it took another several years for the citizens group that bought 
it to persuade the state county and city governments to build the 
museum

serbian leader slobodan milosevic on 
tuesday closed the founding congress of the republics socialist 
party with a pledge that the renamed communists would not veer from 
their political objectives 
in a bid to discard their conservative image serbias ruling 
communists merged with a sister organization and renamed themselves 
the socialist party 
milosevic who also is serbias president was elected leader of 
the new party it seeks to unite all leftwing groups in the 
largest yugoslav republic 
the left should not fear that this party will swing toward the 
right while the right should not hope that this party will come 
closer to them milosevic said 
in the weeks preceding the merger between the communist party 
and the republics socialist alliance a communistrun mass 
movement serbias still illegal opposition denounced the move as a 
sham designed to keep the communists in power as long as possible 
the growing opposition which has demanded free elections in the 
republic says the merger gave the communists control of the 
socialist alliances substantial assets and media it currently 
controls 
two serbian opposition groups in another show of dissent on 
tuesday scheduled a memorial mass throughout the republic for gen 
draza mihajlovic a former leader of royalist chetnik guerillas who 
fought communist partisans in world war ii 
about 2000 anticommunists hailed serbian chetnik movement 
president vojislav seselj who praised the general as a hero and 
martyr and denounced the serbian communist regime 
the rally also cheered mirko jovic the leader of the serbian 
renewal movement another nationalist party and sang serbian 
nationalist songs 
police tried on two occasions to stop the rally on grounds that 
it was not officially approved but the gathering ended without 
incident 
mihajlovic depicted by the victorious communists as a war 
criminal was executed after a brief trial on july 17 1946 
notices printed by the newlyformed chetnik party and calling 
for serbs to attend the church commemorations and a rally in 
downtown belgrade were torn down by police newspaper reports said 
croatia and slovenia yugoslavias two westwardleaning states 
earlier this year held the first free elections in the country in 
45 years both ballots were won by centerright parties 
the founding congress was marked by infighting among delegates 
over who should be included in the socialist partys new 111member 
ruling council several speakers complained that most of the 
proposed members were in the communist party leadership 
milosevic gained popularity in serbia for virtually abolishing 
the autonomy of the republics kosovo province where ethnic 
albanians make up a majority of the people 
earlier this month serbia disbanded kosovos parliament after 
114 ethnic albanian deputies announced plans to declare kosovos 
independence from serbia

a mentally retarded man was sentenced 
to death tuesday for a second time for raping and fatally stabbing 
a young woman in 1979 
jurors deliberated for about 2 hours before deciding johnny 
paul penry 34 should be executed for the death of pamela 
carpenter 22 the sister of former national football league kicker 
mark moseley of the washington redskins 
the state district court jury which last week convicted penry 
of capital murder could have sentenced penry to life in prison or 
death by injection 
penry showed no emotion when the verdict was announced 
he asked me what the verdict was said defense attorney john 
wright i think he did not understand 
wright and fellow defense attorney robert smith said they would 
appeal 
mrs carpenters mother rossie moseley expressed relief at the 
verdict 
this cant bring pam back but really i think he deserves the 
punishment she said 
district attorney joe price said he was hopeful all along of a 
death sentence but feared questions about penrys mental 
retardation would hamper the jury 
i was delightfully surprised price said they didnt get 
confused over the judges instructions 
in final arguments smith urged jurors to sentence penry to life 
in prison 
he deserves very severe punishment smith said standing 
behind penry with his hands on his clients shoulders it is 
right to punish him it is wrong to kill him 
if theres anybody in this room who believes in the death 
penalty its johnny paul penry because he inflicted it said 
polk county district attorney joe price hes got no internal 
controls no remorse no conscience hes dangerous 
tests have shown penry has an iq of about 60 and the reasoning 
capacity of a 7yearold 
penry has been on death row since 1980 when he was convicted 
and sentenced to die for mrs carpenters slaying 
in 1986 he came within hours of lethal injection before getting 
a stay 
the case went to the us supreme court which upheld the 
constitutionality of executing retarded killers but the court 
vacated penrys sentence agreeing with defense attorneys that the 
jury should have been told of penrys retardation 
in his charge to the jury tuesday state district judge joe ned 
dean pointed out they must weigh mitigating circumstances 
mrs carpenter was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a pair 
of scissors she was using to make a halloween costume for her 
niece she described her killer to police before dying in a 
hospital emergency room 
penry who confessed to the slaying had been on parole for 
about three months after serving two years of a fiveyear term for 
rape

the senate appropriations committee voted 
tuesday to limit defense spending next year to 2949 billion 84 
billion less than president bush wants 
the 244 bipartisan vote was only the most recent indication 
that in light of improving relations with the east congress 
intends to give the pentagon less than the white house thinks is 
right 
all 15 voting committee democrats and nine of its 13 republicans 
voted for the 2949 billion figure 
both sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the 
appropriations defense subcommittee and the subcommittees ranking 
republican sen ted stevens of alaska complained that the defense 
figure was too low 
but appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
whose panel also adopted limits on spending for domestic and 
foreign aid programs said the deficit was putting pressure on all 
programs 
tough choices will be necessary for all subcommittees byrd 
said 
the figure the appropriations panel approved is halfway between 
the defense spending totals that have been approved by two rival 
senate committees 
the senate budget committee headed by sen james sasser 
dtenn a negotiator at the budget talks between congress and the 
white house would cut military spending to 2934 billion 
the senate armed services committee whose chairman is the 
influential sen sam nunn dga has voted for a level of 2964 
billion 
the figure adopted by the appropriations committee is the 
starting point from which the panels members will craft military 
spending legislation for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
the number could change however if budget negotiators work out 
a deal their talks have been under way for more than two months 
meanwhile in the house the chairman of the armed services 
committee and house speaker thomas s foley dwash reached a 
tentative agreement on tuesday for the panel to begin crafting a 
fiscal 1991 defense bill later this month 
committee action on the bill was not expected until september 
but the panels subcommittees will likely start work on the 
legislation the week of july 23 said the committees ranking 
republican rep william dickinson of alabama 
unlike the senate armed services committee which crafted a bill 
based on its chairmans total of 289 billion the house panel will 
draw up legislation based on the lower houseapproved budget of 
283 billion 24 billion less than requested by bush it faces 
opposition from republicans and conservative democrats 
its going to be horrendous gutwrenching dickinson said

james h meredith a civil rights pioneer 
who now works for sen jesse helms contended tuesday that a cadre 
of white men control american blacks and their leaders 
meredith made the allegation when asked about a charge he made 
monday that many of the delegates to last weeks naacp convention 
are involved in the drug culture 
helms rnc is running for reelection against democrat 
harvey gantt a black who was mayor of charlotte helms said he did 
not approve in advance the statement meredith issued monday on 
helms stationery but said he generally agreed with it 
when informed of merediths comments gantt said i dont know 
what the heck hes talking about 
meredith who in 1962 was the first black to enter the 
university of mississippi was active early in the civilrights 
movement but he soon fell out with such mainstream organizations 
as the naacp and has been a harsh critic of the civilrights 
establishment 
he argues that the laws those groups advocate just reinforce the 
concept that blacks are inferior to other americans 
in the news release meredith said had background profiles on 
more than half of the 3000 delegates to the naacp convention in 
los angeles and over 60 percent are involved in the drug culture 
and at least 80 percent are involved in criminal or immoral 
activities he said tuesday he stood by the allegation 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people responded by calling 
meredith an intellectual vagrant lacking any visible means of 
support 
we call on sen jesse helms to disavow this statement and 
to take appropriate disciplinary action against mr meredith 
hooks said in a statement issued in baltimore it would serve no 
useful purpose to address such ludicrous accusations from one who 
has obviously lost touch with reality 
meredith maintained all highlevel black government officials 
owe their positions to the purported group of 15 whites that 
includes he said the chairman of the democratic party the 
mayor of any city city councilmen in most cases in the big cities 
any highlevel position in city government 
he said he knew the names of the 15 men but refused to divulge 
them 
helms who hired meredith as a special assistant last year at a 
salary of about 30000 a year defended his aide 
it is his right to express his opinion and i would think the 
press would respect that even if he does not espouse the liberal 
ideas the press supports helms said the press in north 
carolina seems bent on injecting race into this campaign rather 
than fairly reporting the facts 
meredith also said that blacks had more control over their lives 
during slavery than they do now until 25 years ago the black 
race had control of all their domestic affairs he said 
and he accused black leaders especially leaders of the naacp 
and the democratic party of not caring 
i bet you there were not 10 people in that convention who 
lived near the black community he said three thousand people 
dont have the right to sell the interest of 30 million people 
meredith said his prime sources of information on the naacps 
leaders were people who were there and said he has a 
nationwide network of connections 
he added that this activity was not part of his official duties 
the news release dated july 14 was mailed to north carolina 
reporters at senate expense 
it said according to reports in the washington post the 
3000 delegates at the naacps 81st national convention were 
unanimous in agreeing that black officials are being harassed by 
government prosecutors why are they taking this stand 
i think we need to look into the backgrounds of these 
socalled leaders meredith said 
he called upon the naacps hooks and two other black leaders 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown and national urban 
league head john jacobs to reveal whether theyd ever taken drugs 
and to discuss their moral standards 
jenny terzano a spokeswoman for the democratic national 
committee said monday that brown will submit to a drug test any 
day of the week if james meredith submits to an iq test 
calls to jacobs seeking comment tuesday were not immediately 
returned

more than 250 indian chiefs from across 
canada were called into emergency session tuesday to plan strategy 
in a land dispute case that has led to an armed standoff between 
mohawks and quebec police 
one police officer has been killed though responsibility in 
that death has yet to be fixed area residents have asked for 
military intervention and the montreal la presse said possible 
vigilante action was being plotted 
the paper said tuesday that members of a citizens movement 
supported by some local business people were ready to take action 
themselves if the mercier bridge into nearby montreal stays 
blocked a reporter was shown weapons stockpiled by the group 
mohawks from the kahnawake reserve have blockaded the bridge for 
a week in support of the oka indians

spend an extra two hours a day traveling to and from work 
antinative demonstrations have taken place at police cordons near 
the bridge including the nightly burning of a mohawk in effigy 
the dispute stems from plans by oka a town 18 miles west of 
montreal to build a golf course addition on what the mohawks say 
is ancestral land quebec police last wednesday tried to tear down 
an indian blockade and an officer was killed during a brief 
gunfight

a nicaraguan diplomat who allegedly recruited 
other embassy workers to smuggle heroinfilled suitcases into the 
united states and australia was arrested in tokyo on tuesday 
authorities said 
william tapia recently promoted to the no 2 position in the 
nicaraguan embassy in tokyo was charged in a federal indictment 
unsealed tuesday with conspiring to smuggle heroin worth up to 21 
million from thailand to new york 
he was dismissed from his job by the nicaraguan government and 
arrested by japanese authorities acting on a warrant issued in 
brooklyn said us attorney andrew maloney 
in managua the nicaraguan foreign ministry said it had stripped 
tapia of his diplomatic immunity at the request of the us and 
japanese governments so that he could be arrested 
tapia 47 will be extradited to new york within 45 days to 
stand trial maloney said 
tapia worked since at least 1986 with two prominent hong kong 
dealers to smuggle heroin to new york and sydney australia said 
assistant us attorney cathy palmer 
the indictment filed feb 6 in new york after an 18month 
investigation charges tapia arranged two trips in 1987 for a 
guatemalan diplomat jorge rueda to smuggle a total of 125 pounds 
of china white heroin to new york 
tapia received between 300000 and 400000 per trip for 
recruiting the diplomats he is suspected of arranging at least 
four more trips maloney said 
all of the diplomats recruited were from central or south 
american countries and stationed in tokyo he said 
rueda was arrested in australia in april 1988 on heroin 
importation charges and subsequently convicted 
a foreign ministry official in japan speaking on condition of 
anonymity said tapia first came to japan as the embassys cultural 
attache in 1968 he resigned in 1979 but rejoined the embassy as 
first secretary in june 1986 and was recently promoted to 
counselor the official said 
palmer said tapias arrest may not significantly affect the 
amount of heroin on the streets in new york but that it would make 
it harder for hong kong drug lords to bring it in 
it takes out a very secure method for smuggling using 
diplomats she said they are subject to almost no scrutiny 
upon arrival 
us customs agents normally do not inspect the luggage of 
diplomats because of their status maloney said

inspections by the food and drug 
administration of the top 13 laboratories that conduct a key test 
on generic drugs found problems at two an agency spokesman said 
tuesday 
the problems were most severe at biodecision laboratories in 
pittsburgh where all but two of 13 studies reviewed by the 
inspectors violated fda regulations or fell short of accepted 
laboratory practice said fda spokesman don mclearn 
problems were also found at the university of tennessee college 
of pharmacy in memphis mclearn said he said he did not know the 
specific problems there but he said theyre minimal theyre 
clearly not to the degree as the one in pittsburgh 
the inspections at the 13 labs which conduct 95 percent of the 
bioequivalency studies done on generic drugs were conducted as 
part of a followup to disclosures of fraud and corruption in the 
generic drug industry last year eleven of the labs had no 
problems mclearn said 
bioequivalency testing is aimed at showing that a candidate 
generic drug reaches the same concentration in the bloodstream as 
the patented drug for which it would be sold as a substitute after 
the patent expires 
the inspection at biodecision was conducted also as a followup 
to anonymous allegations of wrongdoing according to the fda 
inspection report the document said allegations of poor science 
were found to be supportable evidence of fraud conspiracy and 
conflict of interest was not 
however rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce investigations subcommittee wants the fda to 
conduct more intensive examinations of the studies done by these 
labs on generic drugs that were approved based on those studies 
dingell in a letter monday also asked health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan to instruct the fda to come up 
with a plan by aug 8 to determine the validity of the biodecision 
studies 
biodecision has conducted 20 percent to 30 percent of the 
bioequivalency studies that have resulted in approved generic 
drugs dingell said 
given the impact on the generic industry from corruption found 
to date this latest revelation concerning biodecision of 
impropriety is truly calamitous dingell said 
mclearn said the fda has not responded to dingells request for 
more investigation of biodecisions studies or his request for more 
intensive investigations at the other testing labs 
dingell said that since the biodecision inspection was triggered 
by fraud allegations he doubted the inspections at the other labs 
were as intense 
mclearn said biodecision promised to correct the flaws 
company president robert lecher did not return a telephone for 
comment on tuesday but he was quoted by the washington post as 
saying we view the entire process as very constructive and have 
taken it extremely seriously we dont take issue or disagree with 
any of the observations 
in memphis gil hayes a spokesman for the college of pharmacy 
said we have no information as to what the nature of the 
deficiency might be well investigate that we feel quite 
confident that our college of pharmacy has performed an exemplary 
service over many years

the leader of south africas zulus on tuesday 
denounced the african national congress refusal to reject violence 
and reiterated his opposition to economic sanctions against south 
africa 
chief mangosuthu buthelezi whose inkatha movement is the ancs 
chief rival also said the anc was seeking political gain through 
confrontation 
he warned that unless other predominantly black groups were 
included in constitutional negotiations with the whiteled 
government the anc would have a stranglehold on black 
representation 
south african revolutionaries like revolutionaries 
everywhere do not fight revolutions to enable other political 
parties to gain power buthelezi said in an address to the center 
for policy studies 
the center is a rightwing think tank that advises britains 
conservative government buthelezi arrived in britain monday on a 
mainly private visit 
the anc is entirely wrong when it calls for continuation of 
the armed struggle calls for the continued employment of economic 
sanctions against south africa calls for the general punitive 
isolation of south africa in every way possible he said 
inkatha which claims 15 million members announced over the 
weekend it had become a multiracial political party 
british prime minister margaret thatcher is the most outspoken 
advocate of easing sanctions against south africa to reward 
president fw de klerk for his reforms and his pledge to end 
apartheid 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which 
south africas 30 million blacks have no vote in national afairs 
the countrys 5 million whites dominate politics and the economy 
nelson mandela the anc deputy president released in february 
after 27 years in jail says economic sanctions should remain until 
south africas black majority is enfranchised under a new 
constitution 
the 12nation european community last month refused to lift its 
relatively mild embargoes saying it needed further evidence that 
reforms were continuing 
british foreign office minister william waldegrave who was in 
the audience tuesdsay said south africas public services for 
blacks were woefully inadequate for such a wealthy country

brandon tartikoff who as programs chief 
helped make nbc first in evening ratings for five seasons was 
appointed tuesday to head a new division that will try to find 
markets for networkproduced shows 
tartikoffs duties will include devising programming ideas for 
nbcs inhouse production company and overseeing the networks 
development think tank of executives for sports prime time 
daytime and latenight programs 
the tartikoff switch was announced tuesday as part of a 
highlevel reorganization of the network 
replacing tartikoff as nbc entertainment president will be 
warren littlefield whose post as executive vice president of prime 
time programs will be assumed by perry simon the departments 
senior vice president 
john agoglia executive vice president of nbc productions also 
will now head the recently formed nbc enterprises which handles 
international distribution and other efforts by the network to 
diversify its business holdings 
tartikoffs admittedly illdefined new job will consist of being 
the grand architect of nbcs big picture he said 
the 41yearold executive took over nbcs prime time schedule 10 
years ago and was hailed for pushing it out of last place into 
first for the last five seasons 
his new post was created to breathe life into nbcs leading but 
aging programming and to hold onto executives such as littlefield 
whose contract expires next month 
in an interview tuesday littlefield said he asked for 
tartikoffs job and got it 
brandon said he didnt want to sit in on these prime time 
meetings anymore and i said good i dont want you here 
littlefield said 
brandon was great about it littlefield said this gives 
him more time to run nbc productions and the development group 
the nbc network currently serves more than 200 affiliates nbcs 
announcement didnt specify what kinds of new outlets tartikoff 
will seek for nbcmade productions 
but the company is active in cable as a coowner of cnbc and 
sportschannel america 
it also is a partner with three other companies in sky cable a 
direct broadcast satellite program service scheduled to begin 
operations in late 1993

west german politician oskar lafontaine who 
says german unification is going too fast used an east berlin 
campaign appearance tuesday to say the oncedivided city deserved 
its place as a central european metropolis 
he did not say what he thought about berlins becoming the 
capital of a united germany as most other east and west german 
politicians have suggested 
lafontaine only recently recovered from an attempt on his life 
a disturbed woman stabbed him in the neck during the april party 
conference that nominated him for chancellor and he was rushed to a 
hospital in serious condition 
his assailant was committed to a mental asylum 
social democrat lafontaine is chancellor helmut kohls main 
rival in general elections scheduled in west germany for dec 2 
the 42yearold prime minister of west germanys saarland region 
has repeatedly criticized kohl a christian democrat for 
proceeding too quickly with german unification 
but lafontaine could end up playing a major role in joint 
eastwest german elections those elections expected also on dec 
2 probably will lead to formal unity that month 
during his daylong east berlin visit lafontaine said he would 
play an active role in the campaign for next octobers elections in 
the five soontobeestablished east german regions that are to 
make up the eastern part of a united germany

authorities tuesday arrested at least 17 
people accused of being part of a 16state cocaine and marijuana 
ring a us drug enforcement administration official said 
we feel confident we have pretty much immobilized an entire 
organization said gerard murphy the top dea agent in arizona 
another two of the 40 people indicted in the case were in 
mexican jails murphy said twentyone remained at large 
law enforcement officers also seized 1 million in cash cars 
and other assets he said 
since 1984 the southern arizonabased ring has distributed 
1000 kilograms of cocaine 305 tons of marijuana and 1 million 
methaqualone tablets around the country murphy said he could not 
estimate the value of the drugs 
the ring was headed by michael hooks who has been in a mexico 
city prison on mexican charges since june 1987 the agent alleged 
murphy declined to release any other information about hooks 
authorities arrested seven people in tucson and one each in san 
francisco mobile and birmingham ala nashville tenn and grand 
rapids mich murphy said three other suspects were already in 
prisons in california and another was in douglas ariz 
mexican officials have been asked to transfer hooks to american 
custody he said 
suspects were also being sought in florida illinois oklahoma 
texas and arkansas murphy said the ring also operated in

the us customs service the internal revenue service and the 
arizona department of public safety also took part in the probe 
a 1986 raid in tucson turned up 16 kilograms of cocaine and

clandestine arizona airstrips for storage and subsequent 
distribution he said

federal grand jury in tucson involved actions in 1985 and 1986

attorneys for floridas death row 
inmates have seized on a botched execution arguing their clients 
would be burned alive in the states electric chair 
they contend the electric chair is broken and have produced 
photographs of executed inmates in an attempt to prove that killing 
a person in the chair amounts to unconstitutionally cruel and 
unusual punishment two statepaid attorneys have even offered 
4000 to fix the 66yearold chair 
the issue has been raised in five appeals by death row inmates 
since the states last execution may 4 courts delayed the 
executions of all five but in only one case did the chair issue 
play a role in a decision 
two other courts rejected the defective chair issue 
the efforts began after the electrocution of jesse tafero 
flames and smoke shot from under the headpiece he wore 
the state department of corrections and gov bob martinez have 
maintained that tafero died instantly and that the fire was caused 
by a new synthetic sponge under the headpiece instead of natural 
sponge used in other executions 
the defense lawyers contend that tafero was burned alive and 
that anyone else put to death in the chair would be subjected to 
the same torturous fate thus violating the constitutional ban 
against cruel and unusual punishment 
the faultychair issue was raised for the fifth time in an 
appeal filed with the florida supreme court for jerry white who 
was scheduled for execution wednesday at 701 am 
the court on tuesday rejected whites claims but gave him his 
second 24hour stay in as many days 
his attorneys then turned to us district judge patricia 
fawsett in orlando who also rejected his claims in an order issued 
late tuesday his case now goes to the 11th circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta whites execution was rescheduled for thursday 
at 701 am 
white 42 was condemned for shooting a customer to death during 
the 1981 robbery of a small grocery store in the central florida 
town of taft 
the issue of the chairs condition was raised in the case of 
judi buenoano who was granted an indefinite delay by a federal 
appeals court 
the electric chair argument has been rejected in her appeals by 
a federal judge in orlando and by the state supreme court which 
said the chairs condition should be decided by the executive 
rather than the judicial branch 
defense attorneys argue that a broken head electrode lowered the 
level of electricity sent through taferos body from a fatal 2400 
volts to as low as 90 or 100 volts witnesses saw tafero move and 
breathe after the first two jolts of electricity he was pronounced 
dead after the third 
color photographs of the last nine men executed in florida have 
been included in the defense motions in an attempt to show that the 
damage done to taferos skull and leg differs from the damage done 
to the head and legs of the eight men executed before him 
burn marks on taferos body show that he received a much lower 
voltage according to the state agency that represents poor death 
row inmates 
last week two agency attorneys offered to donate up to 4000 
to buy a new electrode in exchange they would drop the issue from 
one inmates appeal 
the attorney for a death row inmate executed last week in 
alabama also argued that states electric chair was defective the 
appeal claimed that electric chair is inhumane based on two 
instances in which inmates were not killed with the first flip of 
the switch

british opposition leader neil kinnock 
discussed with president bush on tuesday the growing momentum 
toward german unification and the need for western aid to the 
soviet union 
kinnock on a twoday visit to the united states hopes to 
convince us officials and lawmakers that his labor party would be 
as reliable a partner for washington in the new europe as the 
conservative party government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
or more so 
kinnock conceded that his party had traditionally been closer to 
the us democratic party but said his talks with the republican 
administration were very amicable and rewarding 
he said it was too soon to say whether bush shared with mrs 
thatcher the same close relationship she enjoyed with his 
predecessor ronald reagan 
i hope she wont be around long enough for us to find out 
kinnock said 
mrs thatcher has been prime minister since 1979 the longest 
tenure in office of any government leader in a major western 
country 
at the start of the 30minute meeting with bush in the oval 
office meeting kinnock was asked whether he shared the views of 
thatchers confidant nicholas ridley about uppity germans 
his reply was emphatic absolutely not i know very few people 
who do 
ridley said in a magazine last week that the germans were trying 
to take over europe the ensuing furor led him to resign as mrs 
thatchers trade secretary 
we talked about how to help the soviets without being 
patronizing said kaufman 
kinnock differs from thatcher and bush in believing europe 
should help the soviet union with more than just technical advice 
but loans and investments that could lead to the purchase of 
british goods 
kaufman said kinnock congratulated bush on his role n bringing 
about a relaxation of natos defense strategy at the 16nation 
alliance summit in london earlier this month 
the changed strategy enabled gorbachev to make his decision 
about nato membership for a united germany kaufman quoted kinnock 
as saying 
earlier in separate meetings with defense secretary dick cheney 
and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger kinnock 
emphasized labors support for a continued us military presence 
in europe 
the continued us presence is a matter of importance 
kinnock said he told the us officials 
kinnocks visit was in sharp contrast to his previous trip in 
1987 when president reagan gave kinnock less than 20 minutes in 
the white house all the while criticizing labors demands for 
unilateral nuclear disarmament 
since then kinnock has persuaded labor to give up that policy 
and to accept the presence of american troops and nuclear weapons 
in europe 
on wednesday he will be guest of honor at a lunch given by sen 
joe biden ddel who was forced to withdraw from the campaign for 
the 1988 democratic presidential nomination after admitting he 
plagiarized a kinnock speech

a stepfather fatally injured a 
2yearold by plunging him headfirst into a toilet during potty 
training because he had a bad day a prosecutor told jurors 
tuesday in the mans murder trial 
thomas coe 23 sat expressionless as attorneys made opening 
arguments in the firstdegree murder and aggravated childabuse 
case which has already brought changes in state law and 
prosecutions of several social workers 
bradley mcgee died of head injuries july 28 1989 two months 
after he was ordered returned from state foster care to his 
biological mother sheryl coe and her husband thomas 
the defense insisted the parents were just toilettraining the 
youngster and believed they were doing right even if they 
crossed the line 
the state which plans to seek the death penalty if coe is 
convicted focused opening arguments on the day leading up to the 
childs death early on prosecutors told circuit court jurors coe 
flew into a rage searching for a clean shirt for a job interview 
he took bradley and his wife with him and arrived late for the 
interview on the way home bradley soiled his pants the last 
straw for coe prosecutors said 
that defendant right there assistant state attorney william 
jennings shouted because he had a bad day took bradley back 
into the bathroom of that trailer picked him up by the ankles and 
repeatedly plunged this small helpless child into that hard 
porcelain toilet 
he fully confessed to having dunked bradley into the toilet so 
many times he couldnt even remember jennings said and the 
evidence will show that with bradleys head still in the toilet 
he flushed it 
after that coe put his stepson in the shower then both parents 
beat him with pillows until he stiffened and collapsed prosecutors 
said 
defense attorney robert norgard urged jurors to look at the 
facts and not be swayed by emotion 
the bottom line is mr coe did not torture bradley and did not 
maliciously punish him as defined by law norgard said 
the coes were having trouble toilet training the boy and made a 
point of using negative reinforcement norgard said 
in their minds they were doing what was right he told the 
jurors 
the defense also asked jurors to be wary of the testimony of 
mrs coe 21 who pleaded no contest to seconddegree murder and 
aggravated child abuse and is serving 30 years in prison 
she is expected to be the prosecutions key witness testifying 
that coe routinely abused bradley 
norgard said mrs coe has given at least four different versions 
of events trying to distance herself from the incident to make 
life easier for herself in prison 
bradley was placed in foster care after his mother abandoned him 
at a shopping mall when he was 3 months old 
his death came after a state department of health and 
rehabilitative services caseworker recommended a judge return the 
child to his mother who by then had married coe despite a 
psychological report that questioned the couples abilities as 
parents and explosive personalities 
public outrage over the childs death led legislators to change 
the law placing child welfare above state attempts to reunite 
families 
the case also brought unprecedented charges against four social 
workers over their handling of the case bradleys main caseworker 
was convicted june 15 of felony child abuse for negligence in 
recommending that the child be returned to the coes the other 
three were cleared

hartford who has been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit 
murder in haddads slaying 
according to the arrest warrant which was viewed by two 
reporters in middletown before being sealed ranganathan is accused 
of maliciously damaging and destroying and attempting to damage the 
office of wesleyan president william chace which was firebombed 
april 7 
the warrant signed july 16 by federal magistrate arthur h 
latimer in new haven also accused ranganathan of receiving and 
possessing a firearm that was not registered to him 
ranganathan was arrested in middletown then taken to federal 
court in new haven 
he was 17 at the time of the crime 
prosecutors and agents from the federal bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms refused to discuss the status of the case 
but a us marshal said ranganathan was not being detained he 
left the us courthouse with allan macdonald the chief atf agent

through his cousin in middletown 
haddad was found shot in the head in hartfords keney park in 
his car which contained an undisclosed number of semiautomatic 
weapons 
haddads activism on the wesleyan campus had led authorities to 
believe he was linked to two firebombings at the school but state 
prosecutors said last week there was no evidence to link the 
slaying and the campus attacks 
the first bombing april 7 burned the rug and floor of chaces 
office in the building and caused extensive smoke damage the 
second firebombing april 29 caused only slight damage to the 
outside of the wesleyan boathouse

tuesday chose as its chairman a former un official who declared 
his opposition to past discriminatory policies against the 
countrys ethnic turkish minority

representing the opposition union of democratic forces got 172 
votes seven deputes abstained and four were absent

opposition coalition confirmed it 
when he finally got the floor kyuranov made a patriotic appeal 
for unity 
bulgaria is above all above anyone bulgaria is above the 
opposition and above the majority former communists as well

leader todor zhivkov who was deposed by reform communists last 
november 
in the afternoon session both todorov and savov underwent 
questioning by the lawmakers a novelty in bulgaria 
todorov said that in articles and interviews largely published

to change their moslem names to bulgariansounding ones 
todorov a professor and member of the bulgarian academy of 
sciences is the founder of the academys institute for balkan 
studies

by jeffrey ulbrichequals 
associated press writerequals 
toronto ap a small european freshwater mollusk called the 
zebra mussel has spread at an alarming rate since it was found in 
the great lakes in 1988 threatening the ecosystem and clogging up 
industry 
experts say there is no way to wipe the mussels out 
in the great lakes all we can do is accept the fact that they 
are here and learn to live with it said gerry mackie a biology 
professor at the university of guelph who specializes in freshwater 
bivalves 
criticism in canada focuses on the governments slowness in 
attacking the problem 
the invasion of the zebra mussels was preventable the 
toronto globe and mail said in an editorial canadas complacency 
let it happen and may enable similar invasions unless the country 
takes strong preventive measures 
joe comuzzi a liberal member of parliament complained recently 
that ottawa had committed only 230000 195500 us to the 
problem he said that doesnt even pay for the paper to write a 
report 
the mussel invasion has been expensive for ontario hydro which 
has power plants along the lake shore 
zebra mussels produce a sticky thread that attaches them to 
solid objects water pipes in ontario hydros case the mussels 
are capable of sticking in such numbers that they stop or greatly 
reduce the flow of water 
large intake pipes are not affected but the mussels swim up 
into the smalldiameter service piping inside the plants 
their presence also leads to corrosion 
it has cost us well over 6 million to retrofit all of the 
stations for this year and its costing us lots in research 
said renata claudi a senior scientist with the utility company 
representatives of 13 companies in the chemical valley of 
sarnia ontario got together this month to work out a common 
strategy against the mollusks 
the zebra mussel about 1 inches in diameter is a 
darkcolored clamlike creature with white stripes 
it has a larval stage of about a month when it swims with the 
currents that accounts for much of its rapid spread throug the 
great lakes 
some of the mollusks hitch rides on ships up the lakes through 
huron michigan and superior and others swim down the current into 
the st lawrence seaway 
a female produces 30000 to 40000 eggs in each of its two or 
three years of life 
experts agree zebra mussels entered the great lakes system in 
lake st clair in the summer of 1985 or 1986 they probably were 
flushed from the ballast of a ship that came from europe 
all the great lakes now are infested and scientists say their 
passage into the mississippi river system is inevitable 
they have gone through the niagara river and into lake 
ontario ms claudi said now they are swimming their way 
toward toronto 
scientists are not sure what the ecological impact will be but 
are fearful of it 
you have to keep it in perspective said joe leach a 
research scientist with the ontario natural resources ministry 
the major impacts right now are with the technical devices pipes 
and so on we are looking at potention impacts on fishes 
but at the present time there is no indication of major ecological 
impact 
leach said the main fears were disruption of spawning for fish 
like walleye which lay their eggs on hard rocky areas and that 
the food chain would be altered 
these things are filter feeders he said they filter an 
enormous amount of water and take everything out of it what they 
dont use they put mucus around and drop it down to the bottom 
that shifts a lot of organic matter from the water to the bottom 
of the lake leach said it eventually could change fish populations 
by reducing the number of water column feeders such as walleye and 
trout and increasing catfish sturgeon and other bottom feeders 
there also is increasing evidence of zebra mussels attaching to 
other bivalves and smothering them 
as it stands now there isnt anything you can do leach 
said there is no way you can control them if you use poison 
you are going to poison the system 
ontario hydro uses chlorine the most effective molluscicide 
found so far 
in one affected plant ms claudi said the company applied 
sodium hypochlorite in relatively small doses for about two weeks 
that basically did them in and all we had to worry about was 
cleaning out the shells 
she added that the amount used in an agreement with the 
environment ministry is never more than 10 parts per billion 
compare that with the five parts per million of the same stuff in 
the drinking water we happily drink every day 
ms claudi says ontario hydro was talking to other utilities 
across the lakes the american waterworks association and electric 
power research association but were finding that we are way 
ahead or at the same level as these guys in research 
most experts believe the zebra mussel population eventually will 
level off and perhaps even decline but mackie said the problem was 
trying to determine at what point they will level off or if they 
will crash 
geoff holland of the federal fisheries and oceans department 
said canadian officials probably would meet with provincial and 
us representatives this fall to work out a budget for fighting 
the zebra mussel 
as for ontario hydro ms claudi said prevention is really 
what were looking at we just dont want those guys in our pipe

little italy is getting smaller 
squeezed by gentrification from soho to the north and by 
immigration from chinatown to the south the nations most famous 
italianamerican enclave is turning into a mediterranean version of 
colonial williamsburg 
little italy says urban folklorist joseph sciorra is a 
disneyland for suburbanites who want to recharge their ethnic 
batteries 
buildings on mulberry street still are filled with italian 
restaurants cafes and food stores but the names on the mailboxes 
for the apartments upstairs and the deeds are chinese 
it just isnt an italianamerican community says 
sociologist donald tricarico theres an ethnic economy with 
nothing underneath young italians have been leaving for years 
this is really little china says restaurateur anthony luna 
i dont know why they call it little italy 
little italy once a 50block area stretching from broadway to 
the bowery and from houston to canal streets is now less than half 
its original size there are only a few thousand italians left 
many of them elderly 
of the 4200 legal immigrants who moved into the 10013 zip code 
between 1983 and 1987 3727 came from china taiwan or hong kong 
just 11 came from italy 
even the mafia is not the same certainly not since little 
italys most famous mob restaurant umbertos clam bar was seized 
by the government 
the tough guys are still around but they dont live in the 
neighborhood says tricarico they commute 
that includes john gotti reputed boss of the gambino crime 
family who crosses the bridge from queens every day in his 
mercedes 
italians began moving into lower manhattan in the 1880s and 
between 1890 and 1924 they displaced their irish predecessors on 
the blocks along mulberry street by 1932 98 percent of the 
residents were of italian birth or parentage and as late as the 
1950s many young people stayed to raise families 
but the tenements got older and even more crowded and 
confidence in the neighborhood was undercut by plans since 
abandoned to build an expressway through it italians fled to the 
suburbs in vast numbers today neighboring westchester has more 
italianamericans than any county in the nation 
meanwhile neighboring chinatowns population was rising from 
11000 in 1941 to more than 70000 now for years canal street had 
divided the two communities but in the 1970s the chinese began to 
spill across that cultural moat 
there was some resistance graffiti was scrawled on some of the 
new chinese signs but the newcomers paid top dollar in 1980 a 
real estate man named john zaccaro the husband of former vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro was quoted as saying 
that 70 percent of the districts buildings were owned by chinese 
today buildings with italian names carved into the masonry bear 
signs with chinese characters and the floors above the italian 
restaurants are occupied by chinese workshops lendys on grand 
street for years a popular italian hardware store is now a 
popular chinese hardware store 
but little italy is sustained by its two enduring assets its 
food and its mobsters a combination that seems to appeal to 
tourists 
the chamber of commerce says little italy gets about 100000 
visitors a month and a sevenstory tourist hotel the 
neighborhoods first is scheduled to break ground later this year 
although the mafias influence has shrunk along with the 
neighborhood the publicity about the mafia is good for the 
restaurants tricarico says people come in to drink cappuccino 
and see the mobsters 
the chief attraction is gotti who eats lunch at restaurants 
like forlinis and giambones where he frequently shares the 
dining room with prosecutors and judges from the court buildings 
nearby sated he repairs to the ravenite social club for meetings 
with associates 
a walk past the ravenite a modest brick storefront at 247 
mulberry has become part of the little italy experience along 
with pasta at angelos and cannoli at ferraras 
other stops include umbertos where crazy joe gallo was 
shot in the back while dining on the seafood combination benito 
ii outside which salvatore sally bugs brigulio was gunned 
down and ruggero where former gambino consiglieri joseph n gallo 
no known relation to crazy joe often sat at a table in front of 
the bar 
sometimes the neighborhood seems like a movie set and sometimes 
it really is earlier this spring a makebelieve street fair with 
sausage vendors and kiss me im italian buttons was staged by 
the makers of the godfather part iii 
after a big shootout scene one elderly onlooker said she was 
thrilled shed never seen anything like that in the real little 
italy 
in fact as the mafias schemes have grown larger and more 
sophisticated the old neighborhood rackets numbers extortion 
smalltime loan sharking have become less important they have 
bigger fish to fry now says tricarico theres no need to 
control their old neighborhoods 
at least theres still plenty to eat little italy boasts 56 
restaurants 16 cafes and several dozen food stores the latter 
include alleva founded in 1892 and reputedly the nations oldest 
mozzarella maker and piemonte which makes 20 different kinds of 
pasta daily 
we serve real italian food says anne compoccia a leading 
neighborhood booster not fettuccine with strawberries on it 
ms compoccia insists that little italys old world charm and 
its residents determination to stay put will ensure the survival 
of this neighborhoodturnedtourist attraction 
were stemming the tide she says even if its down to 
just 10 blocks were going to preserve it

doug folsom bought a gun left a recorded 
message telling his wife to hang tough climbed into the 
hammock outside his familys duxbury home and pulled the trigger 
that was more than a month ago on june 6 
the suicide followed two years of watching his young wife and 
3yearold daughter angela wither from acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome he lived with the fear that 4yearold nicolette who so 
far has managed to escape the disease would test positive 
that poor man watching his little girl and his wife just go 
through this deterioration this forced him to kill himself 
something he said hed never do so he was forced to leave me 
said jennifer folsom her body frail from fighting the disease and 
struggling to keep her family together 
she studied a framed photograph of the couple taken years 
earlier both are smiling dougs arm is tossed over her shoulders 
the picture rests on a table within easy reach of jennifers chair 
surrounded by tissues and bottles of medication 
i have a very strong attitude of try me his whole attitude 
was why me he danced as long as he could the wind was just 
taken out of his sails i feel bad for him he didnt deserve 
that 
aids has been a relentless enemy since jennifer was diagnosed in 
february 1988 the doctor gave her the test results in his empty 
office after closing he was concerned she said about how his 
staff would react to an aids patient 
i drove home it was a long ride jennifer recalled all i 
could see was gloom and doom and death i thought of suicide i 
went into my room and i didnt ever want to come out 
it seemed incredible that a blood transfusion during an 
emergency appendectomy in a massachusetts hospital in 1979 before 
blood supplies were tested and purged of the virus probably 
carried the aids virus into her body 
angie she said contracted the virus during the pregnancy or 
later from breastfeeding nicolette is tested every six months 
and jennifer prays her healthy older daughter will remain free 
from aids 
here i am this white middleclass housewife living in 
vermont trying to make a living how dare this disease come into 
my home its aids i eat and drink and sleep aids but im not 
afraid of it anymore jennifer said 
jennifer told her parents she was suffering from aids but told 
others that she had cancer we werent sure how people were going 
to react she said 
she and doug worried that business would fall off that people 
would be afraid to come to their autobody shop the health 
insurance bill which runs about 560 monthly continues to be the 
first bill paid each month and she is left with about 10000 in 
other unpaid bills 
her nightmare had been that nicolette would be harassed when she 
starts school next year a fear the school nurse put to rest by 
telling jennifer there will be no discrimination here 
jennifer lives day to day and the past week had been a bad one 
she was wrapped in a blueandwhite afghan and tired she had lost 
10 pounds last month and was worried about angies lesions and 
weight loss 
angie damp from a bath and refusing to be moved off her 
mothers lap was struggling to breathe with a feeding tube up one 
nostril and a pacifier wedged stubbornly in her mouth 
jennifer glanced distractedly out the livingroom windows 
overlooking a faded yellow motorboat parked in the side yard and a 
small neat vegetable garden wind chimes blew in a breeze along a 
secondfloor balcony 
i lie in bed and there are days i dont even want to get up 
its hard dealing with family life and selfworth knowing that i 
cant care for my own kids and my husband she said breaking 
down then quickly regaining control she said i have such a 
strong gene in me that wants to go on i hope i can hang on 
i went to a party this weekend at my sisters and i was 
sitting there exhausted and i thought im 29 years old i just 
cant be doing what a normal kid would be doing 
she wants to tell her story she said so people will realize 
the aids epidemic exists in rural areas of vermont 
vermont does have aids she said the children of this 
generation need to be taught now because we dont know if there is 
going to be a cure 
she wants to live with dignity and not have people whispering 
behind my back im not ashamed of who i am aids invaded my home 
without permission im just hoping that by me going public 
somebody else can be helped 
for her own help jennifer relies on her family her parents 
visit daily to help care for the children her brother has taken a 
leave of absence from his washington job to help jennifer wade 
through the red tape of locating financial assistance and other 
sisters and brothers help out 
weve also gone through the anger and the hurt said 
jennifers mother june kenney its not right to see your 
daughter so sick when shes so young they should be going on 
picnics and dancing 
a visiting nurse stops by the home to provide the health care 
that supplements jennifer and angies weekly trips to the 
university health center in burlington and two community 
fundraisers are planned to help raise money to cover the mortgage 
and medical bills 
jennifer also attends a support group one woman 10 homosexual 
men 
although a recent entry in her diary reads survival will come 
from humor optimism laughter and selfworth jennifer knows 
death is inevitable 
i think about it more lately that death is reality this is 
reality you cant wash it off in the shower its here and its 
real and theres no light at the end of that tunnel it keeps 
closing in i tell myself constantly youve come too far to give 
in now i just wish it would go away and i know its not going to 
go away she said 
doug folsom knew all of this and he could not bear it 
nicolette who says her mother and sister have buggies 
understands as well she once drew a picture of the blue sky with a 
rope hanging down to the house telling jennifer it was god sending 
a rope for angie 
but nicolette recently amended the caption 
it was for daddy she said

when some of the best minds and the most 
powerful legislative bodies cannot resolve budget deficits 
taxpayers might have to seek new ways to pressure elected officials 
here are a few suggestions gleaned from various sources 
question the elected persons patriotism 
since deficits incurred by one generation are a tax and economic 
liability on future generations the effect is that of taxation 
without representation a a violation of the american principle of 
fair play 
according to the patriots of the american revolution taxation 
without representatation is tyranny oppression a violation of the 
rights of free men and women millions of future generations 
therefore are unfairly taxed 
economist e erich heinemann poses the problem and challenges 
succinctly unless the generation that consumes federal services 
also pays for them there will never be a durable majority to limit 
the size of government 
apply psychological pressure on elected officials 
individuals who consistently habitually spend beyond their 
means are viewed in a variety of negative ways 
many people see them as irresponsible and shiftless some view 
them as ignorant some consider them immoral in serious cases 
psychological counseling and therapy are often recommended 
it has been recommended that the same attitudes be applied to 
political spending and spenders since public image is essential to 
political survival the fear of being branded might stir a 
politicians survival instincts 
publicize the historical record publicize the broken promises 
attempts to cut budget deficits through higher taxes have a long 
record of failure so have socalled budget summits and promises 
it is an old political tradition to be against taxes but somehow 
taxes continue to rise 
generally speaking additional revenues from tax increases have 
been used to justify more spending when the government raises a 
dollar in revenues congress spends a dollar fifty president 
bush once explained 
regarding promises citizens for a sound economy an 
independent nonprofit research group reminded members that a 
1987 agreement between the white house and congress to limit 
spending growth led instead to quickened spending 
that agreement called for restraining spending increases to 50 
billion in 1988 and 1989 but in those two years spending increased 
by 139 billion 
it provoked the tax foundation independent nonprofit 
research oriented to warn of tax summitry by the light of 
recent budget summit history it said any deficit reduction 
deal could be a bad deal for taxpayers 
a foundation study found that in the 1980s the fiscal years 
that were not preceded by budget summits actually resulted in the 
most real deficit reduction 
remind voters that washington is a somewhat ineffective spender 
of money 
robert woodson jr congressional liaison for the national 
center for neighborhood enterprise which promotes the idea of 
selfhelp contends that social spending has empowered bureaucrats 
but not necessarily the poor 
its been estimated that 70 cents of every federal dollar 
spent on social service programs goes to the people agencies and 
organizations who serve the poor he states adding 
the big spenders in congress should be asking themselves now 
why hasnt the face of poverty changed 
many other suggestions are heard every day demand explanations 
expose selfish specialinterest spending proposals publicize 
waste encourage the development of a returnoninvestment guide to 
government spending 
all the ideas circulating seem to have one common theme to 
again make it politically unpalatable for elected officials to 
overspend

danny oflaherty has just finished a rousing 
rendition of kelly the boy from killeen a barmaid gives him 
several slips of paper some folded around money he reads them and 
goes back to the mike at his irish pub in the french quarter 
weve been getting a lot of requests for danny boy we dont 
do that we only do the right stuff he tells the audience if 
youll read the literature at your table youll understand 
danny boy isnt the only tune nixed by oflaherty he also 
rejects when irish eyes are smiling and other overplayed ersatz 
irish tunes 
thats not ireland he said theres nothing wrong with 
those songs we just have something better 
opened in december the irish channel is only one block from the 
mississippi river in a sprawling old building with a courtyard 
separating two very different bars 
one is the ballad room featuring regular performances by 
oflaherty who spent three years touring with the irish minstrels 
and 16 years with his own trio the celtic folk a group that has 
10 albums and has played for presidents and the pope and in 
festivals as far away as israel 
the other is called the informer the bigger room across the 
courtyard it has a jukebox a television and four dart boards 
you can sit and talk as loudly as you want in the informer or in 
the courtyard but if you insist on talking out in the ballad room 
especially during some of the more poignant songs youll be asked 
to leave 
its probably the most unmannerly thing anyone could do talk 
while other people are performing said oflaherty 
but he acknowledges few other bars or pubs have such a 
requirement especially not in the boisterous french quarter 
maybe we have to open up a university in america so people can go 
to university and learn how to listen 
the amplification from speakers hung at what would be ceiling 
level if the second floor of the ballad room hadnt been torn out 
is loud enough to cover most quiet conversations in fact although 
you see mouths moving during singalong choruses you dont hear 
anyone but oflaherty until he stops to listen 
people drinking guinness harp double diamond carlsberg and 
miller lite not everybody likes to drink irish said the 
bartender at the 25 or so little tables include tourists and 
locals whitehaired couples and young adults with children 
oflaherty learned how to listen to sing and to play guitar 
mandolin accordion banjo harmonica and tin whistle in galway and 
his home island of innishmor off the galway coast he left in 
september 1970 to work for his uncles construction company in 
chicago he played and sang on weekends and about six months after 
he arrived the irish minstrels asked him to audition 
he toured with them for three years in early 1974 tired of 
airports he decided to settle in washington with his first wife 
i quit the music business for six weeks thats all i could 
last he said 
a woman hired him to play at her wedding oflaherty and his 
brother patrick borrowed a mandolin and a guitar three weeks 
later they were hired as the weekend entertainment at the 
dubliner which had just opened on capitol hill 
they decided to get away from pseudoirish schmaltz and rabid 
paeans to the irish republican army during the early 80s when 
they were performing at clubs and folk festivals around the east 
coast 
we were doing antiwar when it wasnt kosher said 
oflaherty 
patrick oflaherty is currently touring with a group called the 
gaelic shores and welsh harpist robin jamesjones shares the irish 
channel stage 
oflahertys emphasis on folk music doesnt mean he refuses to 
sing anything thats not irish or even songs that arent ancient 
and anonymous 
an evening in the ballad room is likely to include and the 
band played waltzing matilda an antiwar song about the battle 
of gallipoli and a spectacularly nonirish childrens tune called 
waltzing with bears as well as wild mountain thyme or 
the maid of fiveeo 
so whats an irish pub doing in the french quarter 
i dont find a bar like this surprising for a city that has 
five or seven st patricks day parades said don jennings a 
member of the ancient order of hibernians and the irish channel st 
patricks day committee 
perhaps more to the point the brothers and danny oflahertys 
wife susan like the city where an invitation for a bar gig 
during the 1984 worlds fair wound up stretching into a twoyear 
stint that soon was followed by another 
when they left they missed new orleans oflaherty said 
we didnt realize how lucky we were to live in new orleans or 
how nice it was until we left he said the other reason my 
wife and i before we left new orleans we lost twins theyre 
buried here in new orleans 
they returned in 1989 to open a pub as a home base for the 
celtic folk and as a living that didnt call for quite so much 
touring 
new orleans french spanish and africanamerican heritage is 
well known the irishness of the city is quiet once you research 
and dig down deep theres a lot of things the irish have done in a 
very positive manner in this city oflaherty said 
irish immigrants dug the canal after which canal street is 
named many believe they gave new orleans the accent known locally 
as da yat axsent a very close cousin to da way dey talk in 
noo yawk where irish immigrants also settled and they settled the 
irish channel along the riverfront 
oflaherty said he wanted to make his pub a center for that 
history as well as for the older irish heritage of his native 
land however he said he was advised against actually opening a 
bar in the irish channel because too few people would find it 
the bar has broken even most months he said though unluckily 
it opened in december when new orleans went through one of its 
worst freezes ever june was also rough the number of tourists 
and conventions had begun to slack off and the groups that did 
come to town included the national baptist convention 
coming attractions include concerts by tommy makem the clancy 
brothers and bluegrass fiddler kenny kosek who has recorded with 
jerry garcia and laurie anderson as well as the celtic folk 
oflaherty also would like to have a pub theater but thats 
still a dream 
we havent even reached what we want to do yet he said 
weve got to crawl before we walk

bonnie bedelia has been around long enough to 
know the percentages there are more good actors than good parts 
and a lot more good parts for men than for women 
theres usually one decent female part per film she says and 
the numbers have often worked against her lovers and other 
strangers was a bad role in a good film prince of 
pennsylvania was a good part in a bad film fat man and little 
boy struck out on both counts die hard and die hard 2 
were fun but those movies belong to bruce willis 
even a big part in a good film can come up short such as her 
acclaimed role as auto racer shirley muldowney in the 1983 film 
heart like a wheel compliment her on it and the response is 
terse yeah it would have been nice if someone saw it 
but for presumed innocent there are no frowns or 
wisecracks finally its all there the cast harrison ford raul 
julia the director alan pakula klute all the 
presidents men the script based on scott turows bestselling 
thriller and yes the part she wanted 
how often does anyone get a chance to be in film like that 
says bedelia who plays fords wife i would have to be put in 
bellevue if i didnt want that part whats not to want to do it i 
want to work i want a career everyone wanted to do it 
it was the top of the line all along the way you dont get 
better than that 
thats the talk of a selfdescribed lifer convinced she can 
play anything an actress whos been at it for 30 years first 
appearing on broadway in isle of children at age 10 she wishes 
more people knew who she was i hear someone say she looks 
familiar did i go to school with her but accepts it all 
because actings all she ever wanted to do 
i did have a natural gift for suspending reality she said 
pausing and then smiling at that piece of actors talk 
my big brother used to make up these elaborate fantasy games 
where wed be on adventureshed make up these stories about us 
being orphans or wed move our bunk beds and make them into tents 
and pretend we were in the woods its one of those fantastic free 
association games that kids can do 
she remembers being homesick during lovers and other 
strangers carrying her first of two sons and wishing she were 
shopping for baby clothes and they shoot horses dont they 
she remembers how much fun it was making the whole film on that 
single dance floor 
on one end of her career is heart like a wheel her most 
challenging rewarding part wasted on a boxoffice flop it was 
low budget most of the money spent on cars she cracks and 
covered four decades often in one day of filming 
id get up in the morning and be 40 with the little wrinkles 
in my eyes and the gray in my hair she said 
the very next scene id run to makeup and i had to erase all 
that mileage in my life and suddenly i was 16 years old and had to 
go greet my dad then i was 30 and had this short hairdo and false 
eyelashes 
on the other end are the die hard movies the latest one 
reportedly costing more than 60 million everyones seen at least 
one of those films but who remembers that it was bonnie bedelia 
playing willis wife 
i just said my words and went home bedelia said they 
were fun though i really liked the directors john mctiernan from 
the first one and renny harlin for this one and i really liked 
bruce willis i only worked for a couple of weeks on the first one 
and a few days on the second 
so will presumed innocent end the days of bonnie 
watchamacallit shes not saying a lifers superstition again 
its playing the percentages the invariable rule of mathematics 
how often does a film turn out the way its supposed to 
i made a movie in mexico called fat man and little boy 
she said of last years critical and commercial failure 
roland joffe was directing and he made one of my favorite 
movies of all time the killing fields paul newman was starring 
and me and natasha richardson and laura dern and john cusack were 
in the cast all of us good actors i felt pretty good about that 
too and look how that turned out it wasnt that good

at the start of another stifling summer 
day the fishermen of nanliao and their wives gather near a 
buddhist temple to pray for the return of their profitable but 
illegal livelihood 
the 2000 villagers have had little else to do since early june 
when nanliao became the first target of a government attempt to 
stamp out smuggling 
there is virtually nothing fishermen can now do said one 
who identified himself only by the surname pan local fishing 
grounds have been destroyed by pollution and our fishermen had to 
risk smuggling to make a living 
nanliao gets no sympathy from premier hau peitsun a career 
military man who says the smuggling of guns narcotics prostitutes 
and triggermen for taiwan mobsters is responsible for a soaring 
crime rate 
robberies increased by 39 percent and kidnappings by 53 percent 
in 1989 a record year for violent crime 
police seized nearly 1000 handguns last year and estimate 
thousands more remained in the hands of gangsters they said most 
of the weapons were smuggled from china and the philippines 
newspapers print reports of young women from the mainland caught 
working in the numerous illegal brothels of taiwan 
smuggling has not only posed a threat to public security but 
has seriously affected our economic development hau declared 
the premier says crime is driving industries off the island 
military patrols were removed from the ports when taiwan ended 
38 years of martial law in 1987 and smuggling has risen sharply 
nanliao is just 80 miles across the formosa strait from fujian 
province in southern china officials believe nearly everyone in 
town was involved in smuggling and claim villagers beat up police 
whenever they tried to stop it 
about 1000 soldiers were sent to reinforce air and coastal 
patrols in the area and impose a curfew to stop smuggled goods from 
being brought ashore at night the trade slowed to a trickle 
fishermen acknowledge their illegal activity has made the 
village one of taiwans richest with the proceeds from smuggling 
residents of nanliao replaced their traditional brickandtile 
houses with twostory apartment buildings and bought imported 
luxury cars 
until five years ago the villagers made more modest livings 
from coastal waters rich in catfish and octopus offshore oil 
exploration and pollution from industrial waste brought an end to 
that 
pan said nanliao fishermen got into smuggling after martial law 
ended initially trading taiwanese consumer goods for fish and 
agricultural products from china 
at first the villagers exchanged goods with chinese smugglers 
at sea but the easing of hostility between taiwan and china 
emboldened them to enter mainland ports residents of nanliao said 
a boat crew could make nearly 30000 from a threeday trip 
villagers first agreed to stay away from guns drugs and 
illegal chinese immigrants to avoid a harsh crackdown but the 
agreement was broken after more fishing boats joined the trade and 
caused prices to fall for smuggled fish and other produce pan 
said 
earlier in june officials seized a ton of chinesemade 
amphetamines with a market value of about 11 million from a 
nanliao fishing boat five crewmen were arrested 
since the curfew began only a few nanliao boats have gone on 
smuggling missions most have returned with empty holds 
the government says it will assign about 20000 soldiers later 
this year to help antismuggling air sea and coastal patrols but 
the illegal trade may be difficult to conquer 
some nanliao smugglers are said to have moved to other fishing 
ports newspapers report smugglers have begun using motorized rafts 
to bring goods to shore leaving pursuing police patrol boats 
stranded on sandbars in shallow water 
the people of nanliao do not sound defeated at the temple 
villager chen chunhui said right now we are living on our 
savings and are watching

ask dean brackley why he is going to el salvador 
to take the place of a murdered priest why he will give up a 
secure life in academia and he just gazes at the lush campus of 
fordham university 
i need to be close to the struggle for life and death he 
says it just isnt happening here 
it is happening he says in el salvador torn by a 10year 
civil war among the casualties six jesuit priests taken from 
their beds and shot in the back of the head nov 16 at the central 
america university 
the murder of the priests affected me deeply said brackley 
43 one of six priests chosen from around the world to replace 
their fallen brothers he leaves monday 
in san salvador where he has traveled twice before brackley 
will teach philosophy and religion to graduate students at the 
university and oversee a large rural parish in jayaque 45 minutes 
west of the city 
among the priests chosen by the university and the head of the 
jesuits in rome is another american charles beirne an 
administrator at santa clara university the others are a canadian 
a mexican a spaniard and a salvadoran 
we know it will be dangerous and were not going down there to 
commit suicide brackley said but the truth has to be told 
the slayings of the jesuits their cook and her 16yearold 
daughter underscore the dangers facing hundreds of clerics working 
in salvadors shantytowns 
since 1980 when el salvadors leftist rebels began fighting a 
succession of usbacked governments 72000 salvadorans have died 
in the war at least 30000 died at the hands of rightwing death 
squads human rights groups say 
some clerics who work among the dispossessed are viewed as 
subversives by the military and conservative government and as 
enemies by the far right which considers them marxist ideologues 
since 1980 16 including archbishop oscar arnulfo romero have 
been slain 
the leftleaning clerics maintain that the civil war arose from 
vast social injustice and that only by addressing its causes can it 
be resolved but the armed forces contend the revolution is fueled 
by communist forces outside the country 
news of the predawn massacre of the jesuits initially stunned 
the world and prompted calls from some us congressmen to 
reconsider aid to el salvador eight months later although an 
investigation continues no soldier has been tried an officer 
never has been convicted of human rights abuse in el salvador 
which receives 1 million in us aid each day 
brackley said he first was struck by the social inequities of 
life not in central america but in his hometown of troy ny a 
declining milltown 
as a selfconscious little boy i was stunned by poverty he 
recalled he also recognized early on that he was blessed with a 
quixotic temperament given to adventure rather than boredom even 
if it hurts 
brackley joined the jesuits when he was 18 but after graduating 
from boston college he had what he termed a crisis of faith 
and went to work on new york citys impoverished lower east side 
there he learned spanish and helped found a junior high school 
for promising boys from the community 
in the early 1970s as he wrestled with the churchs role in 
society brackley met dorothy day the charismatic cofounder of 
the catholic workers movement he remembers her simple advice to 
him stay close to the people 
the encounter with day taught him confusion doesnt clear up 
until you make a commitment brackley said he said he also 
learned he had something to contribute to the poor and their 
cause 
subsequently brackley reaffirmed his commitment to seminary in 
berkeley calif while doing research he engaged in what he calls 
theological tourism he worked as a carpenter in puerto rico 
and studied in peru 
it was in latin america he was introduced to liberation 
theology the doctrine that champions the poor and oppressed in 
countries where mass poverty coexists with the opulence of a tiny 
minority since it evolved in the 1960s the doctrine has 
splintered the roman catholic establishment 
brackley returned to the united states and while completing a 
doctorate in theology at the university of chicago took courses in 
political science 
i had found out in latin america that god was concerned with 
suffering he said but what was gods view of the 
international monetary fund 
with a doctorate in hand brackley returned to new york and 
worked as a priest and organizer for the south bronx people for 
change a churchsponsored group that sprang up in 1979 to force 
city support for the abandoned community 
in september he took a teaching post at fordham but blanca 
ramirez who heads people for change said there are two places 
brackley is truly happy the south bronx or el salvador 
in the south bronx i learned how to survive which meant 
having a sense of humor resilience and humility brackley said 
i learned who i was and what my mission was

cloudshrouded planet on aug 10 after a 15month journey from 
earth and nasa desperately wants everything to go according to 
plan 
this thing must succeed because of the hubble space telescope 
effect and the generally bad impression weve all been getting of 
how nasa has been conducting its affairs lately said steve 
saunders the magellan projects chief scientist 
but those setbacks the crippling of the 15 billion hubble 
observatory due to mirror imperfections the temporary grounding of 
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks have not dimmed the 
agencys enthusiasm for magellan 
weve dreamed about the sights we would see now its about to 
happen said phil allin a magellan project official at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
named for 16th century explorer ferdinand magellan the crafts 
radar will penetrate acidladen venusian clouds to make pictures 
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images 
that will help geologists understand forces that sculpted venus 
to create flat lowlands hilly plains and continentlike highlands 
capped by peaks such as 35400foot mount maxwell which is a mile 
taller than earths mount everest 
nasa says magellans radar will reveal unprecedented details of 
the planets terrain a landscape shaped by meteorite craters tens 
of thousands of volcanoes and perhaps movements of gargantuan 
blocks of the planets crust a process that may be similar to 
continental drift on earth 
the 37ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and 
channels to learn if venus once had oceans and rivers before its 
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the suns heat in a runaway 
greenhouse effect 
such global warming makes modern venus a bonedry 900degree 
fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than 
earths 
magellans mission is the capstone of the exploration of the 
inner planets said jim head a member of the magellan science 
team and a geologist at brown university in providence ri 
weve seen the surfaces of the moon mars the earth and 
mercury but venus always has been obscured by the clouds and weve 
never gotten a good global view of it 
the 21footlong magellan was released from the cargo bay of 
space shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 then launched on its 
roundabout 806 millionmile voyage by an inertial upperstage 
rocket 
at 931 am pdt on aug 10 magellan will fire its solidfueled 
star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical nearly polar 
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5000 miles above venus 
after a few weeks of tests the spacecraft will bounce radar 
waves off venus to make pictures and topographic maps of 70 percent 
to 90 percent of the surface meanwhile the planet will rotate 
once on its axis during a single venusian day which equals 243 
earth days 
its going to give us a map of venus that in many ways is 
better than anything we have for the whole earth where most of 
the ocean floor hasnt been mapped in detail saunders said 
if scientists are lucky magellan may tell them if venusian 
volcanoes are active if movements of the planets crust produce 
venus quakes and if those movements are more like earths 
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that 
created hawaii 
venus is the planet most like earth in terms of size density 
and mass and also is earths nearest neighbor other than the 
moon yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by 
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships 
about 20 spacecraft have visited venus since the early 1960s 
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the 
surface pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from 
earth and from nasas pioneer venus orbiter in 1978 and the soviet 
unions venera 15 and 16 orbiters in 1983 
but the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only 
those landscape features wider than about 1 miles saunders said 
magellans pictures will be roughly 10 times better capturing 
features as small as 260 yards about the length of 2 football 
fields 
magellan will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit venus once 
during each orbit magellan will spend 37 minutes as it moves from 
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of venus surface about 
10000 miles long but only 16 miles wide the information will be 
stored on two tape recorders 
during the rest of each orbit magellan will radio the 
information back to earth where it will be received by 
230footwide dishshaped antennas at nasas deep space network 
stations in california spain and australia 
computers at jet propulsion laboratory will assemble the data 
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath the swaths 
nicknamed noodles because they are so long and narrow then 
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet 
mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of 
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time saunders 
said if you printed it in books it would fill a shelf about 10 
miles long its very humbling 
magellans main 243day mapping mission will miss the south 
polar regions nasa is expected to approve more 243day mapping 
cycles a total of three are needed to map the entire planet 
cost of the magellan mission through the first 243day mapping 
cycle is 744 million including the cost of launching the 
spacecraft from the shuttle said bill dimmer of nasas 
comptrollers office in washington the spacecraft and its 
instruments account for 413 million of that total he said

here are key facts about the magellan 
spacecraft which is scheduled to go into orbit around venus in 
august 
primary mission to use radar to penetrate the clouds of venus 
and make pictures and maps of 70 percent to 90 percent of the 
planets surface with 10 times better detail than any previous 
images magellan will reveal signs of forces that shaped the 
planet including volcanism meteorite impacts and possibly wind 
water and largescale movements of the planets crust 
extended mission a single venusian day the time it takes the 
planet to rotate once on its axis lasts 243 earth days 
magellans primary mission is to map the planet as it rotates once 
below the polarorbiting spacecraft but nasa scientists expect to 
obtain approval for additional 243day mapping cycles so they can 
make pictures and maps of most of the surface the primary mission 
will miss the planets southernmost latitudes 
cost 744 million through the end of magellans primary 243day 
mapping effort including 413 million for the spacecraft and its 
instruments nasa cut costs by building magellan using some spare 
parts from voyager and galileo spacecraft 
launch deployed from cargo bay of space shuttle atlantis on may 
4 1989 then launched by an inertial upper stage booster 
the voyage a 806 millionmile trip to venus in 15 months 
requiring 1 loops around the sun 
propulsion a solidfueled star 48b rocket is to put magellan 
into orbit around venus on aug 10 twentyfour liquidfueled 
thrusters help point the spacecraft and adjust its trajectory 
orbit magellan will orbit near venus poles once every 3 hours 
and 11 minutes at an altitude ranging from 171 miles to almost 
5000 miles 
vital statistics magellan is 21 feet long and 15 feet in 
diameter and weighs 7410 pounds 
instruments synthetic aperture radar is to send radar waves and 
catch the reflected waves to make twodimensional pictures of 
venus measure elevations for topographic maps and determine heat 
emissions from venus surface to provide clues about surface 
roughness and rock composition engineers on earth will precisely 
track magellans speed to measure changes in the strength of the 
gravity field on various parts of venus that will yield clues 
about the planets interior 
power supply a pair of solar panels charge the spacecrafts two 
nickelcadmium batteries 
communications magellans 12foot antenna dish radios 
information back to 230foot dishshaped antennas in spain 
australia and goldstone calif the radar information will be 
relayed to nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
where it will be assembled into maps and pictures

after the magellan spacecraft goes into 
orbit around venus on aug 10 it will use radar to map the surface 
of the cloudcovered planet here is some of what scientists 
already know about the second planet from the sun 
diameter about 7520 miles or 95 percent as wide as earth 
sixth largest of the solar systems nine known planets 
mass venus weighs about 82 percent as much as earth 
atmosphere about 97 percent carbon dioxide with trace amounts 
of nitrogen sulfur dioxide water vapor argon oxygen carbon 
monoxide neon and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids the 
planets clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets the atmosphere 
traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect that scientists 
believe evaporated liquid water long ago if there ever was any on 
the planet large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may 
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into venus atmosphere 
surface conditions temperature about 900 degrees fahrenheit 
hot enough to melt lead zinc or tin crushing atmospheric pressure 
90 times that on earths surface or equivalent to the pressure 
2700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on earth 
the calendar a day on venus lasts longer than a year a 
venusian year the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun 
lasts 225 earth days a venusian day the time the planet takes to 
spin once on its axis lasts 243 earth days venus also has 
retrograde rotation so the sun rises in the west and sets in the 
east 
distance from the sun venus is the second planet from the sun 
orbiting at a distance of 672 million miles it is closer to earth 
than any other planet other than the sun and moon venus is the 
brightest object in earths skies 
moons none 
geology earthbased and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of 
thousands of volcanoes on the venusian lowlands although 
scientists dont yet know if any are active venus also has 
meteorite impact craters and continentlike highlands with towering 
peaks that dwarf earths tallest mountains scientists suspect 
giant plates of rock may move in venus crust in a process vaguely 
like continental drift on earth venus surface is about 65 percent 
rolling plains 27 percent flat lowlands and 8 percent highlands 
that may be similar to earths continents 
gravity about 89 percent as strong as on earth 
magnetic field none detected so far suggesting venus now lacks 
a liquid core which is needed to generate a magnetic field

southerners mostly scorn the boll 
weevil here they built a monument in the varmints honor 
like others across the cotton belt many in coffee county were 
ruined when the insatiable beetles migration reached here 75 years 
ago but people in enterprise came to see the weevil as the 
herald of prosperity in the words of the monuments inscription 
because its ravages forced farmers to abandon a onecrop economy 
and begin growing peanuts corn and other crops 
it meant that cotton was no longer king said roy shoffner 
a retired newspaper publisher and local historian his book about 
the monument built in 1919 quotes an official on the lesson 
learned there is one and only one weapon of defense and 
thats diversified farming 
but nowadays theres talk of another weapon of a frontal 
insecticide assault to eradicate the bug to evict it over the 
mexican border it crossed nearly a century ago 
were trying to squeeze the weevil out says t cotton 
nelson of the national cotton council in memphis tenn hopefully 
drive him right back out of the country 
american agricultures most destructive pest could be eliminated 
as a threat within the decade says the cotton councils director 
of technical operations andrew jordan that he cautions is in 
an ideal world but he adds after some reflection i think the 
year 2000 is probably realistic 
environmentalists and some cotton farmers themselves are not 
convinced 
after all the boll weevil has proved its durability while 
changing a way of life in the south many areas simply surrendered 
to the creature they gave up growing the white fiber whose profits 
had helped finance the pageant of the antebellum days and whose 
production was the regions signature the land of cotton 
boll weevil coming fast the peoples ledger warned coffee 
countys farmers in 1910 the census that year recorded a bumper 
cotton crop 25207 bales in 1916 a year after the weevil 
arrived only 1500 bales were ginned in enterprise 
elsewhere it was no different in 1921 the boll weevil which 
devours cotton bolls and buds went through 30 percent of the 
souths crop 
a folk song tried to make light of the pest 
first time i saw the boll weevil he was standin on the 
square 
next time i saw the boll weevil he had his whole family there 
they was lookin for a home 
just lookin for a home 
over time a variety of control measures from insecticides to 
pennyabug bounties helped limit damage in enterprise clayton 
metcalf sold a vacuumtype machine called a nesbitt bugcatcher 
it helped he recalls but you couldnt get em all 
even today crop losses and control costs amount to 300 million 
a year and the bill comes to 12 billion altogether since the 
weevil entered texas in 1892 the cotton council estimates 
so there was a mixture of hope and skepticism when the us 
department of agriculture launched an experimental eradication 
effort in a small area of virginia and north carolina in 1978 
fear no weevil became the projects unofficial motto 
instead of farmbyfarm measures it used an area approach 
working from weevilfree zones the pilot program applied weekly 
doses of insecticide from september to the first frost to reduce 
the number of overwintering weevils in spring bug traps 
revealed surviving populations which were sprayed after the third 
year program officials merely mopped up spot reinfestations 
the pilot program was expanded to all of north and south 
carolina in 1983 with farmers and the government sharing costs 
its quite clear that biologically it was successful says 
gerald carlson an agricultural economics professor at north 
carolina state university who studied the program and 
economically what resulted was some fairly substantial savings to 
the farmers and to new farmers getting into it theres been a 
big expansion in acreage 
while us cotton production rose only 10 percent between 1980 
and 89 from 111 million to 122 million bales north carolinas 
nearly tripled from 52000 to 141000 bales 
in north and south carolina the boll weevil has been 
eradicated as an economic pest of cotton the national cotton 
council said in a 1989 report 
further results in the southwest arizona and southern 
california eradication program are equally impressive weevil 
populations fell approximately 95 percent in the first year the 
containment program also is working in texas the council said 
referring to the high plains growing area near lubbock usda also 
lists virginia within the eradicated zone 
is the weevil finally on the run then as the eradication effort 
continues in georgia northern florida and southern alabama 
its not that simple first even now less than 1 million acres 
of the 12 millionacre us cotton crop are under the eradication 
and containment programs says jordan of the cotton council 
second theres been active resistance to expansion 
farmers in alabama this spring voted down a proposed eradication 
assessment increase when program officials concluded that more had 
to be spent in areas where winter cold was less an ally in the 
weevil war than it was in the carolinas in a second vote in june 
they approved the increase 
environmentalists also fought the plan we just didnt feel 
that that made environmental sense a massive malathion spraying 
program especially by air says jim taylor of the alabama 
chapter of the sierra club cars and homes were accidentally 
sprayed with the pesticide he said 
the group sued along with the alabama conservancy and the 
southern environmental law center under a resulting 1988 
agreement the government is drafting an environmental impact 
statement and is now spraying with what taylor calls more 
benign pesticides 
supporters of the eradication effort insist one of its benefits 
is a longterm reduction in pesticide use as weevil populations 
dwindle 
without the program 20 years from now youre going to be 
spraying just as much as you are now says robroy fisher a 
mississippi delta cotton planter who is active in weevil control 
efforts 
taylor dismisses the effort as voodoo science and the goal 
of eradicating the perennial pest says taylor ill bet on the 
boll weevil 
in coffee county theyre not taking any bets people know of 
the eradication program and they know cotton acreage is up some 
but says county agent dan presley i dont think cottonll ever 
come back as king 
peanuts and corn are the main crops here now the weevils 
lesson about diversification remains whether the bug does or not

gubernatorial candidate gatewood 
galbraith wants to put the law back on the side of a kentucky 
agricultural tradition growing marijuana 
our granddaddies used to grow it by the thousands of acres 
when marijuana was legal and grown mainly for fiber for rope and 
textiles said galbraith a 43yearold lexington attorney 
galbraith a long shot in next years kentucky race for 
governor is among a handful of prolegalization candidates who 
consider themselves political trailblazers for millions of 
americans who smoke pot regularly 
they also style themselves as champions for the taxpayers who 
are footing the bill for the nations war on drugs 
in new hampshire congressional candidate michael weddle is 
challenging voters to heed their state motto live free or die 
by supporting marijuana legalization weddle a state 
representative is among eight candidates in a gop primary for an 
open us house seat 
in kansas democratic congressional candidate mark creamer now 
operates his prolegalization campaign from a jail cell where he 
is serving a sixmonth sentence for lighting a marijuana cigarette 
in a police station creamer is given little chance against 
democratic rep jim slattery in the states aug 7 primary 
kevin zeese vice president of the private prolegalization 
drug policy foundation in washington said several other 
majorparty candidates also are carrying the marijuana legalization 
banner this year 
zeese said incumbent officeholders who support marijuana 
legalization and are running for reelection include us rep 
george crockett dmich democratic state rep elbert walton in 
missouri democratic state sen joe galiber in new york and bill 
mathesius the republican county executive in mercer county nj 
zeese believes the political winds have changed since the 
conservative tide swept the nation during the 1980s dousing the 
marijuana legalization debates of the 1960s and 1970s 
some politicians are starting to get ahead of the curve on 
this zeese said something like this was unspeakable three 
years ago and now people are running for office on it 
supporters of legalization include conservatives such as 
economist milton friedman and columnist william f buckley jr 
other proponents are former attorney general ramsey clark 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke and us district judge robert w 
sweet in new york former secretary of state george shultz has said 
legalization should at least be considered 
many supporters of legalization say marijuana is less potent and 
addictive than cigarettes or alcohol and shouldnt be grouped with 
cocaine heroin crack or other hard drugs they also contend 
legalizing marijuana would be a big weapon against crime syndicates 
that control the drug world 
but federal drug czar william bennett has branded legalization 
as stupid and morally atrocious 
it doesnt make any sense bennett has said it is 
becoming something of a fashion to believe this legalization in 
certain circles of opinion but even though its fashionable its 
still every bit as dumb and compassionless as it was before 
dewey stokes the national president of the fraternal order of 
police said legalizing marijuana would prompt more people to 
develop drug habits and increase demand for harder drugs 
i think the antidrug effort has to be successful if were 
going to have a country he said 
kentucky democratic leaders have taken steps recently to 
distance themselves from galbraith and a newly formed grassroots 
organization called the green democrats 
galbraith weddle and creamer all face long odds at the polls 
this year but legalization supporters express confidence their 
numbers will grow as opposition mounts to the costs of a federal 
antidrug policy they deem ineffective 
as the repression continues and the erosion of civil liberties 
continue so will the awareness that solving the problem with a 
drug war is not the solution said weddle a twoterm state house 
member from portsmouth nh 
weddle a democrat who turned republican for the september 
primary said voter response has been better than he anticipated 
in kentucky where marijuana outstrips tobacco as the leading 
albeit illegal cash crop galbraith said the response has been 
absolutely stunning to his proposal to strictly regulate and 
tax marijuana 
galbraith who is among five announced or likely candidates for 
the democratic nomination for governor next year estimates the 
state could reap up to 1 billion in taxes each year from legal 
marijuana 
he said kentucky was the nations leading producer of marijuana 
which was commonly called hemp for a century before it was 
banned in 1936 
john dunlap a spokesman for the national organization for the 
reform of marijuana laws in washington said legalizing marijuana 
would generate 40 billion a year nationally billions more could 
be saved by scrapping local state and federal eradication efforts 
he said

after 30 million of repairs the exxon valdez 
is due back at sea in august with a new crew new steel in its 
shredded hull new ports of call in the middle east and a new name 
exxon mediterranean but no such industrywide makeover has 
occurred to limit oil spills and their damage 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it seemed like a maritime version of murphys 
law 
the wayward exxon valdez plowed into bligh reef then three 
shipwrecks oiled three waterways within 12 hours last june 
the american trader ran over its anchor and gashed itself the 
bt nautilus was one of three spills in three months in the new york 
city area the mega borg caught fire in the gulf of mexico and on 
and on and on 
but these accidents all within 15 months of each other are 
more than just a run of bad luck systemwide flaws in the way 
tankers are built operated and monitored contribute to accidents 
according to records and interviews with industry experts 
on an average of five days out of seven last year a tanker ran 
aground hit another ship or a dock broke apart sprung a leak 
exploded or had some other kind of mishap according to coast guard 
records 
a coast guard report on tanker safety cited formidable 
problems in regulating tankers among them are fatigued tanker 
crews shipowners who give more priority to schedules than safety 
and inspectors who are overworked and burned out 
the center for marine conservation has called for a presidential 
task force to assess tanker safety because no agency is doing a 
toptobottom review it also criticized cutbacks in the coast 
guard as false economizing 
and despite the exxon valdez wreck that caused the nations 
worst oil spill on march 24 1989 the industry remains 
illprepared to handle a major spill and a glacialpaced congress 
still hasnt passed a tanker safety package 
the result is bleak news for a nation whose gluttonous appetite 
for oil means more tankers many of them aging will be pulling 
into its ports on any given day about 50 tankers carrying 450 
million gallons of oil sail into us harbors each one a potential 
environmental disaster 
we are asking for trouble said clifton curtis president of 
the oceanic society 
and not just environmentalists are uneasy 
this industry is in a bad way said arthur mackenzie head 
of the tanker advisory group and a former exxon corp shipping 
executive we have to make drastic changes in the way we build 
operate and license in this business 
whos studying the whole picture nobody 
in sheer numbers the coast guard investigated 265 oil spills 
from tankers last year an average of five a week most were minor 
but six were more than 10000 gallons including the 11 million 
gallons disgorged by the exxon valdez 
add last years 639 tank barge incidents and the average is 17 
a week 
a private study by golobs oil pollution bulletin in cambridge 
mass counted 78 spills of 10000 gallons or more in the past 12 
years an average of nearly seven a year 
total spillage was 41 million gallons at the same time 243 
billion gallons or 9998 percent of the oil shipped got to shore 
safely 
the oil industry says that record hardly supports the image of 
an oceanic demolition derby but six major spills have occurred 
already this year and the public as much as it demands the oil 
wont tolerate the sliming of beaches and shorelines 
what was an acceptable level of performance 10 years ago is 
not acceptable today said sean connaughton of the american 
petroleum institute theres an almost zero tolerance for oil 
spills the sensitivity is so much greater now 
environmentalists say the breakdowns are not isolated incidents 
but examples of common problems the way three mile island was in 
the nuclear power industry and the challenger explosion was in the 
space industry 
clearly this is an issue that has reached and will exceed 
crisis proportions the potential for an increasing number and more 
severe accidents is very high said roger mcmanus president of 
the center for marine conservation 
what we have on the seas is something we wouldnt put up with 
in air traffic he said it desperately needs attention 
turning things around is trickier than steering a supertanker in 
a tight channel there is no one solution because there is no one 
problem and no one agency who can fix it 
each branch of congress passed its own version of an oil tanker 
safety bill last fall but a 100member conference named to 
reconcile the differences had met just once before the mega borg 
exploded june 9 and leaked 39 million gallons of oil 
on july 12 the committee reached a compromise that would 
require new tankers be built with punctureresistant double hulls 
whileexisting tankers be fitted with a second hull or phased out of 
service over the next 20 years 
in addition the bill would create a 1 billion oil spill 
response fund make it easier for the coast guard to take over 
cleanup efforts set liability levels for spills and toughen 
licensing requirements for tanker crew members 
a final vote is pending

meanwhile the coast guard motto is semper paratus or 
always prepared but in an interview its commandant said the 
service would be better suited to live up to its motto if congress 
acts 
there is more that can be done were less prepared without 
this bill conceded adm j william kime we need to do 
everything we can to minimize the probability were going to have a 
spill and then maximize our ability to limit the impact of the 
pollution 
the coast guard in a 44page report by its tanker safety study 
group said a review of tanker operations has not been done in 10 
years 
among the highlights of the report distributed last fall to all 
admirals were 
tankers are being driven harder and faster by shipowners more 
concerned with schedules than safety the coast guard pays too much 
attention to owners desires to make money and too little attention 
to safety coast guard inspectors are overworked and burned out by 
a dirty and tiring job and their training is inadequate 
tankers are built with 18 percent less steel than in the 1970s 
newer ships are so big only 20 percent of the inside of their cargo 
tanks are inspected 
the report said the best way to avoid shipwrecks is having 
competent crews because human error plays a part in 90 percent of 
the groundings and collisions and 75 percent of the fires and 
explosions 
cuts in the number of crew have severely impaired routine 
maintenance the report said and relying on automation and 
machines as a cureall misses the point and provides a false 
sense of security 
fatigue is also factor when coast guard inspectors met with 
chief mates to set up inspections some mates were so exhausted 
they fell asleep during these meetings 
the center for marine conservation did its own study called 
shipping safety and americas coasts it urged presidential 
action and assailed congress for not giving the coast guard the 
money and manpower to do its job right 
our coasts deserve a better defense than they are getting from 
false economizing said the centers michael weber 
the center said better radar used in other parts of the world 
could be used in domestic ports for less than the cost of a 
cleaning up a goodsized spill exxon has spent 2 billion on the 
valdez cleanup 
in valdez the coast guard cut the power on its radar and 
reduced crew sizes for budget reasons the exxon valdez was off the 
screen when it crashed foreign ports have radar that beeps an 
alarm if a ship strays from its channel in another costcutting 
move the coast guard cut out vessel traffic systems in new york 
and new orleans the system used in five ocean ports allows 
mariners to see beyond blind corners and keep up to date on what 
other ships are doing but other countries have better systems 
at sullom voe europes largest oil and gas terminal operated by 
british petroleum co in scotlands shetland islands licensed 
pilots instead of technicians work at radar screens to steer 
tankers past reefs and hazards 
the existing vessel traffic services in the us are far from 
state of the art said richard townsend who did the study for 
the center for marine conservation much better systems currently 
are available using offtheshelf technology that is vastly 
superior to that currently used by the coast guard 
in the private sector 20 oil companies formed the petroleum 
industry response organization last year the group would set up 
five regional centers covering 24 coastal states that would act as 
gigantic fire houses with booms skimmers and oil dispersants 
but the organization is waiting for congress before it buys any 
equipment 
the void that existed when the exxon valdez had its accident 
still exists as far as cleanup is concerned said retired adm 
john costello who heads the group we dont own any ships or any 
booms yet

a double hull creates a ship within a ship it 
is two layers of steel separated by a gap of air around the sides 
and bottom of an oil tanker as an extra layer of protection 
environmental groups in a letter to a congressional committee 
this month said requiring doublehull tankers was the single 
most important step congress can take to prevent oil spills 
a compromise is pending in congress to have two hulls on new 
tankers and to retrofit or phase out singlehulled tankers within 
20 years the house originally wanted a 15year timetable while the 
senate asked for more study 
a double hull is not a beall or endall but weve got to 
build redundancy into the system said clifton curtis president 
of the oceanic society 
curtis called the compromise a signficant victory but he 
added we are sorely displeased with the fact that the retrofit 
schedule is not more rapid 
advocates of double hulls say they would limit the impact of oil 
spills if a tanker runs aground because a reef or manmade object 
would have to gash both layers to spill oil 
a coast guard study of 30 tanker groundings between 1969 and 
1973 said 96 percent of the spills would have been averted if the 
vessels had double hulls 
a double hull would not have prevented the exxon valdez spill 
but some studies say less crude oil would have fouled prince 
william sound in the nations worst oil spill 
double hulls are an extra margin of safety to prevent or 
minimize marine accidents said us coast guard commandant j 
william kime 
but critics say double hulls also may have drawbacks water can 
rush in between layers of the steel and make a ship settle lower 
thereby leaking more oil there are also fears explosive vapors 
could gather between the gaps 
double hulls are also more expensive it would have cost 10 
percent to 15 percent more to build a double hull on the 125 
million exxon valdez its damaged hull was repaired with 3000 tons 
of new steel but it still doesnt have a double hull 
retrofitting the 153 us tankers at 30 million each would cost 
46 billion the same work on 900 foreignflagged tankers could be 
as high as 10 billion industry officials said 
but the oil industry believes the debate is misdirected 
if an airplane crashes into a mountain we dont build planes 
that can withstand the impact we try to find out why and prevent 
it from happening again said sean connaughton of the american 
petroleum institute 
if we have ships running into underwater mountains we end up 
with people calling for ships that can withstand that type of 
collision connaughton said 
meanwhile some companies arent waiting for congress 
houstonbased conoco inc ordered two doublehull tankers in 
april and said it would order doublehull ships in the future 
norways statoil the largest producer of north sea crude oil 
said in june that it was ordering five new tankers two with double 
hulls and three with double or partial double bottoms

smallbusiness optimism about the immediate 
future faded in june to the lowest level for that month in at least 
four years 
in reporting survey results of more than 700 detailed responses 
from small businesses economist william dunkelberg said declines 
were noted in all but two of 10 components of a socalled optimism 
index 
the index produced for the national federation of independent 
business declined to a reading of 1001 sixtenths of a point 
below its yearago reading and more than two points below june 
readings in 1986 1987 and 1988 
the report confirms the weakness observed in other business 
surveys but it found little evidence among federation members that 
a credit squeeze was responsible 
however dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of 
business in philadelphia said only 35 percent of reporting 
companies said they were regular borrowers a near record low for 
the survey which was begun in 1974 
the index is based on a formula that includes plans opinions 
and hard data on factors such as expected business conditions 
expected sales volume the climate for expansion job openings and 
hiring and spending plans 
the study found declines in plans for capital spending hiring 
and investment in larger inventories the labor market weakened 
slightly but both the pace of price increases and plans to raise 
prices declined 
the june optimism reading was also the lowest of 1990 although 
slightly lower readings were measured last october november and 
december 
while the optimism index measures results and attitudes of 
mostly small businesses although small can mean companies 
with more than 100 million in sales some economy watchers feel 
it is a responsive grassroots tool 
dunkelberg notes for example that the business community 
represented by the survey employs about onehalf the private 
nonfarm work force and produces about 50 percent of the nations 
gross private sector product 
using 1978 as its base of 100 the index plunged to a quarterly 
low of just 811 in the second quarter of 1980 but rebounded even 
more sharply to 951 in the third quarter of that year foretelling 
the rise from recession 
by 1983 the index was regularly over 100 reaching an alltime 
high of 1087 in the first quarter of 1984 since the second 
quarter of 1984 it has wavered between 995 and 1027 
while the survey found no evidence of a credit crunch it found 
suggestions of tighter lending practices causing dunkelberg to 
comment that while there is more selectivity this should be 
expected at the peak of a business cycle 
he observed that projects that may have looked good to lenders 
at the beginning of the expansion might not appear to have the same 
promise late in the expansion especially in real estate 
development 
thus with the same standards projects that were accepted 
earlier will now be turned down he said

three dozen teenagers from across the nation 
witnessed firsthand monday the noisy collision of supply and demand 
it looks like chaos 14yearold tara powell from 
northeastern high school in elizabeth city nc said as she 
watched traders at the chicago board of trade try to fit the two 
sides of the economic equation together 
she was one of 36 high school students who showed a special 
acumen in the futures markets along with their economics classes 
the students got a free trip to chicago and a look at how futures 
trading is really done 
in simulated trading during the school year miss powell made a 
profit of 16860 in the gold futures market 
it was an eyeopener she said standing beside the crowded 
corn pit as prices plunged 3 cents to 4 cents lower from fridays 
close around her order forms fluttered to the floor from traders 
hands ready to be scooped up by runners who hustle the buy and 
sell orders back to computer terminals 
like her fellow students miss powell was entranced by the noise 
and fast pace 
you get to let loose and yell a lot she said but youve 
got to know what youre doing 
each of the students was assigned to a trader who was supposed 
to explain what was going on 
trader joel jacobson amid the din of the corn pit took a 
minute out to give some pointers to bruce bishop 15 of beaumont 
junior high school in lexington ky 
jacobson had a hand full of forms and wads of paperwork were 
jammed into the half dozen pockets in his jacket he looked like a 
walking file cabinet 
this is an order for 5000 bushels of corn jacobson said 
pointing to a few squiggles on a piece of paper but the price 
looked too good so i sent it back for confirmation and the 
customer said buy so we bought 
five thousands bushels of corn sold just like that no fuss 
no muss he told his student 
i love it bishop said its a tense situation but it 
never gets boring 
a few minutes later jacobson was asked about a detail of the 
5000bushel corn trade 
i dont remember anything about it he said its 1021 
am that was 1018 am so its ancient history 
another student carmen barrus 18 of los alamos high school in 
new mexico made 30000 in her hypothetical trading of sugar 
futures but the real trading pits had a special appeal 
wow she said its very exciting its something new 
every day 
all the students had heard about the indictments last year of 48 
people involved in futures trading at the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange 
none of the teens questioned about this seemed troubled by the 
allegations of fraud 
the corruption doesnt seem very widespread said miss 
powell indicating she wouldnt be concerned about being sullied if 
she sought a career in futures 
its a personal thing she said you dont just get 
corrupted if something is against the law you just dont do it

in a dramatic step aimed at easing backlogs in 
the nations court dockets a federal judge has ordered 
consolidation of more than 100000 liability cases involving 
workers killed or injured handling asbestos 
the ruling monday by thomas d lambros chief judge of us 
district court in cleveland comes amid mounting problems with a 
trust set up by manville corp to compensate victims of 
asbestosrelated diseases such as lung cancer 
lambros said he issued the order because thousands of victims 
nationwide could go uncompensated as companies that made asbestos 
products were or could become unable to pay millions of dollars in 
asbestos liability 
plaintiffs lawyers said they expected the order to be opposed 
and challenged in a federal appeals court each victim doesnt 
get their day in court said perry weitz a new york lawyer 
handling hundreds of cases 
all cases filed under the umbrella of a class action are bound 
by a single court judgment eliminating individual trials and 
outofcourt settlements but class action also raises the 
possibility of an adverse ruling for all victims 
the move preempted similar action threatened by us district 
judge jack b weinstein in brooklyn who has sought to take charge 
of fixing the financially ailing manville trust fund and clearing 
the asbestos backlog 
weinstein last week ordered the trust to halt all payments to 
victims until he receives a proposal on aug 6 to restructure and 
refinance the trust which was created in 1988 as part of 
manvilles bankruptcy court reorganization 
the trust is out of cash to pay new claims and has said people 
who file claims now may not be compensated until well into the next 
century 
asbestosrelated cases form the largest number of personal 
injury lawsuits in the country lambros said more than 100000 
claims have been filed in federal and state courts nationwide some 
cases arent scheduled for trial until the late 1990s while 
thousands of others await resolution with the manville trust 
several dozen companies that made asbestos products and the 
manville trust which is legally separate from the company are 
defendants in the cases 
in a fourpage order lambros said the asbestos litigation meets 
the requirement for creating a class action because there are 
insufficient funds among all of the defendants to pay all 
meritorious claims and the cost of litigation 
the judge said that since 1982 manville and several other 
companies have sought bankruptcy court protection because of 
thousands of lawsuits seeking asbestos compensation while other 
companies are approaching the brink of bankruptcy 
lambros said the cleveland court has 7000 asbestos personal 
injury cases with more than 13000 claims pending the nations 
largest concentration of cases 
manville once was the nations largest maker of asbestos which 
was used widely for decades because of its natural heatresistance 
and insulation properties it later was identified as carcinogenic 
manville based in denver emerged from chapter 11 proceedings 
in 1988 and no longer makes asbestos 
the trust so far has spent 974 million in settling the first 
22000 cases at an average of 43509 a claim well above initial 
estimates of 25000 per settlement some 130000 claims are 
pending but the trust expects no new funds until late 1991 
the main criticism of the trust is that it processes claims on 
the basis of when they are filed rather than the nature of the 
disease or the victims need the system is expected to be altered 
under the reorganization ordered by weinstein 
lambros said his order establishing a class action could be 
changed only by a decision from a recently formed committee of 
judges with the nations largest asbestos dockets the order also 
establishes subclasses of exisiting cases to be managed and 
processed in state and federal courts 
a manville trust spokeswoman declined to comment on the court 
order 
last week weinstein supported but did not order consolidation 
of asbestos litigation into a class action instead ordering an 
overhaul of the trust 
but weinstein said creating a class action could maximize a 
prompt fair recovery to all claimants under a final settlement 
involving all parties the trust claimants the corporation and 
other defendant companies 
he said cases now being settled or tried could be excluded from 
the mandatory class the judge also proposed a parallel 
registration system for less urgent claims by victims presently 
without symptoms

a congressional study says investors should 
not be misled into believing personal financial advisers are 
closely watched by the securities and exchange commission 
investment advisers and financial planners must register with 
the sec and submit to periodic review if they advise on securities 
or issue analyses of securities 
but the sec doesnt guarantee that investment advisers know what 
theyre doing 
a study by the general accounting office released monday found 
that the sec was behind in reviewing registered advisers when 
advisers are reviewed usually only inadequate disclosure or 
recordkeeping problems are uncovered and the sec does little to 
ensure deficiencies are corrected the report said 
under the 1940 investment advisers act the sec requires 
investmentadvisers to register with the agency and submit to 
periodic review information submitted at registration is not 
verified until the first review which could take up to a year or 
more the gao report said 
secs oversight of investment advisers provides investors 
little assurance that the information they receive from advisers is 
accurate or that advisers operate in accordance with the law 
according to the gao study 
the sec however noted that to implement the reports 
recommendations would require tripling the staff now devoted to 
investment adviser review 
the gao the accounting arm of congress warned that current law 
unless improved may be doing more harm than good by lulling 
investors into a false sense of security that secregistered 
advisers have a seal of approval 
the study noted that one investor who lost her life savings of 
60000 said she had been impressed that the investment adviser 
was registered with the sec the investor was not identified in the 
report 
in a letter attached to the report sec officials said they do 
not have enough money and people to adequately regulate the 
financial advice industry 
recently between 2000 and 3000 new advisers have registered 
annually to inspect all new registrants within one year of 
registration would require a very large increase in staff 
resources kathryn b mcgrath who was then head of the secs 
division of investment management wrote the gao in an april 23 
letter 
she noted that the average sec examiner is able to complete 
about 25 inspections a year and in 1990 the current division staff 
of 53 expects to complete about 1330 examinations 
a hearing on the issue is scheduled for wednesday before the 
house energy and commerce committees finance subcommittee which 
requested the gao study 
rep rick boucher dva a member of the subcommittee has 
submitted a bill that would require anyone offering investment 
advice for pay to register with the sec and provide clients with 
accurate information the bill also would give customers the right 
to sue for damages when they lose money because of violations of 
the law 
this report sounds a warning bell for the millions of 
americans who consult financial planners each year boucher said 
in a statement issued jointly with reps edward markey dmass 
and dennis eckart dohio 
last year the sec submitted legislation that would farm out 
investment adviser oversight to a selfregulatory organization like 
the national association of securities dealers that has yet to be 
acted on 
the gao study noted that since 1980 the number of investment 
advisers has tripled to about 14000 while the assets they manage 
have increased from 440 billion 10 years ago to about 46 
trillion today 
while the amount of fraud and abuse reported to date has been 
relatively small compared to the amount of assets managed the gao 
worried that the threefold increase in the number of people 
providing financial advice and the 10fold increase in assets 
managed raises the risk that fraud and abuse will occur and the 
potential that any amounts lost could be large

savings and loan bailout officials hope to 
speed the sale of distressed real estate and sour loans by mixing 
them with more attractive assets in multimilliondollar packages 
a bush administration board overseeing the bailout approved the 
new sales technique on a trial basis monday the resolution trust 
corp oversight board headed by treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady authorized bulk sales totaling 2 billion 
the agency overseen by the board will put together portfolios of 
similar assets such as commercial loans commmrcial real estate 
apartment properties or apartment loans the packages will include 
both good and problem assets 
ed kane ohio state university business professor and thrift 
expert said 2 billion is a small amount compared with the huge 
volume of assets that need to be sold but he praised the bulk 
sales concept 
i think the important thing is to get these things out of the 
hands of the government which is run for bureaucratic purposes 
and put them into the hands of private people who can make 
decisions for entrepreneurial reasons that will be best for the 
taxpayers in the long run kane said 
bulk sales have been criticized by others who label it a fire 
sale that could depress asset values by flooding the market 
however kane said when you have the financial equivalent of 
a fire a fire sale is the first thing you do 
selling properties one by one is terribly inefficient he 
said 
in its first 11 months the rtc has taken over about 460 failed 
sampls selling or closing about 210 of them but in sampl sales so 
far the agency has been stuck with about half of the institutions 
assets usually the delinquent loans and repossessed real estate 
the oversight board is permitting the bailout agency to lend 
portfolio buyers up to 85 percent of the purchase price for up to 
five years 
ideally wed like it to be shorter term but we wanted to 
give the agency the flexibility said felisa neuringer an 
oversight board spokeswoman 
after the trust corporation completes 2 billion in sales the 
oversight board will evaluate the programs success and consider 
extending it 
on a related matter the oversight board authorized the trust 
corporation to give some properties away to local governments and 
nonpofit agencies for use as day care centers housing for the 
homeless or other public purposes 
properties will be eligible for the program if the agency 
determines that the cost of holding and selling them exceeds their 
value 
another part of the sampl bureaucracy the federal housing finance 
board announced approval of a 669 million housing program for 
lowincome people 
the program required by last years sampl bailout bill is 
financed by the 12 regional federal home loan banks which in turn 
are owned by the sampl industry 
the finance board headed by housing secretary jack kemp is 
spending 472 million from the home loan banks in combination with 
private and foundation funds and other government grants and loans 
the money will pay for 193 projects providing 13706 housing 
units in 37 states much of it will be used to offer lowinterest 
mortgage loans to lowincome homebuyers through thrifts and banks 
fred webber president of the us league of savings 
institutions the industrys largest trade group noted that the 
program would not exist without the industryowned home loan banks 
it demonstrates that this nation needs a separate healthy 
savings institution business to meet the need for decent 
affordable housing he said

claiming pennzoil lied when it said it was buying the stock for 
investment purposes only 
pennzoil said monday it does not currently plan to acquire 10 
percent or more of chevron a larger stake would trigger chevrons 
poison pill

15 percent or more of the stock

longterm investment for pennzoil and its shareholders harper

one in september then come up with the balance in october 
parretti had agreed to a 20ashare offer but raised it to

roundtheclock meetings during the weekend 
produced an agreement between southland corp and some of its 
creditors that will pay cash to junk bond holders and give them a 
larger share of a restructured company 
but some analysts questioned if the sweetened deal which also 
calls for a larger cash infusion from japanese investors can save 
the 7eleven convenience store chain owner burdened by huge debts 
after a 49 billion leveraged buyout in 1987 
no ones been able to prove to me yet why it wouldnt be 
better to throw them into bankruptcy said jay lustig who 
follows distressed companies for drake capital securities inc in 
santa monica calif 
the agreement is the latest revision in a plan first announced 
in march that involved a bailout by itoyokado co ltd and 
seveneleven japan co ltd a majorityowned subsidiary 
southland missed 69 million in interest payments due june 15 
and a 30day grace period expired sunday during which the 
dallasbased company could have made the payments without penalty 
but weekend meetings between a committee of creditors the 
japanese investors and southland produced an agreement in principle 
on the restructuring spokeswoman cecilia stubbs norwood said 
monday 
the agreement replaces a proposal that would have paid holders 
of 18 billion in debt about 550 million plus stock and 
securities in the new company ms norwood said no value was 
immediately available on the revision 
also monday some bondholders filed a lawsuit in us district 
court in dallas asking that southland be forced to pay 69 million 
in interest payments it missed on june 15 the company reaffirmed 
monday that it would not make the payments leaving open the door 
for creditors to force southland into bankruptcy court 
under the new proposal itoyokado and seveneleven japan would 
contribute 430 million in new capital in exchange for 70 percent 
of the common stock in the restructured company previously the 
two had agreed to inject 400 million and get 75 percent of the new 
company 
the founding thompson familys share of the company would be 
reduced form 65 percent to about 5 percent 
bondholders would get the additional shares upping their 
holdings to about 25 percent of the new company 
besides the increased stock the most senior bondholders would 
receive 57 in cash for each 1000 of the bonds they currently 
hold no cash was included in the previous agreement 
other changes include increasing principal amounts of new 
securities and common stock swapped for the old debt in exchange 
the maturity dates are lengthened and interest rates lowered 
clark matthews southlands chief financial officer said 
holders of more than 70 percent of the most senior notes indicate 
they support the plan 
the notes are considered a key group for this deal which must 
be approved by 95 percent of each class of bond plus twothirds of 
preferred shareholders 
we believe that we can successfully negotiate final documents 
and complete a restructuring and are now aiming for midaugust 
matthews said 
i would feel a lot better if they would go ahead and pay the 
accrued interest said david glatstein of barre amp co inc a 
dallas investment company that holds some of the bonds although he 
said the revised plan is more palatable than anything theyve 
presented so far 
the revisions are better for the steering committee its not 
much of a change for the four subordinated classes of bonds 
lustig said 
lustig said he doubted southland could get 95 percent acceptance 
a selfimposed level my gut feeling is that if they get an 80 
percent tender they should just take it kiss the ground and be 
done with it he said 
southland has been struggling under heavy interest payments 
brought on by the buyout in 1987 which was announced before the 
oct 19 market crash but financed after it 
in addition to the higher interest costs cash has been drained 
by increasing competition from proliferating convenience stores run 
by major oil companies 
southland said last year it would be unable to meet obligations 
in 1991 in march the company first announced a proposed 
restructuring with its japanese partners 
southland operates about 6900 7eleven stores and other 
convenience outlets in the united states and canada with another 
6000 stores in the united states and 21 other countries run by 
licensees of which seveneleven japan is the largest

a federal bankruptcy judge says southmark corps 
restructuring plan is fair and equitable but offers no assurances 
that federal regulators will not take further action against it 
us bankruptcy judge stephen felsenthal approved the plan 
monday bringing one of the nations largest bankruptcy cases near 
an end 
under the plan the company will liquidate almost all of its 
holdings except for san jacinto savings association a 3 billion 
thrift based in the houston suburb of bellaire 
but felsenthal said southmark has no guarantees that federal 
regulators will not seize the insolvent thrift however he said 
the reorganization plan improves the prospects for creditors 
recovering a fraction of what they are owed 
it is in the public interest said felsenthal who also 
noted that he believes the plan does not rely on san jacintos 
future 
reorganized southmark should be able to perform under the plan 
even if san jacinto is seized after confirmation 
but a key element of the plan is an agreement by southmark to 
inject 100 million in new capital into san jacinto which 
currently falls far short of regulatory capital requirements 
southmark filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
last july listing assets of 105 billion and debts of more than 
14 billion 
the plan calls for paying off holders of more than 1 billion in 
junk bonds with 75 million in cash shortly after confirmation in 
addition debt holders would receive preferred and common stock in 
the new company plus representation on a new board of directors 
southmark once held assets of more than 9 billion as it used 
high yield or junk bonds to expand rapidly from a real estate 
investment trust to a holding company owning campgrounds nursing 
homes an insurance company and numerous other properties 
southmark filed for bankruptcy after a 1 billion firstquarter 
loss last year put it in technical default on its junk bonds the 
company said it also would not be able to make principle and 
interest payments because of the losses

the federal government which sought 400 
million has agreed to settle a lawsuit against former officers of 
eureka federal savings and loan for 68 million according to a 
published report 
the san francisco chronicle reported in todays editions that 
the agreement was reached sunday night ending a trial in us 
district court in san francisco that started in may 
former eureka president kenneth kidwell and four other officers 
of the san carlosbased thrift were sued by eureka and the 
government they were accused of allegedly mismanaging the 
institutions loan portfolios in 1983 and 1984 and incurring more 
than 200 million in losses regulators brought in new management 
in 1985 and three years later sold the institution to american 
first corp in 1988 
federal regulators contended kidwell robert n harris allan r 
jamieson donald b keuper and walter gilliam jr made more than 
150 real estate and commercial loans totaling 260 million that 
almost immediately went into default 
recipients of the loans included casinos in reno and las vegas 
and real estate projects in texas wisconsin florida and other 
states 
the government charged that the loans were made without required 
regulatory approval without adequate assessment of the borrowers 
financial state and with numerous other negligent actions 
arthur shartsis kidwells lawyer said on monday the settlement 
was a very bad result for the government he said it had 
refused to accept a 78 million settlement offer from the 
defendants insurance company shortly before the trial started 
john thomas associate general counsel for the federal deposit 
insurance corp said the defendants had refused to negotiate on 
any kind of settlement until last fall when they came up with a 45 
million offer that the government rejected 
thomas conceded that in light of the later 78 million offer 
with the benefit of hindsight we probably would do it a little 
differently today

president saddam hussein on tuesday warned 
gulf oil producers that iraq will retaliate against them possibly 
with force if they continue producing above opec quotas 
he said the excessive production is an american plot carried out 
by some rulers in the gulf designed to deplete revenues from oil 
exports which has cost iraq billions of dollars 
the iraqi leader speaking on television on the 22nd anniversary 
of his ruling baath party coming to power said raising our 
voice against the evil is not the final resort if the evil 
continues 
there should be some effective act to bring back things to 
their right place iraqis will not forget the proper saying that 
cutting necks is better than cutting the means of living he 
said oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them 
saddam did not mention any country by name but iraqi oil 
minister abdulrahim alchalabi has named the united arab emirates 
and kuwait as the culprits for violating production ceilings set by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the policies of some arab rulers are american they are 
inspired by america to undermine arab interests and security 
saddam said 
he said that since the collapse of communist governments in 
eastern europe the united states is seeking to become the only 
world superpower and implement this dream through controlling 
gulf oil 
he said the overproduction brought prices down and allowed the 
united states to to add to its strategic stockpiles of oil with 
cheap oil 
the iraqi leader said certain gulf leaders are trying to 
undermine iraq after it emerged triumphant in its eightyear 
war with iran 
he vowed that he will not let them continue this policy which he 
described as dangerous and harming the interests and the security 
of the arab nation 
the united arab emirates has been overproducing its opecset 
production quota by about one million barrels a day and kuwait by 
some 200000 barrels per day 
this has been one reason for a recent fall in oil prices from 
opecs benchmark goal of 18 per barrel to as low as 14 dollars a 
barrel 
saddams statement comes after an agreement was reportedly 
reached last week in saudi arabia which would increase the uae 
quota from 11 million barrels a day to 15 million under the 
agreement kuwait would stick to its 15 million barreladay 
ceiling 
iraq was one of the major arab opec producers which accepted the 
new arrangement 
oil ministers of the cartel scheduled to meet in geneva 
switzerland on july 25 are expected to accept the settlement

the us trade deficit climbed to 773 
billion in may reflecting a big jump in imports of oil and foreign 
cars the government said today 
the commerce department said the may trade deficit was 58 
percent higher than a revised april imbalance of 731 billion 
in may imports climbed 29 percent to 4052 billion 
offsetting a 23 percent rise in us exports which totaled 3279 
billion in may the trade deficit is the difference between imports 
and exports 
the big surge in oil accounted for almost half of the increase 
in imports in may with imports of cars and other manufactured 
goods accounting for the rest of the gain 
this increase overshadowed a healthy advance in us exports 
which posted their second best showing on record 
the bush administration is counting on strength in exports to 
offset a sluggish domestic economy and keep the country out of a 
recession this year 
during the first three months of 1990 fully half of all 
economic growth was contributed by gains in exports 
through the first five months of this year the us trade 
deficit has been running at an annual rate of 9768 billion 
surprising many analysts who had been forecasting that this years 
deficit would be little changed from the 1094 billion imbalance 
recorded in 1989 
the bush administration is confidently predicting that americas 
trade performance will continue to improve throughout the year 
however many private analysts worry that americas growing 
dependence on foreign oil will cut into the export gains being made 
by us businesses 
in may oil imports shot up 152 percent to 432 billion the 
advance reflected an increase in the volume of shipments which 
rose to 895 million barrelsa day up from daily shipments of 755 
million barrels in april 
the price per barrel actually fell to 1557 per barrel down a 
full 1 from the april price 
shipments of new cars were up 52 percent in may to 388 
billion reflecting higher imports from canada and other countries 
which offset a drop in car shipments from japan 
the rise in us exports reflected higher shipments in a variety 
of areas including automotive parts capital goods and consumer 
products 
the united states continued to enjoy a trade surplus with the 
countries of western europe of 812 million in may while japan 
continued to be the country with which the united states had the 
largest trade deficit 
in may the deficit with japan totaled 297 billion down 
sharply from a 395 billion april imbalance

a major commodities trading company headed by the 
chairman of the chicago board of trade says it is parceling out 
some accounts to get its books back in order 
stotler and co headed by karsten mahlmann also said monday 
that it is seeking an outside investor 
stotler has been directed by the board of trade to bring its 
amount of cashonhand up to 4 percent of customer funds as 
required by the commodity futures trading commission by the close 
of business wednesday said a statement issued by the firms parent 
company stotler group inc 
if a brokerage does not maintain the required amount of 
regulatory capital the exchange can restrict the brokerage to 
trading only for the purpose of liquidation and can transfer that 
brokerages customer accounts to other brokerages said michael 
oconnell a board of trade spokesman 
he referred questions about the specifics of the case to 
chicagobased stotler group where spokesman vito piazza declined 
to comment beyond the prepared statement 
the statement said stotler planned to meet the requirement by 
transferring a portion of its customer accounts and trading 
positions to other brokerages and by seeking a capital infusion 
from various parties 
the moves are likely to reduce the firms revenue and net 
income stotler said 
without a capital infusion stotler group may be unable to 
meet its debt obligations unless those obligations are refinanced 
or restructured the company said 
the chicago tribune reported saturday that stotler one of the 
nations 10 biggest futures brokerages may have run afoul of 
capital requirements because of its recent rapid growth 
stotler group said another subsidiary brokerage rg dickinson 
amp co of des moines iowa was not affected by the compliance 
problems at stotler and co

higher while the corn and oat markets slipped a bit this morning on

bearish signals 
a national weather service forecast for cool rainy weather 
early next week in the midwest was a depressing factor in the corn 
and soybean pits analysts said 
but selling linked to the sixto10day outlook was offset by 
contradictory forecasts from some private forecasters and by 
perceptions that the corn and bean markets were due for a 
correction after sharp recent losses said ann fricke senior 
oilseed analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york

president bush said today that disturbing new 
figures on the federal deficit show that the time for game 
playing is over and he pledged to increase pressure for a 
compromise on new taxes and budget cuts 
were getting to a crunch bush told a group of magazine 
publishers at the white house it is absolutely essential that 
something be done i will do my part 
he commented a day after the white house office of budget and 
management boosted its estimate of the fiscal 1991 deficit to 
1688 billion up 10 billion from the administrations estimates 
a month ago and up sharply from the 1005 billion it estimated in 
january 
the projected deficit is more than 100 billion above the 
grammrudman law target of 64 billion 
congressional budget negotiators had given mixed reviews to the 
administrations gloomy assessment some saying it would help prod 
slowmoving talks and others suggesting the opposite 
given yesterdays news bush said today the time for 
gameplaying is over and we have to get something done that is not 
only a sound budget agreement but is seen by the american people to 
be a sound budget agreement 
bush said that while he was still fairly optimistic such a 
pact could be reached it will require both spending cuts and tax 
increases 
bush earlier this month abandoned his 1988 no new taxes 
campaign pledge 
the president said he was fearful about the confidence in the 
marketplace should a budget deal not be struck 
we will be pushing in the next couple of weeks and the meter 
is running bush said 
budget summit talks between administration officials and 
congressional leaders enter their third month this week meanwhile 
the house planned to vote today on a conservativebacked 
constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget 
backers of the amendment conceded monday they seemed to be 
several votes short of the twothirds margin needed to approve a 
constitutional amendment 
bush sent a letter to capitol hill urging support of the 
amendment and calling for a lineitem veto and greater authority 
for the president to impound funds appropriated by congress 
together with political courage and discipline these tools 
are vital to solving the problem of budget deficits bush said 
calling the balanced budget amendment crucial to our nations 
longterm economic health and prosperity 
the administration coupled the release of the revised figures 
monday with a bleak assessment of how a 100 billion cut in 
services which would be triggered this fall by the grammrudman 
law in the absence of a budget accord would affect government 
services 
the scenarios included eliminating half the nations 2 million 
active military personnel reducing hours of operation at the 
nations airports and halting increased drug interdiction efforts 
at the countrys borders 
no one was willing to say they believed such dramatic cuts would 
be allowed to stand for very long as recently as last fall the 
grammrudman law required spending cuts that were rolled back as 
soon as negotiators worked out a budget deal 
but some lawmakers argued monday that the new numbers 
illustrated a problem that had to be dealt with 
the day of reckoning has arrived said rep leon panetta 
dcalif chairman of the house budget committee he said 
congressional leaders had asked the white house to illustrate 
possible budget cuts to find a way to convey a sense of crisis 
to show both our colleagues and the country that there is no 
choice here 
sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee said the details should send a message to 
lawmakers who have opposed the budget talks 
they now have a clear alternative domenici said if it is 
not an economic summit it is this it is a 100 billion 
automatic spending cut 
not everyone agreed one of the more partisan democratic budget 
negotiators senate budget committee chairman james sasser noted 
that the new deficit projection was just 9 billion higher than the 
shortfall the administration informally projected a month ago 
sasser dtenn described the talks as stalled in 
contrast panetta said white house and congressional staff 
discussed possible taxraising proposals over the weekend 
the 1688 billion shortfall projection did not include the 
costs of bailing out the savings and loan industry when that 
spending is included the white house estimated a 2314 billion 
budget gap 
the balanced budget amendment if approved by twothirds votes 
of each house of congress and threefourths of the states would 
ban the government from spending more than it takes in unless 
threefifths of the congress voted to waive the requirement 
the balanced budget rules would not take effect before fiscal 
1993 and would be set aside in time of war 
the house last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 1982 
falling more than 40 votes short of approval the house democratic 
leadership opposes the amendment

a spurt in automobile production and a heat 
wave that boosted utility output pushed industrial production up 
04 percent in june the federal reserve reported tuesday 
last months 04 percent gain which followed a rise of 06 
percent in may surprised analysts who had been expecting a more 
modest increase 
the june increase helped push industrial production for the 
second quarter up by an annual rate of 35 percent a significant 
improvement over the mediocre 06 percent annual rate of gain in 
the first three months of the year 
however private analysts cautioned that the upturn was likely 
due to temporary factors rather than any longterm comeback in the 
nations manufacturing sector which has been in a slump for months 
analysts attributed much of the recent strength in auto 
production to the likelihood that automakers have been building up 
inventories in preparation for a possible september walkout by the 
united auto workers 
although the number is good its not necessarily a harbinger 
of strength in the months ahead the manufacturing sector is still 
in the doldrums said michael k evans who heads a washington 
economic forecasting company 
still cynthia latta of drimcgraw hill said the increase in 
industrial production showed were still slogging along with very 
slow growth but some growth 
manufacturing is not booming its struggling she said 
but since output does seem to be expanding slightly it has to be 
viewed as a relatively good report 
the fed said that the increases in automobile production and 
utility output accounted for threefourths of the total june 
increase 
the fed also reported the operating rate of the nations 
factories mines and utilities which usually move in tandem with 
industrial production rose 02 percentage point to 835 percent of 
capacity in june 
the operating rate measures not only output but changes in 
productivity levels 
while the june operating rate was the highest since decembers 
837 percent it was still well below the level a year ago when the 
industrial sector was operating at 846 percent of capacity 
industrial production at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods rose 05 percent in june after 
increasing 08 percent in may 
output of durable goods bigticket items expected to last at 
least three years also increased 05 percent after a jump of 13 
percent a month earlier manufacturing of nondurable goods such as 
food and clothing was up 04 percent after a 01 percent increase 
in may 
the fed said its industrial production index in june stood at 
1098 percent of its 1987 base up from 1093 in may

martin l grass president of rite aid 
corp said tuesday he will take legal action against ohio 
officials who waged what he called an outrageous prosecution 
against him 
grass called reporters to company headquarters here and said he 
will expand his federal defamation lawsuit to include more people 
at the ohio board of pharmacy 
grass and rite aid were cleared monday of a bribery charge when 
a cuyahoga county common pleas court judge dismissed the case after 
the prosecution rested its case 
grass said it was clear from the testimony that the prosecution 
had no case against him he charged that no police agency ever 
investigated the case investigators were never called to testify 
and prosecutor william caine was more interested in furthering his 
career 
when somebody comes at you like that you dont sit back and 
take it grass said you have to retaliate 
caine declined to comment tuesday 
grass and the company were accused of trying to bribe ohio 
pharmacy board member melvin wilczynski to step down so a new board 
member favorable to rite aid could be appointed grass said 
wilczynski was a consultant to a drug store chain that rite aid had 
just acquired and the board member was given a rite aid check for 
33000 to buy out his contract 
grass defamation suit was filed last year in federal court in 
cleveland against wilczynski and had been on hold pending outcome 
of the criminal trial 
accusing ohio of a double enforcement standard grass said other 
chains including one rite aid acquired were never cited by the 
pharmacy board but he said it appeared to be targeted for alleged 
violations soon after rite aid bought nearly 300 additional stores 
and became one of the states largest chains 
we just didnt like having a dual standard grass said as 
far as were concerned ohio is the only state weve been in where 
theres been selective enforcement it seemed like there were rules 
for one group and rules for another group and we were in the wrong 
group 
jack smittle assistant executive director for the ohio board of 
pharmacy also declined comment tuesday 
grass said the 15month ordeal had put a damper on the company 
stock with some pensions and other buyers avoiding it because of a 
cloud of suspicion hanging over rite aid 
he said the trial had no effect on retail sales and the company 
will not change operations in ohio

a senior world trade negotiator on tuesday 
circulated a draft treaty setting out new rules to liberalize 
global trade in services worth more than 600 billion a year 
the draft provides for the establishment of a general agreement 
on trade in services similar to the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade gatt which has governed trade in goods for more than 40 
years 
but the text by services negotiating group chairman felipe 
jaramillo fails to define what services will be covered reflecting 
the deadlock between the united states and other countries involved 
in the talks 
negotiators are meant to agree on an outline text by the end of 
this month to enable a services accord to be made final when the 
fouryear round of uruguay trade talks concludes in december the 
ambitious negotiations are also due to draw up new rules in 14 
other areas of world trade such as agriculture and textiles 
industrialized countries have led the way in pressing for a new 
agreement to open markets to services such as tourism 
transportation and telecommunications the rapidly growing sector 
now accounts for an average 60 percent of employment and gross 
domestic product in the developed world according to estimates 
from the genevabased gatt secretariat 
third world countries were initially worried that denied 
protection their infant service industries would be overwhelmed by 
competition from indutrialized countries 
however the text presented by jaramillo a colombian national 
seeks to ease these concerns by stating that the process of 
liberalization shall take place with due respect to the level 
of development in individual parties 
the 25 articles of the draft treaty set out the general 
obligations of signatories as well as provisions for progressive 
liberalization specific commitments on market access and 
institutional questions like dispute settlement 
the text seeks to reconcile conflicting interests however the 
section titled coverage was left blank 
trade sources say that most countries including the 12 members 
of the european community have argued that the treaty should cover 
all services 
under this universal approach special needs of individual 
sectors could be tackled through more detailed amendments once 
agreement on a broad framework has been reached 
the united states by contrast wants coverage of the general 
treaty to be narrower in particular us negotiators have pressed 
for a format that would allow financial services aviation and 
shipping to be excluded 
washington while pressing for greater overall liberalization 
is reportedly anxious to protect existing bilateral deals that 
benefit the us aviation and maritime industry 
on financial services the us treasury wants to retain control 
over prudential regulation rules meant to ensure the soundness of 
the banking system trade sources say japan backs the united states 
on this

the big three automakers are expected to make 
about half as much money in the second quarter this year as they 
did last year analysts said tuesday 
economic problems in brazil caused problems for general motors 
corp and ford motor co while incentives and increased jeep 
competition reduced profits at chrysler corp they said 
gm and ford report their earnings july 25 chrysler releases its 
figures july 31 
average earnings estimates from seven analysts contacted tuesday 
by the associated press suggested that gms earnings were expected 
to drop about 40 percent from a year ago fords would be off about 
49 percent and chryslers were forecast to be down about 46 percent 
in last years second quarter gm earned 15 billion ford made 
14 billion and chrysler earned 341 million 
gm reported three months ago that its 1990 firstquarter 
earnings fell to 710 million down 54 percent from last years 
first quarter fords were down 69 percent to 506 million and 
chryslers were off 80 percent to 71 million 
except for brazil its pretty much shipping fewer cars for 
lower prices said analyst david healy of the barclays de zoete 
wedd investment banking firm in new york 
gm and ford have large operations in brazil that supply many of 
the vehicles they sell in south america the brazilian government 
put the brakes on the nations economy earlier this year when the 
inflation rate topped 1000 percent annually 
the two largest us automakers operations in brazil were shut 
down and only recently have they seen the beginning of a recovery 
for the first four to five weeks in the quarter there was 
virtually no production in brazil said analyst john kirnan of 
kidder peabody amp co of new york brazil is definitely a drag on 
the earnings 
the top two automakers recently have relied on their overseas 
operations for much of their profits gm and ford have reported 
record overseas earnings recently while north american operations 
ran on marginal profits 
chrysler in the worst overall financial shape of the big three 
has essentially no overseas profit base 
in north america each of the big three watched incentive costs 
and a listless sales pace squeeze their profits late in the 
quarter the sales pace began to pick up as the companies boosted 
production and pared incentive offers estimated to cost about 
1000 per vehicle 
from a domestic standpoint it looks like the worst is over 
said analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york 
chrysler is purely a victim of circumstances in the north 
american market 
for chrysler the third quarter promises to be a tough one the 
nations third largest automaker plans to stop production at its 
minivan plants in st louis and windsor ontario during the period 
to retool for the redesigned 1991 models thats likely to cause an 
availability problem for one of chryslers most profitable vehicles 
they fully expect to get hammered by the minivan changeover 
said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co of new york 
chryslers other moneymaker the jeep cherokee is seeing its 
dominance of the sportutility market slip with the recent 
introduction of the fourdoor chevrolet blazer and ford explorer 
analysts expected that the erosion of cherokees 25 percent 
share of the market segment will accelerate as production of the 
blazer and explorer increase

steel producer through the acquisition of the ailing west german 
steel company saarstahl since then the french company has sought 
to build up its us presence through acquisitions and partnerships

chicago and is one of the biggest us producers of stainless 
steel following its acquisitions of techalloy inc alloy amp 
stainless inc and j amp l a unit of ltv corp earlier this year

translink said that in 1989 there were 40 french state 
acquisitions of european targets valued at 267 billion european

amounted to 28 percent of the total value of all french 
acquisitions in europe 
france is in effect nationalizing europe commented mark 
dixon the editor of the review 
the review said that many governments consider the takeovers 
unfair because of the protection given to the french companies by

pfizer inc tuesday said it earned 11 percent 
more in the second quarter than it did a year earlier as stronger 
sales in its health care and specialty chemicals divisions helped 
produce a 15 percent revenue gain 
the profit growth came despite disappointing sales from pfizers 
animal health and consumer products segments 
a 20 percent drop in specialty minerals sales reflecting the 
sale of a pigments business also restrained the companywide sales 
gain 
pfizer earned 1512 million or 90 cents a share in the three 
months ended july 1 up from 1357 million or 80 cents a share 
in 1989s second quarter sales rose to 149 billion from 130 
billion 
edmund t pratt jr the new yorkbased pharmaceutical companys 
chairman and chief executive officer said the 26 percent growth in 
health care was fueled by the increasing number of new pfizer 
products entering markets worldwide 
among some of the recently launched products are new 
cardiovascular drugs such as procardia xl cardura and norvasc 
and the antifungal agent diflucan 
our net income is beginning to benefit from the earnings 
momentum these products promise for the 1990s pratt said 
by midyear pfizer earned 4031 million or 240 a share up 7 
percent from 3765 million or 223 a share through the first 
half of 1989 halfyear revenue rose 9 percent to 298 billion

nynex corp neither funded nor supported a 
subsidiarys annual florida parties that featured call girls and 
clients the chairman of the telephone company said tuesday 
the annual miami parties which occurred between 1984 and 1988 
were attended by employees of materiel enterprises co which at 
the time was nynexs unregulated purchasing arm and about 30 
suppliers 
the parties reportedly featured awards for the most perverted 
partygoer and to the man who procured the most women 
at a news conference nynex chairman william ferguson called the 
activities sophomoric and repugnant he said none of the 
activities that were investigated were sponsored by the company 
none were paid for by the company none took place on company 
time 
an internal 1988 nynex investigation of the events resulted in 
two employees being fired and six others being disciplined for 
violating nynexs code of business conduct 
a fired nynex consultant who had no dealings with the parties 
told the wall street journal that suppliers who attended and paid 
for the parties saw their business increase by 67 percent while 
those who didnt saw an increase of only about 35 percent 
ferguson said those figures were misleading and said there was 
no evidence that any supplier ever benefited due to the parties 
he also said the nynex investigation showed that employees who 
attended the parties paid their own way he said some offered 
canceled checks as proof while others said they paid cash 
materiel enterprises activities have become a key issue in the 
companys pending request to new york regulators for a record 
9197 million rate increase 
the federal communications commission in february ordered fines 
totaling 14 million against the companys new york telephone co 
and new england telephone and telegraph co subsidiaries because of 
1185 million in alleged overcharges made to the two units by 
materiel enterprises 
materiel enterprises which was formed in 1983 to provide 
equipment and services to the telephone companies allegedly 
engaged in a series of transactions with the two aimed at 
increasing nynexs overall profit at customer expense 
the fcc also ordered the two telephone subsidiaries to refund 
about 35 million to customers nynex has appealed the fine and 
refund order 
ferguson said all documents concerning the florida parties were 
turned over to the state public service commission and fcc in 1988 
asked why nynex didnt make the investigation public at that 
time ferguson said what would you have us do take out a full 
newspaper ad theres not a company in the world who would do that 
we did what we had to do we investigated and we took action 
ferguson who took over as nynexs chairman and chief executive 
officer last october said he was talking about the incidents now 
because its become part of the rate case and because its in the 
public and i want some facts out there 
he said the parties first came to the attention of meco 
executives in 1985 an internal investigation was conducted by an 
outside agency 
they found no evidence of misconduct with respect to the 
purchasing arrangement or contract with vendors ferguson said 
as a result no action was taken 
he said the 1985 investigation made no mention of suppliers and 
nynex employees sharing rooms or of prostitutes attending 
gatherings 
but he said apparently these things the parties were 
becoming bigger and bigger year after year another investigation 
was launched in 1988 
nynex transferred ownership of meco to new york telephone and 
new england telephone in march the subsidiary now is regulated by 
the state

the world bank said tuesday that efforts to 
lower costs for third world borrowers and increased provisions for 
problem loans resulted in a 5 percent drop in its fiscal 1990 net 
income over a year ago 
the bank which is owned by roughly 150 countries and is the 
largest lender to the developing world said its profit totaled 
104 billion for the year ended june 30 compared with earnings of 
109 billion in 1989 
the 1990 figures include a 357 million provision set aside to 
cover future loan losses and a 106 million charge for health and 
insurance benefits to retired staff 
income was further reduced by about 150 million as a result of 
the world banks decision to lower the loan commitment fees to 
borrowers for a second consecutive year the bank said 
in discussing the profit decline ernest stern senior vice 
president for finance told a news conference the world bank 
does not seek to maximize income our first priority is to 
begin to reduce costs to our borrowers 
lower net income figures would not reflect a lower 
incomegenerating capacity but a discretionary decision not to 
retain income which is not needed to maintain our very strong 
financial position particularly at a time when many of our 
borrowers face serious cash flow problems 
the bank said it met its target 11 percent reservestoloan 
ratio during the 1990 fiscal year the reserves act as a buffer 
against unforseeable events such as volatility in foreign exchange 
or higher interest rates which could cause borrowing costs to rise 
or borrowers to cease making payments 
at the end of the last fiscal year nine countries including 
panama nicaragua and zambia were classified as being on a 
nonaccrural basis which means they have either stopped or 
decreased their loan payments 
the world bank granted a total of 207 billion of new loans in 
the year down from 213 billion the year before 
of the latest total 152 billion was lent by its international 
bank for reconstruction and development through its international 
development association which is funded by more than 30 of the 
richer member countries including the united states the bank lent 
55 billion to the poorest countries 
disbursements on loans reached a record 139 billion in the 
1990 fiscal year up from the previous years 113 billion the 
bank said 
one reason for the increase was a 2 billion disbursement to 
mexico under treasury secretary nicholas bradys debt reduction 
plan 
stern said the world bank intends to support struggling eastern 
european countries by lending about 7 billion to that region over 
the next three years

ames department stores inc won approval from a 
federal bankruptcy judge on tuesday to reject employment contracts 
totaling about 33 million for three former executives 
the ruling by judge howard c buschman means the three who 
stepped down after the troubled retailer filed for protection from 
its creditors will have to line up with other unsecured creditors 
if they want to collect anything they say is due them under the 
contracts 
they would recover the same percentage of what is owed them as 
other unsecured creditors when a bankruptcy reorganization plan is 
approved by the court 
the former executives include former chief executive officer 
peter hollis whose contract guaranteed him a salary of 700000 a 
year through jan 31 1993 
the others are leslie dietzman former executive vice president 
of merchandising whose contract was for 325000 a year through 
1992 and jeffrey dentz former executive vice president of 
operations whose contract provides for 200000 a year through 
jan 31 1993 
federal law allows a company in bankruptcy to assume or reject 
any contract it entered into before its bankruptcy filing the law 
is intended to help a company reorganize by removing obligations it 
considers burdensome or no longer appropriate for its ongoing 
business 
ames based in rocky hill conn filed for protection under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code on april 25 largely because 
of problems stemming from its 788 million acquisition of the zayre 
discount store chain in 1988 
hollis resigned a few days after the company filed for 
protection dietzman and dentz resigned their positions but have 
remained with ames said ames spokesman doug ewing 
ames had already stopped making payments to the executives and 
none received severance payments said another ames spokesman 
william roberts 
hollis was replaced by stephen l pistner a specialist in 
turning around troubled retail companies who is being paid 15 
million a year 
last month buschman approved the closing of more than 200 
stores and authorized the company to pay 24 million to 18000 
workers who will lose their jobs 
during tuesdays hearing the judge called the ames case 
troubling because of the store closings and impending layoffs 
buschman also said the companys unsettled finances have left 
38000 remaining employees with jobs dependent upon factors of 
which they have very little control 
ames the nations fourthlargest discounter has 679 stores in 
the eastern united states and two distribution centers

million barrels as expected 
james ritterbusch an energy analyst for painewebber inc said 
crude prices were likely to open 15 to 20 cents lower wednesday in

fundamental force here is still the willingness on the part of opec 
to curtail output that still overshadows weektoweek changes in 
the api numbers

exchange amid heavy commodityfund selling prompted by bearish

cents per 1000 face amount its yield held at 845 percent the 
same as monday 
market watchers said dealings were moderate but traders 
appeared hesitant in advance of greenspans testimony wednesday 
before a congressional committee on the central banks view of 
economic conditions 
people are waiting for greenspan said gary schlossberg 
senior economist at wells fargo bank in san francisco they want 
a better read on what the followup to the feds recent easing will 
be 
greenspan surprised the markets last week when he told a senate 
banking committee that the central bank was ready to offset an 
emerging credit squeeze 
traders widely interpreted fed actions the next day to inject 
more reserves into the banking system as a relaxation of its credit 
policy 
the move was followed by a quarterpoint decline to 8 percent in 
the federal funds rate the interest rate that banks charge each 
other for overnight loans the federal funds rate finished at 8 
percent unchanged from late monday 
also due wednesday is a report on consumer prices in june with 
many economists expecting a rise of 03 percent 
in the first of two economic reports tuesday the government 
said the us trade deficit rose to 773 billion in may from a 
revised 731 billion imbalance for april 
but analysts said the result had largely been anticipated by the 
credit markets and prices failed to respond to the news 
in another report the government said industrial production 
rose 04 percent in june that was about twice as much as expected 
but traders said that report was discounted because the rise was 
largely due to a heat wave that boosted utility output 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose 132 point intermediate maturities were unchanged 
to up 116 point and longterm issues were off as much as 332 
point according to telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index was 
unavailable it measures price movements on all outstanding 
treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 332 point to 92 the average yield to 
maturity slipped to 741 percent from 742 percent late monday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills auctioned monday fell to 
785 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 760 percent 
yields on sixmonth bills auctioned monday were 787 percent as the 
discount fell 4 basis points to 748 percent yields on oneyear 
bills fell to 786 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 
734 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

federal regulators sold 536 million of real 
estate seized from failed thrifts in texas and oklahoma in the 
first five months of this year but still hold properties worth 
76 billion 
that doesnt include what the government may gain through 
continued failures 
but real estate experts said tuesday a credit crunch and the 
governments reluctance to help finance purchases are making the 
thrift bailout effort more difficult 
we basically have no financing in the real estate market 
jr kimball a real estate appraiser from fort worth testified at 
the first meeting of the resolution trust corps region 4 advisory 
board 
banks dont want to make real estate loans and the savings 
and loans are virtually nonexistent everythings still on a 
downward slope he said 
prices are declining as the markets continuing to erode 
with or without financing from the rtc said elizabeth b sink 
president of real estateasset information management systems inc 
in dallas 
i dont think weve seen the end of the downward spiral 
she said 
the rtc was created last year to oversee the thrift bailout 
estimated to cost taxpayers between 300 billion and 500 billion 
the advisory boards were designed to provide guidance to the 
regional rtc offices from industry experts 
tuesdays meeting of the region 4 board which oversees texas 
and oklahoma is the second to be held nationally like a previous 
meeting in new york few people other than witnesses and rtc 
officials attended 
carmen sullivan the rtcs regional director told the board the 
agency now controls 122 thrifts in the two states including 48 
that have been resolved by selling deposits and some assets from 
the failed institutions 
as of may 31 she said the rtc had retained 17000 assets in 
the two states worth 76 billion all but 135 million of it in 
texas of those properties 11000 are singlefamily residences 
valued at about 2 billion 4400 parcels of vacant land valued at 
36 billion and 1600 commercial properties valued at 2 billion 
of the 536 million sold this year 248 million was in 
singlefamily residences 98 million in vacant land and the rest 
in commercial property she said 
all of last year government regulators sold off 579 million of 
thrift real estate she said 
several board members and witnesses questioned ms sullivan on 
the problems caused by scant financing and some board members 
indicated they backed government guaranteeing of loans 
but ms sullivan said i dont believe that were necessarily 
turning away any creditworthy purchasers 
regulations allow the rtc to finance sales under certain 
restrictions and she said the agency provided 16 million in 
residential financing and 10 million in commercial financing 
during the first quarter of the year

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
tuesday that congress should consider delaying action on the 1990 
farm bill until a budget agreement is reached by white house and 
congressional negotiators 
certainly that would be the most propitious way to handle the 
matter yeutter told reporters 
otherwise congress might have to write two farm bills he said 
indicating an agreement on the overall federal budget may require 
changes in farm programs not anticipated in the pending legislation 
but he said he has not asked any members of congress directly to 
delay farm bill action 
the administration is hiding behind the budget and trying to 
kill the farm bill said senate agriculture committee chairman 
patrick leahy dvt since the budget summit may take months to 
complete the administrations proposal sets the stage from a 
oneyear farm bill extension so that american farm policy would be 
written in geneva 
leahy made a similar accusation monday after yeutter said he 
would seek a veto of the bill if its cost isnt reduced yeutter is 
playing a major role in us efforts to get countries participating 
in the general agreement on tariffs and trade talks in geneva 
switzerland to reduce trade distorting subsidies 
since discussions on the farm bill began last year congress has 
warned yeutter that it would not allow agriculture policy in this 
country to be determined at the international negotiating table 
leahy has said yeutter wants a oneyear bill in order to give us 
trade negotiators a freer hand at gatt 
thats nonsense said yeutter whether we have a one 
three or fiveyear farm bill is fundamentally irrelevant to the 
gatt process 
though yeutter has said repeatedly that he would accept a 
oneyear extension of current law if debate bogs down he said 
tuesday that he expects congress to pass a fiveyear bill 
senate leaders have said they would like to begin floor debate 
on the bill this week probably thursday eighty or 90 possible 
amendments are being prepared and debate could take more than a 
week in the house the rules committee meets that day to determine 
the procedures for the house debate which could begin next week 
meanwhile budget negotiators who have been working since 
midmay have apparently made little significant progress toward 
reaching an agreement some have suggested that congress will have 
to return after the november election to get a budget passed 
the senate agriculture committee says the bill contains 55 
billion in price supports but yeutter says administration figures 
show that it would cost 59 billion 
with the administration announcing yesterday that were facing 
a 168 billion deficit were not going to have money for that 
yeutter said he said his office also will issue an analysis of the 
house farm bill 
yeutter said the budget negotiators are trying to work out a 
fiveyear economic plan but until they reveal their proposals the 
amount allowed for agriculture remains unknown 
its totally up in the air because we still do not have a 
budget agreement with congress said yeutter 
it is widely accepted that the versions of the farm bill passed 
by the house and senate will be significantly changed in conference 
committee that committee could wait for an agreement from the 
budget negotiators before polishing off the farm bill

united telecommunications incs stock 
plunged tuesday after it reported a 55 percent drop in second 
quarter earnings and postponed its purchase of gte corps stake in 
its us sprint longdistance division 
the company also announced it would eliminate 1000 jobs 
nationwide and switch more employees to sales and customer service 
jobs 
we have determined that due to the disappointing 
secondquarter results this is not the time to complete the 
buyout the companys chairman and chief executive william t 
esrey said in a statement 
we will continue to evaluate the status on a monthly basis 
and the buyout will take place when we determine the timing to be 
correct esrey said 
shares of the kansas citybased telecommunications company 
dropped 875 to 2950 on the new york stock exchange a 22 
percent slide it was the most heavily traded issue with 118 
million shares changing hands 
esrey blamed the earnings drop on high overhead and onetime 
costs 
but william deatherage an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc 
in new york said the company wasnt achieving the level of revenue 
growth it needs to keep pace with costs 
not only are they not taking market share from atampt theyre 
not even growing at the industry rate overall deatherage said 
analysts who had expected slightly lower earnings were surprised 
by what the company reported he said 
they have not communicated to us over the last few months 
that they were having problems of this magnitude therefore its 
difficult to pinpoint the exact difficulty deatherage said 
but theres no way they can pass off a quarter like this as an 
aberration 
esrey said the company did not meet its revenue goals 
particularly in customer segments such as residential and small 
business 
in light of increasing competition we are aggressively 
refocusing our sales efforts to place our technologically advanced 
network and innovative telecommunications products and services 
before potential customers esrey said 
united telecom had announced with great fanfare three months ago 
that it would buy the share of us sprint it did not already own for 
500 million and change its name to sprint corp to capitalize on 
the high profile of the nations thirdlargest longdistance 
company the transaction and name change had been expected to take 
place this month 
gte corp which formed us sprint with united telecom as a joint 
venture in 1986 still owns 20 percent of the company 
us sprint has 8 percent of the longdistance market and trails 
only industry leader american telephone amp telegraph co and mci 
communications corp 
the company said it earned 406 million or 18 cents a share 
during the quarter ending june 30 compared with 905 million or 
43 cents per share during the same quarter a year earlier 
the company said several nonrecurring charges totaling 72 
million affected the performance of us sprint the charges included 
a reserve for the workforce cuts a writeoff in the value of 
nonproductive assets and reserves set aside for other unspecified 
uses 
the earnings came on revenue of 207 billion compared with 
185 billion in the same quarter of 1989 
us sprints revenue increased 19 percent to 124 billion but 
after the nonrecurring charges were included the longdistance 
unit lost 42 million for the quarter 
for the first sixmonths of the year united telecom earned 
1482 million or 69 cents per share compared with 1669 
million or 79 cents a share in the yearearlier period 
syd courson a spokesman in kansas city said some employees 
will be laid off when the 1000 positions are eliminated but he 
did not have an exact number other job eliminations will come 
through attrition he said 
the company has been looking for ways to cut costs he said in 
addition some positions were duplicated when united telecom and 
sprint began consolidating their operations this spring he said

mcgrawhill inc said tuesday its secondquarter 
earnings fell 267 percent from a year earlier as improved results 
in financial services were offset by declines in publishing and

the absence of onetime gains reported last year from asset sales 
the media company said 
among other media companies reporting results park 
communications inc said its earnings inched higher in the second 
quarter ew scripps co reported a quarterly loss of 162000 due

and the numerax service which was sold

the house narrowly defeated a constitutional 
amendment tuesday to balance the budget after opponents said it was 
a gimmick to hide the failure of congress and the president to cut 
the huge federal deficits 
the house voted 279150 in favor of the amendment but it was 
seven votes short of the twothirds required to propose a 
constitutional change 
president bush meanwhile declared that the worsening federal 
deficit meant the time for gameplaying is over and set a 
budget meeting with congressional leaders at the white house on 
wednesday 
backers of the amendment said they had expected defeat rep 
charles stenholm dtexas said either way congress needed to make 
tough choices to end a decade of huge increases in the national 
debt which now tops 31 trillion 
its up to us folks he said if this amendment passes 
its going to take guts if it doesnt pass its going to take 
guts 
none of us want to face the tough decisions at hand but faced 
they must be said rep larry craig ridaho cosponsor of the 
amendment 
the amendment would beginning in 1995 prohibit government 
spending from exceeding revenues or any increase in government 
borrowing unless the requirements are waived by a threefifths 
vote of each chamber of congress 
the house defeated 244184 a proposal by rep joe barton 
rtexas to extend the supermajority threshold to any proposal 
containing a tax increase barton said without his amendment a 
balanced budget requirement would create a bias toward raising 
taxes 
the balanced budget amendment would send a message to the 
economic markets of our country that this congress is serious 
about fiscal responsibility said rep marilyn lloyd dtenn 
bush in a letter monday urged support of the amendment along 
with changes in the budget process to give the president more 
power including the lineitem veto 
together with political courage and discipline these tools 
are vital to solving the problem of budget deficits bush said 
bush on tuesday told a group of magazine publishers in the white 
house the time for game playing is over and he would push 
harder for a compromise with congress on a deficitreduction plan 
the house last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 1982 
when it fell short by more than 40 votes support for the amendment 
has grown since then largely because of growing frustration over 
the deficits and the failure of statutes such as grammrudman law 
to solve them 
but opponents tuesday said the amendment was a sham that its 
requirements could easily be dodged and that delaying the 
effective date to 1995 amounted to passing the buck 
this socalled balanced budget amendment is the amendment for 
the truly religious because the balance to which it refers occurs 
only in the hereafter said rep david obey dwis 
we get the headlines today someone else gets the headache of 
making it work tomorrow said rep richard durbin dill 
rep jack brooks dtexas said the amendment would solve none 
of the nations fiscal problems except give the courts an excuse to 
begin dictating the nations fiscal policy judicial tyranny 
waiting to happen he said 
president bush like ronald reagan before him has not proposed 
a balanced budget and has touted the amendment so long as it 
doesnt take effect too quickly the white house said it supported 
the house version although it objected to language making it 
harder to raise fees for government services or to increase 
government borrowing 
the delay in the effective date of the house version until 
1995 was in response to concerns expressed by the administration 
and others that reducing the deficit too quickly would risk damage 
to the economy 
the presidents budget office estimated on monday that the 
deficit in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 would reach 1688 
billion unless spending is cut or taxes raised that figure would 
trigger automatic spending cuts under the grammrudman law of 
nearly 105 billion 
and the new administration estimate does not include the tens of 
billions of dollars needed for the bailout of the savings and loan 
industry 
white house chief of staff john sununu said bushs meeting with 
congressional leaders on wednesday afternoon would focus on the 
budget talks which have been progressing slowly despite the 
presidents reversal of his no new taxes pledge 
the agendas a very simple one lets get a solution to the 
deficit get a package to come out of the summit and move 
forward sununu said

exchange dropped moderately

tuesdays close of 14820 yen it finished at 14780 yen in new 
york 
currency dealers said the dollars slide followed its retreat in 
new york partly because of an increase in the us trade deficit 
in may 
the us commerce department reported the nations trade deficit 
for may increased to 773 billion from a revised 731 billion in 
april the government said increases in oil and auto imports offset 
the secondhighest level of exports on record 
a dealer with daiichi kangyo bank said the dollars weakness as 
a whole was in line with trends of declining us interest rates 
since last week 
its somewhat difficult now to buy dollars over prospects of 
further declines in interest rates said the dealer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said many market players were awaiting wednesdays testimony 
by us federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan before 
congress

the senate voted tuesday to speed up action on 
a major job discrimination bill brushing aside warnings from 
critics that the measure would lead to minority hiring quotas 
the action brought an outcry from republican leader bob dole 
that the bill was being rammed down our throats while white 
house chief of staff john sununu accused sponsors of backing out on 
a compromise reached last week 
if were going to be treated like a bunch of bums on this side 
of the aisle there wont be any agreements on anything said 
dole after the 6238 vote to limit debate to 30 hours 
provisions of the bill sponsored by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to 
punitive damages for victims of intentional discrimination 
the sharpest clashes have come over a provision that would make 
it easier to challenge hiring practices of companies whose work 
forces do not mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the local 
labor pool 
such employers if challenged in court would have to prove that 
the hiring practices that led to the composition of the work force 
were justified by business necessity that would reverse the most 
controversial of five 1989 supreme court rulings on job bias 
addressed by the bill 
the justices in a case involving a salmon cannery in alaska 
held that it was up to those who file such lawsuits to prove the 
practices they objected to were not motivated by business necessity 
the bush administration business groups and some gop senators 
say the bill would lead to employers using hiring quotas to avert 
any chance they would incur the costs including damage awards of 
job discrimination suits 
after voting to set the time limit the senate debated an 
alternative version of the legislation sponsored by sen nancy 
landon kassebaum rkan but it broke off action for the night with 
the administration and sponsors agreeing to negotiate some more 
while still allowing the clock to run on the 30hour deadline 
i think everybody agrees its worth one last shot one last 
effort dole said as the senate recessed bush said last week he 
was encouraged by the negotiations after kennedy and sununu 
appeared to reach a compromise 
i thought we had an agreement sununu said the senator 
came in yesterday after we had an agreement and then we didnt 
have it anymore 
he said president bush would continue to press for a civil 
rights agreement but would veto any measure that would lead to 
hiring quotas 
at a photo opportunity session earlier sununu said in answer a 
question on the chances of an agreement we had one thursday 
they reneged on it 
kennedy said on the senate floor however the president never 
claimed that there had been a deal and the situation was locked up 
and neither did i if anyone said otherwise he said they 
misspoke 
kennedy noted the indignation of critics of the bill who argued 
they needed more than 30 hours to purge it of what they viewed as 
quota provisions and other objectionable features 
i wish we could see that kind of indignation about the kind of 
unfairness that is taking place at job locations all over this 
country against women and minorities kennedy said 
dole grimly acknowledged the defection of eight republicans on 
the roll call raising his voice he suggested that perhaps someone 
else should be found to serve as minority leader 
some of our republicans they know better than the 
leadership he grumbled 
dole complained that sponsors were trying to portray republicans 
as opposed to civil rights because they voted in large part against 
limiting debate he said gop senators wanted a civil rights bill 
but remained concerned about the quota issues and other features of 
the bill 
to have this rammed down our throats because it didnt please 
the senator from massachusetts it seems to me that were going 
to be in for a long hot summer dole said 
to drive home the notion that republicans did not want to stand 
in the way of civil rights dole brought a sudden stunned silence 
in the senate by offering to approve the measure immediately on a 
voice vote immediately 
now we have a chance to pass this historic legislation right 
now dole declared we can finish in 20 minutes 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine a proponent of the 
bill objected to three separate offers by dole to pass the measure 
immediately mitchell declared that senators who were scheduled to 
offer amendments under the 30hour time limit were entitled to a 
hearing on them 
but dole said the democratic reluctance to pass the bill 
immediately proved that it had some troublesome features that even 
proponents wanted out before they went home to explain the measure 
to voters 
now were told we cant vote because we have some fellas stuck 
out here on a limb and we need some cosmetic surgery dole said 
sen john c danforth rmo one of the republicans who 
supported limiting debate said he didnt believe that what we 
have just done furthers the cause of enacting this into law 
i am satisfied with the bill as is and i will vote for the 
bill as is but it is clear that this bill is not going to become 
law unless the president agrees to it danforth said 
republicans joining danforth in the vote to limit debate were 
james jeffords of vermont a cosponsor of the bill william cohen 
of maine david durenberger of minnesota mark hatfield of oregon 
john heinz and arlen specter of pennsylvania and bob packwood of 
oregon 
the one democrat to vote against limiting debate was james exon
