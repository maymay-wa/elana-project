president ranasinghe premadasa and 
four members of his cabinet met for the first time thursday with 
tamil rebels fighting for an independent nation and discussed ways 
to end the insurgency officials said 
also thursday officials said premadasa will help the top 
sinhalese militant leader go abroad for medical treatment a move 
which may pave the way for peace negotiations with the extremists 
the tamil rebellion and the resulting sinhalese backlash have 
claimed more than 12500 lives since 1983 and unleashed a wave of 
terror bombings and assassinations on this oncepeaceful island 
nation 
officials refused to reveal details of the meeting with the 
tamils which concluded for the day after a few hours 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said premadasa had received 
and approved a request from rohana wijeweera leader of the 
underground peoples liberation front to allow him to go abroad 
for medical treatment 
wijeweera 46 is believed to have suffered a heart attack 
recently 
the front is an ultranationalist sinhalese group which has been 
at the forefront of the antigovernment campaign launched in 1987 
to protest peace overtures made to tamil rebels 
the request from wijeweera was made through chris nuttal the 
british broadcasting corp correspondent in colombo 
nuttal said he received two telephone calls from a front member 
on thursday who said the group would be willing to hold talks with 
the government if wijeweera was allowed to receive medical 
treatment in london the request was conveyed to the government he 
said 
a government statement said premadasa had not directly been in 
touch with the front 
the front last month rejected premadasas offer of amnesty and 
seats in parliament if they gave up their campaign of 
assassinations and calling crippling industrial strikes an 
estimated 3500 people have been killed in the campaign the peace 
offer was accepted by tamil rebels and a fivemember team is 
currently holding talks with the government 
tamil insurgents launched a bloody rebellion in 1983 for an 
independent nation in the northern and eastern regions of the 
country where most tamils live 
an attempt by premadasas predecessor junius r jayewardene to 
end the rebellion by granting limited autonomy to the tamils ended 
in failure after the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest 
rebel militia rejected the plan after a brief acceptance 
the peace plan signed in july 1987 also sparked a backlash 
among nationalist sinhalese who said it gave too many concessions 
to the tamil minority 
the plan was sponsored by india and indian peacekeeping troops 
were later despatched to sri lanka to enforce an arms surrender by 
the tamils at least 800 indian soldiers have been killed in 
hitandrun attacks by the rebels since then 
the hindu tamils who comprise 18 percent of the countrys 16 
million people say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese 
majority in jobs and education 
sinhalese buddhists make up 75 percent of the population and 
control the government and the military

hundreds of american diplomatic and 
military families headed thursday to temporary haven on us 
military bases to avoid possible harassment by gen manuel antonio 
noriegas government 
the problem is regimedirected gangs such as the group that 
assaulted opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara and 
his two running mates on wednesday said terry kneebone a 
spokesman for the us embassy 
kneebone said there had been no direct threats against us 
personnel but that in the past the panamanian government has 
publicized the neighborhoods where americans live 
kneebone said he did not know if that was just propaganda but 
the people around wednesday were out of control 
us ambassador arthur davis announced that us diplomatic 
dependents would be moved to bases after the assault on endara and 
his two vice presidential candidates wednesday 
president bush anounced thursday that davis is being recalled 
that us personnel would be reduced and that both military and 
diplomatic dependents would be moved either to safe housing or out 
of the country 
the united states maintains 10 military installations in panama 
which is us military headquarters for latin america about 10000 
us soldiers are stationed in panama and bush said thursday he 
was sending 2000 more to protect the lives of american 
citizens 
kneebone said 105 us citizens work for the embassy and the 
moving order affected 57 spouses and 85 children 
the order does not affect 21300 american civilians not 
connected with the us government many of them retired 
leo leblanc from seattle said his daughters are away at 
college he was planning to put up three families in his three 
spare bedrooms at fort clayton 10 miles from panama city 
ive been in the service or with the service 25 years 
said leblanc a civilian army employee we take care of our own 
the kirberg family was one of the three leblanc was expecting 
they arrived at sunset unloaded their suitcases in a few minutes 
and looked at their new surroundings 
they said theyd had no trouble but theyd rather be safe 
the panamanians have always been friendly said emil 
kirberg who works for leblanc 
his wife judy boyle said she had been surprised by the call 
it was worse last year and we never had a problem she said 
the kirbergs said they put as much as they could into a few 
suitcases and left their dog with friends 
i tried to take things that meant something to me said 
boyle that included some pillows and a small chandelier 
once inside the gate leblanc said his wife had sped out to rent 
some videos 
i hope she gets some good ones he said i dont know how 
long this is going to go on 
the plan under which diplomatic dependents were moving thursday 
was designed for temporary security and embassy spokeswoman 
cynthia farrell said it was not known how bushs decisions would 
affect the immediate situation 
kneebone said everybody lives in a highrise apartment 
building for security reasons people cant see that youve moved 
as they could if you lived in a house 
its not like the joads moving from oklahoma to california 
you just pack a suitcase for four or five days get in your car and 
drive across town 
all was calm wednesday in one of the exclusive highrise 
neighborhoods where many diplomatic families live almost the only 
vehicle moving in the hot afternoon sun was a beer truck making a 
restaurant delivery 
some people with pets were boarding them out kneebone said but 
others planned to return home during the day to feed pets or pick 
up clean underwear 
panamanian employees of the embassy were concerned both about 
harassment and whether they would have jobs if the size of the 
staff was reduced 
we can do with very few americans here and that will probably 
create more work rather than less for the panamanians the 
spokesman said 
he said the military officials were in a more difficult 
situation because they had more dependents to deal with 
a spokesman for the us southern command said there are 10600 
military dependents in panama 972 of whom live off base 
southern command was operating under condition charlie 
meaning us personnel can go into public areas of panama only on 
official business and in civilian clothes 
kneebone said his family was in the united states because the 
current government had sent him a letter ordering him to leave the 
country 
since we dont recognize that government we opened the 
envelope photocopied it resealed it and stamped returned 
unopened on it he said 
he said he sent his family home because he thought the expulsion 
order and his refusal to obey it made him a target 
bush said us companies doing business in panama also should 
withdraw dependents among the larger companies with operations 
here are texaco and colgate 
a person who answered the telephone at the american chamber of 
commerce said the chamber could not express an opinion or give 
information because this is a political matter now

lawyers for house speaker jim wright sought 
wednesday to dismiss the most serious charges against him as the 
ethics committee moved to dig deeper into a texas gas investment 
that yielded huge profits for wright last year 
the ethics panel also denied a motion by the speakers lawyers 
to bar the special outside counsel in the case chicago lawyer 
richard phelan from holding private discussions with the 
committee but granted other motions seeking access to witnesses 
and documents said stephen d susman a lawyer for wright 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif strongly defended 
phelan against allegations from wrights camp that he has used 
faulty and weak reasoning in bringing charges against the speaker 
that is totally inaccurate totally wrong and an exercise in 
bad judgment by the respondents attorneys dixon told reporters 
at the same time the justice department said it would undertake 
an independent review of wrights business and political dealings 
if the house exonerates the speaker 
i expect the department will take an independent look david 
runkel chief spokesman for attorney general dick thornburgh said 
in response to a question at a press briefing 
he said such a review would cover matters brought up by the 
house ethics committee and other matters that have been raised 
such as wrights involvement in a 1985 political fundraising 
effort in texas 
we are going to keep an eye on allegations made about the 
conduct of the speaker runkel said but the spokesman added that 
its premature to say we are going to have any investigation 
asked if the department would investigate wright if the house 
disciplined the speaker runkel said the justice department has 
a different function than the house has and we are keeping tabs on 
that it would be premature to say what thats going to lead to 
in seeking to dismiss the most serious allegations against the 
speaker that he used bulk sales of his book to evade limits on 
outside earned income and improperly accepted 145000 in gifts 
from a person with a direct interest in legislation the lawyers 
charged the ethics committee is trying to hold wright to a new 
tougher standard 
the charges amount to a house of cards delicately balanced on 
a series of unprecedented reinterpretations of house rules they 
argued 
the eightlawyer defense team did not immediately challenge 
other charges that the speaker failed to report as gifts benefits 
he received from fort worth texas developer george mallick but 
signaled that that issue would be contested later 
on the matter of wrights gas investment dixon said the 
committee after a briefing on a series of interviews conducted 
last week decided that there were other witnesses who would have 
to be interviewed and directed phelan to continue investigating 
the investment involves a gas well in sabine lake near the 
texaslouisiana line which wright and mallick bought into for 
9120 last january they sold their interest less than five months 
later for a 340000 profit even though the wells production had 
dwindled 
the ethics panel also generally discussed a series of other 
allegations against wright raised in recent news stories but made 
no decisions on whether to formally expand the investigation to 
include those dixon said 
the new york times in its thursday editions reported that 
among the transactions that have come under scrutiny is wrights 
100000 investment in a texas nursing home company that later went 
bankrupt 
published reports have said wright was one of the few investors 
in jewell enterprises to receive payments from the company before 
it failed 
the companys president tr jewell is quoted in thursdays 
editions of the times as saying his company provided wright the 
money to pay interest on the 100000 bank loan wright used to buy 
his stock in 1983 jewell said he considered the money a loan 
and that similar loans were available to a few other stockholders 
jewell told the fort worth texas startelegram that wrights 
investment had no connection with any legislation before congress 
and that the company gained nothing by having the powerful 
congressman as one of its 28 investors 
we were regulated by the state there isnt anything he could 
have done to help us jewell told the startelegram 
among the areas the panel is looking into is a 1985 fundraising 
effort for a special congressional election in texas in which 
wright took an intense personal interest in testimony last week at 
a federal fraud trial in dallas wright was linked to a political 
action committee which collected allegedly illegal contributions 
from officials of commodore savings and loan an insolvent texas 
thrift 
on wednesday three former commodore employees testified they 
gave money to the east texas first pac and later were reimbursed by 
their company either through pay increases or checks for fictional 
travel 
former commodore president e morten hopkins his brother robert 
and john w harrell former commodore ceo and vice chairman of the 
board are being tried on charges they misused commodore funds to 
make illegal pac contributions 
east texas first raised and spent about 100000 to help rep 
jim chapman dtexas win a special election in 1985 a former 
commodore chief financial officer testified friday that his boss 
told him wright had agreed to halt legislation opposed by the 
savings and loan industry if the industry raised 250000 for the 
pac but wright denied making any such statement

the last brezhnev man on the politburo bends 
enough under the pressure of reform to stay in power but vladimir 
v shcherbitsky has not budged from his deepest convictions 
he was named ukranian communist party leader 17 years ago to 
crack down on nationalism in the industrial and agricultural 
heartland of the soviet union and he indicates nationalism is 
still one of his primary concerns 
nationalist ideas exist everywhere but we cannot allow people 
who stick to such absurdities to join perestroika he told the 
associated press 
at 71 shcherbitsky is the oldest of the 12 men on the ruling 
politburo and considered one of the most conservative except for 
reformist president mikhail s gorbachev himself he is the only 
one left dating back to the late soviet president leonid i 
brezhnev 
shcherbitsky a ukranian also is the only party leader of a 
republic gorbachev has not replaced since becoming general 
secretary in 1985 reformers complain that shcherbitsky is 
preventing gorbachevs changes from taking root in the ukraine a 
republic with a population of 50 million 
but shcherbitsky made clear in written responses to questions 
submitted by the associated press that he feels the earth moving 
under his feet 
one can see signs of renewal with the naked eye he wrote 
his aides said they could not recall shcherbitsky ever 
responding to a foreign journalists request for an interview the 
ukrainian leader refused however to take any followup questions 
either in writing or in person 
shcherbitsky is blamed by some for covering up the radiation 
damage done by the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion for 
restraining the local press and for arrests and harassment of 
dissidents whose political activities would be considered routine 
in the other european republics of the soviet union 
he denied the charges 
some groups attempt to use glasnost and the public rostrum for 
alien propaganda national egoism and even antisovietism he 
said 
schcherbitsky concedes the ukraine is suffering from accumulated 
problems such as severe pollution he said he responds to public 
opinion these days and as evidence he pointed to the scrapping of 
several nuclear power projects and a dam 
in recent months shcherbitsky has come under new pressures for 
change gorbachev has begun public criticism of the ukrainian 
leadership and several new reform groups have drawn thousands of 
people to public meetings six of his aides were defeated in their 
bids for additional positions of power in the recent election the 
first in which citizens voted in large numbers against the 
establishment 
i have to admit i have never run such an active and intensive 
election campaign shcherbitsky wrote of his successful bid for a 
seat in the new soviet parliament he got 74 percent of the vote in 
the dnepropetrovsk area his old power base 
the other 26 percent crossed his name off the ballot since there 
was no alternative candidate 
nine years ago shcherbitsky smashed the helsinki watch human 
rights group in the ukraine by arresting everyone who joined today 
those activists are out of prison and some campaigned for his 
defeat in the election some spent a few weeks in jail for their 
efforts 
the grassroots organizations have drawn thousands of people to 
meetings on ecology expanded use of the ukrainian language 
legalization of the ukrainian catholic church and exposing the 
crimes of stalin 
many of them shcherbitsky said dont understand that we need 
time technology and money to make changes 
he opposes the most general reform group the peoples movement 
of the ukraine accusing its leaders of ambition and nationalism 
that leads the way to permissiveness and national antagonism 
contradicting the interests of perestroika 
though none of the major reform groups in the ukraine is openly 
calling for independence that is a growing source of conflict in 
several smaller areas of the soviet union most recently 20 soviet 
georgians died in unrest after troops broke up a proindependence 
demonstration april 9 
ukrainian activist oles shevchenko says shcherbitsky remains in 
power because gorbachev needs him to clamp down on nationalism in 
the second most populous republic and because shcherbitsky voted 
for gorbachev to become the soviet leader in 1985 
shcherbitsky confirmed that i supported the election of 
mikhail sergeevich gorbachev as general secretary 
shcherbitsky said he has no principal disagreements with 
gorbachev despite creative discussions in kremlin meetings 
a lively friendly atmosphere has replaced artificial 
unanimity and that is a clear and eloquent sign of the times he 
wrote 
shcherbitsky sprinkled his comments with references to 
perestroika gorbachevs reform program he insisted the ukraine is 
pressing ahead with farm leasing glasnost and competitive 
elections all keystones of gorbachevs plan 
gorbachev is more blunt in his criticism of the ukrainian 
leaderships performance 
in a march party meeting gorbachev complained that billions of 
rubles poured into agriculture have been wasted a 320 percent 
increase in investment in the ukraine has bought only a 39 percent 
rise in output in two decades he said 
but shcherbitsky denied soviet news reports that gorbachev 
ordered ukrainian party leaders to pay more attention to 
democratization and to work with progressive ukrainian writers 
pressing for reform 
gorbachev never raised this question shcherbitsky said 
he did acknowledge however that the communist party chief 
expressed some critical remarks and offered advice which we are 
considering 
shcherbitsky refused to comment on his reputation as a 
conservative opponent of domestic reforms but emphasized that 
changes must be carefully monitored 
after all perestroika is harmed by sluggishness and stomping 
in one place as well as by impulsive jumps and overreactions he 
wrote

for two months residents of beirut have spent 
much of their lives in bunkers and basements because of fierce 
artillery battles between christians and moslems here is a report 
on 10 hours in the life of one moslem family 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the munaymneh family and their neighbors 
tumbled into the underground shelter in their apartment block when 
a 155mm howitzer shell exploded in the street signaling another 
round of fierce artillery battles in beirut 
this is only the beginning moaned soumayya munaymneh 35 
as she shepherded her two sons amer 12 and samer 14 down the 
stairs on tuesday will it ever stop 
most of the six families have spent most of the last two months 
cooped up in the makeshift 33footby19foot shelter in the 
basement of the sixstory block in the bourj abuhaidar district of 
moslem west beirut 
the fierce artillery rocket and tank battles that have raged 
between army commander gen michel aouns mainly christian forces 
and an alliance of syrian soldiers and moslem druse militiamen have 
reached an intensity unprecedented in lebanons 14yearold civil 
war 
some days as many as 25000 shells and rockets are fired by 
both sides 
mrs munaymneh clutched two bottles of drinking water her 
husband rafik and the boys carried chairs blankets and 
mattresses 
dont forget anything because we wont be able to come up and 
get it mrs munaymneh told the boys 
life for christians and moslems alike has become an endless 
cycle of waiting out the bombardments huddled in stuffy shelters or 
basement parking lots then foraging for food and water or patching 
up their damaged homes and businesses during the lulls nervously 
listening for the first thud of shellfire that heralds another 
barrage 
there were 18 people in the shelter they slipped into the 
routine of life underground while exploding shells and artillery 
guns thundered above them 
the men lighted kerosene lanterns and huddled to talk politics 
the women spread out mattresses in the sleeping corner and food 
supplies in the part of the shelter mrs munaymneh called the 
dining room the area around a small cooker used to fix tea or 
coffee or to heat canned food 
the children played cards but everyone was tense as the 
explosions shook the shelter 
the munaymnehs who are sunni moslems have missed much of the 
recent shelling because like thousands of other beirutis they 
fled the city 
rafik munaymneh a 52yearold shipping agent took his family 
to damascus syria he brought them back to beirut on april 30 one 
day after arab foreign ministers called for a ceasefire in lebanon 
we thought it was over after the arabs announced the 
ceasefire and we came back because the kids school said it was 
resuming classes munaymneh said 
obviously it was the wrong decision he said 
as the shells exploded the children argued about the caliber 
and direction of the rounds 
thats an outgoing tank shell samer said when a 
particularly loud blast thundered above i bet its that tank on 
the corner 
munaymneh grumbled that tanks inviting trouble the 
christians will start shooting at it 
a few minutes later five arillery rounds hit the neighborhood 
one near the entrance to the apartment building 
oh allah have mercy on us one of the 10 women yelled the 
children screamed 
silence silence munaymneh shouted 
were all ok thank god the shell didnt damage the 
shelter he said 
his wife and some of the other women recited verses from the 
koran islams holy book 
the whispered prayers were drowned out by a flurry of news 
flashes on the halfdozen transistor radios all tuned to different 
christian and moslem stations reporting on which districts were 
getting pounded by aouns usmade howitzers 
the radios the families only link to the outside world are 
kept on all the time 
is anyone talking about a new ceasefire one of the women 
asked her voice trembling 
no one bothered to answer her there have been dozens of 
ceasefires in the last two months none lasted very long 
the intensity of the barrage eased around midnight and najwa 
quoraitem ran up to her familys thirdfloor apartment to bring 
down some manakeesh lebanese pizza made with thyme 
you have to eat to survive that is if the shells dont get 
us she murmured as she passed out the manakeesh another woman 
served tea 
the barrage eased near dawn and the children fell asleep the 
men took turns to go upstairs to check their apartments 
the building next door took several direct hits munaymneh 
said when he came back some people were wounded well find out 
exactly what happened later 
at daybreak the families left the shelter to return to their 
apartments 
no one knew when the shelling would resume only that it would 
the munaymnehs packed and headed back to damascus their 
neighbors prepared to spend another night underground

is made of hightech materials including mylar and tedlar it 
weighs about 12750 pounds including the radar package of about 
3500 pounds customs officials have said

next month 
conroy said the aerostat at deming has an overlapping range over 
the area covered by the damaged device that combined with 
military radar customs airborne and ground radar and air traffic 
control radar will make up for that on the downed balloon

successful tracking of several small aircraft carrying narcotics 
being smuggled into the united states from mexico but critics have 
labeled the balloon a white elephant

the government flew western reporters to 
jalalabad for their first visit to the city since a guerrilla siege 
began march 7 here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the army says it has driven 
guerrillas away from jalalabad ending a nineweek siege and on 
wednesday the shelling had stopped in the 16th century city of 
gardens built by the moguls 
children played in open spaces bright with lilacs 
afghan soldiers advanced up to 25 miles along two fronts in an 
offensive begun sunday against moslem insurgents surrounding the 
city their commanders said 
as you can see jalalabad is alive said lt gen manok 
mangall chairman of the defense council and governor of nangarhar 
province 
leaders of the mujahedeen the holy warriors who have fought 
for more than a decade denied army claims of ending the siege 
retaking the samarkhel garrison and controlling half the road to 
the pakistan border town of torkham 
mohammad nabi mohammadi defense minister of the guerrillas 
exile government told reporters in pakistan its a total lie 
baseless propaganda the siege of jalalabad continues samarkhel 
continues to be in the hands of mujahedeen who also control the 
jalalabadtorkham road 
president najibs government flew 13 western journalists to 
jalalabad to prove it controls the strategic provincial capital 75 
miles east of kabul 
jalalabad once known for magnificent gardens orchards and 
palaces has been under guerrilla siege since march 7 military 
officials said the city 45 miles from pakistan had been pounded 
by 131000 rockets and artillery and mortar shells 
it lies near the khyber pass astride the trade routes to india 
and pakistan dominating the entrances to the laghman and kunar 
valleys the modern city was built in the 16th century by akbar 
grandson of babur who founded the mogul empire of india 
army officials said at least 523 civilians had been killed and 
3000 wounded during the siege they said most of the casualties 
occurred in the first weeks of the first major guerrilla offensive 
since soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from 
afghanistan on feb 15 
doctors at nangarhar hospital said nearly all the casualties 
were caused by rockets or shells 
we dont even have one patient with a bullet injury said 
dr hafizullah director of the 260bed hospital 
commanders of the guerrillas who began fighting after a 
communist coup in april 1978 had predicted at the onset of their 
offensive that jalalabad would fall within days 
they had hoped to set up their interim government in the city as 
a basis for international recognition as an alternative to najibs 
regime in kabul the rebels are based in pakistan and receive much 
of their support from the united states 
reports from both sides have said jalalabad was in ruins with 
nearly all the mudandbrick buildings damaged or destroyed and the 
remaining residents hiding in ditches or basements 
the scene in the dusty rutted streets wednesday suggested 
otherwise 
most buildings had been damaged by shellfire but remained 
standing although shops generally were boarded shut the city had 
electricity running water and working telephones 
farmers worked in fields on the outskirts harvesting their 
wheat and planting rice lilacs and wild flowers were in bloom and 
the city had an abundance of palm trees and small orchards 
children played in the sun and their elders moved about the city 
on bicycles and in horsedrawn carts sharing the road with tanks 
military jeeps and armored personnel carriers 
some neighborhoods were like ghost towns however more than 
64000 people lived in jalalabad when the civil war began but many 
fled to kabul or to refugee camps in pakistan 
no count of how many remain is available but some said they 
will never leave despite hardship and war 
what would we do where would we go asked bhargar singh a 
70yearold doctor living in a sikh temple he said rockets had hit 
it five times killing 24 people and wounding at least 100 
early in the battle for jalalabad the army surrendered key 
garrisons around the city and the guerrillas came within about six 
miles of the airport which was hit by thousands of rockets the 
runway was damaged a cargo building leveled and the windows of the 
control tower knocked out 
if its necessary planes can land but i dont remember when 
the last one landed said lt col jehangi 42 the airport 
commander 
military officials have not said how many soldiers have been 
deployed in and around jalalabad but estimates run as high as 
30000 nearly double that number of guerrillas were believed to 
surround the city at one time 
when soviet troops left afghanistan after nine years of 
involvement in the war there were predictions that afghanistans 
conscript army would collapse 
col gen mohammad delawar army commander for the area said of 
guerrilla claims of quick victory in jalalabad and the long siege 
that followed theres an old afghan proverb when a man digs a 
well he usually falls in

and safety service reminds his officers they work under the eyes 
of diplomats and countless tourists and must observe proper 
military decorum 
among admonitions in his memorandum obtained wednesday 
smoking and chewing gum are forbidden while in uniform 
carrying of bags packages or other items while in uniform does 
not create a good image and is not permitted 
leaning against walls or door jambs also out 
guards with hands in pockets or thumbs hooked in belts look 
either lackadaisical or aggressive or both all members of the 
service must refrain from so doing 
regarding saluting oconnell wrote there is an unacceptable 
lack of uniformity in this area members of the service at the 
rank of inspector and above will be saluted 
guards routinely salute secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar as their commander but correspondents observed an outbreak 
of saluting since oconnells memo began circulating on friday

the ford foundation saying the us social 
welfare system is out of date has recommended comprehensive 
changes that include treatment on demand for drug and alcohol 
problems 
the ford report entitled the common good social welfare and 
the american future concedes that many of its recommendations 
face uphill political and monetary battles 
the report was scheduled for release thursday in washington dc 
details were reported in thursday editions of the new york times 
and the washington post 
the times said the ford proposals would cost 29 billion beyond 
the 500 billion the federal government spends on social programs 
the report recommended a tremendous expansion of the head start 
program to reach 900000 more 3 and 4yearolds and that the 
government pay for longterm care for the elderly 
the proposals would also cost the private sector an estimated 
10 billion for employers to extend health insurance coverage for 
workers 
the panel recommended paying for the additional programs by 
taxing social security benefits such a tax would raise more than 
half of the 29 billion annual cost of the recommended programs 
the report said 
the 3 million study was prepared by an 11member panel of 
business civic labor and civil rights leaders and educators 
we are on the right track calling attention to the countrys 
social deficit said irving s shapiro chairman of the panel and 
former chief executive of the du pont company we know we have a 
hell of a fight ahead arousing people to do what needs to be done 
one of the most ambitious proposals advocated by the panel is to 
provide drug and alcohol treatment on demand at an estimated 1 
billion per year 
it also called for expanding a food program women infants and 
children which now reaches half of the 65 million to 75 million 
people who are eligible

those summer days spent soaking up the rays to 
create a glorious tan may come back to haunt sun worshippers with 
cancer and aged wrinkled skin a panel of experts said 
a national institutes of health consensus committee on wednesday 
said current health studies show that suntans can lead to skin 
cancer a weakened immune system and skin that wrinkles and ages 
before its time 
instead of uncovering to bathe in the noontime sun the panel 
recommended americans avoid the midday hours of sunlight wear 
shading clothes and apply generous amounts of sunscreen lotions 
children in particular should be protected from overexposure to 
sunlight because skin damaged early in life is more likely to 
develop cancer later the panel said in a report 
all forms of tanning are potentially hazardous to the skin 
said david bickers head of the panel and chairman of the 
dermatology department at case western reserve university in 
cleveland tanning is visible evidence of injury to the skin 
larry a schachner of the university of miami paraphrased noel 
coward to note only mad dogs and englishmen go out in midday 
sun there are no healthy tans 
bickers said the panel recommended that 
everyone avoid direct exposure to sunlight particularly during 
the hours of 10 am to 3 pm when the ultraviolet rays coming 
from the sun are the strongest 
people exposed to sunlight should wear sunscreen lotion with a 
rating of 15 based on protection from ultraviolet b solar 
radiation the panel said ultraviolet a radiation also is 
hazardous though much less so and lotions that protect against 
both types of uv are best bickers said the panel found that 
lotions with a protection rating of 15 will assure that virtually 
everyone would get sufficient protection from the sun and that 
there is no evidence lotions with higher ratings provide additional 
protection 
tanning parlors should be avoided the panel consensus is to 
recommend against the use of tanning parlors for cosmetic 
purposes said bickers people who do use tanning parlors should 
wear goggles to protect their eyes and should be aware that tanning 
lamps can damage the skin and cause adverse reactions in people 
taking antibiotics hypertensive or antiinflammatory drugs the 
panel said 
though some people react adversely to chemicals contained in 
lotion sunscreens the panel said the riskbenefit ratio favors 
the use of such lotions for people who must be exposed to the sun 
said bickers individuals in the sunbelt should use sunscreens on 
a daily basis 
special precautions should be taken to protect children from 
damaging exposures to sunlight schachner an expert on childrens 
skin said that schools and day care centers should schedule 
outdoor recesses to avoid midday exposure to the sun he also said 
that outdoor play or lunch areas should be shaded 
damaging exposure to sunlight particularly early in life can 
lead directly to development of two types of common skin cancer 
and there is a suggestion that sunlight may play a role in 
development of maglignant melanoma an unusually vicious type of 
skin cancer 
though retina and other vitamin abased compounds are widely 
used to treat the wrinkles in sundamaged skin bickers said the 
panel found there was insufficient scientific evidence about the 
longterm safety of such products 
a 1978 study showed that about half a million people annually 
develop the common forms of skin cancer said bickers but reports 
from skin doctors indicate it is highly likely that there is an 
increasing number of cases of nonmelanoma cancers 
he said chemicals are thought to be eroding the ozone layer of 
the stratosphere thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach 
the earths surface and bickers said the panels research showed 
there are about 20000 tanning salons in the united states which 
are visited by an estimated one million customers both of these 
factors he said may be leading to increasing cases of skin 
cancers 
the panel released the recommendations after reviewing studies 
and hearing testimony over a threeday period the panel included 
14 skin and cancer experts from nine states

a coalition aimed at improving the quality of 
science math and technology education today recommended president 
bush form a white house task force on those subjects to develop a 
national policy 
the nonprofit triangle coalition for science and technology 
education also said the federal government should spend an extra 
304 million in fiscal 1990 rising to 465 million in 1993 to 
promote elementary science math and technology education 
improvements 
the proposed presidential task force would develop a national 
policy coordinate federal programs and plan a white house 
conference on science mathematics and technology education for 
the year 2000 
we have made a special effort to emphasize programs that do 
not require significant new funds said the report released by 
the coalition of 80 business labor science and education groups 
however the very magnitude of the challenge the nation faces 
will call for some new programs and new resources 
the action plan designed to help congress and the president 
develop a national policy on science education states that 
increased investments in elementary education must be the 
nations number one priority 
specifically it suggests that the government start a 50 
million grant program to help elementary schools pay for new 
science equipment and earmark another 50 million to encourage 
innovative approaches to science teaching 
the group would also give the national science foundation an 
extra 50 million to expand its inservice and preservice training 
programs for elementary teachers 
other recommendations would require less money or none at all 
among them 
revamp the science curriculum to tailor it to students of 
different ages interests and backgrounds a project that should be 
led by the national science foundation 
increase federal support for graduate training in the sciences 
and engineering with special support to women and minorities 
give clear instructions to schools receiving money under 
federal school improvement programs totaling more than 1 billion 
a year that their first priority must be science math and 
technology education activities 
reserve 5 percent of the nearly 9 billion the federal 
government spends on student loans grants and scholarships for 
special programs aimed at attracting and retaining math science 
and technology teachers at all academic levels 
establish new federal incentives to encourage better teacher 
training 
implement more stringent state requirements for science 
teachers 
offer salary incentives for excellence in science and math 
teaching and strengthened continuing education requirements in the 
science area for elementary and secondary teachers 
the triangle proposals are a followup to an earlier report that 
called for a sharply focused science education strategy 
the group is affiliated with the national science teachers 
association organizations represented by its officers include the 
national education association the american federation of 
teachers ei du pont amoco corp the united auto workers union 
the acoustical society of america general electric co the edison 
electric institute the american chemical society and various 
universities and state education groups

president bush has been declared in sound 
health and advised to keep up the exercise regimen his physician 
says helps keep him fit 
although bush emerged from bethesda naval medical center on 
wednesday with an adhesive bandage on a finger he was pronounced 
in excellent health by his personal physician dr burton lee 
after his first fullscale medical checkup as chief executive 
the bandage covered a cyst that was treated and which lee said 
is not a medical problem 
president bush is in extremely sound physical condition lee 
said in a statement issued by the white house he keeps fit 
through a number of physical activities which we recommend he 
continue on a regular basis 
lee led a team of physicians including an ophthalmologist a 
urologist a dermatologist and two allergists that conducted the 
threehour examination 
the statement said a sebaceous cyst on bushs middle right 
finger was drained the president is wearing a bandaid on the 
finger which he can remove within the next few hours lee said 
this cyst has been present for many years and does not present a 
medical problem 
a sebaceous cyst is a benign growth on the skin that is often 
removed surgically 
bush is an avid jogger plays tennis pitches horseshoes 
occasionally swims and uses a stationary bicycle and indoor 
treadmill 
the white house statement said a chest xray an 
electrocardiogram blood samples and a urinalysis all showed normal 
results 
other xrays showed mild degenerative arthritis of the hip that 
condition has been present for several years the statement 
said 
bush has said the arthritis has forced him in recent years to 
cut down on his jogging 
bush takes medication because of a severe allergy to bee stings 
and to control hay fever wednesdays medical statement said 
allergy tests showed excellent protective antibody levels 
the white house did not make immediately available statistics 
from the examination such as bushs cholesterol count and blood 
pressure however deputy press secretary stephen hart said some 
additional data might be released later 
hart said wednesdays examination showed no major changes from 
the results of last years tests which showed bushs cholesterol 
count at 192 considered in the desirable range by the american 
heart association his blood pressure then was a normal 10884 
more complete information was released from the may 1988 test 
when bush was a presidential candidate 
bush himself displayed his pleasure with the results of the 
physical by grinning and flashing giving a double thumbsup sign

a us international trade commission study 
helps document the claim by a manufacturers group that steel 
import quotas have harmed the us economy the group says 
the itc said in a report wednesday that steel import restraints 
have reduced american export sales by raising steel prices 
the 96page report by the independent government agency was 
certain to enliven the debate over whether the us should continue 
steel quota agreements with 19 nations and the european community 
the reagan administration negotiated fiveyear 
productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements or vras in 
1984 with japan south korea brazil south africa and other 
nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the united states 
president bush has pledged to continue the restraints in some 
form beyond their sept 30 expiration date but with the steel 
industry newly profitable opponents of the curbs believe they can 
make a case for ending the program or at least narrowing its scope 
the itc said in the report that the curbs caused steel prices in 
the united states to rise by as much as 06 percent in 1985 16 
percent in 1986 14 percent in 1987 and 02 percent in 1988 it 
said the weakening of the dollar overseas and other factors also 
contributed significantly to further price hikes 
as a result of the vrainduced price increases the commission 
estimated american exports in steelconsuming industries decreased 
by 258 million in 1985 673 million in 1986 699 million in 1987 
and 95 million in 1988 
it makes no sense to renew a program that causes such harm to 
american competitiveness particularly when the steel industry is 
healthy said jon jenson spokesman for a coalition of more than 
300 manufacturers opposed to the import curbs extension 
applauding the reports conclusions jenson said american 
manufacturers have been hamstrung by higher steel prices 
the report said recent steel price hikes have been distributed 
unevenly among categories of customers 
price increases were not as great for large steel purchasers as 
for small ones apparently because the larger purchasers buy a 
great deal of their steel through longterm contracts with prices 
set in advance the itc said 
the question of whether the restraints have caused steel price 
increases has divided american manufacturers 
last month a coalition of 374 manufacturers led by chrysler 
corp maytag corp and others was formed to lobby for continuing 
the quota agreements on grounds that the curbs have helped make the 
steel industry healthier 
that coalition contends steel price increases have been caused 
by strong worldwide demand and shifting exchange rates 
the itc cautioned the figures reflected an upward bias 
because of the procedures it used that means the effect of the 
import restraints on prices might have been overstated 
the study was conducted at the request of the house ways and 
means subcommittee on trade

us armed forces are quietly forging ahead 
with plans to phase out their bases along the panama canal despite 
threats in washington of american military intervention following 
this weeks allegedly fraudulent election 
in all this hubbub we are doing our job maj kathy wood a 
pentagon spokeswoman said wednesday the 10000 or so troops and 
the 14000 dependents however were put on a heightened alert 
urging them to stay close to home following violent 
demonstrations in downtown panama city 
col robert donnelly deputy public affairs director for the 
us southern command in panama described the measure as a 
precaution adding its business as usual as far as the 
units go 
the american personnel are based at 10 military installations 
along the 50mile long panama canal which cuts a swath through the 
isthmus to join the atlantic and pacific oceans their mission 
mandated by the 1977 panama canal treaties is twofold to protect 
the waterway but to prepare to turn that job over to the 
panamanians on dec 31 1999 a socalled neutrality treaty 
however provides an openended american military presence to 
guarantee the permanent neutrality and operation of the canal 
alleged election fraud by panamas de facto ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega sparked new waves of internal discontent and 
renewed speculation at home the united states would send in 
military reinforcements some in congress have suggested outright 
intervention to topple noriegas regime although bush 
administration sources have described that as unlikely 
wood asked about possible plans to send added american troops 
said i cant speak with regard to future military activities 
but a military source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said as i understand it that is not being given serious 
consideration 
the united states has not recognized noriegas government since 
last year shortly after he was indicted on federal drug 
trafficking charges 
american military personnel in panama for the past year have 
been the targets of harassment reportedly by noriegas defense 
forces troops on wednesday for example five us military 
personnel were detained 
noriega frequently accuses the united states of attempting to 
renege on turning over the canal and on getting the troops out 
the pentagon however is making plans to move the us southern 
command which manages american military operations south of mexico 
to the tip of south america the tropical whitewashed buildings 
will be transferred to the panamanians no later than the end of the 
century 
theres nothing to preclude a move before then wood said 
seven sites for the southern command have been announced and a 
decision could come by the end of july the spokeswoman said under 
consideration are macdill air force base near tampa fla patrick 
air force base near cocoa beach fla fort polk near leesville 
la england air force base near baton rouge la the naval air 
station in new orleans brooks air force base and fort sam houston 
both in san antonio texas 
american troops have been based in panama since shortly after 
the nations independence from colombia in 1903 peaking during 
world war ii when some 67000 military personnel were there 
despite its stated mission to protect the canal the us military 
has used panama to garner intelligence on the sandinista government 
in nicaragua and the leftist guerrillas fighting in el salvador 
when the panama canal treaties went into effect on oct 1 1979 
the american military began turning over its territory and property 
bases turned over the panamanian defense forces so far include 
fort amador and albrook army air field both near panama city more 
than 125 military homes in the former canal zone and fort gulick

immigration reforms have created a 
vulnerable underclass living in the shadows of our communities 
immigration rights activists told a house panel 
thousands of undocumented aliens who do not qualify for amnesty 
are being forced into a fearful underground and impoverished 
existence said muriel heiberger executive director of the 
massachusetts immigrant and refugee advocacy coalition 
the immigration reform and control act of 1986 act allowed 
undocumented aliens who could show they entered the united states 
before 1982 to apply for amnesty and prohibited employers from 
hiring undocumented aliens 
but witnesses told the house judiciary subcommittee on 
immigration refugees and international law the law has left many 
harshly exploited and with nowhere to turn 
as the undocumented are forced further underground the 
immigration law is creating everything it was supposed to eliminate 
a vulnerable underclass living in the shadows of our 
communities facing increased poverty and exploitation ms 
heiberger testified 
unscrupulous employers often exploit undocumented workers 
fearful of reporting subminimum wages sexual harassment and unsafe 
working conditions she said 
muzaffar a chishti director of the immigration project for the 
international ladies garment workers union said the law has had 
a deep impact on the socalled sweatshop sector employers are 
finding it easier to exploit these workers and further depress 
wages and working conditions she said 
ins spokesman verne jervis countered that those who dont 
qualify for amnesty do not have to remain in the united states 
jervis said the law was not intended to benefit the most 
recent arrivals the law is doing what it intended to do by 
keeping undocumented aliens out of the work force 
cecilia munoz of the national council of la raza testified that 
spouses and children of legalized family members have had 
deportation proceedings initiated against them in chicago dallas 
oklahoma city albuquerque san antonio and elsewhere 
jervis called that charge ridiculous

the electoral tribunal nullified the 
election late wednesday after paramilitary forces beat the 
opposition presidential and vice presidential candidates with pipes 
and baseball bats as soldiers stood by 
both sides had claimed victory in sundays balloting which 
international observers and the opposition claimed were rigged by 
forces loyal to strongman gen manuel antonio noriega who heads 
the 15000strong defense forces 
the elections of may 7 1989 are declared annulled in their 
entirety yolanda pulice de rodriguez head of the electoral 
tribunal said in a nationwide broadcast constant vote stealing 
at the polls vote buying and missing tally sheets made 
proclamation of a new president impossible 
she said the outcome of the elections was altered by the 
obstructionist action by the many foreigners called in by foreign 
or domestic political forces without invitation 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega for more than 
a year and president bush charging that noriegas forces planned 
to fix the elections had sent an uninvited us delegation 
us ambassador arthur davis condemned the attack on the 
candidates and said dependents of the 12000 military and 
diplomatic personnel in panama who live offbase would be moving to 
military bases thursday 
by this action noriega has demonstrated his contempt for the 
panamanian people he said 
after the election was declared null the city went quiet as 
truckloads of soldiers moved into the streets the soldiers 
searched any vehicle that moved as the trucks dropped squads off 
throughout the city 
calls to opposition leaders found none at home 
the government meanwhile said nothing about rescheduling the 
election 
while the white house and state department had no immediate 
comment terry kneebone a us embassy spokesman in panama city 
said it makes it worse 
noriega has closed out his options he added 
earlier wednesday supporters of noriega panamas de facto 
leader since 1983 beat opposition presidential candidate guillermo 
endara and his two running mates with iron bars and bats as he led 
protesters alleging electoral fraud 
soldiers made no attempt to intervene during the attack in 
which endara suffered a gash in the head that required eight 
stitches 
officials said one of endaras bodyguards was killed and four 
soldiers were wounded in a gunfight witnesses said some of the 
candidates bodyguards leaped out of cars and fired at the 
attackers 
later wednesday endara was taken from his campaign headquarters 
on a stretcher after a second attack the new york times reported 
endara had difficulty walking and his speech was slurred his 
doctor said the left side of his body was partly paralyzed 
paitilla hospital early thursday denied endara was being treated 
there 
endaras two vicepresidential candidates guillermo ford and 
ricardo arias calderon were bloodied but not injured as seriously 
news reports said scores of others were injured 
the three candidates were leading a motorcade through the 
capital when they were attacked by civilians wearing red dignity 
battalion tshirts and wielding an assortment of sticks bats 
pipes and rubber whips 
armed civilian noriega supporters often members of paramilitary 
dignity battalions have frequently taken part in breaking up 
opposition demonstrations 
they beat me in the head with an iron bar said endara in a 
brief hospital interview i saw arias on the ground with me he 
said referring to his first vice presidential candidate 
arias calderon told the associated press that ford had been 
arrested and taken to an undetermined location 
the incident took place at a defense forces blockade and 
opposition bodyguards shot four soldiers said defense forces 
spokesman capt eduardo lim yueng he said a second lieutenant was 
critically injured 
davis said one of endaras bodyguards was killed 
it was the first time soldiers suffered gunshot wounds since 
noriega came to power in this nation of 22 million 
endara sitting in a wheelchair displayed the stitches doctors 
put in the top of his head 
i blame noriega for everything bad that has happened in the 
republic of panama i hope he leaves soon he said 
angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in the 
downtown area police broke up scattered groups of demonstrators 
with tear gas and gunshots fired in the air 
the motorcade was part of an opposition campaign to gain 
international support and prevent an official victory proclamation 
in favor of noriegas handpicked candidate carlos duque 
duque was ahead by a 21 ratio in the secretive official count 
of the estimated 800000 votes cast sunday 
more than 300 observers including europeans the us 
delegation as well as former president jimmy carter called the 
election fraudulent and said endara actually won by a 3to1 margin 
the tv announcer repeated government accusations that the 
opposition is trying to help the united states abrogate the panama 
canal treaties under which panama gains control of the canal on 
dec 31 1999 
the us southern command had told its personnel to stay out of 
public places unless on official business and then to appear only 
in civilian clothes 
davis said five members of the us armed forces were detained 
three of them reservists who were quickly released he said he 
expected the other two to be released shortly and that they were 
being treated well 
uspanama relations have been poor since noriega orchestrated 
president eric delvalles ouster in february 1988 and the cia 
reportedly contributed 10 million to the opposition campaign 
delvalle was replaced by the acting president manuel solis palma 
delvalle tried to fire the general after he was indicted in 
florida on drugsmuggling and moneylaundering charges but the 
noriegadominated national assembly removed him from office 
noriega claims the us charges are a smokescreen to keep the canal

some doctors are warning that longterm daily use 
of a common aspirin substitute may triple the usual risk of kidney 
damage but the maker of tylenol disputed the finding 
i dont want people to panic and say my kids shouldnt have 
tylenol said dr saulo klahr president of the national kidney 
foundation but at the same time its important for people not 
to take this drug daily 
klahr said acetaminophen the main ingredient in tylenol 
anacin3 datril and other brands may accumulate in the kidneys 
and cause chemical damage a related painkiller called phenacetin 
was taken off the market six years ago because of concern about 
kidney damage and bladder cancer 
some experts also have worried that prolonged daily use of 
ibuprofen another common painkiller may harm the kidneys the 
drug was released for nonprescription sales in 1985 and was not 
included in the study of acetaminophen 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
found no sign that aspirin is bad for the kidneys however it can 
cause stomach irritation and bleeding and perhaps a rare childhood 
disorder called reyes syndrome 
the new research found that acetaminophen is safe when used 
occasionally and while it raises the possibility that overuse 
harms the kidneys it does not prove this 
acetaminophen is not necessarily risk free said dr dale p 
sandler who directed the national institute of environmental 
health science study 
this study does not demonstrate any effect for acetaminophen 
when taken as directed which is when needed for symptoms but when 
symptoms persist you should seek medical advice 
in a journal editorial drs william m bennett of oregon health 
sciences university and marc e debroe of the university of antwerp 
in belgium cautioned that this finding should be considered 
tentative until it is confirmed by other studies 
dr vardamen m buckalew jr of bowman gray school of medicine 
a coauthor of the study commented i would be swayed toward 
believing there is a cause and effect relationship between heavy 
acetaminophen ingestion and renal kidney disease but i would 
agree with anyone who says we need to do more work 
the study compared 554 people in north carolina who had newly 
diagnosed kidney disease with 516 randomly chosen adults it found 
the people who took the medicine daily for an extended period had 
three times the risk of kidney disease than occasional users 
acetaminophen accounts for 37 percent of the nations 25 
billion annual overthecounter sales of pain pills according to 
the consulting firm kline amp co aspirin represents about 43 percent 
and ibuprofen 20 percent 
according to kline 71 percent of the acetaminophen sold in the 
united states is tylenol which is made by johnson amp johnson 
a spokesman for the company said the study was flawed in part 
because it often relied on relatives of kidney patients to 
determine their use of acetaminophen and other painkillers 
the study in question provides no basis to suggest that the 
use of acetaminophen is associated with kidney disease spokesman 
edwin c watson said in a statement 
at whitehall laboratories which makes anacin3 spokeswoman 
carol emerling said the article says it deserves further 
scrutiny from the scientific community and we will be interested 
in following the results of that further scrutiny 
high blood pressure and diabetes are major underlying causes of 
kidney disease sandler said that even if acetaminophen does prove 
harmful it is probably less significant than those causes 
how much kidney disease is explained by this sandler said 
a small but not inconsequential amount the importance is knowing 
that there is a risk that is preventable whereas there is not much 
we can do about kidney disease associated with diabetes

a man who rented a house to an unmarried 
couple and then changed his mind because he believed they were not 
showing respect for christian values is getting support from across 
the country 
i just couldnt allow that type of activity to go on in our 
house said carpenter layle french 33 who reneged on an 
agreement that would have allowed sue jenson and her fiance to move 
into a house he was trying to sell 
a minnesota administrative law judge ruled in march that french 
violated a law that prohibits discrimination based on marital 
status he said the only unsettled issue is how much french should 
pay in damages 
french a member of the marshall evangelical free church 
contends the law should take a back seat to his christian values 
aside from that he maintains that couples who live together 
violate the states fornication law 
we go back to a very scary time if we say landlords get to 
pick the religion of tenants said state human rights 
commissioner steven cooper 
although there is some support for the 27yearold ms jenson 
most of this politically conservative town of 10000 residents seem 
to back french 
if people want to live together thats their business but 
then they should rent from someone who doesnt care said bob 
cool who owns an office supply store 
i look at the case as a morality case said lionel bolden 
another businessman in this town 150 miles west of minneapolis 
layle in essence would be responsible for what goes on in that 
place 
its really a paradox said attorney james anderson who 
organized a nonprofit corporation that has raised about 1300 for 
frenchs appeal the state is coming after layle for upholding a 
statute 
about 200 people attended a rally for french last month and 
petitions and letters of encouragement have streamed in from around 
the country including one from a group of about 40 orthodox jews 
in new york city anderson said about 300 people have made 1 
contributions to frenchs legal fund he said 
as the matter works its way through the courts i think were 
going to prevail anderson said 
french agreed on feb 22 1988 to rent to jenson who told him 
what her living arrangements would be french changed his mind two 
days later and paid a refund 
i didnt feel good about it but i initially took the money 
anyway french said my biggest toughest thing was to go back 
on my word 
not knowing that jenson complained to the state human rights 
department french said he forgot the transaction until the 
department wrote him in may 1988 requesting an unspecified amount 
of money to pay for jensons damages 
to me it was like they were asking for a payoff french said 
jenson who has since married her fiance said she is proud of 
the state and angry that french is publicizing the case as a moral 
quandary 
what mr french did was against the law she said he 
broke a contract this isnt about religion

sixtyfive years after the soviet 
union first tried to gain membership the pen international 
writers association has accepted a russian and a lithuanian 
chapter 
members of the 10000strong pen whose charter speaks out 
strongly against censorship voted unanimously wednesday to admit 
the two groups 
we have at last obtained something we have been fighting for 
for decades the great russian literature with its great 
traditions is finally among us said the groups 
international secretary alexandre blokh 
the association also criticized turkey czechoslovakia and seven 
other nations for imprisoning literary figures and journalists 
including a founder of the charter 77 czechoslovak human rights 
group playwright vaclav havel 
soviet participation has been an issue ever since pen poets 
playwrights editors essayists and novelists turned down an 
application by the soviet state in 1924 three years after pen was 
founded 
pen had kept out the soviet union because of its persecution of 
writers and other intellectuals and moscow had regarded the 
authors group as anticommunist 
the approval of the two chapters in the soviet union clears the 
way for the opening of up to four more pen chapters there 
including latvian and estonian chapters operating in exile said 
pens outgoing chairman francis king 
in a speech made before the vote soviet novelist anatoly 
rybakov told delegates that all worthy writers can become members 
of our pen center including those living outside the soviet 
union 
we want our country to have its literature regardless of the 
writers place of residence regardless of his beliefs and ideas 
rybakov said 
thirty years of stalins tyranny 20 years of leonid 
brezhnevs incompetent rule is long enough to ruin any society 
particularly a society that has no democratic traditions rybakov 
said 
pen leadership and soviet authorities agreed the new chapter 
would operate independently of the official soviet writers union 
soviet poet andrei bitov conceded there cant be any 
guarantee that the soviet pen chapters wont be suppressed or 
taken over by authorities 
but bitov added theres a kind of belief that everythings 
been going in a progressive way referring to president mikhail 
s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or increased openness which has 
been credited for more freedom in intellectual pursuits 
pen criticized turkey for jailing at least 24 dissident 
intellectuals and banning two novels including henry millers 
tropic of capricorn 
pen also called on czechoslovakia to release havel who in 
february was sentenced to nine months in prison havel had been 
involved in a demonstration to commemorate the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of his country

union leaders representing workers at an ohio 
uraniumprocessing plant complained to congress that an animal 
doctor rather than a people doctor led an important medical 
division at the governmentowned plant 
until recently a veterinarian was the manager of medical 
services at the feed materials production center near fernald 
ohio the labor leaders told the house education and labor 
committee wednesday 
to me it is an obvious example of the casual attitude the 
department of energy and their contractors took when dealing with 
the health and very lives of the men and women who worked at these 
facilities said elmer chatak of the aflcios industrial union 
department 
a plant spokesman confirmed that david howell who holds a 
degree in veterinary medicine held the job until april 13 
howell holds several other degrees including a bachelors 
degree in health sciences with minors in chemistry and mathematics 
and a masters degree in pathology said william kelley a 
spokesman for the plants operator westinghouse materials of ohio 
kelley said howell did not perform medical evaluations was 
not considered the supervisor of the three physicians who work at 
the plant on a subcontract basis and has not been a practicing 
veterinarian at all since his affiliation with westinghouse 
the medical services job involves overseeing medical records and 
technologists kelley said a new administrator has not yet been 
named he added 
howell was moved to another department as part of major 
reorganization in which many department heads were changed the 
spokesman said 
the fernald plant about 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons or as fuel for 
reactors 
the plant is the subject of a 300 million lawsuit on behalf of 
14000 people who live or work nearby and believe their health has 
been threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water 
the government has admitted ignoring or undermining efforts to 
reduce pollution there 
the government has estimated that as much as 552000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the 
plant 
workers have been complaining they werent adequately protected 
from or told about the dangerous substances most of those 
complaints have been directed against the plants former operator 
nlo inc which ran the plant until 1985 
it seems to me that what we have at fernald is a work force 
that has been excessively exposed to radioactive and other toxic 
materials over an extended period of time chatak testified 
for at least the last few years they relied on a medical 
program that was directed by a veterinarian and they were studied 
by doe researchers whom they did not trust and could not believe 
he said

fire killed about 500000 research mice 
at the jackson laboratory and the loss will set back scientists 
around the world who depend on its purebred strains officials said 
four construction workers who were remodeling the building where 
the blaze broke out wednesday afternoon were hospitalized and at 
least two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation officials 
said 
we managed to save what are called the foundation stocks 
the original genetically defined strains of mice said 
directordesignate kenneth paigen it will take us time but we 
will be able to reproduce what was there 
earl green a former jackson director said it would take six to 
eight generations of mice or about two or three years to replace 
the animals 
it was unclear what effect on research the shortterm mouse 
shortage could have 
with an annual budget of 27 million the lab produces between 2 
million and 3 million mice a year and provides them to scientists 
throughout the country europe africa and the soviet union 
its major customers include mammalian genetics researchers at 
the national institutes of health harvard and massachusetts 
institute of technology as well as major hospital research 
centers said barbara trevett a jackson spokeswoman 
during years of breeding the lab has produced 1700 strains of 
mice by genetic accident the mice carry odd physical traits some 
caused by mutant genes studying those genes can provide clues to 
human disorders such as heart disease diabetes cancer and aids 
sales of the mice generate 10 million a year which is put back 
into research and other programs at the laboratory trevett said 
the fire would not delay jackson laboratorys research because 
mice used in its own experiments already had been transferred to a 
different building paigen said 
but he said he was concerned about preserving the jobs of 230 of 
the more than 500 employees of the laboratory the major employer 
in the town of about 2400 people 
its going to be a hard blow to the towns economy said 
fire chief royal higgins 
the fire destroyed a blocklong onestory brick and metal 
building 27 other lab buildings were untouched 
the cause of the fire was under investigation a sealant used by 
the construction workers apparently helped spread the flames 
higgins said 
the four injured construction workers were listed as stable 
said jeanne dulong of mount desert island hospital the most 
seriously burned worker was transferred to maine medical centers 
burn unit in portland she said 
jackson lab which was founded in 1929 was destroyed in a 1947 
forest fire that swept across mount desert island after it was 
rebuilt the lab grew rapidly to become the worlds largest center 
for the study of mammalian genetics

a major liberal organization is gearing up for 
a fulldress lobbying campaign to challenge the nomination of 
william lucas as the justice departments civil rights chief 
we made a commitment to oppose and we wont go into it 
halfheartedly arthur j kropp president of people for the 
american way said wednesday 
it is the most important civil rights position in the 
government and we believe lucas isnt qualified for that top 
position he said 
the group along with the leadership conference on civil rights 
an umbrella coalition of 180 organizations and the naacp 
educational and legal defense fund inc announced this week it 
would join the naacp in opposing lucas 
these civil rights organizations contend that lucas a black 
republican who ran unsuccessfully for governor of michigan in 1986 
lacks the necessary experience to be assistant attorney general for 
civil rights 
kropp said his organization must figure out how to get our 
case out to the american public and members of the senate who 
will ultimately vote on lucas nomination 
no date has been set for lucas confirmation hearing before the 
senate judiciary committee 
kropp would not rule out an advertising campaign similar to one 
the group waged in 1987 to help defeat robert borks nomination to 
the supreme court 
despite mounting opposition among civil rights groups david 
runkel a top aide to attorney general dick thornburgh predicted 
that lucas would not encounter serious opposition in the senate 
the nomination has split the civil rights movement with such 
prominent figures as jesse jackson and the rev joseph lowery head 
of the southern christian leadership conference supporting lucas 
lucas a former democratic sheriff and chief executive of wayne 
county mich is also backed by rep john conyers dmich and 
the detroit chapter of the urban league 
kropp acknowledged that the split will make the fight more 
difficult 
certainly jesse jackson brings a lot of prestige symbolic 
validation well need to deal with it kropp said it is not 
something anyone feels comfortable with 
lucas a former democrat became a republican the year before 
his unsuccessful gubernatorial bid he opposes racial quotas but 
generally supports affirmative action 
besides his lack of experience in civil rights opponents cite 
lucas record as sheriff of wayne county which includes detroit 
a panel of state judges once cited lucas for contempt of a court 
order to reduce overcrowding and improve conditions at the wayne 
county jail a federal appeals court also criticized lucas for 
failing to investigate allegations of brutality against several 
deputies 
lucas has said jail conditions were out of his control because 
of a fiscal crisis in local government and he only learned of the 
brutality charges years later 
runkel said lucas has a very impressive record of achievement 
in the civil rights area 
when he became sheriff of wayne county less than 1 percent of 
the detective force was black after 12 years as sheriff that had 
increased to 20 percent of the detective force 
bill lucas experience is not significantly less than other 
people said runkel who noted that other civil rights chiefs 
did not have significant litigating experience in civil rights 
he called lucas a conciliator whose approach to civil rights 
issues was well suited to the bush administrations policies 
our intention is to try to move forward on contentious civil 
rights issues in a constructive way and not get involved in 
contentious legal disputes that might only delay the providing of 
civil rights runkel said

the bush administration says it plans to come 
to the rescue of the african elephant whose numbers are being 
threatened by ivory hunters 
interior secretary manuel lujan said wednesday he has told us 
representatives to an international conference next october to push 
for increased protection of the elephant 
the united states at the meeting will urge that the african 
elephant be placed in a more protected classification under the 
international endangered species treaty thereby prohibiting any of 
the 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading of 
ivory 
the us decision met immediate praise from several conservation 
and animal protection organizations which have for some time wanted 
the united states to take a more direct interest in protecting the 
african elephant 
the united states is by far the most influential member to 
come out in favor of the proposal this should carry a lot of 
weight said priscilla feral president of friends of animals 
which earlier this year petitioned the interior department to take 
action to protect the elephant 
susan lieberman associate director of wildlife and environment 
for the humane society of america said us leadership in ending 
the worldwide ivory trade is critical to protecting the african 
elephant 
no trinket is worth the death of an elephant and the 
extinction of a species she said 
since 1978 the number of african elephants found in 34 
countries has declined from 15 million to as few as 400000 
according to the government and private groups the number 
continues to decline at a rate of 8 percent a year largely at the 
hands of ivoryseeking poachers they say 
last year the united states imported 32 million worth of ivory 
most of which originated with the african elephant 
i am deeply concerned about the future of the african 
elephant said lujan in a statement announcing that the 
department also is considering changing the african elephants 
classification from threatened to endangered under the us 
endangered species law he told department officials to come up 
with a recommendation 
conservationists believe the action by the 101 nations that 
belong to the convention on international trade in endangered 
species to place the african elephant on a more restrictive list 
would severely cut into the international ivory trade 
lujan said officials of the fish and wildlife service will urge 
action by the 101 nations at the october meeting a twothirds vote 
is needed for the elephant to be reclassified

dissident groups charged today that a 
radical student was tortured and killed by police interrogators and 
they called for peaceful protests to demand the fall of president 
roh taewoos government 
about 5000 students rallied today at chosun university in the 
southeastern city of kwangju to denounce police for the death of 
cholkyu lee according to yonhap the south korean news agency 
some cut their fingers and wrote antigovernment slogans in 
blood 
lee a 24yearold student at chosun had served almost two 
years in jail for violating national security laws and was being 
sought by police for writing articles praising communist north 
korea 
his body was found wednesday in a reservoir near kwangju police 
said 
the united national democratic movement the main dissident 
alliance alleged lee was tortured and killed by police 
investigators assigned to suppressing dissident groups 
dissidents and lees family claimed the body showed signs of 
electric torture and beatings 
police denied involvement in lees death and officials said 
leftists may have killed the student as part of an attempt to cover 
up antigovernment activities an initial autopsy showed no signs 
of torture but it appeared lee was slain they said 
dissident groups charged that a special police unit the joint 
investigation team set up earlier this year to suppress violent 
antigovernment groups may have been involved in lees death 
the unit had announced wednesday it arrested 234 dissidents 
since april 3 for antigovernment activity 
the discovery of lees body came after six riot troopers were 
killed may 3 in a clash with radical students in the southern port 
of pusan the government ordered a major crackdown on violent 
dissidents after the troopers were killed 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent antigovernment 
protests and labor strikes in recent months police have rounded up 
dozens of suspects as part of efforts to crush dissident groups 
the national student council the main alliance of south koreas 
radical students charged that lee was tortured and it demanded 
that police officers involved be arrested and punished 
we will fight to the end if there is any attempt to cover up 
or fabricate the truth said council head lim chongsuk 
thousands of riot police were on alert for demonstrations friday 
in the central city of taejon and in kwangju on saturday to mark 
the anniversary next week of a 1980 antigovernment uprising in 
kwangju in which at least 192 people were killed 
some dissident and radical student groups have said they will 
stop violent protests because of the deaths of the riot troopers in 
pusan but lees death could provoke new unrest especially if 
police attempt to block protests 
radical students and the antigovernment dissident groups have 
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
political views the radicals have been calling for the overthrow 
of roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and 
farmers 
the government has warned that efforts by radicals to build an 
alliance with workers threatens stability strikes have cost the 
economy almost 4 billion in lost production so far this year 
officials say

the fbi doesnt have enough evidence to seek 
an indictment despite the cias conclusion that iran was 
responsible for last years bombing of pan am flight 103 over 
scotland the washington post reported in todays editions 
a cia assessment of the dec 21 1988 bombing has concluded 
that iran hired a syrianbased palestinian organization to carry 
out the operation sources told the post 
the sources also said the fbi is investigating the possibility 
that one of two american college students who had arab boyfriends 
may have been the unsuspecting courier who carried the bomb onto 
the flight 
the explosion over lockerbie scotland killed 270 people the 
flight had originated in frankfurt west germany and stopped in 
london before heading to new york 
the cia is confident of its conclusions blaming iran but the 
fbi doesnt believe sufficient evidence exists to seek indictments 
against the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command the newspaper said 
the organization is headed by ahmed jibril who with his senior 
aides met at least once last fall with iranian officials in tehran 
the post reported 
published reports previously have linked jibrils organization 
to the bombing 
jibril has denied that his organization planted the bomb but 
acknowledged in an abc news interview broadcast last friday that 
his group routinely used the same kind of explosive device that 
investigators say blew up the pan am jumbo jet 
jibrils first lieutenant hafez dalkamoni who jabril said 
commonly built and used the bombs is jailed in germany after a 
police raid last october that netted weapons and three bomb devices 
like the one used to blow up flight 103 
jibril has denied that his group receives money from iran but 
has said he shared irans outrage at how the united states last 
year shot down an iran civilian passenger plane 
i see now that the incident of the pan am is neither worse nor 
uglier than the destruction of the iranian airbus jibril told 
abc both of them are crimes against civilians whether by the 
us administration or by terrorist groups who may have blown up 
the pan am they are equally barbaric 
while denying his groups involvement jibril issued a warning 
should the united states or israel strike his camps in syria we 
shall not remain still our response shall be equal if not more 
violent he said

the house ethics committee plans to dig deeper 
into a lucrative texas gas investment by house speaker jim wright 
as lawyers for the texas democrat seek to pare down the list of 
charges already filed against him 
and the panels chairman rep julian dixon dcalif gave a 
strong vote of confidence to special outside counsel richard 
phelan the chicago lawyer who conducted the long probe that so far 
has produced 69 charges that wright violated house rules 
attacks on phelans professionalism by wrights lawyers are 
totally inaccurate totally wrong and an exercise in bad 
judgment dixon said adding that he has total confidence in 
him 
at the same time the justice department expressed renewed 
interest in the wright matter and in particular his connection with 
allegedly illegal campaign contributions made in 1985 for a special 
texas house election 
the ethics panel met for 2 hours on wednesday and voted to make 
available to wrights lawyers some witnesses and documents that 
have figured in its 11month investigation of the texas democrat 
but the panel denied wrights motion to bar phelan from having 
any private contact with the ethics committee a decision in line 
with its belief that he is acting more as a staff member of the 
panel than as a prosecutor 
it also directed phelan to investigate further the sabine lake 
gas drilling venture which boosted wrights worth substantially 
last year 
the investment involves a gas well near the texaslouisiana 
line which wright and mallick bought into for 9120 last january 
they sold their interest less than five months later for a 340000 
profit even though the wells production had dwindled 
the committee wants to know whether the deal amounted to another 
gift to wright by investors seeking to curry favor with a powerful 
legislator the panel last week interviewed five texans involved in 
the well deal and decided other witnesses still need to be heard 
from dixon said 
wrights defense team beefed up this week to include eight 
lawyers filed a new motion on wednesday asking that the two most 
serious charges be dismissed because they are based on faulty 
interpretation of house rules 
the attorneys asked that the ethics panel drop charges that 
wright evaded house rules limiting outside earned income through 
bulk sales of a book he wrote and that the speaker improperly 
accepted 145000 in gifts from fort worth developer george 
mallick who was deemed to have had a direct interest in 
legislation before congress 
the charges amount to a house of cards delicately balanced on 
a series of unprecedented reinterpretations of house rules 
according to the motion 
one member of the defense team rep robert torricelli dnj 
said it is clear that house rules have grown outmoded and need to 
be revised they are dated time has passed circumstances have 
changed and ethical standards have appropriately risen he said 
but he said the ethics committee is seeking to apply those 
higher standards to wright retroactively which is unfair to the 
speaker 
also on wednesday chief justice department spokesman david 
runkel said the department plans an independent review of wrights 
business and political dealings once the house ethics process runs 
its course 
i expect the department will take an independent look should 
the house exonerate wright runkel said the department has been 
collecting publicly available information on the wright case for 
several months and plans to have its public integrity section 
review the evidence for possible criminal violations 
runkel said such a review would cover matters brought up by the 
ethics committee and other matters that have been raised such 
as wrights involvement in a 1985 political fundraising effort in 
texas 
in testimony last week at a federal fraud trial in dallas 
wright was linked to a political action committee that collected 
allegedly illegal contributions from officials of commodore savings 
and loan an insolvent texas thrift a witness said wright was said 
to have promised to block legislation seen as unfavorable by the 
sampl industry in return for 250000 in donations to the pac but 
wright has denied the charge 
on wednesday three former commodore employees testified they 
gave money to the pac known as east texas first and later were 
reimbursed by their company either through pay increases or checks 
for fictional travel 
former commodore president e morten hopkins his brother robert 
and john w harrell former commodore ceo and vice chairman of the 
board are being tried on charges they misused commodore funds to 
make illegal pac contributions 
east texas first raised and spent about 100000 to help rep 
jim chapman dtexas win the 1985 special election

exxon vowed to put 1600 more workers on 
alaskas shores but said it would take up to six weeks to get them 
to the front lines of the nations worst oil spill 
exxons promise came wednesday after the coast guard ordered it 
to expand its cleanup state and federal officials have repeatedly 
criticized exxon for moving too slowly to clean up the march 24 
spill 
an exxon spokesman said the number of shorebased workers would 
reach 5000 by late june 
exxon said the buildup had to be gradual to provide training and 
housing 
youve got to house all these people youve got feed these 
people youve got to train them said spokesman henry beathard 
coast guard adm paul a yost told a senate hearing in 
washington that despite the increased manpower he considers it 
almost impossible for exxon to clean all the oil from more than 300 
miles of shoreline by its sept 15 target date 
as part of its cleanup plan exxon also has requested that some 
environmental laws be waived so it can burn off the oily wastes and 
process oily water at the valdez treatment plant normally used by 
oil companies to clean bilge water from their tankers 
both options were scorned at a hearing wednesday night speakers 
expressed concern about air pollution from the burning and said 
the terminal plant was inadequate for exxons needs 
exxon expects to collect more than 55000 tons of contaminated 
material from tainted water to soiled clothing worn by cleanup 
workers 
i feel the people of valdez the people of cordova and the 
people of prince william sound have given their fair share of blood 
in this situation said james winchester a local 
environmentalist i think you boys ought to go home and work this 
through again 
earlier the coast guard ordered exxon to beef up its cleanup 
operation and provide federal officials with weekly detailed 
operations schedules of cleanup work outside prince william sound 
where the exxon valdez tanker ran aground and spilled its load 
the order announced in valdez by vice adm clyde robbins was 
the coast guards official response to the exxon cleanup plan 
submitted may 1 for coast guard approval 
the oil spreading steadily has fouled beaches along alaskas 
coast as far south as wide bay about 450 miles southwest of 
valdez authorities said wednesday they also discovered oil patches 
on the west coast of kodiak island 
the crippled tanker is being repaired at naked island in prince 
william sound according to the coast guard exxon plans to move 
the 987foot vessel to portland or the far east next month 
the hull was ripped open by the crash and there are huge 
boulders inside the cargo hold scooped up as the craft scraped 
against the reef said robbins the coast guards onsite commander 
of the spill cleanup 
he said it appeared doubtful that exxon could meet its sept 15 
cleanup deadline i am seriously concerned that the investment of 
resources you describe will not be able to clean the 300plus miles 
of shoreline in the time alloted robbins said in a letter to 
exxon general manager otto harrison the companys ranking 
executive in the spill zone 
workers meanwhile toiled on the four islands hardest hit by 
the spill in the sound hoping to clean the shores a few days 
before seals begin their annual birthing cycle about may 20 
there are about 10000 seals in the sound and between 25 and 50 
percent may have been in areas affected by the spill said mary 
sigman a biologist with the alaska department of fish and game 
no seal deaths have been attributed directly to the spill 
although biologists say they have seen heavily oiled seals 
as of tuesday the us fish amp wildlife service said there had 
been 613 confirmed sea otter deaths and 9918 bird kills

this just in the climate of the earth changed 
dramatically 20 million years ago when high plateaus rose up in 
tibet and western north america 
with new threats to the climate looming upwards of 3000 
scientists have gathered here this week for the american 
geophysical unions semiannual exchange of ideas on weather and 
climate volcanoes earthquakes water the solar system and even 
politics 
several hundred listeners assembled wednesday to hear rep 
richard a gephardt dmo discuss the need for leadership to 
combat the threats of global warming acid rain and wasteful energy 
policies 
you dont have to be an alarmist to recognize that if the 
earths average temperature rises as much as five degrees it 
will completely change our way of life observed gephardt 
in another hall william ruddiman of columbia universitys 
lamontdoherty geological observatory explained his calculation 
showing that the rise of the mountains in tibet and western north 
america forced the winds to shift direction around them causing 
climate changes that led to the ice ages 
scientists have long speculated about the reasons for the ice 
ages ruddiman a marine geologist and john e kutzbach a 
climatologist from the university of wisconsin say computerized 
models of the earths climate are convincing them that the rising 
mountains and high plateaus were the major factor in cooling off 
north america and the northern parts of europe and asia 
in addition they said those shifts in the wind helped change 
the flow of ocean currents and led to conditions that promote the 
summer monsoons in asia dry summers in california and the 
mediterranean and increase the cold winter winds in parts of the 
western united states 
a pair of national aeronautics and space administration 
scientists meanwhile reported their conclusion that the barrage 
of charged particles from the sun may be contributing to the damage 
to the earths protective ozone layer 
linwood callis reported that the flow of highenergy particles 
from the sun leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in the 
upper parts of the stratosphere 
in turn those nitrogen compounds can settle into the 
stratosphere where if you have any kind of significant buildup 
then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of 
ozone said callis 
ozone helps protect the earth from potentially damaging 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun losing some of the ozone could 
lead to an increased incidence of skin cancer 
what the model calculations show and that the data confirm is 
that from 1979 to 1985 the nitrogen oxide levels in the polar 
lower stratosphere probably increased between 30 and 80 or 90 
percent in the equatorial region there have been increases much 
smaller on the order of 10 or 15 percent callis said 
damage to the ozone over the south pole has been widely 
discussed in recent years callis said that socalled antarctic 
ozone hole appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds 
trapped over the polar areas since ice particles in this region 
tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air 
the interest that we have in this is primarily related to 
global ozone there are larger than expected ozone changes 
said callis 
in the air about 16 miles above the surface the area where 
ozone is most concentrated callis and dan baker found the gas 
depleted by as much as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985 callis 
said 
natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of 
incoming charged particles between now and the mid1990s said 
callis and he and baker are anxious to see if ozone levels will 
recover during that period 
while modern and ancient climate changes were under discussion 
the massive convention center swarmed with students in jeans 
geologists in string ties nervous speakers rehearsing their 
presentations and political advocates proclaiming the greenhouse 
warming a hoax 
a steady drizzle dampened arrivals while an appropriately 
placed booth emblazoned hydrology greeting them just inside the 
main entrance

latin american leaders say allegations 
of election fraud in panama and violence against the opposition 
could further isolate that country from the regions democracies 
late wednesday panamas electoral commission nullified the 
presidential election after guillermo endara the opposition 
candidate and his two vice presidential candidates were beaten by 
government supporters officials said one of endaras bodyguards 
was killed in an ensuing gunfight 
in a statement released in brasilia and montevideo uruguay 
seven latin american foreign ministers said the turbulence could 
distance even further the panamanian government and democratic 
community of latin america during a historic moment in which free 
and popular expression is advancing in a way never before seen in 
our region 
we believe the best defense of the interests of nations and 
peoples of latin america can be achieved only through free 
expression and the popular will 
the statement was signed by the group of eight nations which 
actually has seven members peru argentina uruguay brazil 
venezuela colombia and mexico panama was suspended after gen 
manuel antonio noriega the nations de facto ruler engineered the 
ouster of elected president eric delvalle in february 1988

a house panel chairman demonstrating that the 
acid rain debate will again pit blocks of states against one other 
says proposed legislation to cut sulfur dioxide emissions would 
place an unfair burden on nine states 
rep philip r sharp chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committees energy and power subcommittee wrote president bush on 
wednesday that the nine states account for 52 percent of sulfur 
dioxide emissions considered the leading cause of acid rain 
but sharp said three congressional proposals introduced so far 
would require the nine to achieve 77 percent of the nations 
required reductions the affected states are ohio indiana 
missouri pennsylvania kentucky illinois tennessee west 
virginia and georgia 
sharp dind wrote bush because the administration is 
developing its own acid rain proposals which could be submitted to 
congress this month 
nine states in the nation should not be cleaning up both their 
own and somebody elses portion of the national reduction sharp 
told bush in the letter 
sharp said the proposed legislation would emphasize reduction of 
sulfur dioxide emitted from older coalfired electric power plants 
rather than from industrial facilities the nine states because of 
their geography use coalfired plants largely because they do not 
have access to hydropower and natural gas sharp said 
a pound of sulfur dioxide removed from the air is of equal 
benefit to the environment whether it is removed from a small 
industrial facility in texas or a large power plant in the 
midwest the letter said 
in the past the northeast the primary victim of acid rain 
sought immediate action while midwestern states feared controls on 
their coalfired plants would boost electric bills 
states that produce large amounts of highsulfur coal indiana 
illinois ohio west virginia and pennsylvania worried that 
controls would cause massive job losses in the coal industry 
the west where lowsulfur coal is mined and acid rain is a less 
serious problem has been reluctant to pay the cost for new 
controls 
acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are 
converted in the atmosphere into acids which travel far from their 
starting points to pollute lakes and forests and according to 
health experts cause serious respiratory problems for asthmatics 
children and the elderly 
the leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coalburning power 
plants and industrial facilities nitrogen oxides are emitted in 
approximately equal amounts for asthmatics children and the 
elderly

jesse jackson isnt ruling out a campaign for 
mayor of washington dc but says hes not looking for 
something to do and has no current plans to run 
facing persistent questions about reports he is weighing a race 
for mayor of the nations capital jackson repeated his pledge not 
to challenge embattled incumbent marion s barry jr 
but he declined to say what he would do if barry steps aside 
i need not deal in the hypothetical jackson said i take 
this process of public service seriously and i take it one day at 
a time 
the twotime candidate for the democratic presidential 
nomination responded to questions about the mayoral race at a news 
conference following an appearance before a senate committee where 
he called for a federal law making voter registration easier and 
more accessible 
entering the hearing jackson got a taste of the speculation 
about his future that has filled political circles 
should we be saying welcome mr mayor sen edward 
kennedy dmass asked jokingly as jackson took his seat at the 
witness table 
i think its out of order jackson responded 
jackson dismissed a washington post poll showing he would be the 
runaway leader if he runs for mayor saying it would not influence 
his thinking 
as a matter of fact if they conducted a poll on who democrats 
would want nationally to be the presidential nominee id be no 
1 in that poll as well he said so i must keep all those polls 
in focus 
the poll said jackson would win 68 percent of the vote to 17 
percent for barry the poll of 1021 registered voters in the city 
also found that barry facing declining support because of 
questionable behavior and mounting city problems would lose in 
oneoneone matchups with four other possible challengers the poll 
had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points 
jackson lives in chicago and would have to move to washington by 
this november a year ahead of the mayoral election if he is to 
become a candidate 
he owns a vacant home in the city and is renovating it jackson 
said the renovations are for practical reasons because he is in 
washington several days a week and intends to use it instead of 
staying in hotels 
ive said very clearly and often i have no plans to run for 
mayor of washington jackson said i support the current mayor 
as mayor of washington dc and my position is as clear as it can 
be 
jackson said that he is active as president of the rainbow 
coalition the political and civil rights group he founded and is 
not ready to give up national political ambitions 
im sufficiently busy im not looking for something to do 
jackson said 
if there is ever any change in my basic work priorities ill 
be all too willing to share it with you he said

nasa will go after some historical colour 
by naming its newest space shuttle built to replace the destroyed 
challenger after a british sailing ship 
the space agency announced wednesday that president bush had 
selected the name endeavour after it was the most popular name 
in a national nametheshuttle competition among americas school 
children 
the endeavor was the flagship used by 18th century english 
explorer james cook 
thirtyone of the 111 statelevel winners in the competition 
chose the name endeavour although many of the entries used the 
american spelling of endeavor second most popular among the state 
winners with 12 selections was resolution 
the competition was in two divisions kindergarten through grade 
6 and grades 7 through 12 nasa selected a winning entry in each 
category 
the winning entry for kindergarten through grade 6 was from the 
fifth graders of senatobia middle school in senatobia miss 
winning in the other division was tallulah falls school 
tallulah falls ga 
for their winning project the mississippi fifth graders created 
a space camp where younger children were taught about space 
the tallulah falls entry had two parts a magazine called 
math exploration with james cook and a play called where on 
earth which compared cooks explorations with the voyages of a 
space shuttle called endeavour 
more than 6100 teams formed by 71650 students submitted 
research projects supporting the names selected panels from each 
of the state education agencies then sorted through the entries and 
picked state winners in the two divisions from these state 
winners bush made his selection 
endeavour was the name james cook chose for the 98foot vessel 
he used to explore the south pacific from 1768 to 1772 he sailed 
southwest from plymouth england around south america then 
explored the coasts of new zealand australia and new guinea before 
returning to england by way of africas cape of good hope 
completing a circumnavigation of the earth 
cook chose the name resolution for a ship he used in his second 
and third voyages exploring the pacific ocean during those trips 
cook went as far north as the arctic ocean and as far south as the 
antarctic circle he located and named the sandwich islands later 
called hawaii and was killed there in 1779 
the second vessel in cooks company during his final voyage was 
named discovery the same as that given to one of the current space

armed with reviews from tv critics praising the 
madefortv movie roe vs wade nbc is asking advertisers to 
stand up to pressure groups seeking to block the film about the 
case that legalized abortion 
in a may 8 letter to advertisers nbc president robert c wright 
vowed to air the movie as scheduled monday without advertising if 
advertisers pull out 
im not writing this letter to simply sell commercial time 
wright wrote we will underwrite this project without support if 
necessary were very proud of roe vs wade 
nbc said the status of advertising time sold during the twohour 
film was still unsettled and probably would be until the broadcast 
date 
the factbased movie stars holly hunter as a character based on 
norma mccorvey the thenanonymous jane roe plaintiff who sued 
dallas district attorney henry wade in the case that went to the 
supreme court amy madigan plays attorney sarah weddington 
the abortion battle heightened when the high court heard 
arguments april 26 in a missouri case that could affect the 1973 
decision 
the movie is about the prochoice advocates who prevailed in 
1973 but also portrays sympathetically the prosecutors who argued 
the other side though they get much less attention 
this is discriminatory programming against an entire class of 
people in the united states said john c willke president of 
the national right to life committee 
it is clearly strong proabortion propaganda there is 
absolutely no claim that can be made that this is balanced not 
remotely 
he said his group was calling on nbc affiliates to refuse to 
show the movie or provide antiabortion groups with at least 30 
minutes of time to refute the views they believe the movie 
represents 
in an unusual move nbc allowed advertisers to screen the film 
before deciding whether to sponsor it 
a few have withdrawn others have been added said nbc 
spokesman curt block we havent identified any of the names of 
advertisers in or out and expect it will be fully sponsored the 
next couple of days are going to be crucial 
wrights letter quoted favorable reviews of the movie and said 
advertisers should be concerned about threats of boycotts as a way 
for pressure groups to control program content 
nbc firmly believes the decision about where your messages 
appear rests with you and your marketing people not with those 
who have a predisposition to judge a programs merits based on 
their own agenda and no information said wrights letter 
nbc news tom brokaw will anchor a 30minute special later in 
the evening to discuss abortion but willke wasnt impressed 
baloney he said they are controlling the discussion 
in his letter wright referred to recent cases of advertisers 
pulling out of tv programs because of pressure from groups and 
individuals who find them offensive he mentioned no specifics but 
shows that have been targeted recently include foxs raunchy sitcom 
married with children and nbcs cuttingly satirical 
saturday night live 
abc recently canceled two realitybased specials crimes 
of passion ii and scandals ii due to lack of advertiser 
support because of their expected lurid content both were sequels 
to previous specials that garnered good ratings

the nullification of elections in panama was 
necessary because the opposition instigated by the united states 
violated election laws and attempted to rig the results the 
official tass news agency claimed today 
the electoral tribunal in panama city late wednesday invalidated 
sundays election saying the stealing of ballots votebuying and 
missing tally sheets made proclamation of a new president 
impossible 
both sides had claimed victory in the balloting which 
international observers and the opposition claimed were rigged by 
forces loyal to strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
tass in a dispatch from panama city claimed supporters of 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara had violated 
election procedures 
they blockaded polling stations preventing ballot boxes from 
being taken to the commissions headquarters in good time tass 
said a considerable number of ballot papers were stolen or 
destroyed and several ballot boxes were burned 
witnesses and international observers said soldiers loyal to 
noriega had stolen ballots from polling stations where voting 
heavily favored the opposition 
tass said that as results were coming in the opposition 
directly instigated by the united states started heightening the 
atmosphere by resorting to obviously provocative and subversive 
actions 
tass said allowing the election results to remain valid posed 
unpredictable consequences for the countrys future 
the decision to nullify the election appears to be 
extraordinary but the only correct one the news agency said

the recently acquired ability to freeze 
human embryos has produced more than 150 babies for previously 
infertile couples but it is posing difficult questions for 
prospective parents a psychiatrist says 
before having embryos frozen couples should legally document 
their wishes on such questions as what to do with the embryos if 
the parents divorce or die during the process said dr michael 
vergare 
other issues include what should happen to stored embryos if the 
woman enters menopause and can no longer be implanted with them 
said vergare associate chairman of the psychiatry department at 
the albert einstein medical center in philadelphia 
vergare spoke at a news conference and in an interview wednesday 
at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric association 
such ethical questions are beginning to appear in the nations 
courtrooms 
a los angelesarea couple on wednesday sued a norfolk va 
invitro fertilization center for refusing to release an embryo 
that was frozen 23 months ago 
the couple want to remove their embryo from the jones institute 
for reproductive medicine so that a california doctor can attempt 
to implant it in the woman 
in another case the divorce of a tennessee couple has turned 
into a battle over custody of seven of the womans eggs that are 
fertilized with her husbands sperm and kept in frozen storage a 
knoxville court has scheduled a hearing in july to determine if the 
embryos are joint property of mary sue davis and junior lewis 
davis or subjects for a custody decision 
good embryofreezing programs provide legal documents that deal 
with such issues as well as others such as what to do with embryos 
if the organization that is storing them goes out of business 
vergare said 
at his institution couples are required to ponder the issues 
before proceeding with the freezing he said 
embryofreezing has become part of invitro fertilization 
programs with which normally infertile couples can have children 
with the help of eggfertilizing in the laboratory 
virtually every major city now offers programs with 
embryofreezing said vergare who is psychiatric consultant to the 
einstein centers invitro program 
babies born so far from frozen embryos have appeared generally 
healthy and normal vergare said the technique has been used 
sucessfully in animal husbandry for years but whether it will 
prove to have longterm effects in people is unknown he said 
cows arent expected to study algebra he said 
in the case filed in federal court in norfolk steven and risa 
york asked for 200000 for alleged emotional damages and the 
immediate release of their embryo 
between august 1986 and july 1987 when the couple lived in new 
jersey ms york went to the institute four times to attempt 
invitro fertilization doctors managed to fertilize 12 of her 
eggs and 11 of those were implanted without success according to 
court papers 
the 12th embryo was frozen for future implantation but the 
yorks moved to california and later notified dr suheil j muasher 
director of the jones institute that they wanted to take the 
frozen embryo to los angeles where local doctors would implant it 
dr howard w jones jr cofounder and president of the 
institute said agreeing to the yorks request could set a 
precedent by forcing the release of fertilized eggs to doctors who 
might be unqualified to perform the procedure

opposition vice presidential 
candidate ricardo arias calderon said he froze when he saw the iron 
bar coming 
but at the same time my assistant pulled me away and the bar 
missed my head by a few inches 
arias calderon was describing how he was attacked wednesday by a 
gang of thugs loyal to gen manuel antonio noriega 
his presidential running mate guillermo endara and second vice 
presidential candidate guillermo ford suffered head injuries during 
the clash 
the violence put an end to a peaceful demonstration that 
escalated into a confrontation and an exchange of gunfire 
four security men were wounded and one of the candidates 
civilian bodyguards killed officials said 
the demonstrators were protesting government attempts to 
steal an election they say endara won both sides claimed 
victory 
the opposition cavalcade had wound through the streets of panama 
city until it stopped in front of a group of riot troops 
we were talking with an officer in charge about withdrawing 
arias calderon said we were told to wait at that moment the 
paramilitary broke through the ranks of the riot police and started 
shooting 
witnesses said the candidates bodyguards leaped out of cars and 
started returning fire although arias calderon denied his men had 
weapons 
witnesses also said the demonstrators had thrown rocks and 
bottles at the paramilitary dignity battalions who were 
standing behind the riot police 
i ran into an alley with other people arias calderon said 
people were falling into each other i fell and then about 
five people fell on top of me i could not breathe then i heard 
someone say my vice president and he and others picked me up and 
took me inside a store 
the man who picked him up gilberto cardenas said he and others 
also picked up endara and put him in a truck to take him to a 
hospital 
the dignity battalion is made up of civilians recruited into 
armed groups with the expressed purpose of defending panama in case 
of a us invasion which noriega has been saying could happen 
noriega head of the defense forces has been de facto leader of 
panama since 1983 
the world knows that whats at stake here is not panama 
canal as the government claims but the desire of a people to be 
free said arias calderon

after the government nullified the elections and opposition 
candidates beaten by supporters of gen manuel antonio noriega 
apparently went in hiding 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara and his two 
running mates had been beaten by bat and pipewielding civilian 
thugs us officials said one of their bodyguards was killed 
soldiers who did not interfere as the candidates were beaten 
wednesday afternoon had halted an opposition motorcade protesting 
what international observers have called the governments theft of 
sundays elections 
the demonstration had sought to rally international opinion 
against noriega and prevent the proclamation of his candidate 
carlos duque as president 
us ambassador arthur davis condemned the attack and called the 
nullification announced late in the day as a cowardly act of 
contempt for the choice made by the panamanian people 
davis said dependents of the 12000 military and diplomatic 
personnel in panama who live offbase would be moved today to 
military bases to ensure their safety us personnel were told to 
stay out of public places unless on official business and then to 
appear only in civilian clothes 
washington has been trying for more than a year to oust noriega 
the countrys de facto leader since 1983 and defense forces chief 
the opposition said wednesdays attack showed noriega who has 
not been seen in public since the weekend is getting desperate 
they now know they cannot carry out the electoral fraud they 
planned it is already a scandal throughout the world said first 
vice presidential candidate ricardo arias calderon who also was 
beaten 
second vice presidential candidate guillermo ford was beaten 
bloody and like endara suffered a head wound arias calderon said 
ford and several other opposition officials including press 
spokesman luis martins were apparently under arrest 
davis and other officials said one of the candidates bodyguards 
was killed and about 20 demonstrators injured the military said 
four soldiers were wounded in an exchange of gunfire that followed 
the attack on the candidates 
also wednesday the government expelled nine foreign 
journalists accusing them of spreading misinformation the 
expelled included an cable news network correspondent and two 
reporters working for the voice of america 
vote counting had yet to be finalized in this country of 22 
million when the electoral commission announced the balloting had 
been voided 
in a proclamation it cited votestealing votebuying missing 
tally sheets and international interference as behind the move the 
commission said nothing about rescheduling the vote 
more than 300 observers including europeans the us 
delegation as well as former president jimmy carter backed 
opposition claims that endara won by a 3to1 margin 
this does not change anything it makes it worse terry 
kneebone a us embassy spokesman told the associated press 
noriega has closed out his options 
yolanda pulice de rodriguez head of the electoral tribunal 
charged in a nationwide broadcast that the outcome of the vote was 
altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners 
called in by foreign or domestic political forces without 
invitation 
president bush charging that noriegas forces planned to fix 
the elections had sent an uninvited us delegation in addition 
the cia reportedly contributed 10 million to the opposition 
campaign 
opposition supporters throughout the city began beating on pots 
and pans after the nullification announcement chanting endara is 
my president 
but the streets quieted as truckloads of soldiers appeared 
dropping squads off around the city the soldiers searched buses 
trucks and cars for weapons 
members of panamas 15000strong defense forces also were 
reported on the move in other cities 
dozens of telephone calls to opposition leaders at homes 
offices and hotels after the election announcement found not even 
one 
endara who suffered a scalp wound that took eight stitches to 
close was spending the night in paidilla hospital according to 
his wife but the hospital said he was not there 
i blame noriega for everything bad that has happened endara 
said in a brief hospital interview during the afternoon 
angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in the 
downtown area police broke up scattered groups of demonstrators 
with tear gas and gunshots fired in the air 
the attack on the candidates occurred as they were touring the 
city from the bed of a pickup truck when the pickup was halted by 
a police blockade it was surrounded by a group of men wearing 
dignity battalion tshirts and waving iron bars baseball bats 
and rubber hoses 
by this action noriega has demonstrated his contempt for the 
panamanian people said davis at a news conference 
the government in television broadcasts accused the opposition 
of trying to set the stage for us intervention 
government television showed footage of us intervention in the 
dominican republic of a ciainspired coup in guatemala and of the 
coup that toppled president salvador allende of chile 
the opposition rejects noriegas accusations that it is trying 
to help the united states violate the panama canal treaties which 
cede the canal to panama by the year 2000 
washington began its campaign to oust noriega after he 
orchestrated president eric delvalles ouster delvalle had tried 
to fire noriega after the general was indicted in florida on 
drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 noriega denies the drug 
charges

a titan rocket packing a secret 
pentagon payload streaked off on an apparently routine flight into 
orbit but the fiery blastoff ignited brush fires that closed the 
launch area for more than an hour 
the 65 million titan 34d lifted off at 347 pm wednesday and 
appeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky 
as with other military space flights the air force did not 
announce the launch in advance but with more than 20000 employees 
working at cape canaveral and adjacent kennedy space center it 
couldnt hide the fact that the 16storytall rocket was going to 
be launched 
minutes before liftoff hundreds of workers poured out of 
buildings to watch 
the air force issued a brief postlaunch statement saying only 
that a titan 34d had been launched successfully it provided no 
information on the nature of the payload 
there was no damage to launch pad from brush fires triggered by 
the rockets exhaust officials said 
lt gen aloysius casey retiring commander of the air force 
space division told a conference last year that the first titan 
34d launched in 1989 would carry up two communications satellites 
named dscs for defense satellite communications system 
the satellites are built to provide secure voice and high data 
rate transmission for american military and diplomatic 
communications 
sources close to the project who spoke on condition of anonynity 
said wednesday the satellites were aboard the titan 34d 
a chalet satellite designed to monitor soviet communications 
networks was aboard a titan 34d launched last sept 2 an upper 
stage failure left that payload in the wrong orbit 
on nov 6 a titan 34d successfully launched a payload believed 
to be a pair of satellites intended to monitor soviet missile tests 
and electronic communciations 
one titan 34d remains in the air force inventory it is 
scheduled for launch from cape canaveral later this year and will 
be replaced by the more powerful titan 4 
the first titan 4 is scheduled for launch here within a few 
weeks carrying a satellite designed to provide instant warning of 
a hostile missile attack on the united states

miners at four southwestern copper mines 
ended a sixday strike today and returned to work after winning 30 
percent pay increases plus higher bonuses a solidarity spokesman 
said 
in another development solidarity called on the interior 
ministry to investigate the planting of an eavesdropping device in 
one of its campaign offices after local officials refused to look 
into the matter 
preparatory work to reopen the mines began with the first shift 
following the acceptance of the agreement by workers on wednesday 
night said jan sugalski of solidarity a member of the strike 
committee 
normal work at the mines was to start in the afternoon he said 
the strike which began may 5 and involved up to 20000 miners 
had been the first major instance of labor unrest since the april 5 
signing of a broad agreement between communist authorities and the 
solidarityled opposition 
the agreement led to the reinstatement of solidarity after a 
sevenyear ban and a government promise to allow the opposition to 
run for onethird of the seats in parliaments lower house and all 
the seats in its new senate 
the june elections are to be the first open balloting in the 
east bloc 
the free trade union movement said the strike was inspired by 
the official opzz unions but joined by solidarity members 
frustrated by high inflation which has reached an 80 percent 
annual rate this year 
sugalski said the miners won a 30 percent increase in basic 
wages plus a 30 percent bonus if production goals are met they 
originally demanded a 50 percent increase in basic pay 
the increase in basic wages averages about 140 a day he said 
the miners now earn 112 to 169 a month 
solidarity helped miners win pay for the period of the strike 
and we are very happy about it said sugalski 
the agreement also calls for urgent changes in the pay 
system he said miners have long complained that the pay structure 
undervalues labor performed during the normal fiveday work week 
forcing miners to work weekends to make ends meet 
the strikes were at four mines near the city of lubin about 200 
miles southwest of warsaw the official pap news agency said the 
strike reduced output by 100000 tons of ore daily 
poland is the worlds eighthlargest producer of refined copper 
in 1987 it exported to the west more than 161000 tons worth 
about 233 million 
solidarity workers found the electronic eavesdropping device in 
campaign offices in the northern provincial capital of slupsk 
union spokesman said jacek moskwa said wednesday 
hew told a warsaw news conference that the device was found 
tuesday in a wall in the solidarity citizens committee office the 
city about 50 miles east of the port of gdansk 
government spokesman pawel byra said he knew nothing about it 
the slupsk case sheds a clear and worrying light on methods 
applied by the coalitiongovernment side in the election campaign 
it was proved again that the polish state is still an instrument of 
a political monopoly said a statement released by solidaritys 
national citizens committee 
the committee is coordinating the free trade union movements 
campaign for junes partially democratic elections 
moskwa said the slupsk committee asked the local prosecutors 
office to investigate but it refused the national committee then 
complained in warsaw at the interior ministry which oversees the 
police

the governments announcement that 
the presidential election had been nullified was accompanied by a 
level of gringobashing seldom seen in latin america 
stern voices on government radio told of alleged us attempts 
to undermine the elections and television viewers were shown clips 
from bad movies documentary footage of the 1965 dominican republic 
uprising and the 1962 bay of pigs fiasco 
film showing unspeakable torture scenes was broken up by 
flashframes of the cia emblem and headquarters us troops 
training and former president lyndon johnson who sent american 
soldiers to quell the uprising in the dominican republic 
then it was back to movie clips in which sinister american plots 
were discussed to topple governments 
a cuban documentary said foreign intervention especially 
american had brought poverty and misery to panama now 
together we will conjugate the verb to decolonialize it said 
a government program showed american firepower and pictures of 
the panama canal and said the united states intends to keep the 
canal after the turn of the century in violation of 1977 treaties 
on national radio a speaker went down a list of countries 
friendly to the united states 
guatemala they cant even take care of or clean up their own 
situation 
costa rica what can we say about costa rica the speaker 
asked alleged that it was well known that the nobel prize won by 
president oscar arias in 1987 was bought and paid for 
news programs of wednesdays parade that ended in the beatings 
of opposition candidates for president and vice president said the 
violence was provoked by attacks by paramilitary troops of the 
opposition to create for the united states a justification to 
invade panama just as they did in the dominican republic in 1965 
there was no mention of the beatings or of the death of one 
candidates bodyguard 
the government statement nullifying the vote partly blamed the 
united states 
the normal development of the elections was altered by 
obstructionist acts of many foreigners called here by political 
forces within or outside the country who did not have an invitation 
from the electoral tribunal and whose obvious aim was to circulate 
the idea of electoral fraud proclaimed to the world by american 
authorities well before the elections 
president bush had sent an uninvited delegation that virtually 
crashed the election and was highly critical of the process 
gen manuel antonio noriega head of panamas defense forces and 
the nations de facto leader started promoting the theme of the 
united states as a threat more than a year ago when he was indicted 
in florida on drug charges and the united states mounted a campaign 
to force him from power 
but panama has had closed ties with the united states over the

the chairman of princeton universitys 
english department says his recent resignation was prompted in part 
by lenient treatment of a professor accused of making sexual 
advances on a student 
emory elliott is one of four members of the english faculty to 
resign since a controversy erupted over the september incident 
which involved a male english professor and a male graduate student 
the professor thomas mcfarland 62 was suspended that month 
for one year faculty members had hoped he would be eased out 
altogether elliott said 
the student who allegedly was the target of the advance reported 
it to police last week but it was unclear if charges would be 
filed 
kim otis a lawyer representing the student said his client 
told police it was a criminal assault of a sexual nature but 
denied the student was alleging rape or sexual assault 
otis said there was a definite reason the student did not go 
to police sooner but the attorney refused to elaborate 
robert wills mcfarlands lawyer said the students delay cast 
doubt on his allegations 
university officials have refused to comment on mcfarlands 
suspension or on the alleged incident the princetonian the 
student newspaper reported that the episode occurred after an 
english department party 
elliott who is leaving for the university of california 
riverside said his disillusionment with the ivy league schools 
administration mounted after it notified the faculty in january it 
would allow mcfarland to return in the fall 
we had been given hope early on in the fall there would be a 
resolution that the professor would accept some kind of other 
position or early retirement that we would not be looking forward 
to his return to the classroom elliott said 
several english students said in interviews that the dispute 
over mcfarland was part of a deeper morale problem in the 
department that stemmed partly from insufficient financial support 
another of the departing professors margaret doody said the 
universitys handling of the matter was a very serious factor 
in her decision 
the other english faculty members reportedly leaving princeton 
are sandra gilbert and valerie smith both feminist literary 
critics neither returned messages left wednesday on their home 
answering machines

all americans under age 60 should be encouraged by 
their doctors to be tested for the aids virus regardless of their 
risk of being infected two physicians recommend today 
currently most experts recommend limiting routine aids testing 
to people who are at obvious increased risk of the disease 
in their report in the new england journal of medicine drs 
frank s rhame of the university of minnesota and dennis g maki of 
the university of wisconsin said doctors should take a more active 
role in promoting aids testing for their patients 
our greatest concern is to reach the great number of persons 
infected with hiv who are not availing themselves of any current 
options in testing and who are not confronting their risk for hiv 
infection they wrote 
testing reveals infection with hiv the virus that causes aids 
people may carry this virus for many years before becoming sick 
they said that doctors might raise the subject with patients by 
saying i recommend an hiv test to all my patients because some 
people who have risked exposure to hiv dont realize it and many 
persons whose activities put them at risk find it difficult to 
disclose them 
among the benefits of widespread testing that they cited 
people who know they are infected will benefit from earlier 
treatment with the aids drug azt as well as therapy for infections 
associated with aids such medicines can prolong peoples lives but 
not cure the disease 
people who know they are infected may be more careful not to 
pass the virus on to others 
taking the test would remind people that aids is potentially a 
problem for anyone 
candidates for research studies of new aids drugs would be 
identified 
we are recommending hiv testing vigorously to all us adults 
under the age of 60 regardless of their reported risk history 
the doctors wrote 
the doctors said they doubted that aggressive testing programs 
would drive people away from the medical care system as some have 
argued they said that falsely positive results another argument 
against widespread testing would be rare 
they said the suggestion that infected people should be 
protected from the bad news is somewhat paternalistic and 
counter to the trend toward a patients right to know 
in essence we are arguing that hiv infection should be 
treated as much as possible like another infectious disease they 
wrote

mayor tom bradley gave a brief admission of 
guilt before a hastily gathered city council session saying he had 
erred in judgment by taking money from companies doing business 
with the city 
but council members said wednesdays admission would not lower 
the heat for bradley facing the crisis of his political career for 
accepting fees from far east national bank and valley federal 
savings amp loan 
ive been very proud of the high level of unquestioned 
integrity and character which have been a part of my 47 years of 
public service in this city bradley said 
so let me state frankly that i made an error in judgment by 
engaging in outside employment which although not legally wrong 
has created the perception that i fell short of my own high 
standards in government 
bradley made the remarks in a twominute address to the council 
then left without taking questions from either council members or 
reporters 
not all of the councils members were satisfied 
i dont think it was clear enough i dont think it was 
convincing enough said councilwoman gloria molina 
bradley didnt address the issue of lying the inconsistencies 
in his statements said councilman michael woo who heads a 
council panel overseeing the city attorneys investigation of 
bradley 
council members robert farrell joel wachs and ernani bernardi 
however stood to applaud the mayor 
city attorney james hahn is investigating whether there was a 
conflict of interest in bradley receiving payment to serve on the 
boards of the two financial institutions while they did business 
with the city 
in addition the securities and exchange commission is looking 
into stock investments handled for bradley by drexel burnham 
lambert 
i was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside 
employment could create the perceptions we see today bradley 
said i will always regret it 
the issue of bradleys finances arose shortly after the former 
city councilman and police lieutenant was elected in april to an 
unprecedented fifth term as mayor of the nations secondlargest 
city 
bradley has returned 18000 paid him by far east national bank 
to serve as an adviser he has announced he will resign from valley 
federals board of directors a position that paid him at least 
71800 over the last 11 years 
the citys investigation will continue council members said 
maybe he asked for forgiveness but the process has to move 
forward councilwoman joy picus said i suspect that he thought 
maybe it would end it but it couldnt possibly in reality

a financial planner who bilked clients of millions 
of dollars was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay 
129 million in restitution 
us district judge stanley marcus sentenced henry gherman on 
wednesday on seven embezzlement and mail fraud convictions 
marcus said the reason for the stiff sentence was because there 
were many victims real people not large institutions who 
lost money as a result of ghermans fraud 
as the fraud unveiled he took almost 5 million of these 
peoples money marcus said to this day vast amounts of money 
remained unaccounted for 
many of the dozens of clients bilked were doctors and nurses who 
entrusted gherman with their pension plans they believe he 
swindled some 20 million since starting his onestop shopping 
investment and financial planning firm in 1970 
gherman charged with misusing 10 million of his clients 
money claimed that most of it was wiped out by the 1987 stock 
market crash 
i never schemed i never planned it gherman told the judge 
i never set out to do this i never converted other peoples 
money to my own benefit or that of my family 
he showed no reaction as the sentence was read ghermans 
relatives including his wife of 33 years and their two daughters 
were in tears 
gherman was arrested last october in tokyo and was returned to 
miami by federal marshals dec 28

the woman called the godmother of a 
drugsmuggling cult that killed 15 people along the us border has 
confessed to taking part in ritual slayings us and mexican 
authorities say 
sara aldrete villarreal 24 and two other alleged cult members 
were charged wednesday in the weekend deaths of their leader and 
his righthand man authorities said police say the two had 
ordered their own deaths 
a source in the mexico city attorney generals office said ms 
aldrete has a split personality and us customs agent oran neck 
told a news conference that she confessed to conspiracy and 
involvement in ritual killings 
the three were not charged in those killings 
neck returned to brownsville texas on wednesday from a 72hour 
trip to mexico city after assisting mexican authorities in the case 
ms aldrete a mexican who attended college in texas was wanted 
on both sides of the border after police acting on a tip dug up 
15 mutilated bodies at a desolate ranch near the border town of 
matamoros on april 11 
cult members boiled brains and other human organs as part of 
their belief that human sacrifice would give them occult protection 
when they smuggled marijuana into the united states authorities 
have said 
one body was identified as that of mark kilroy 21 of santa fe 
texas a student at the university of texas 
ms aldrete told reporters at two news conferences earlier this 
week that she knew nothing about the killings 
shes giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators 
working this case right now neck said in brownsville across the 
border from matamoros 
marco antonio diaz de leon director of judicial proceedings for 
the mexico city attorney generals office would only say that ms 
aldrete most certainly is immersed in these crimes 
the source in the attorney generals office speaking on 
condition of anonymity said that when ms aldrete talks to police 
about cult rituals she loses that charming aspect she exhibits 
when she faces television cameras 
i would say she has three personalities he said 
one personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies 
any involvement in the human slayings another emerges when she 
talks to police and the third one comes out when she talks to 
herself the source said 
neck told reporters sara has kind of lost touch with reality 
no question about it her dual personality is coming up pretty 
strong right now when you talk to her without the tv cameras 
there shes pretty truthful 
cult leader adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 and his righthand 
man martin quintana rodriguez were killed on saturday in a mexico 
city apartment during a shootout with police 
ms aldrete omar francisco orea 23 and alvaro de leon valdez 
22 were charged on wednesday with homicide in the shootings they 
also were charged with criminal association resisting arrest 
shooting a firearm at authorities and for injuries suffered in the 
gunbattle with police 
an arraignment date was not announced 
constanzo a cubanborn american from florida reportedly 
instructed de leon valdez to kill him and quintana as police moved 
in 
ms aldrete and orea were charged because they had agreed and 
made a pact before the deaths in case they were going to be 
arrested diaz de leon said this death pact was carried out

the countrys leading opposition groups 
have rejected the ruling communist partys offer to negotiate the 
details of a transition to a multiparty system opposition 
spokesmen said today 
the partys governing central committee proposed earlier this 
week that procedures for next years promised multiparty elections 
and other reforms take place in a roundtable setting 
but the opposition spokesmen said the leaders of eight groups 
met wednesday night and decided they wanted to present their views 
as a single entity 
the communists have demonstrated increasing willingness to share 
power with other political groups following a severe economic 
crisis and demand for greater democracy 
the central committee said the negotiations could be conducted 
in a setting similar to the series of meetings held recently in 
poland where the government agreed april 5 to reinstate the 
outlawed trade union solidarity and allow opposition participation 
in parliamentary elections 
balint magyar of the league of free democrats said the 
opposition groups want a twosided negotiating table and a broader 
agenda 
we do not want to negotiate on concrete issues but on the 
political rules of the game he said 
magyar said the talks would have to include a new law on 
political parties and a new constitution as well as the reforms 
needed before the june 1990 vote which is to give voters a choice 
of parties for the first time in 40 years 
according to the daily newspaper magyar nemzet and a communique 
distributed by the staterun news agency mti the opposition groups 
called on the communist leadership to make a new proposal within 48 
hours 
central committee secretary gyoergy fejti told hungarian 
television he was surprised by the oppositions swift negative

two former tv news managers have been charged 
with illegally tapping into phone lines and computers at another 
station to gain a news edge over their competitors 
former news director terry cole and assistant news director 
michael shapiro at wtsptv were charged wednesday with 17 counts of 
computer hacking and conspiracy in the theft of information through 
computer phone lines authorities said if convicted each could 
face a maximum prison sentence of 85 years 
circuit judge edward ward scheduled their arraignments for may 
19 
the two were accused of tapping the phone lines and computers of 
wtvttv 
the breakins began in november but were not noticed until jan 
12 when wtvts morning news producer noticed that files were 
missing authorities said computer experts determined that an 
intruder had rifled the files 
its no different than digging a tunnel under their office and 
coming up and rummaging through their desks said assistant 
prosecutor chris hoyer its hightech burglary 
shapiro knew wtvts security system thoroughly including 
passwords and identification numbers because he had helped set it 
up while working there as an assignment manager authorities said 
he was hired away from wtvt in october 
vincent barresi wtsps general manager said shapiro and cole 
were fired when the station learned of the alleged thefts 
shapiro 33 was arrested feb 7 after an investigation 
implicated the 32yearold cole he surrendered april 11 
hoyer said he was considering a civil lawsuit to seize wtsps 
assets under the states racketeering laws he said his decision 
would depend on whether wtvt sued its competitor 
theyre the victims in this case and were waiting to see what 
they do hoyer said 
wtvts news director bob franklin said corporate executives 
and the stations lawyers were weighing the decision

iranian president ali khamenei said today iran 
still demands the execution of british author salman rushdie for 
his novel the satanic verses which some say insults islam 
khamenei speaking at a news conference also denied that irans 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani had called for the murder 
of westerners he said rafanjanis words were distorted by the 
western media 
rafsanjani previously regarded as a moderate who supported 
better ties with the west is expected to succeed khamenei when he 
finishes his term in office later this year 
the decision made about salman rushdie is still valid 
khamenei said as i have already said this is a bullet for which 
there is a target it has been shot it will one day sooner or 
later hit the target 
irans spiritual leader the ayatollah ruhollah khomenei in 
february said rushdie must be killed for writing the satanic 
verses which contains passages many moslems say are insulting to 
the prophet mohammed 
rushdie has been in hiding since the death threat was issued 
khamenei on a sixday visit to china also said rafsanjani 
has not recommended anybody kill anybody 
the iranian speaker he said was offering an analysis that us 
policies toward the oppressed people of palestine would only lead 
to such a situation 
in a speech friday rafsanjani reportedly called on palestinians 
to kill five american french or british citizens in retaliation 
for each arab slain in the uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories 
he later denied that he supported the killing of western 
civilians 
earlier today khamenei met with chinas senior leader deng 
xiaoping who expressed hope that iran and iraq which have agreed 
to a ceasefire after their eightyear war will live in peace 
all the third world countries should unite and refrain from 
wasting their strength on disputes deng was quoted by the 
official xinhua news agency as saying we also hope to see a 
stable middle east 
deng 84 looking frail and meeting khamenei for only 20 
minutes noted that china is also working for international 
stability 
khamenei also has met communist party general secretary zhao 
ziyang and premier li peng for talks that have included chinas 
participation in reconstruction of irans wartorn economy 
khamenei leaves friday for xinjiang chinas farwestern 
province which has a large moslem minority

a judge has dismissed criminal mischief 
charges against a man who claims he painted over swastikas scrawled 
in his apartment building but city officials maintain his story is 
a lie 
the city housing authority asked municipal judge joseph n falbo 
to drop the charges against jack stahl on wednesday if convicted 
stahl 59 could have faced six months in jail and a 1000 fine 
stahl said in march that he painted over swastikas in an 
elevator and a hallway in his housing project because the authority 
had ignored his seven months of complaints 
a threemember mayoral commission concluded earlier this week 
that it would be hard to prove stahl intentionally damaged the 
building but the panel said a paint expert and a commission member 
found no evidence of swastikas 
the truth in this case is that mr stahl fabricated a story in 
order to play upon the peoples fears of ethnic hatred to justify 
his own actions mayor robert menendez said wednesday 
furthermore mr stahl took advantage of the medias 
sensitivity to such divisive issues by using the swastika one of 
humanitys most horrible symbols of vicious hate and violent crimes 
as a shield to protect himself from further prosecution 
stahl does not have a telephone and could not be reached for 
comment

striking teachers voted by a wide margin to 
return to the classroom and end a walkout that has kept 10 million 
students out of school a union official said 
the vote ended a 3weekold strike by a dissident faction of the 
progovernment teachers union to demand higher wages and protest 
alleged union corruption 
an agreement between the union and the striking faction was 
approved overwhelmingly by the dissident teachers wednesday 
night said the union official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he did not give the vote 
the national education workers union and the dissident 
democratic coordinate agreed to accept a government offer of a 25 
percent increase in wages and benefits and to adopt anticorruption 
measures 
the federal education department also said it would replace the 
superintendents in all 14 of the nations districts it said the 
move was designed to increase efficiency but it gave no details 
the democratic coordinate claims the loyalty of about half the 
unions 11 million members and the strike closed roughly half of 
the nations grammar and high schools and vocational institutes 
the government had threatened unspecified punitive measures 
against the striking teachers but the union official said that all 
teachers who return to work will suffer no consequences 
the excelsior news service reported that schools would reopen 
nationwide by next tuesday schools in some parts of mexico 
reported that they were ready to open today 
the democratic coordinate struck april 17 to demand union 
democracy and a 100 percent increase in pay 
the teachers whose takehome pay averages 147 a month 
rejected the governments initial offer of a 15 percent increase 
the strike also led to the ouster of the unions chief carlos 
jonguitud barrios an oldstyle machine politician close to the 
governing institutional revolutionary party jonguitud and a group 
of associates had controlled the union for 17 years 
union dissidents accused jonguitud of mismanaging union funds 
and keeping his group in power by rigging union elections 
jonguituds replacement elba esther gordillo removed a major 
obstacle to reviving negotiations coordinate leader teodoro 
palomino refused to talk with jonguitud but said he was willing to 
deal with ms gordillo

truce in a 2monthold bloodbath in lebanon after rocket and 
artillery duels between christian and syrian gunners killed 20 
people and wounded 62 
gen michel aoun who commands 20000 christian soldiers 
fighting an alliance of syrian and druse moslem forces ordered his 
gunners to abide by the ceasefire a spokesman said 
there was no immediate public reaction from his foes but the 
voice of lebanon radio station in christian east beirut and the 
moslem voice of the nation the most popular broadcast in west 
beirut quoted reliable sources as saying the arab mediators 
conveyed the ceasefire order to both sides 
it was the fifth ceasefire called by the arab league in the 
current round of fighting the most desructive of lebanons 
14yearold civil war all others have collapsed 
thursdays casualties raised the overall toll to 357 people 
killed and 1385 wounded since the fighting broke out march 8 by 
police count 
the arab emissaries led by lakhdar ibrahimi an algerian 
diplomat braved shellfire and drove across the dividing green line 
to east beirut for a meeting with aoun at the bombscarred 
presidential palace in the christian suburb of baabda 
aouns spokesman who refused to be further identified said 
all roads to the palace were under syrian shelling a howitzer 
shell exploded very close to the palace as the arab delegates were 
at the entrance no one was hurt 
the mediators met earlier in west beirut with acting prime 
minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet in lebanons dual 
government 
ibrahimi told reporters after meeting with hoss that they were 
seeking to normalize the situation in lebanon to allow the 
committee to pursue its efforts a reference to a sixmember arab 
league panel entrusted with finding a settlement of the civil war 
aouns spokesman said syrian gunners fired 126 shells most of 
them 240mm mortars into the palace before the arab envoys 
arrival 
aoun 53 a maronite catholic had been staying in the bomb 
shelter of the palace with his wife and three daughters 
the arab envoys arrived in beirut on wednesday after meetings in 
damascus with syrian foreign minister farouk sharaa and in the east 
lebanon city of baalbek with lebanese parliament speaker hussein 
husseini a shiite moslem 
ibrahimi said the meetings wednesday were the first step of 
the new mission 
hoss and aoun who heads a christian military cabinet agreed to 
a threepoint plan declared by the arab league on april 28 
it called for a ceasefire lifting blockades of sea and air 
ports and the deployment of 321man observer team drawn from six 
arab countries 
but syrian and druse gunners kept on shelling the 
310squaremile christian enclave claiming they wanted to prevent 
three ships from unloading iraqi weapons for aoun the truce 
collapsed over the weekend when christian forces began returning 
fire 
syria and iraq have long been enemies and now are competing for 
influence in lebanon 
iraq backs aoun who has pledged to fight until syrias 40000 
soldiers based in moslem regions of the country under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate are withdrawn 
the latest confrontation broke out two days after aoun ordered a 
blockade of illegal ports run by the moslem militias the militias 
deprive the state treasury of about 100 million annually in lost 
customs dues

when a navy jet carrying a hydrogen bomb rolled 
off an aircraft carrier into the pacific ocean william lane feared 
he and others aboard the ticonderoga were moments away from death 
they were very nervous minutes lane said recalling the 
longsuppressed accident which happened in 1965 about 80 miles off 
a japanese island and 200 miles from okinawa the bomb mounted 
under the a4 skyhawk jet was lost in 16000 feet of water 
at the time my feelings were that if that atomic bomb goes 
off this is all going to be vapor were just going to disappear 
off the face of the earth he said in an interview in wednesdays 
the san diego tribune 
the pilot and plane also were lost despite the desperate efforts 
of sailors who clawed at the singleseat attack jet to try to keep 
it from rolling off the deck 
the word was passed that they would appreciate it they 
didnt say dont or anything else if you didnt mention it in 
your letters home and just kind of kept it quiet lane said in 
those days you more or less did everything you were told there 
was a great deal of patriotism on that ship 
the pentagon confirmed the accident earlier this week and 
government officials have told japan they dont know of any danger 
posed by the onemegaton hbomb which they said had not been armed 
lane a resident of santee in san diego county was a 
20yearold bomb handler on the ticonderoga at the time 
the carrier was on a break from war duty and holding a 
nuclearweapons loading exercise he said lane said the pilot had 
climbed into the cockpit when the carrier listed sending the jet 
rolling backward 
we saw the pilot look at the handlers as if to say there 
are no brakes or i cant reach them or something like that 
lane said 
when the plane hit the water the bomb separated from the 
fuselage lane said it was bobbing around with smoke coming 
out of it probably from the batteries before it sank he said 
the ticonderoga on which lane served was decommissioned in 1973 
another ship now carries the name

only three of the 16 flight attendants aboard 
united flight 811 whose side ripped open feb 24 and pulled nine 
passengers to their deaths have regained their composure enough to 
return to work 
most of the attendants who worked to protect the remaining 327 
passengers in the howling horror of the planes darkened cabin have 
not been able to return to work either because of physically or 
psychologically problems according to their supervisor 
the boeing 747 landed safely in honolulu after aborting a flight 
to new zealand 
transportation secretary samuel skinner gave the planes pilots 
and other crew members the secretarys heroism award in ceremonies 
wednesday saying the flight attendants overcame the deafening 
hurricanelike winds that swept through the cabin as they helped 
passengers deal with the crisis over the pacific 
skinner said that despite increased concern air travel remains 
one of the safest forms of transportation he blamed news headlines 
for sometimes creating the impression that aviation is unsafe 
but several flight attendants interviewed after the ceremonies 
were critical of the state of aviation safety and accused united 
airlines of cutting back in training and safety equipment 
the company denied the criticism saying it meets or exceeds all 
federal aviation administration regulations and industry standards 
the national transportation safety board is continuing its 
investigation into the incident following a hearing in seattle last 
month investigators have focused on a possible malfunction in the 
locking mechanism of the cargo door that blew off with a large 
section of the fuselage 
skinner handed out awards to capt david cronin of incline 
village nev 1st officer gregory slader of langley wash 2nd 
officer randal thomas of albany ind and 13 flight attendants 
in a separate meeting the airline pilots association gave 
superior airmanship awards to the pilot and copilots 
three other flight attendants did not attend the program but 
were to receive their awards later joani zumbrunnen manager of 
united flight attendants in honolulu said they were still 
recovering from the effects of the incident 
she said at least one has refused to fly at all and may never 
fly again because of the experience 
edward lythgoe of kailuakona hawaii who suffered two broken 
ribs in the incident said he returned to work only last week and 
still reacts with newfound anxiety whenever a plane gets into 
turbulence and during landing and takeoff 
flight attendant darrell blankenship of seattle who accepted 
the award with his arm still in a cast said a flying liquor cart 
jammed into him during the flight 
blankenship and lythgoe both said passengers and some flight 
attendants had difficulty putting on life vests which lythgoe said 
he thought were badly designed 
sharol perkins of honolulu said not enough oxygen bottles or 
enough megaphones needed to communicate with passengers above the 
roar caused by the hole were readily available to flight 
attendants 
sarah shanahan of kailua hawaii said she does not want to 
return to work until united improves its training for emergencies 
she said the airline has watered down safety procedures and 
training over the years 
ms shanahan who has been flying for 22 years said attendants 
used to have to undergo three days of retraining each year 
including an openbook test but now have only an eighthour 
session 
it makes it more difficult because you have to fly by the seat 
of your pants she said the corporation doesnt seem to think 
safety is costeffective 
united spokeswoman sara dornacker in chicago said the airlines 
no 1 priority is safety 
safety is good business she said noting that although the 
747 is required to carry only nine flight attendants flight 811 
had 15 in addition to one who was flying as a passenger but joined 
in helping with the emergency and also received an award 
she said the airlines training for flight attendants exceeds 
industry standards including eight hours of classroom work four 
hours of home study and added security training each year 
the quality of our training has never deteriorated and in 
fact we have enhanced it to improve proficiency over the years 
she said 
ms dornacker said safety equipment aboard united planes either 
meets or exceeds faa specifications providing more supplies of 
emergency oxygen than required 
she acknowledged however that some passengers have complained 
of difficulty in putting on life vests she said there has been no 
report that any passenger on flight 811 was unable to don a vest 
other flight attendants from hawaii receiving the secretarys 
award included laura brentlinger tina blundy jean nakayama ilona 
benoit and ricky umehira all of honolulu and robyn nakamoto of 
aiea 
skinner also gave awards to linda shirley and curtis christensen 
of san francisco and leonard jenkins of denver who was flying as a 
passenger but joined the crew after the door blew off awards were 
to be sent to those not attending from hawaii john horita of 
hilo mae sapolu of honolulu and richard lam of haleiwa

county judges have enacted a policy 
requiring drug offenders to name their suppliers or face additional 
time in jail for contempt 
some defense attorneys say the measure is unconstitutional 
forced and coerced information is suspect unreliable and 
potentially dangerous it raises serious constitutional 
questions said herb moncier 
the policy violates the fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination because it could indirectly be used to produce 
additional charges against the defendant said bob ritchie 
another defense attorney 
knox countys three criminal court judges adopted the measure 
friday at the suggestion of scott dean chairman of the areas 
metropolitan drug commission 
at least one judge said he would use the policy immediately in 
addition a juvenile court judge agreed to use the policy dean 
said 
the policy is modeled after one in columbus neb which is used 
with juvenile offenders he said 
under the program people convicted of drug offenses can be 
jailed for contempt of court for not naming their suppliers 
anyone who wants to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser 
sentence will be told of the policy if the defendant refuses to 
name the supplier the judge may reject the plea agreement said 
criminal court judge randy nichols

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is coming 
to make history the chinese ever wary of their northern neighbor 
are determined that history will not be repeated 
expectations differ as gorbachev and chinas senior leader deng 
xiaoping meet for the first chinesesoviet summit since mao gave 
nikita khrushchev the cold shoulder in beijing in 1959 
both sides agree that the may 1518 summit will normalize 
political and party relations strained three decades ago when 
beijing challenged moscows right to dominate the world communist 
movement 
both desire an easing of tensions so they can concentrate on 
their sputtering efforts to reform plodding statecontrolled 
economies abnormal relations along their 4300 mile border 
are not in the interest of the people of the two countries 
chinese premier li peng recently said 
the summit will give impetus to growing trade relations 
particularly across border outposts and to joint efforts in the 
development of siberia and northeast china 
it will mean more official contacts the soviet union will be 
able to better study chinas pioneer efforts in marketoriented 
reforms china now challenged by a prodemocracy student movement 
will get a better look at the bold political reforms gorbachev has 
initiated 
there will be more consultations on korea where both support 
the communist north and on cambodia where sovietbacked vietnam 
is battling chinesebacked guerrillas 
students who have demonstrated for democratic reforms also plan 
to take advantage of gorbachevs visit leaders of the movement 
today announced they would have a separate welcoming ceremony 
for gorbachev and invite him to speak on political reform in his 
country 
we have not ruled out a demonstration to express our support 
for political reform said one activist who has helped lead 
seven marches since midapril for democracy and a free press 
the chinese have been decidedly cool to the idea that the summit 
is another triumph for gorbachevs policies of international 
detente 
it remains to be seen one chinese scholar wrote in the official 
beijing review whether the soviet union can thoroughly correct 
its deeprooted bignation chauvinism and hegemonism under the 
guidance of gorbachevs new thinking 
the chinese say normalization of relations is important but so 
is winning concessions from the soviets especially on cambodia 
chinese leaders insist that improved relations will not mean a 
return to the alliance of the 1950s when mao tsetungs fledgling 
communist government was forced to bow to moscows ideological 
dictums 
maos disputes with josef stalin and then with khrushchev led 
to an irrevocable split in 1960 when the kremlin withdrew all its 
technicians from chinese factories built with soviet aid 
soviet revisionism was reviled by the ultraleftists of 
chinas 196676 cultural revolution after border clashes broke out 
in 1969 mao asked the nation to prepare for allout war 
war was averted but prospects for better relations after the 
cultural revolution were quashed by vietnams invasion of cambodia 
in late 1978 and by soviet military intervention in afghanistan at 
the end of 1979 
political normalization talks were started in 1982 but went 
nowhere because of what china calls the three obstacles 
afghanistan cambodia and soviet troops on the chinese border 
gorbachev has pushed hard for the summit he finally started 
getting a positive response from the chinese last year after 
announcing the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan reducing soviet 
troops on the border and agreeing to help get vietnam out of 
cambodia 
but as foreign minister qian qichen recently stressed there is 
still some way to go and some efforts to be made before the 
obstacles are eliminated 
deng 84 and semiretired apparently agreed to the summit

house speaker jim wrights top assistant 
resigned today a week after a newspaper published the story of a 
woman whom he had beaten and left for dead 16 years ago 
i wish i could rewrite the past but unfortunately i cant 
said john p mack who had the title of executive director of the 
democratic steering and policy committee and served as wrights 
chief legislative strategist 
wright who is in the midst of defending himself against charges 
of unethical behavior in his personal finances accepted macks 
resignation with sadness and regret in a statement the 
speaker said he never regretted giving this young man another 
chance 
in 1973 when he was 19 mack was the manager of an imported 
household furnishings store in a washington suburb when he attacked 
a female customer with a hammer stabbed and slashed her with a 
steak knife and left her for dead in the back seat of her car 
doctors said it was a miracle the woman recovered 
mack was convicted of malicious wounding and served 27 months of 
a 15 year sentence mack was wrights daughters brotherinlaw at 
the time and the speaker offered him a clerks job upon his 
release 
mack rose to become wrights closest aide as the texas 
congressman himself climbed the house ranks to become speaker in 
1987 
although macks record was known to many on capitol hill and 
several articles had been written in recent years about the case 
the story caused a great stir last week the story about mack came 
in the midst of wrights own battle against charges that he has 
repeatedly violated house ethics rules 
the washington post printed the victims story with prominent 
display in its style section pamela small recounted the gruesome 
ordeal in great detail and said mack had never apologized for the 
crime 
in his statement of resignation released by wrights office 
today mack said he was and will always be full of remorse 
to pamela small and also to my family all i can say now is 
what i have said many times before and to myself every day since 
this happened and that is i am sorry truly sorry 
mack said he had considered leaving the speakers office and his 
89500ayear job since last december but now its time to 
leave he said 
wright in his statement said he had hired mack as a mail clerk 
on the recommendation of law enforcement officials and of his 
daughter who had known mack in high school i was told he had 
served some 27 months upon conviction of a crime but was not told 
the details of the crime wright said 
my heart goes out to the young woman who was the victim of 
that crime so many years ago and i wish there were something i 
might do to be of benefit to her he said 
mark johnson wrights press secretary said mack told wright of 
his decision late wednesday 
john just decided that he did not want to become an issue 
said johnson

a yugoslav official denounced the 
detentions of more than 200 ethnic albanians who he says were 
jailed without charge in the troubled province of kosovo a 
belgrade newspaper reported today 
the daily borba quoted josip vrhovec croatias representative 
on the collective nineman state presidency as cautioning that 
holding citizens without charge is legal only in certain 
difficult situations 
kosovo is a province in serbia that has been plagued by violence 
involving the ethnic albanian majority and the slav minority the 
province has been under a state of emergency since march riots that 
killed at least 25 people 
vrhovecs statement to parliamentary deputies in croatia 
criticized the police action however as a member of the 
presidency he has played a role in the crackdown 
the isolation in kosovo represents the most flagrant the most 
radical form of limiting human rights vrhovec said according to 
borba the newspaper is considered among the most liberal of 
yugoslavias statecontrolled media 
police reports say 60000 ethnic albanians rioted to protest 
constitutional changes giving serbia more control to police kosovo 
where 85 percent of the 18 million inhabitants are ethnic 
albanians previously the province enjoyed virtual selfrule 
within the federation 
serbian authorities claim the amendments were needed to prevent 
alleged harassment of slavs by ethnic albanians 
opponents of serbian leader slobodan milosevic accuse him of 
distorting the ethnic situation to exert control over kosovo and 
elevate himself among serbs yugoslavias largest ethnic group 
about 800 protesters have been jailed following the march 
violence most receiving 60day prison sentences 
among those awaiting trial are albanian politicians businessmen 
and other community leaders accused of instigating the troubles 
a commentary in the current issue of danas the countrys 
largestselling news magazine said detainees are not allowed to 
receive visits by lawyers or family members and are denied books 
and newspapers 
meanwhile kosovo authorities have demanded an unspecified 
number of ethnic albanian regional deputies be ousted for opposing 
the constitutional changes and voting against official 
serbianbacked candidates for the regional presidency 
it is unacceptable to have in kosovos assembly a certain 
number of deputies whose behavior and statements are contrary to 
the policies of the communist party the magazine quoting daut 
jasanica a highranking provincial official as saying 
in the liberal northern republic of slovenia meanwhile 
thousands of students boycotted classes today to protest the 
jailing of a journalist accused of revealing military secrets 
about half of ljubljana universitys 17000 students protested

prime minister noboru takeshita met senior 
statesman masayoshi ito today but failed to persuade the 
reformminded politician to succeed him when he steps down over an 
influencepeddling scandal sources said 
local news reports said takeshita and ito a former foreign 
minister are at odds over itos call for an end to party factions 
ito in naming his terms for leading the scandaltainted party and 
becoming japans next prime minister also has demanded the 
resignations of all party officials connected to corruption cases 
after meeting more than three hours today the two liberal 
democratic party leaders said their discussions focused on reform 
of the party whose popular support has been deeply eroded by the 
socalled recruit scandal 
my feeling has not changed ito said i believe mr 
takeshita hasnt got a good impression of the conditions under 
which he would accept the countrys top post 
though takeshita was expected to ask ito to accept the party 
presidency he told reporters after the meeting we entered 
todays talks after confirming between each other that im not in a 
position to make any request today 
takeshita leads the largest of six major factions that make up 
the liberal democratic party balancing factional strength is an 
important factor in determining appointments to the cabinet and has 
become a widely accepted feature of the ruling party organization 
political fundraising a key issue in the current scandal is a 
major part of factional competition 
the discredited prime minister has admitted receiving more than 
1 million in donations from the information conglomerate recruit 
co and announced april 25 he will resign to take responsibility 
for the loss of public trust 
revolutionary changes in the partys way of thinking are 
needed itotold reporters tuesday 
ito 75 and diabetic has rejected a series of informal offers 
to replace takeshita citing his age and poor health but party 
leaders appear ready to negotiate with him because he is one of a 
handful of senior politicians untainted by the scandal which also 
involved insider trading 
three of takeshitas cabinet ministers have resigned and 14 
businessmen and exbureaucrats have been arrested for bribery or 
other charges related to the affair

a scientist claims to produce nuclear 
fusion in a jar at room temperature but few believe him and his 
application for a patent is rejected 
the story may sound familiar but it happened in sweden in 1927 
more than a halfcentury before two researchers stunned the 
scientific world with a similar experiment in the united states 
john tandbergs experiments seemingly were very similiar to 
the ones performed in utah said bertil wilner of the fusion 
research department at the royal institute of technology 
its amazing that his findings have been completely forgotten 
for 60 years said wilner whose father worked on the project and 
kept notes 
tandberg began looking into cold fusion in 1927 when the 
33yearold chief scientist for the electrolux co became intrigued 
with fusion experiments being conducted in germany wilner said 
two berlin researchers who were trying to produce helium for 
airships said they fused hydrogen into helium using a palladium 
catalyst but later they discovered errors that forced them to 
retract their claim of fusion 
the german scientists werent interested in producing energy 
since the worlds energy sources seemed inexhaustable at the 
time wilner said 
but tandberg immediately realized the energy aspect of the 
experiment and its potential importance wilner said in an 
interview 
the national patent and registration office refused to accept 
tandbergs application to record his experiment their experts 
claimed it was impossible to release nuclear energy through cold 
fusion wilner said 
soon afterward tandberg ended his fusion research and dedicated 
himself to other fields he later left electrolux still one of the 
worlds largest makers of home appliances and became a professor 
at stockholm university 
in march b stanley pons chairman of the university of utahs 
chemistry department and martin fleischmann of the university of 
southampton england announced they achieved cold fusion that 
produced up to 50 times the amount of energy they put into their 
experiment 
their findings were met with incredulity 
the latest scientist seeking to explain away their claims nobel 
laureate dr linus pauling suggested chemical reactions not 
fusion could have produced the heat 
pauling 88 of the linus pauling institute of science and 
medicine at palo alto calif said in a letter published today in 
the british science magazine nature that the palladium would have 
combined with deuterium heavy water to form palladium deuteride 
which is unstable 
after the beginning of electrolysis this unstable deuteride 
may begin to decompose either slowly resulting in an increased 
liberation of heat or explosively as fleischmann and pons 
observed wrote pauling who won the nobel prize for chemistry in 
1954 
but if they are right it could open the way to a cheap 
inexhaustible way to create energy in the same way that the sun and 
stars produce heat and light fusion derives its energy from 
forcing atoms of deuterium or hydrogen together the reaction 
produces an atom of helium a burst of energy and a neutron 
the work of pons and fleischmann bears a strong resemblance to 
the way tandberg carried out his experiments according to my 
fathers notes wilner said wilners father wrote a book on 
tandberg describing the experiment 
the book was never translated and was forgotten a long time 
ago he said which helped explain why the work stirred so little 
interest among contemporary scientists tandberg who died in 1968 
apparently never withdrew his claim of having produced cold fusion 
like pons and fleishmann tandberg used palladium electrodes 
placed in deuteriumrich heavy water wilner said 
according to the notes the experiment produced helium and 
energy but in those days it wasnt possible to record whether 
the reaction produced more energy than was used to initiate it 
wilner said 
there is no evidence that us researchers knew of the 
experiments in germany and sweden 
johan rafelski working on a fusion research team at brigham 
young university in provo utah was in sweden last month to report 
on the us experiments he seemed amazed to find that cold 
fusion attempts were performed all those years ago wilner said

already imposed some limits on what research may be done on campus 
we have prohibitions against using human subjects and doing 
classified or any other research that can not be made public

a member of the us observer team that 
visited panama said today there are disturbing parallels 
between panama before last weekends election and the voting 
scheduled for next february in nicaragua 
having just returned from panama our reflections are fresh 
and the lessons we have drawn have important applicability to 
develoments in nicaragua keith e schuette told the privately 
financed commission on free and fair elections in nicaragua 
schuette is president of the national republican institute for 
international affairs which with its democratic counterpart 
sponsored the panama observer team headed by former presidents 
carter and ford the balloting was branded as fraudulent by 
observers and the bush administration 
our experience in observing a variety of elections around the 
world is that the quality and intention of an electoral law is but 
one element of the critical determinants of whether an election 
will be free and fair schuette said the other two points of 
analysis are the caliber and organization of the opposition and the 
overall organization of government 
there are disturbing parallels too frequent to be considered 
accidental between these three elements in the cases of nicaragua 
and panama he said 
my own analysis of the current environment and i should note 
that the republican institute has just concluded a seminar in 
managua with opposition parties on the electoral process is that 
sufficient freedom of organization expression and activity does 
not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election he said 
on wednesday an official of the national security council said 
the bush administration reserves the right to seek renewed military 
aid to the contra rebels if the sandinista regime holds power by 
fraudulent means in next years election 
if it is perceived that they have stolen the election then 
our policy subsequently will reflect that nsc counselor peter 
rodman told the conservativebacked commission on free and fair 
elections in nicaragua 
the wider this perception then the stronger consensus there 
will be for an appropriate policy afterward rodman said 
the official was asked his reaction to the testimony of senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas who told the privately funded 
group on tuesday he would favor significant military aid to the 
contras if nicaraguan president daniel ortega fails to hold free 
elections as promised 
i have nothing to add to what was part of the bipartisan 
accord a couple of months ago that the administration does reserve 
the right to ask for such aid in the future if circumstances 
change rodman said thats not part of our present policy but 
the administration has not given away its future right to ask for 
such things if it seems appropriate 
the bipartisan agreement reached in the face of congressional 
resistance to administration requests for immediate military aid to 
the contras calls for continued nonlethal aid only 
asked by former sen gaylord nelson dwis commission 
cochairman what us policy would be if a fair election resulted 
in an ortega victory rodman replied i hesitate to prejudge 
everything we would do i think there is a presumption that if 
there is a fair election and we accept it as a fair election that 
makes a big difference in our attitude toward nicaragua and 
certainly our policy 
carl gershman president of the national endowment for 
democracy a private grantmaking organization that receives an 
appropriation from congress testified that the nicaraguan election 
process will not work and indeed will be a farce if there is 
not concerted effort by the central american presidents and by 
others who are concerned about the situation to insist upon fair 
rules 
so far the fear is that there have been certain cosmetic 
steps that have been taken perhaps to improve the standing of the 
government in europe and elsewhere but that there has not been any 
real effort to sit down and establish an agreement gershman 
said unless there is agreement on rules it will undermine the 
legitimacy of the whole process 
elections are to be held in nicaragua next february under an 
agreement managua made with the governments of costa rica el 
salvador guatemala and honduras

a lawyer for an indian tribe that gets 94 
percent of its income from oil royalties complained today that the 
three federal agencies in charge of protecting indian wells from 
theft are ineffective 
tom shipps attorney for the southern ute tribe said putting a 
request for action to the bureau of indian affairs the minerals 
management service or the bureau of land management is like 
throwing it into the atlantic oceans bermuda triangle where 
legend says boats mysteriously disappear 
he singled out the minerals management service as making so many 
compromises with industry over the years that it no longer 
effectively protects the indian owners of oil wells 
shipps testimony came during an investigative hearing by a 
special panel of the senate select committee on indian affairs that 
has been probing theft of indian oil and underpayment of their 
royalties 
shipps said the southern utes have been supervising their own 
oil wells for the last 10 years he and others urged the committee 
to grant more management power to the tribes 
the panels chairman sen dennis deconcini dariz on 
wednesday blasted the bureau of land management for what he called 
benign neglect 
its unbelievable said deconcini an i dont care 
attitude an i dont give a damn attitude i hope someone loses 
their job 
deconcinis comments came after a day of testimony by blm 
officials about their work in oklahoma 
he became particularly angry during the hearing when bob 
goodman supervisor for inspection and enforcement technicians of 
the blm in tulsa said he didnt call the fbi about theft in the 
oil fields because he couldnt find the phone number 
deconcini waved a telephone book over his head 
you couldnt find the phone number he bellowed ill show 
you where the phone number is its right in the front of the 
book 
deconcini turned to george brown deputy assistant director of 
energy and mineral resources with the blm in washington 
do you think mr goodman who cant find the fbi phone number 
is meeting his responsibility the senator asked 
when brown said he thought the agencys inspection force was 
fulfilling its charge to the indians deconcini raised his voice 
even further 
thats no more meeting the responsibility than im an 
astronaut and im not an astronaut he shouted 
goodman tried again 
i talked to the fbi in 1984 and got no response he said 
saying he left his name and number with the fbi but didnt get a 
call back and then never tried to reach the agency again 
brown said he thought goodman had made a satisfactory attempt 
the testimony wednesday concentrated on oklahoma although the 
committees probe extends to all states where indians have wells 
earlier jim sims district manager of the blm in tulsa told 
investigators for the committee that anyone who wanted to steal oil 
could do it because of the remoteness of wells on indian lands 
dale tunnell special agent with the blm in santa fe nm said 
the problem was further complicated by confusion over who could 
make arrests when stealing is discovered 
he said no one in the blm has the authority to do so on indian 
land 
nine inspectors in oklahoma are responsible for about 5000 
wells of which about 3000 are indian said brown 
he presented documents showing that in eight years the blm had 
discovered theft of 20490 worth of oil 
this also drew strong criticism from the committee which has 
discovered millions of dollars worth of theft in the six months 
its been investigating stealing in the oil fields 
fbi agent richard james elroy who has been assigned to the 
special committee said give me a staff the size of the blm and 
two years and id come back with a truckload of indictments

a woman whose daughters died three years 
apart under mysterious circumstances arrived at court today to 
appear before a grand jury one day after burying the second infant 
next to the firstborns unmarked grave 
paula and robert sims are the primary suspects in the 
suffocation of heather sims whom they reported abducted on april 
29 investigators said their firstborn loralei died under nearly 
identical circumstances 
mrs sims 29 and four relatives arrived at the madison county 
courthouse in edwardsville today to face a grand jury her husband 
37 was not subpoenaed 
police say sims told them that he believed his wife accidentally 
killed heather and loralei 
the simses accompanied by more than a dozen family members 
attended a private halfhour funeral service for heather on 
wednesday at the first baptist church in bethalto 
the infant whose body was found in a trash can on the missouri 
side of the mississippi river on may 3 was buried in nearby 
woodland hills cemetery 
two police detectives stood about 150 feet from the cemetery 
where they shot photographs and scribbled notes 
at the church the rev charles west urged reporters and 
photographers to stay far away from the building out of respect 
for the baby 
heathers body was in a tiny white coffin and an employee of 
the gray funeral home in wood river served as the lone pallbearer 
the simses held hands as they walked into the church 
cemetery manager bill helvie said the simses requested that 
heather be buried next to the unmarked grave of their firstborn 
daughter loralei who was 13 days old when they reported her 
abducted on june 17 1986 
the simses seem just like normal parents to me helvie said 
as he dug heathers grave wednesday morning thats why its hard 
to believe all thats going on 
helvie recalled that the simses visited the other childs grave 
several times and put flowers there 
remains believed to be loraleis were found near the simses 
home in nearby brighton where the couple was living at the time 
about a week after the couple reported her abducted 
the case was never solved though the couple are suspects in her 
death also jersey county authorities said 
the simses attorney donald e groshong of alton had no 
comment wednesday he said earlier that the simses denied any 
wrongdoing

the head of a genericdrug company told 
congress today that the food and drug administration is retaliating 
against his company for having started an investigation into 
alleged bribery at the agency 
roy mcknight chairman of mylan laboratories in pittsburgh 
testified to a a house investigations subcommitttee that the fda is 
holding up approvals of the companys products because this was 
one way to retaliate 
discriminatory treatment or wholly unjustified inaction 
continues to be the rule rather than the exception at the fdas 
generic drug division mcknight said 
rep john dingell dmich the subcommittee chairman said he 
will inform fda commissioner frank young personally that any 
retaliation by any fda employee against the firms or individuals 
who testify before us will not be tolerated 
dingell also said he will ask young to explain the steps he will 
take to assure that mylan and other companies testifying before the 
subcommittee will not be discriminated against by the fda 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said of the retaliation charge no 
one has had a chance to look into that he also said the agency 
has asked the inspector general for the department of health and 
human services to audit the management and supervisory practices of 
the generic drug division 
nearly a year ago mcknight took his complaints about arbitrary 
and discriminatory treatment by fda genericdrug officials and his 
allegation that bribes and payoffs were being accepted by fda 
employees to the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee 
the panel began an inquiry and turned over its evidence to the 
us attorneys office in baltimore for a criminal investigation 
so far two fda employees and a drug company executive have been 
charged in a wideranging investigation more charges are expected 
you would think that news like this and the increased scrutiny 
the division has faced as a result of this subcommittees 
investigation would produce a new atmosphere at the genericdrug 
division mcknight said on the contrary the agencys response 
has been business as usual 
mcknight said his company has been trying for more than 18 
months to get fda approval to make several drug products at its new 
plant in puerto rico the company already has approval to make the 
drugs at its morgantown wva plant he said 
he said the company was told by an fda employee that we would 
never get approvals for puerto rico the employee walter kletch 
appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena last week but 
exercised his fifth amendment right and declined to answer any 
questions 
investigators have said that while the investigation has turned 
up serious problems with the fdas process for approving generic 
drugs they have found no evidence that unsafe or ineffective drugs 
have been put on the market 
generic drug sales amount to 89 billion annually 
on wednesday charles y chang a former genericdrug division 
supervisor who has been charged with taking bribes said in an 
affidavit submitted to the subcommittee that favoritism was common 
in the division 
special handling of applications resulted partly from pressure 
by the larger more sophisticated companies said chang a key 
figure in the investigation 
favoritism that helped speed the processing of applications he 
said was not necessarily the result of illegal behavior but 
reflected in part highly personal arbitrary and often arrogant 
management 
he also referred in the document to examples of special 
treatment and said they were the result of continuous pressure 
put on the division at all levels by the industry through 
lobbying conducted by executives lawyers consultants and 
occasionally through political channels inside and outside the 
fda 
chang was charged earlier this week in us district court in 
baltimore with two counts of interstate travel in aid of 
racketeering he was accused of accepting a free trip to hong kong 
and furniture as bribes from american therapeutics inc a bohemia 
ny generic drug manufacturer 
he has agreed to plead guilty and has been cooperating with 
investigators said his attorney barry leibowitz

today 
the telegram of bridgeport conn and the hartford conn 
courant attributed the figure to unidentified sources today 
the star tribune of minneapolis quoted james fetterly a 
minneapolis lawyer for the hotel as saying the settlement would be 
substantially less than the 200 million in settlements from the 
1980 mgm hotel fire in las vegas 
a former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the 
dupont plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22story hotel 
which was packed with almost 1000 tourists more than 140 people 
were injured 
about 2300 plaintiffs sued for a total of 18 billion the 
hotel was cited for 25 violations by the occupational safety and 
health administration including lack of emergency exits from the 
casino where 84 victims died 
richard bieder whose bridgeport law firm represents the 
families of the nine connecticut people killed in the blaze 
confirmed wednesday that a settlement had been reached but he 
refused to discuss the amount 
the agreement reached tuesday is subject to approval by two 
federal judges the newspapers said 
fettery said if the agreement is approved about 170 defendants 
including those who provided furnishings and services in the hotel 
still would have claims against them

texas agriculture commissioner jim 
hightower under fire for his enforcement of farm chemical rules 
would lose much of his power to regulate pesticide use under 
legislation passed by the house today 
the legislation sets up a pesticide regulatory board headed by 
the commissioner meaning he will be only one of six votes 
the board consisting of experts in chemistry agriculture 
public health and the environment would take emotionalism and 
politicism out of pesticide regulation said rep rick perry a 
democrat 
the measure was an amendment to a bill extending the life of the 
agriculture department state departments and agencies must undergo 
a review every 12 years and are abolished unless the legislature 
decides to keep them 
the amendment was approved 8854 on wednesday after a bitter 
debate the overall bill goes back to the senate for consideration 
of the amendment 
this is an amendment that hurts farmers it helps chemical 
companies it weakens the pesticide protections of the people of 
the state of texas hightower said 
hightower a democrat has been criticized by some farm and 
chemical groups for enforcement of pesticide regulations and for 
advocating the sale of hormonefree beef to european countries that 
want it 
the texas farm bureau the states biggest agriculture group 
has even urged abolition of the elected commissioner post in favor 
of an appointed panel 
the pesticide board would give the commissioner the 
intellectual expertise the scientific expertise to make 
pesticide decisions perry said

secretary of state james a baker iii today 
rejected soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs proposa to 
negotiate and unilaterally reduce shortrange nuclear missiles 
in europe 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the us 
rejection seriously concerns us 
baker rebuffed gorbachevs offer in an unexpectedly long 
3hour kremlin meeting the secretary later described as a rather 
extensive and indepth discussion he told reporters and he and 
the soviets had agreed that we would continue to disagree 
agreeably on this 
the secretary said the united states would not negotiate 
cutbacks in natos lance missiles because washington believes the 
weapons have served as an effective deterrent to the soviet bloc 
shevardnadze meeting separately with reporters said gorbachev 
in a crucially important conversation had made a most 
important proposal concerning reductions in soviet tactical 
nuclear weapons in europe and a comprehensive resolution of this 
question 
in rejecting the offer shevardnadze said the bush 
administration had taken a very negative position and added 
this seriously concerns us 
the proposals made by comrade gorbachev contain some 
unilateral measures covering the reduction of tactical nuclear 
arsenals in europe he said 
the official news agency tass said shevardnadze had complained 
that the missiles could be used to deliver a first strike and that 
modernizing the nato stocks which the united states has proposed 
would destabilize europe 
gorbachevs offer of reductions appeared aimed at pressuring 
nato into dropping plans to modernize its 88 lance missiles most 
of which are based in west germany 
the bush administration says the soviet union and its warsaw 
pact allies must unilaterally reduce what it says is an advantage 
of 121 in tactical missiles before nato can consider beginning 
negotiations 
shevardnadze said both sides had agreed not to discuss the 
contents of gorbachevs proposal but it would be published in the 
soviet press friday 
the soviet union did not propose discussions on shortrange 
missiles which have a range up to 300 miles as part of 
negotiations on reducing conventional arms in europe shevardnadze 
said adding that gorbachev had however made unspecified offers 
to discuss conventional force reductions at talks in vienna 
on a more upbeat note baker said the two superpowers would 
resume talks next month on longrange nuclear weapons and a nuclear 
test ban he announced that negotiations on longerrange strategic 
nuclear weapons recessed last year would resume between june 12 
and 19 
he also said talks with the soviets on a nuclear test ban would 
start june 26 
baker met with reporters before flying to brussels belgium to 
tell the north atlantic treaty organization about his two days of 
talks his first visit to the soviet union 
nato itself is embroiled in a dispute over the missiles despite 
strong resistance from the united states and britain west germany 
is insisting on eastwest talks that would reduce the weapons most 
of natos 88 lance misiles are based in west germany 
baker appeared to rule out the possibility that gorbachev and 
president bush would hold their first summit meeting soon 
we agreed that we would further discuss that issue at the next 
ministerial meeting minister shevardnadze and i have probably in 
september baker said 
american secretaries of state and soviet foreign ministers 
traditionally meet in new york each fall at the start of un 
general assembly sessions 
baker met with gorbachev in the kremlin for about 3 hours 90 
minutes longer than scheduled us officials said 
baker said that in the meeting with gorbachev which ran 90 
minutes longer than planned he gave the soviet president a letter 
from bush expressing the bush administrations broad view on how 
they want sovietus relations to develop the letter also 
referred to the kremlin chiefs wideranging overhaul of soviet 
society domestic policy according to baker it emphasized in the 
strongest terms our wish to see perestroika succeed 
on other issues baker said the soviets gave us officials a 
list of people who will be allowed to emigrate the secretary had 
met wednesday with a group of dissidents and jewish refuseniks 
people not allowed to emigrate telling them washington would 
keep up the pressure to resolve individual cases 
the middle east also figured prominently in bakers two day of 
talks 
we think there may be a fair amount of common ground to our 
approaches to the middle east baker told reporters we talked 
about the idea of giving elections a chance 
that was a reference to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
proposal for elections in the israelioccupied territories the 
soviet union has called the plan an attempt by shamir to gain time 
to crush the 18monthold palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
during a picturetaking session in the kremlins st catherine 
hall of the grand kremlin palace before beginning his talks with 
baker gorbachev said everything will be on the right road 
baker then returned to the foreign ministry guest house to sign 
an agreement with shevardnadze on cooperation in combating 
pollution in the bering and chukchi seas in emergencies

hitching 40 belgian horses to one wagon 
is like killing a mosquito with a bazooka but paul sparrow says 
thats beside the point 
its the spectacle of the thing he said 
the original 40horse hitches were developed at the turn of the 
century to advertise the circus and at the time he said it was 
the most spectacular thing they could do 
sparrow is putting together a modern version of the big hitch 
and the zearing farmer says its still spectacular sometimes i 
almost get mind boggled by it he said i wonder am i in over 
my head 
after months of training the animals sparrow gave them a 
practice spin today on a 300acre plot on the sparrow farm 
it went off real well said his wife sandy sparrow 
sparrow said the last time family attempted a 40horse hitch was 
in 1977 when his father dick did it 
since then sponsoring money ran out the sparrows sold the 
animals and went back to farming 
we went all over the country rose bowl coast to coast 
said the son 
now thanks to a 120000 grant from general foods corp the 
sparrows assembled a new team the grant covers expenses of 
training and transportation to the only planned public appearance 
the great circus parade in milwaukee in july 
sparrow 34 said it takes patience and practice to arrange the 
animals correctly 
its like assembling a football team he said some 
animals are interchangeable and some arent 
hauling the wagon takes just a fraction of the horsepower 
available meaning theres more than enough energy to cause 
trouble sparrow said especially in a crowd 
theres no way you can make them crowd proof but you do the 
best you can 
sparrow said the animals are trained to think nothing of it when 
a balloon pops nearby or a band blares or a car horn sounds 
when you stop you have to stand there and not get spooked 
he said we drive right up to them in cars with the horn 
blaring 
sparrow said he can shout loud enough for the lead animals 115 
feet away to hear the commands but the hitch requires two pairs 
of mounted outriders as well one pair flanks the lead animals and 
the other is midway 
we had a 4yearold one time who darted right toward the hitch 
and would have gone under if it hadnt been for one of the 
outriders cutting him off sparrow said 
what if an animal midway in the pack wants to bolt right and the 
command is to hang a gradual left not to fear he said the other 
horses will provide the correct influence 
if one horse doesnt want to turn the others will push him 
and he wont have any choice

a spring frost in eastern france will mean fewer 
bottles of bubbly in 1989 the champagne producers association said 
thursday 
the group said it could not yet put a precise figure on how much 
production would be affected by the late chilling of the champagne 
region although about onefourth of the vines were hit by the cold 
in some areas practically all the vines were affected and it 
seemed likely that some vineyards would produce very few grapes 
the growers said 
vineyards in the champagne region are hit by damaging spring 
frosts about one out of every three years they said

its mississippi leader because he was born a jew 
jordan gollub of poplarville deposed as leader of the 
mississippi christian knights of the ku klux klan said wednesday 
he will form his own klan organization either under the name of 
southern knights of the great forest or gulf kkk inc 
gollub born and reared in philadelphia pa by jewish parents 
said he considers himself a christian he said national klan leader 
virgil griffin of mount holly nc dislikes his background and 
the fact that im against catholics joining the klan 
griffin said gollubs removal was mostly concerned with his 
jewish background 
the klan historically has directed hate campaigns against jews 
blacks and catholics but gollub said griffins faction allows 
catholic members 
i find it ironic that the leader of the klan was a jew 
obviously a selfhating jew said eric gurvis rabbi at beth 
israel congregation in jackson gurvis said gollubs removal as 
grand dragon points out the senseless hatred that seems to be a 
part of the klan i cant say its unexpected 
as head of the christian knights gollub has marched in several 
towns usually with no more than a couple dozen klansmen griffin 
would not reveal the name of his new grand dragon

retail sales rose by a lackluster 04 percent 
in april the government said thursday in a report cited by 
analysts as evidence that higher interest rates are taking a toll 
on economic growth 
the commerce department said sales climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 1399 billion last month after remaining flat in march 
and falling 04 percent in february 
the last three months sales were up 5 percent over the same 
period last year barely keeping pace with inflation said 
economist lawrence a hunter of the us chamber of commerce 
todays report is another clear sign that the economy has slowed 
far more than most analysts realize 
economists had expected a much stronger rebound in april 
anticipating a surge of between 1 percent and 2 percent on the 
strength of higher auto sales 
carbuying did increase for the first time since november it 
was up 11 percent following declines of 05 percent and 18 
percent but the gain amounted to only about half of what was 
predicted 
auto sales have been hit particularly hard by the federal 
reserves strategy of pushing up interest rates to fight inflation 
as have housingrelated items such as hardware building supplies 
and furniture 
what the fed was hoping was to cool off consumer spending 
while we still had an expansion led by business investment 
spending and exports and it looks like its going the fed way 
said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer 
bond prices which move up as interest rates move down rose 
slightly in trading after the release of the sales report 
still jones and other analysts said retail spending is not so 
weak as to push the economy into a recession retail spending 
accounts for about onethird of overall economic activity and is 
closely watched as a measure of overall growth 
excluding the automotive category sales rose a sluggish 02 
percent last month after inching up 01 percent in march and 
falling 01 percent in february 
i dont see a recession in these numbers said economist 
rosalind wells of the national retail merchants association i 
think the economy is slowing but only in selected areas 
the bright spots in the report were sales at department stores 
and specialty clothing shops buoyed by a longawaited rebound in 
sales of womens clothing 
purchases at general merchandise and department store were up 
10 percent following a 01 percent gain in march clothing stores 
reported a large 36 percent gain last month compared with a 05 
percent drop a month earlier it was the biggest jump since 
february 1987 
they must be jumping up and down and breaking out champagne 
bottles said economist sandra shaber of the futures group a 
washington consulting firm that industry has been depressed for 
so long 
shaber said womens clothing appears to be recovering from a 
twoyear slump caused by rising import prices and the failure of 
merchandisers to offer styles appropriate for women to wear to work 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years rose only 01 percent in april after falling 
09 percent in march sales of nondurable goods meanwhile rose 
06 percent following a 05 percent rise 
other categories reporting sales increases in april were 
gasoline stations 22 percent and food and grocery stores 07 
percent michael k evans an economic consultant in washington 
said the rise in gasoline sales is attributable to price increases 
categories posting declines included building supply and 
hardware stores 05 percent furniture stores 12 percent bars 
and restaurants 09 percent and drug stores 16 percent

during his trial oliver north contradicted 
the sworn testimony of a longtime george bush aide who says he 
didnt find out until august 1986 that north was assisting the 
contras 
the bush aide donald gregg the presidents nominee to be 
ambassador to south korea will face questions about the 
irancontra affair at a confirmation hearing friday before the 
senate foreign relations committee 
north who was convicted of three of 12 charges last week 
testified during his trial that he spoke to gregg in 1985 about the 
efforts of a retired cia agent named felix rodriguez working in el 
salvador to assist an air resupply operation to the contras 
did national security adviser robert mcfarlane know about mr 
rodriguezs mission prosecutor john keker asked north 
yes i believe he did north testified in fact i believe 
that once i had talked to mr gregg about it i talked to mr 
mcfarlane about it about the fact that he would be able to assist 
in that country 
gregg testified in a sworn deposition to the congressional 
irancontra committees in 1987 that he did not know until an august 
1986 meeting with rodriguez that north was helping facilitate the 
movement of weapons and other lethal aid to the contras 
in his courtroom testimony north did not say precisely when he 
told gregg about rodriguezs mission but north was responding to 
prosecutors questions about a sept 20 1985 letter he wrote to 
rodriguez 
the dear felix letter says rodriguez should approach two 
high salvadoran military officers asking for space at ilopango air 
base to service planes being used to supply the contra rebels 
at the time mcfarlane and north were preparing false responses 
to congressional inquiries by denying that the national security 
council staff was assisting the contras one of the responses said 
that north did not use his influence to facilitate movement of 
supplies to the contas 
keker asked north whether he showed mcfarlane a copy of the 
letter to rodriguez at the time 
i dont recall but as i indicated a moment ago i was put 
in touch with mr rodriguez by mr gregg of the vice presidents 
staff i mean he is the person who introduced me to the man 
north said from the witness stand 
gregg a former cia official was thenvice president bushs 
national security adviser during the reagan administration 
he and rodriguez had been friends since working together in 
vietnam 
gregg said rodriguez never mentioned his work with the contra 
resupply operation until aug 8 1986 even then gregg said he 
didnt pass along to bush rodriguezs complaints about the way the 
operation was being run 
when norths contrasupply network began to unravel after a 
plane was shot down over nicaragua on oct 5 1986 gregg told 
reporters he had never talked with rodriguez about the rebels he 
later corrected his statement saying he had forgotten about the 
august meeting 
gregg also can expect questioning from the senate panel about a 
secret plan approved by president reagan to slip more than 110 
million in extra aid to honduras in exchange for supporting the 
contras 
bush said last week that his 1985 trip to honduras was not part 
of any such quid pro quo scheme documents released at the 
north trial state that bush discussed extra aid to honduras but do 
not allege that bush tied the aid to contra support 
the president said the us government had no quid pro quo 
arrangement with honduras as far as i know 
however a 42page governmentapproved admission introduced at 
the trial says that in midjanuary 1986 the state department 
prepared a memo for gregg in advance of a meeting between bush and 
the honduran president 
one purpose of the meeting was to encourage continued honduran 
support for the resistance the contras said the document 
the memorandum alerted gregg that honduran president jose 
azcona would insist on receiving clear economic and social benefits 
from its cooperation with the united states

a former justice department official once the 
target of environmental protection agency protests that he 
undermined cleanup of federal facilities pledged on thursday to 
take strong steps against us government polluters if he is 
confirmed for epas no 2 position 
f henry habicht ii the deputy administratordesignate told 
the senate environment committee that he would be an aggressive 
advocate to see that federal facilities meet or exceed 
antipollution measures in the private sector 
as chief of the justice departments land and natural resources 
division habicht in 1986 and 1987 admittedly helped write the 
reagan administration policy that forced epa to negotiate with us 
government polluters instead of handing them orders to clean up 
their pollution 
internal epa memos at the time called the plan unlawful 
because it was more lenient toward government than private 
polluters and warned the double standard could severely damage 
epas credibility 
in more recent interviews epa officials said the policy has 
allowed the defense and energy departments to stall negotiations 
involving their facilities thereby delaying agreements to clean up 
some of the nations worst pollution sites 
asked at his confirmation hearing how he would enforce federal 
cleanup habicht said we in the federal government have to do 
what is necessary to bring the federal agencies in compliance if 
that involves the administrative enforcement process i would 
support that kind of action 
he said in disputes among federal agencies epa must be able to 
call the shots 
under questioning from sen max baucus dmont habicht 
acknowledged he could not speak for the white house on federal 
facilities cleanup testifying this is my personal position i 
cant say whether thats the administrations position 
but habicht said federal agencies are more willing than before 
to clean up their facilities and singled out energy secretary 
james d watkins as one who is interested in a strong environmental 
program 
he promised the bush administration will formulate and 
communicate to congress a program to bring federal facilities 
into compliance with antipollution laws 
habicht went to work after 1987 for a private consulting firm 
headed by former epa administrator william d ruckelshaus he is 
now at epa with the title of consultant to epa administrator 
william k reilly

international gathering ever in that isolated country a youth 
festival with an antiimperialist theme 
about 30000 people from more than 170 countries are expected 
for the 13th world festival of youth and students on july 18 in 
pyongyang said so man sul chairman of a preparatory committee for 
the pronorth korean general association of korean residents in 
japan 
about 20000 people from 157 countries attended the last 
festival in moscow in 1985 so said 
north korea has not held a major international event since the 
35th world table tennis championships in 1979 which brought 900 
players from 85 countries to pyongyang 
north korea had demanded to be a cohost with seoul of the 1988 
summer olympics the international olympic committee offered to let 
it stage several of the olympic events but the offer fell short of 
north koreas demands and it boycotted the games 
so said the youth festival would be the largest international 
gathering ever held in the north korean capital since korea was 
divided at the end of world war ii 
the festivals theme is antiimperialist solidarity and 
peace and will include representatives from the united states 
japan and western europe 
the festival first held in prague in 1947 is a major 
political cultural and sports event involving mostly communist and 
third world nations previous hosts have included budapest east 
berlin bucharest warsaw vienna helsinki sofia and havana 
asked about prospects for south koreas participation so said 
we arent so optimistic 
north korea has invited south korean radical students to attend 
in letters sent through the south korean government since april 
however south korea has refused to accept further north korean 
letters meant for radical student groups and dissidents 
the policy change followed an unauthorized trip to north korea 
by a south korean dissident the rev moon ikhwan for talks on 
national unification 
moon was arrested on his return to south korea on april 13 on 
charges of violating a law requiring all south koreans to obtain 
government permission to visit north korea the communist nation 
suspended all dialogue with south korea to protest moons arrest 
so said sports events at the festival would include the 
marathon soccer basketball volleyball table tennis gymnastics 
swimming and diving 
all facilities for the festival have been completed in and 
around the capital of pyongyang he added including hotels 
stadiums and theaters 
north korean officials have been quoted by foreign media as 
saying about 4 billion was spent on the festival so far

the cabinet minister in charge 
of largely unsuccessful efforts to draw black leaders into 
negotiations announced his resignation thursday 
constitutional development minister chris heunis gave no reason 
for his decision announced a week after he made a groundbreaking 
speech in parliament proposing that blacks be given a role in 
parliament in the cabinet and in the selection of a president 
on wednesday another senior cabinet member and national party 
leader home affairs minister stoffel botha announced his 
resignation saying he wanted to return to private life botha has 
overseen the enforcement of press censorship during the 3yearold 
state of emergency 
heunis the leader of the governing national party in cape 
province will resign from the cabinet on july 1 botha the party 
leader in natal province will resign sept 6 when a general 
election is scheduled 
there will be at least six vacancies on the 17member cabinet 
when it meets after the election providing an opportunity for a 
major overhaul by fw de klerk the favorite to succeed pw botha 
as president heunis unsuccessfully competed against de klerk in 
february for the position of national party leader 
two ministers of agriculture and economic affairs previously 
announced they would not seek reelection and the minister of 
manpower quit after being linked to allegations of financial 
impropriety de klerks portfolio as national education minister 
also probably will be vacant 
heunis 62 joined parliament in 1970 and has been a close 
associate of pw botha during the presidents 11 years in power 
heunis often was mentioned as a possible successor to botha but 
political commentators said his chances were hurt by his lack of 
progress in persuading prominent blacks leader to enter 
negotiations about powersharing 
some blacks were deterred by the governments insistence the 
white minority retain veto power over major decisions made in any 
new form of government other blacks say they will enter 
negotiations only if jailed african national congress leader nelson 
mandela is freed and bans on militant black groups are lifted 
heunis announced this week that a group of black mayors and town 
councilors had agreed to begin negotiations on powersharing but 
the 1988 local election that put these officials in office was 
widely boycotted by blacks and black leaders of national 
prominence have shown little interest in the socalled national 
forum 
under south africas system of apartheid the 5 million whites 
control the government while the 28 million blacks have no role in 
parliament and no voice in national affairs

britains new official secrets act got the royal 
seal of approval thursday even though it has been denounced by 
critics as a government assault on the publics right to know 
prime minister margaret thatchers government called it an 
improvement on the original 1911 act which contained 2000 
different ways of charging someone with revealing official 
information however trivial without authorization 
critics said the new laws major flaw is that it denies 
officials who leak information about improper or questionable 
government conduct the defense that they acted in the public 
interest or that the information has already been published 
elsewhere 
the law received the royal assent a final formality before 
taking effect later this year the home office said no date has 
been announced 
the 1911 law hastily passed during a german spy scare has 
given britain the reputation of being one of the most secretive 
western democracies 
technically it covered everything from the civil services tea 
intake to the fertilizer applied to buckingham palaces flowerbeds 
home secretary douglas hurd said the new legislation removes 
from criminal sanction the unauthorized disclosure of large 
quantities of official information substantial as well as trivial 
including disclosures which might merely embarrass or inconvenience 
the government of the day 
introduced after months of controversy and debate the new law 
codifies the governments right to secrecy in six specified areas 
covering defense the security services crime prevention and 
detection and international relations 
the only automatic offenses will be leaking or publicizing 
security service bugging telephone tapping and mail interception 
in other cases of unauthorized disclosures by journalists or the 
800000 civil servants diplomats and defense industry workers who 
have taken an official secrets act oath prosecutors will have to 
prove a damaging disclosure has been made about a branch of 
government 
the government says that by shifting the burden of proof to the 
prosecution it has enhanced civil liberties it also says the new 
law is an improvement because the receiver of unauthorized 
information is no longer liable to prosecution 
but critics say that by specifically excluding the public 
interest defense the government has set freedom back newspapers 
say the government will have little difficulty finding expert 
witnesses such as retired military officers to testify that 
publication was damaging 
what of the man who breaks down the door of a strangers house 
to save a child from fire asked john birt deputy director of 
the bbc writing in the newspaper the independent there may 
well be damage but what counts are the good consequences of his 
actions 
the new law retains the lifetime gag on members of the mi5 and 
mi6 intelligence agencies and continues to shield the intelligence 
services from any parliamentary scrutiny 
the government has drawn the cloak of secrecy even more 
tightly around the operations of the security and intelligence 
services says article 19 an anticensorship organization 
since coming to power in 1979 mrs thatchers government has 
mounted at least 24 prosecutions under the official secrets act 
compared with 34 in the previous 68 years 
in 1985 a jury acquitted civil servant clive ponting saying he 
acted in the public interest in exposing a government coverup 
surrounding the sinking of an argentine cruiser in the falkland 
islands war under the new law ponting likely would have been 
convicted 
civil libertarians claim freedom of expression has shrunk during 
the thatcher era they cite the governments increasing use of 
court injunctions to suppress news its futile threeyear battle to 
ban spycatcher a retired intelligence agents memoirs a 
police raid on bbc studios to seize tapes an attempt to suppress a 
tv documentary questioning the governments version of the killing 
of three irish terrorist suspects a ban on broadcast interviews 
with irish militants 
at a news conference thursday lord stockton chairman of 
macmillan publishers said he was very frightened that every day 
takes a step closer to tyranny the mechanisms of tyranny seem 
to be inbuilt in our society 
labor lawmaker norman buchan said he was concerned that 
secrecy is now becoming a kind of a habit of governments and as 
soon as you have secrecy in government actions tyranny is an 
almost inevitable consequence

president bushs nominee to be ambassador to 
the organization of american states said thursday that nicaraguas 
sandinista government has not met what we would consider 
standards of legitimacy in the first phase of preparations for 
elections next year 
there were in fact no direct negotiations between the 
sandinistas and the internal opposition groups over the content of 
the reforms that were to be made luigi einaudi director of 
policy planning for the state departments bureau of interamerican 
affairs testified at a hearing 
rather these were in effect imposed by the sandinistas 
einaudi said 
einaudi was among final witnesses in three days of hearings by 
the commission on a free and fair election in nicaragua a 
bipartisan panel supported by private donations that will come up 
with suggested guidelines for the february balloting the 
commission was established by the conservative world freedom 
foundation 
the commission also heard from keith e schuette president of 
the national republican institute for international affairs which 
with its democratic counterpart sponsored the panamanian election 
observation team headed by former presidents carter and ford 
after observing the elections in that country schuette said 
the lessons we have drawn have important applicability to 
developments in nicaragua 
our experience is that the quality and intention of an 
electoral law is but one element of the critical determinants of 
whether an election will be free and fair he testified the 
other two points of analysis are the caliber and organization of 
the opposition and the overall organization of government 
there are disturbing parallels too frequent to be considered 
accidental between these three elements in the cases of nicaragua 
and panama he said 
he said he had concluded that sufficient freedom of 
organization expression and activity does not currently exist to 
ensure a free and fair election in nicaragua 
that view was echoed by einaudi who said the united states was 
very concerned that the first stage of preparations for the 
election has in fact not met what we would consider standards of 
legitimacy 
he said the sandinistas appeared to have shown a complete 
unwillingness to open the system further when they empowered 
president daniel ortega to name all five members of an electoral 
commission made up of two sandinista members two opposition 
members and a neutral member 
ortegas naming of a neutral member in reality will make the 
commission an automatic sandinista rubber stamp einaudi said 
he added however that he is cautiously optimistic that the 
sandinistas may make changes to make the electoral system more 
palatable 
curtin winsor former reagan administration ambassador to costa 
rica and cochairman of the commission said that although einaudi 
is the ambassadordesignate to the oas he was testifying in his 
current state department capacity 
the nicaraguan elections are to be held under an agreement 
managua made with the governments of costa rica el salvador 
guatemala and honduras

a group of homeless men led by a monk 
who runs a soup kitchen has formed a softball team named the 
soupers and is taking on all comers with a price losing 
challengers must donate to the soup kitchen 
a lot of people have asked where is our home field as 
homeless people i tell them its appropriate we dont have one 
said brother denys cormier a monk of the emmaus monastic community 
who runs the downtown evening soup kitchen and is the teams 
manager 
brother denys hopes his team will help break stereotypes of the 
homeless as people either on drugs or alcohol and help put faces 
on the working poor he said there are about 6000 homeless people 
in this city of 125000 
teams that play the soupers will have to make a donation of any 
amount they choose if they lose but brother denys is hopeful even 
victorious opponents will pitch in and help the homeless 
the challenge has gone out to established teams in new havens 
softball leagues and at least two teams have expressed interest 
but brother denys said his ballclub will play anybody 
well go to florida if theyll pay for our tickets he said 
thursday 
the soupers plan to hold their first practice sunday after 
attending a weekly church service for the homeless run by their 
manager who will wear his traditional gray robes during games 
twenty homeless men have signed up for the team ranging in age 
from their early 20s to mid30s most live at the citys three 
homeless shelters and a number have temporary jobs several 
members of the fledgling team were top athletes while in high 
school 
some have had runins with the law and are trying to get their 
lives back together gordon 22 the teams captain is one of 
them after graduating from high school in waterbury where he 
played basketball and baseball gordon said he got into trouble 
because i didnt use my mind 
gordon who declined to give his last name has lived at a city 
shelter for four months and has lived at other times with an aunt 
he said playing softball should lift the spirits of the homeless 
men and show the community they are no different from anyone else 
some of these guys are really feeling bad because of the 
situation they are in they have not chosen to be in this position 
i think if you give them a little motivation they will have a 
better attitude toward things gordon said 
we dont want people to be afraid of the homeless added 
gordon a muscular and articulate man who is now earning about 40 
a day as a temporary laborer if they see us out there playing 
ball maybe they will think they arent that bad 
gordon said he expects his team to be very competitive 
a restaurant has already agreed to donate shirts to the team 
and other contributions of equipment or money are being sought 
some soupkitchen volunteers will be inserted in the lineup at 
times a reflection of brother denys belief that the homeless 
should not be singled out as somehow different 
while committed to fighting stereotypes of the homeless brother 
denys still chuckles at the thought of all the jokes that may 
spring from his fielding a team of homeless men 
when someone yells bums at the umpires he said our 
whole team will stand up

that he had tested positive for the aids virus 
sgt john j roantes 29 pleaded guilty on tuesday he could 
have received up to 10 years in prison a dishonorable discharge 
and forfeiture of all pay at sentencing wednesday 
roantes was accused of exposing a dental hygienist to the aids 
virus last year several witnesses said they feared for their lives 
when bloodtainted saliva sprayed around the room as the hygienist 
cleaned his teeth at a base facility 
prosecutors said roantes failure to tell the hygienist put her 
in danger of contracting the virus because she did not take the 
additional precautions called for when treating a patient who may 
have aids 
but dr jack stuart rosenburg head of the lambda dental center 
in new york testified for the defense that he had treated about 
2000 aids or aids virusrelated patients

president bush today decided to order up to 
3000 us military troops to panama and evacuate some american 
dependents from that volatile country informed sources said he 
urged allied nations to condemn gen manuel antonio noriega for 
election fraud 
adminstration sources said the pentagon was preparing to sending 
the troops from two bases fort ord calif and fort polk la the 
sources said one group of about 1000 would be dispatched 
immediately from the 7th light infantry division from fort ord the 
other he said would be drawn from the 5th infantry divsion at 
fork polk and would not arrive in panama for days because that 
is a mechanized infantry division and the men and their equipment 
will be transported by ship 
the actions would beef up the 10000strong us troop strength 
in panama with additional forces as one of a series of actions in 
response to the nullification of the panamanian election results by 
noriega and the postelection violent attacks against opposition 
politicians said the sources who had knowledge of bushs decision 
in addition some of the dependents of us personnel in panama 
were to be returned to the united states while others were being 
relocated for safety reasons from panama city and other locations 
to the us bases in panama a source said 
further bush was continuing talks with leaders of latin 
countries to support various intiatives they were undertaking in 
the aftermath of what many condemned as an election blatantly 
rigged by noriega officials said 
for example the president backed the call by venezuela for an 
urgent meeting of the organization of american states the sources 
said 
the president is going to take a whole series of actions 
said one administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the official characterized the moves as prudent 
measures to asure the safety of americans and assuare the united 
states can fulfill its commitment to the panama canal treaties 
earlier today white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush 
had ordered us military forces to prepare for possible 
deployment as he weighed a series of options against panama where 
rioters attacked opposition leaders 
our miltary forces that are involved are being readied for any 
possible changes in their status white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said in describing the administration stance a day 
after gen manuel antonio noriega nullified elections that us 
officials condemned as fraudulent 
we have an obligation to the safety and security of the us 
citizens in panama and we have substantial military commitments in 
that country we intend to meet our obligations 
there are also steps to be taken on the diplomatic front he 
sid 
the spokesman would not elaborate on us plans bush scheduled 
an announcement later in the day to announce his plans 
panamas electoral tribunal last night perpetrated the 
ultimate electoral theft in nullifying the elections fitzwater 
said 
he said bush and the state department today were conferring 
with leaders of latin american countries on the actions he plans 
to take we know they share our concern and that shared interest 
moves us to define the course of actions that will protect american 
citizens in panama and register our intention to stand up for 
democracy in the wake of sundays fraudulent election fitzwater 
said 
the spokesman said us objectives in panama were to protect the 
51000 american citizens living there to maintain the terms of the 
panama canal treaties maintain us interest in its defense 
establishments in that country and promote democracy and the rights 
of the panamanian people 
fitzwater also decried the soviet position stated in the news 
agency tass that panama was justified in nullifying the election 
the spokesman said that tends to throw cold water on the soviet 
talk of a new openness 
congressional leaders who attended a strategy session with the 
president predicted there would be near unanimous support on 
capitol hill for bushs decisions 
the president is proposing constructive steps in concert with 
other countries said sen alan cranston dcalif the 
president and his people are still consulting with leaders of other 
countries that are concerned 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan described bushs 
measures as preliminary adding who knows what may happen 
tomorrow or the next day or next week that will depend on the 
conduct of noriega 
house minority leader robert michel rill said the american 
response has got to be something more than just something 
symbolic you either mean business or you dont 
house speaker jim wright told reporters after the white house 
session that bush expressed the absolute determination to 
protect american lives in that we certainly do support him 
ambassador arthur davis concerned for the safety of the 
americans asked the 152 dependents of diplomats to move to 
military bases and embassy spokeswoman cynthia farrell said from 
panama that the move was underway 
cranston said it would be leaping to a conclusion to assume 
the us actions would involve military response although pentagon 
officials said earlier that bush was leaning toward beefing up 
the us forces in panama 
abc news reported that bush planned to send 3000 us troops to 
panama and was working toward a joint measure with latin allies 
pentagon officials who asked not to be identified told the 
associated press the defense department has been told bush is 
leaning toward deployment of 2000 to 2500 combat troops to 
panama to reinforce the american military presence there but the 
sources stressed today that no final decision had been made and 
that no execute order had been received 
it looks like its going to go that way sending down some more 
troops the source said but there is nothing definite and 
were not saddling up the ntire 82nd airborne 
administration sources said the 5th infantry division units will 
probably be dispatched with armored personnel carriers and only a 
small number of tanks one official said a mechanized force would 
be sent as a precaution in case the situation deterioriates and 
additional protection is needed to help dependents evacuate 
the sources also disclosed that a very small unit from the 
marine corps at camp lejeune nc might be dispatched via ship 
transport but declined to elaborate 
and the officials further noted that bush had the option of 
ordering an aircraft carrier battle group to the region by sheer 
coincidence the carrier america and six escorts departed norfolk 
va and two other ports thursday bound for a routine deployment 
in the mediterranean sea 
the group was told to stay loose they might have to hang a 
right turn said one official 
the america battle groups deployment was planned months ago and 
its departure announced publicly last monday 
one military official called the plan a show of force that is 
being orchestrated at the white house were not sure about the 
goals from a military standpoint besides our continuing concern 
about american dependents 
rioting broke out in panama following sundays presidential 
elections branded as fraudulent by observers and the bush 
administration the opposition claimed victory and noriega tossed 
out the election results late wednesday hours after armed 
civilians mobbed and beat several demonstrators in the streets 
including presidential candidate guillermo endara 
us military forces in panama are on heightened alert there 
are 10000 troops based at installations along the 50mile long 
panama canal 
in panama tribunal head yolanda pulice de rodriguez blamed the 
nullification on the obstructionist action by many foreigners 
alluding to the team of observers bush sent to monitor the 
elections

the claim they won the vote dependents of us diplomats began 
moving onto military bases to ensure their safety an embassy 
spokeswoman said 
president bush decided to order additional us military forces 
to panama and evacuate some american dependents from the country 
informed sources in washington said 
panamanian soldiers patrolled the capital and us personnel 
were advised to stay off the streets if possible and to wear only 
civilian clothes in public 
international condemnation of noriega intensified following 
attacks on opposition candidate guillermo endara and his two 
running mates by bat and pipewielding thugs wednesday 
we won and we will continue to fight said guillermo ford 
the second vice presidential candidate who suffered a beating he 
said endara is still president 
ford said he was taken to modelo prison where a judge sentenced 
him to a year in jail for inciting riot and attacking soldiers but 
he was freed a few hours later he had stitches over his left eye 
and cheek 
ford said the opposition wants to talk with the military but 
that would require getting rid of noriega because panama cannot 
have two presidents 
noriega is head of the 15000member defense forces and the 
countrys de facto ruler 
endara suffered a scalp wound wednesday requiring eight 
stitches his doctors issued a statement today saying his condition 
was stable and there were no neurological complications 
soldiers did not interfere during the beatings which broke out 
after troops halted an opposition demonstration to protest what 
international observers have called the governments theft of 
sundays vote 
davis and other officials said one of endaras bodyguards was 
killed and about 20 demonstrators injured the military said four 
soldiers were wounded 
opponents had hoped to rally international opinion against 
noriega and prevent the proclamation of his handpicked candidate 
carlos duque as president 
us ambassador arthur davis asked the 152 dependents of 
diplomats to move to military bases and embassy spokeswoman 
cynthia farrell said the move was under way 
you have these dignity battallions moving around town and 
targeting people were not sure who theyre next targets are going 
to be so rather than leave people exposed to possible attacks by 
these roving mobs theyre moving people onto the bases just as a 
precaution she said 
at the pentagon officials said the us southern command and 
defense department had not issued similar orders affecting 
dependents of servicemen there are about 14000 military 
dependents in panama of whom about 3100 live away from us bases 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said bush planned to 
announce he was sending additional us troops to back up the 
10000 american soldiers already in panama 
in moscow secretary of state james a baker iii said noriega 
has done everything he could to steal that election and when it 
became extraordinarily difficult to accomplish he declared it 
null 
either way you look at it it is a perversion and a subversion 
of the will the freely expressed will of the panamanian people 
baker said 
spain peru and argentina today condemned the annulling of the 
elections and britain demanded that noriega resign 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez for an emergency 
meeting of the organization of american states to consider actions 
against noriega 
in announcing the nullification panamas official electoral 
commission cited votestealing votebuying missing tally sheets 
and international interference in voiding the election the 
commission said nothing about rescheduling the vote 
more than 300 international observers including former 
president jimmy carter backed opposition claims that endara won by 
a 3to1 margin official results however had shown duque leading 
by about 2to1 
yolanda pulice de rodriguez head of the electoral tribunal 
charged in a nationwide broadcast that the outcome of the vote was 
altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners 
bush sent an uninvited us delegation to monitor the elections 
and the cia reportedly contributed 10 million to the opposition 
campaign 
washington began its campaign to remove noriega after he 
orchestrated president eric delvalles ouster delvalle had tried 
to fire noriega after the general was indicted in florida on 
drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 noriega denies the drug

attorneys for a judge and the state commission on 
judicial conduct agreed thursday to make public the contents of 
formal proceedings against the judge stemming from remarks he made 
against homosexuals 
the allegations cite comments state district judge jack hampton 
made in december to the dallas times herald and the associated 
press as well as remarks a court official in hamptons office 
allegedly made to callers protesting his statements 
the commission charges allege that hamptons remarks violated 
the code of judicial conduct which prohibits a judge from publicly 
commenting on a pending case hampton also is charged with 
violating the code that requires a judge to conduct himself in a 
manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the 
judiciary 
the agreement came during a brief hearing before special master 
robert murray a retired judge from san antonio appointed to handle 
the case hampton was not present 
in an interview published in the dallas times herald in 
december hampton said he gave a lighter sentence to convicted 
killer richard bednarski 18 in part because his two victims were 
queers 
bednarski was sentenced to 30 years in prison he could have 
received a maximum life sentence 
i dont care much for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys hampton told the newspaper ive got a teenage 
boy 
on the same day hamptons comments were published in the times 
herald he told the ap the victims were homosexuals they were 
out in the homosexual area picking up teenage boys had they not 
been out there trying to spread aids around theyd still be alive 
today 
the charges against hampton also state that when people who had 
read the times herald report and heard an ap radio network 
broadcast called hamptons office to complain they were referred 
to an attorneys office and told to have a gay christmas 
the commission alleges the court officials response was 
cavalier disdainful and undignified 
the commission announced in february its decision to initiate 
formal proceedings against hampton 
murray will report to the 11member commission then the panel 
could dismiss the complaint issue a public censure or recommend 
the judges removal

the tuberculosis rate in us prisons may be more 
than three times higher than on the outside federal health 
officials said thursday urging testing isolation and other 
measures to curb tb behind bars 
researchers with the centers for disease control cited a survey 
in 29 states where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 
100000 inmates in 198485 compared with eight cases per 100000 
reported among nonincarcerated adults in those states during the 
same period 
in some large correctional systems the incidence of tb has 
increased dramatically the cdc said noting that in new york 
state there were 106 tb cases per 100000 inmates in 1986 seven 
times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 197678 
in new jersey inmates had a tb rate of 110 per 100000 in 1987 
11 times higher than the general new jersey population in 
california the rate was nearly six times higher 80 per 100000 
tuberculosis a contagious bacterial lung disease occurs in 
about 22000 new cases each year in the united states most can be 
cured with drug treatment as many as 7 percent of americans have 
latent tb infections and about 10 percent of them will someday 
develop a case of tuberculosis itself 
persons at highest risk are close contacts the cdc 
said noting that tb can pose particular problems in prisons where 
there is often overcrowding and where the environment is often 
conducive to airborne transmission of infection among inmates 
staff and visitors 
the cdcs advisory committee for the elimination of tuberculosis 
is recommending tb testing for most new prison inmates and staff 
members with the possible exception of inmates just transferring 
through for less than a week 
the cdc committee also recommends new tests at least once a 
year rapid chest xrays for tbinfected people showing symptoms 
and isolation off the prison property if necessary for those 
with suspected or confirmed symptomatic tb cases 
the spread of aidsvirus infections may play a part in the 
spread of tb in prisons the cdc said aids weakens the immune 
system making patients susceptible to infections other people 
might ward off including tuberculosis 
aids tests should be offered to all inmates with known tb 
infections the cdc report said

elderly people suffer less depression and 
anxiety by the time seven months pass after a spouses death than 
do younger people a study suggests 
their reactions may be eased by a feeling that death is expected 
in old people and the experience of having lost friends and 
relatives before suggested researcher sidney zisook of the 
university of california at san diego 
they may also escape a stigma that can affect younger widows and 
widowers who suddenly find themselves single in a peer group of 
couples and perhaps perceived as a sexual rival by others of the 
same gender he said 
zisook presented the study of more than 300 widows and widowers 
wednesday at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric 
association 
he said the sample overrepresented white and middleclass 
people ages ranged from 26 to 85 years with an average of 61 
years seventyone percent were female 
the subjects had been married an average of 32 years and 64 
percent had lost the spouse to an illness lasting more than three 
months 
eightyeight percent of the survivors reported grieving two 
months after the death and those people tended to show more 
depression and anxiety than nongrievers one year after the loss 
zisook said 
that finding does not support the idea that active grieving in 
the short run helps longerterm adjustment he said 
to study agerelated differences zisook and coauthors split 
the group into 94 people of ages 26 to 55 175 people of ages 56 to 
69 and 77 people of ages 70 and older 
the oldest group showed the least amount of depression seven 
months after the loss as measured by three independent standards 
by one yardstick 11 percent of the oldest group had moderate to 
severe depression at seven months in contrast to 29 percent of the 
youngest group and 23 percent of the middle group 
the oldest group also showed less anxiety than the younger 
groups at two months and seven months after the loss

the navy will have 110 fewer f14 fighter 
planes than it says it needs by 1996 according to a study released 
thursday by a congressman seeking to save the grummanbuilt jet 
no matter how you slice the bushcheney budget it comes up 
dangerously short in navy aircraft said rep george 
hochbrueckner dny who requested the study by the congressional 
research service of the library of congress 
the report described in its introduction as a quick rough 
analysis concludes that the navy will have 417 f14 tomcats at 
the end of fiscal 1996 110 fewer than it has said it will need 
the study assumes there will be an increased demand for f14s as 
two aircraft carriers are converted from airwings which carry no 
f14s to airwings which carry 20 each and projects a loss of 70 
f14s during the period due to peacetime accidents 
battle lines were drawn last month when defense secretary dick 
cheney submitted his fiscal 1990 budget to congress which saved 
360 million by cutting orders for 12 new f14ds 
the f14d is the largest airplane program of the grumman corp 
of bethpage ny and company officials say if funding is not 
restored it will be forced to lay off 5600 employees

arms dealer richard v secord in an 
indictment unsealed today was charged with lying during the 1987 
congressional irancontra hearings by denying he profited from the 
usiran arms sales 
the ninecount indictment accused secord of giving false 
testimony to the special house and senate committees that 
investigated the usiran arms deals and the diversion of profits 
from them to the nicaraguan rebels 
the indictment charged that secord lied when he told the joint 
hearings that he foreswore any profits from the dummy 
corporations he operated with his former business partner albert 
hakim 
i foreswore them and left to mr hakim to do with it as he 
wished secord said in a statement irancontra prosecutors 
charged was false 
the indictment charged that secord lied when he said he gave a 
swissbased attorney only 400000 of his money to manage in fact 
it said 
when in fact he used the lawyer on a continuous basis to 
manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to secord 
a retired air force major general secord is already charged 
along with hakim and former national security adviser john 
poindexter with participating in the irancontra conspiracy 
he was the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted in 
the spring and summer of 1987 by the house and senate committees 
secord testified without limited immunity from prosecution before 
the congressional panels 
the latest indictment was returned by a federal grand jury on 
april 7 but was kept under seal until the end of the trial of 
former white house aide oliver north 
north was convicted last week of three felony counts but 
acquitted of nine others stemming from his role in the irancontra 
affair 
in a statement secords lawyers called the indictment a clear 
example of complete abdication of prosecutorial discretion 
the second indictment makes it painfully obvious that the 
prosecutors office is fearful that what little is left of its 
original case against general secord can no longer withstand attack 
in the courtroom 
the new charges show that the independent counsel intends to 
go to extraordinary lengths to find some charge however 
immaterial for which general secord can be prosecuted said 
defense lawyers thomas c green james e sharp and v thomas 
lankford jr 
as the indictment was unsealed today secord was convicted in a 
suburban virginia court of driving while intoxicated 
fairfax county district judge barbara kimble gave secord a 
suspended 30day jail sentence and ordered him to pay a 500 fine 
of which 300 was suspended said deputy prosecutor ray morrow 
secords drivers license was suspended for six months but he 
was allowed to drive between his home work and an alcoholism 
rehabilitation center morrow said 
the federal indictment charged that secord endeavored to 
impede the select committees from learning the true facts about the 
finances of the enterprise and his relationship to those finances 
by providing false evasive and misleading evidence while under 
oath 
the indictment ordered unsealed by us district judge aubrey 
e robinson jr charged that secord willfully and knowingly 
obstructed the investigation by the congressional committees into 
his role as a middleman in the usiran arms deals 
it said among other things that secord lied when he testified 
at the hearings that he had no interest in a company called korel 
assets inc even though he was a principal shareholder 
secord 56 is also accused of lying by stating that he did not 
share in the profits of the irancontra enterprise even though 
he earned profits from the operation 
each charge upon conviction carries a maximum sentence of five 
years imprisonment and 250000 in fines 
secord is lso charged with lying the committees staff by 
denying that any of the proceeds went to north 
independent counsel lawrence walsh told reporters that the 
charge relates to alleged lies about the 200000 fund for 
norths family in the event he failed to return from a trip to iran 
and about norths acceptance of a 13800 home security system 
the count accused secord of denying to lawyers for the 
congressional irancontra panels that he was aware of any money 
from the enterprise that went to benefit north 
north was convicted last week of accepting an illegal gratuity 
when he allowed secord to install the security system outside his 
home in great falls va 
secord and hakim are already charged with conspiring to pay an 
illegal gratuity to north

a senior military official accused 
neighboring pakistan on thursday of planning to invade afghanistan 
capture two major cities and turn them over to moslem guerrillas 
lt gen abdul haq olumy told a news conference the plan was to 
attack the eastern city of jalalabad and kandahar in the south on 
sunday 
the general is secretary of the national defense council and a 
ranking member of the communist party central committee 
president najib who uses only one name has repeatedly accused 
pakistan of armed intervention which the pakistanis deny 
pakistan serves as a base for the guerrillas who began fighting 
after a communist coup in april 1978 and the insurgents get most 
of their support from the united states china and saudi arabia 
olumy said 7000 pakistani soldiers and militiamen disguised as 
guerrillas had been moved to the border or inside afghanistan for 
the new assault on jalalabad and a smaller force was being 
mobilized near quetter to attack kandahar 
jalalabad the nangarhar provincial capital 75 miles east of 
kabul has been under siege since march 7 the insurgents made it 
their first major target after the soviet military withdrawal was 
completed feb 15 and they initially predicted it would fall 
within days 
military officials say the city has been hit by more than 
131000 shells and rockets more than 500 civilians have been 
killed and at least 3000 wounded 
earlier this week the army launched a counterattack and claimed 
the guerrillas had been pushed back as much as 25 miles on two 
fronts

marcus dimagio was determined to 
become a us citizen even though he had to take a whole day off 
from work at the last minute and travel more than 6000 miles by 
plane bus and taxi 
and he was late 
the native of chile arrived in a courtroom panting and trembling 
wednesday just as a judge finished swearing in a group of citizens 
he came in shivering almost in tears and looking very 
exhausted sonoma county clerk eeve lewis said he was about a 
halfhour late and the others had already been sworn in 
but superior court judge william bettinelli rewarded dimagios 
determination by administering the oath of citizenship to him 
individually 
lewis said dimagio applied for citizenship in sonoma county but 
moved to massachusetts before the immigration and naturalization 
service set a date for his naturalization 
notice of the ceremonys date was mailed two weeks ago but 
since it was forwarded from dimagios old santa rosa address to 
boston he didnt get it until tuesday 
dimagio said he didnt know how to change the location so he 
took the day off from work and headed for santa rosa on wednesday

researchers have been struggling for 
more than a year trying to find what malady is killing baby pigs 
and one veterinarian says he believes the deaths may be 
droughtrelated 
pathologist george daniels at the iowa state university 
veterinary diagnostic laboratory said the failure of laboratory 
tissue studies to indicate a culprit is a strong point in favor of 
his theory the deaths are related to bad feed 
it is possible the deaths come from poor quality grain 
containing toxins being fed to the pigs mothers he said 
the dollar cost goes into the millions its a tremendous 
cost said daniels 
he said the number of deaths has increased with the drought and 
with the related decline in quality and rise in contamination of 
grain the outbreak in iowa has been in isolated pockets not 
widespread and no figures for the number of pig deaths was 
available 
others believe a virus or a new strain of disease is to blame 
gene erickson of the national animal disease center at ames said 
that while researchers have been unable to pinpoint the cause of 
the deaths for more than a year this is not something to panic 
about 
purdue university has been studying a mysterious outbreak of 
baby pigs in wabash county ind where hundreds of pigs are 
reported to have died on a dozen farms 
neal wollen a veterinarianpathologist at kansas state 
university said a new strain of disease may be involved 
you find a group of hog farmers locally having a problem but 
it is not spreading across the state said iowa state university 
extension veterinarian james mckean 
mckean said scientists including those at the university of 
minnesota think the deaths are caused by a virus

fifty years ago long before 
satellites space shuttles and planetary probes work began on a 
national research center that would help make all those things 
possible 
nasas ames research center is celebrating its first 
halfcentury beginning with an aerial photograph friday of 2000 
employees arranged into a giant 50 
over the years thousands of top scientists and engineers have 
worked at ames developing sweptwing planes and supersonic flight 
contributing to the mercury gemini and apollo programs and 
tracking pioneers voyages through the solar system 
they have searched for the chemical building blocks of life 
experimented with plants insects and eggs in space studied the 
effects of weightlessness and looked for holes in the atmospheres 
ozone layer 
the two prominent features of ames have been outstanding 
people and the development of major unique national aerospace 
facilities said william f ballhaus jr director of the 500 
millionayear center 
space exploration was hardly a hot topic in 1939 when the 
national advisory committee for aeronautics predecessor of the 
national aeronautics and space administration founded ames 
research center named for naca chairmen joseph p ames 
when tensions mounted before world war ii the governments 
langley field lab in virginia was seen as vulnerable to attack by 
germany and a second facility was proposed 3000 miles away at the 
armys moffett field base 45 miles south of san francisco 
the threat from japan was considered but the site also had 
lowdensity air traffic good flying weather adequate electricity 
and access to the growing western aircraft industry stanford and 
the university of california 
today ames is in the heart of hightech silicon valley and has 
grown into a maze of dozens of laboratories wind tunnels and 
offices 
when i first started working here in 1971 during lunchtime 
id wander around in the various wind tunnels and laboratories and 
ask people what they were doing ballhaus said its 
fascinating like a technical disneyland 
the flight research building was put into operation in august 
1940 by the fall three wind tunnels were under construction to 
work on problems of theoretical aerodynamics 
when the united states entered world war ii the basic research 
naca emphasized was phased out while labs concentrated on immediate 
problems 
research on deicing airplane wings had started at langley as 
early as 1927 but the problem was licked at ames in 1944 proving 
the effectiveness of the new laboratory 
in 1952 harvey allen a specialist in highspeed theoretical 
aerodynamics was working on missile research when he developed the 
bluntbody theory which would later solve the problem of 
heating during a spacecrafts reentry into the atmosphere 
that theory would shape project mercurys reentry capsule and 
play a key role in the design of the gemini and apollo crafts and 
their heat shields 
ames work on highspeed flight helped lead to capt charles 
yeagers first supersonic flight in the bell x1 on october 14 
1947 eight years later ames researcher rt jones came up with the 
supersonic area rule which minimized drag on supersonic craft 
and allowed still faster planes 
in 1958 ames invented the lifting body wingless craft able to 
fly back into the atmosphere from space survive entry heating and 
land that idea eventually led to the space shuttle 
ames was given responsibility for basic research in life 
sciences in 1961 and began studying the chemical evolution of life 
in the 1970s ames broke new scientific ground with its pioneer 
series of space probe pioneer 10 launched in 1972 became the 
first craft to go through the asteroid belt and returned the first 
closeup pictures of jupiter 
four years later the search for extraterrestrial intelligence 
began at ames a program that listens for radio signals from other 
civilizations 
ames has had a big impact on the space program and on other 
sciences and it still is very important said ballhaus the 
work here is helping us understand the universe and our 
environment

gov neil goldschmidt and legislative leaders 
are asking voters statewide to approve a property tax formula that 
opponents say would take control of school financing out of local 
hands 
supporters say the measure will aid about 100 public school 
districts with inadequate property tax bases some dating to the 
early 1900s a property tax base is an amount a school district can 
levy each year without seeking voter approval 
measure 1 on the ballot tuesday would reset all districts tax 
bases to include whatever extra levies local voters have approved 
to make ends meet in 198889 
under the state constitution the tax base can automatically 
increase by up to 6 percent a year so broadening the base will 
make for bigger automatic increases each year 
supporters say this change is the next step in getting oregon 
out of a crisis that had schools closing for lack of money a few 
years ago 
the first step a safety net law passed in 1987 allowed 
schools in danger of shutting down to fall back on the previous 
years tax levies without additional voter approval however 
school officials trying to make budgets on 2yearold tax levies 
say they dont have enough money to cope with inflation enrollment 
increases and other needs 
goldschmidt a democrat and legislators from both parties argue 
that measure 1 will bring some stability to school financing until 
a new source of funds can be developed 
this is just a step as was the safety net toward equity 
said senate president john kitzhaber there are no losers in 
this only degrees of winners 
only about a third of the states 303 school districts are 
potentially affected by the legislatures ballot proposal they are 
mostly rural and relatively small meaning voters from the large 
urban districts are likely to determine the fate of their tax bases 
it tests whether people view schools as a statewide or local 
responsibility said john danielson lobbyist for the oregon 
education association the states largest teachers union 
clyde brummell of portland a longtime tax critic and president 
of the oregon state homeowners association said the issue is 
whether taxpayers want remote voters to determine their taxes 
the main thing we object to in the property tax is its simply 
no longer fair he said until the system is changed theres 
no need to go through with this mediocre approach 
passage of measure 1 automatically would enact a companion bill 
with 112 million in special school aid and property tax relief it 
includes 35 million for educating handicapped students 35 
million for districts with high property tax rates and 22 million 
to ensure no districts get less basic aid under the legislatures 
actions this year than they now receive 
the bill also provides 20 million with the aim of limiting 
homeowner property tax bills for schools to no more than 5 percent 
of income

nbcs inability to attract advertisers for 
a madefortv movie on abortion demonstrates that big business 
listens when consumers take a stand a crusader said thursday 
i alerted advertisers about the prochoice stance of nbcs 
roe vs wade movie and asked them not to sponsor it said the 
rev donald wildmon 
the united methodist minister heads the tupelobased american 
family association an organization that has successfully 
challenged what it sees as profane and morally objectionable 
material in magazines television and movies 
wildmons comments follow a statement by nbc president robert c 
wright in new york urging advertisers not to bow to pressure groups 
seeking to block the film that is based on the 1973 us supreme 
court case that legalized abortion 
in a may 8 letter to advertisers wright said he would broadcast 
the movie as scheduled monday without advertising if advertisers 
pull out 
wildmon whose association was credited with abcs decision may 
2 to drop crimes of passion ii from its primetime schedule 
said the latest action by corporate sponsors marked a trend to rid 
television of excessive sex and violence 
he said the association which has chapters scattered around the 
country was voicing similar opposition to other television 
programs and one coming up on nbc friday night amityville the 
evil escapes is in trouble 
the factbased roe vs wade stars holly hunter as a 
character based on norma mccorvey the thenanonymous jane roe 
plaintiff who sued dallas district attorney henry wade amy madigan 
plays attorney sarah weddington 
the abortion battle heightened when the high court heard 
arguments april 26 in a missouri case that could affect the 1973 
decision 
the movie is about the prochoice advocates who prevailed but 
it also portrays sympathetically the prosecutors who argued the 
other side though they get much less attention 
wildmon said wrights letter to advertisers asked them not to 
be bullied i am in agreement with that i dont think these 
advertisers ought to let nbc or any other network bully them into 
any program 
nbc has every right to air that movie and the advertisers have 
every right to help sponsor it and more and more consumers are 
learning they have every right to spend their money where they want 
to and that i think has mr wright very upset he said

president bushs chief spokesman on thursday 
criticized the official soviet news agency tass for a dispatch 
blaming the united states for election disruptions in panama the 
spokesman said it raised new questions about soviet intentions on 
improving relations with the west 
marlin fitzwater bushs press secretary called the tass 
account very disappointing 
it certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims 
of a new thinking a new openness in foreign relations fitzwater 
said 
tass in a dispatch from panama city reporting on sundays 
nullification of elections in panama said the action was necessary 
because the opposition directly instigated by the united 
states violated election laws and tried to rig the results 
through subversive actions 
fitzwater said these statements reflect a lack of changes 
that we all would do well to keep in mind 
while we welcome and encourage glasnost and perestroika the 
bush administration intended to keep in the back of our minds a 
very healthy skepticism about these kinds of things 
fitzwater said the soviets have yet to match words with deeds 
panamas election tribunal invalidated the election results 
saying the stealing of ballots votebuying and missing tally 
sheets made proclamation of a new president impossible 
the tass report asserted that supporters of opposition 
presidential candidate guillermo endara had violated election 
procedures 
they blockaded polling stations preventing ballot boxes from 
being taken to the commissions headquarters in good time tass 
said a considerable number of ballot papers were stolen or 
destroyed and several ballot boxes were burned 
tass said the decision to nullify the election appears to be 
extraordinary but the only correct one 
the tass story and fitzwaters comments came as secretary of 
state james a baker iii was in moscow meeting with his soviet 
counterpart to discuss arms talks and on the eve of a commencement 
speech by president bush at texas aampm expected to focus on the 
results of his administrations review of eastwest relations

the communist party chief of moldavia on thursday 
backed a proposed language reform in the republic and lambasted 
local party leaders for lagging behind the soviet unions fast pace 
of change tass reported 
semyon grossu spoke about the need to grant the status of 
official language to the moldavian language tass said but 
cautioned that the reform should not infringe on the rights of 
other nationalities in the republic 
speaking at a plenary meeting of the moldavian communist party 
grossu said change in moldavia is not coming fast enough and the 
causes for this lag are shortcomings in the work of the party 
organization the official news agency said 
he also criticized leaders of some grassroots political 
organizations for stirring up emotions tass said 
thousands of moldavians demonstrated this spring in the 
republics capital of kishinev demanding changes in official 
policy on language the economy and the environment as well as a 
crackdown on widespread crime and corruption 
in march the communist party newspaper pravda criticized the 
moldavian party leadership for adjusting too slowly to the 
republics changing political life and letting the protests get out 
of hand 
grossu in february condemned nationalist activitists for going 
too far but endorsed some of their demands to make their native 
language closer to romanian 
moldavian and romanian are the same spoken language but 
dictator josef stalin imposed the cyrillic alphabet after soviet 
troops occupied the region during world war ii 
grossu said work is under way to gradually reinstate the latin 
script still used in neighboring romania 
a draft law on the reintroduction of the latin script will soon 
be put out for public discussion tass said

a man accused of killing a bald eagle has 
been acquitted by a jury after a federal trial that was conducted 
much like a murder case 
jurors decided wednesday there was insufficient evidence linking 
steven lindell to the death of the bird whose carcass was found 
last fall in a ditch about a mile from lindells home 
lindell was prosecuted under the 50yearold bald eagle 
protection act which protects the species as a national symbol and 
provides for a sentence of up to a year in prison and a 250000 
fine 
two acquaintances testified lindell had bragged about shooting 
the eagle out of an oak tree defense attorney douglas thomson 
charged that the men were making up the story for revenge 
as in many murder cases experts testified about the cause and 
circumstances of the death the bird allegedly was shot in 
september but the carcass was not examined by authorities until 
several months later 
kent oakes a chemist with the us fish and wildlife service 
testified that he found evidence of lead on one of the eagles 
ribs suggesting it had been shot with a smallcaliber weapon but 
oakes said he did not know enough to say how the bird died 
lindell who did not testify said he could not have brought 
himself to kill a bald eagle i have feeders all over my 
property i spend 40 a time buying feed the 32yearold truck 
driver said

a former secretary in the 
chancellors office whose love for a soviet agent led her to spy 
for the kgb was sentenced thursday to 6 years in prison 
elke falk 44 was found guilty of passing more than 200 
confidential documents to soviet intelligence agents between 1975 
and 1985 
the documents included west german intelligence reports 
government and cabinet minutes and information on nato maneuvers 
ms falk who pleaded guilty said she started spying after 
falling in love with a kgb agent who recruited her to work for the 
soviets 
in passing sentence chief judge klaus wagner said ms falk was 
a willing spy 
knowingly and with open eyes she slipped deeper and deeper 
into espionage and caused great damage to west germany the judge 
said 
but wagner also praised ms falks cooperation with 
investigators after her arrest in march 1988 saying she gave new 
and important information about the kgb methods 
according to the evidence introduced during the trial ms falk 
fell in love with a soviet agent who used the cover name of gerhard 
thieme the agent was never caught 
ms falk told the court she met thieme in 1973 through a 
lonely hearts newspaper advertisement and considered him the 
man of my life 
the kgb agent gave her a miniature camera concealed in a lighter 
and a hair spray can designed to hide films 
ms falk worked in several government offices including the 
chancellery and the ministries of transport and economic 
cooperation 
judge wagner said the most valuable intelligence material given 
to the soviets came after ms falk moved to the ministry of 
economic cooperation in 1979 
they were not state secrets but they contained the 
governments assessment of the international situation he said 
wagner said the kgb paid for 23 vacations abroad for ms falk 
during which she met with her lover who left west germany in 1974 
for her 40th birthday the kgb gave her a gold ring as a 
present the judge said 
the duesseldorf court also ordered ms falk to turn over to the 
state the 5200 she received from the kgb

shortrange nuclear arms could be 
eliminated from europe if the united states and soviet union agree 
on reducing conventional forces a leading politician in the 
governing coalition said thursday 
west germany seeks eastwest negotiations on reductions in the 
battlefield nuclear weapons most of which probably would be used 
on its territory in case of war but the united states and britain 
are opposed 
officials in bonn said west german leaders who have pressed 
nato for a more favorable attitude toward reforms in the soviet 
bloc would discuss superpower relations with eduard a 
shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister 
shevardnadze met with secretary of state james a baker iii in 
moscow on thursday and is to visit bonn on friday 
about eliminating shortrange weapons otto lambsdorff said in a 
radio interview this is not possible today but it could be if 
conventional forces in europe were reduced to levels each side 
requires for defense 
lambsdorff is chairman of the liberal free democratic party 
junior partner in chancellor helmut kohls coalition 
kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher also a free 
democrat have called for speedy eastwest negotiations to reduce 
shortrange weapons the united states and britain say the weapons 
are an essential part of the western alliances efense strategy 
genscher flew to london on thursday for more talks on the matter 
with british counterpart sir geoffrey howe 
in a meeting two weeks ago prime minister margaret thatcher was 
unable to convince kohl to drop his demand for negotiations which 
has split the alliance just before a nato summit scheduled for 
brussels later in may 
in moscow baker rejected a proposal by president mikhail s 
gorbachev that the superpowers negotiate reductions in the 
shortrange weapons 
nato has 88 lance missile launchers most of them based in west 
germany the missiles now have a range of 75 miles but 
modernization would increase that to about 250 
shevardnadze is expected to address many topics during his visit 
to bonn including disarmament and relations between the two 
countries he will meet with both kohl and genscher 
before meeting with shevardnadze genscher will see baker at a 
meeting of nato officials friday in brussels 
a federal government source said we expect shevardnadze will 
be reporting on the current state of sovietamerican relations 
this area is very important and interesting for us 
in remarks to parliament on april 27 kohl said the west 
should support reform processes in all warsaw pact countries i 
urge our european and american friends to help carry out this 
policy and agree on a common approach

industry the rain forest cleans it up thats a singular service

owe brazil something 
depending on the estimates the amazon rain forest has been 
depleted 5 percent to 12 percent with an area the size of a 
football field going every five minutes much of it is being burned 
ecologists say the vast jungle as part of the worldwide system 
dubbed the lungs of the earth converts carbon dioxide into 
needed oxygen some ecologists warn that the loss of the amazon 
rain forest contributes to the greenhouse effect or global 
warming

what doesnt please me is the emphasis of that attention 
the search for a culprit sting said if i was a poor brazilian 
had no money no land i too would burn the forest so too would 
everyone in this room 
sting blamed the multinational corporations and the banks in the 
united states for bleeding brazil with fixed inflexible interest 
rates on the south american nations debt 
the reason is america is in debt also said sting

elementary school pupils set free 
7000 ladybugs in what their principal called an ecological 
alternative to an annual balloon launch 
balloons with notes attached are often released by school and 
community groups eager to see how far their messages will travel 
many wind up in fields and wetlands where the balloons can be 
fatal to foraging wildlife 
the idea to launch ladybugs came from agnes clift a school 
volunteer who works at a gardening shop that sells ladybugs as an 
alternative to pesticides clift said she bought seven 1000bug 
bags and donated them to the school 
chamberlin school pupils prepared for the launch by reading 
about ladybugs and discussing them in class on wednesday morning 
they took small plastic cupfuls of the bugs into the schoolyard 
where the insects flew away or were set on tree trunks or blades of 
grass 
i think theyre neat because they crawl all over and theyre 
good for everything said jason lockwood 7 
its gross they feel funny said 6yearold lucas dusablon 
its a new tradition that were starting principal rick

john p mack who resigned thursday as a 
legislative aide in the face of widespread public criticism over 
his brutal 1973 attack on a woman was a powerful figure in the 
tightknit world on capitol hill 
as a key assistant to house speaker jim wright dtexas mack 
was a visible staffer often seen buttonholing legislators on the 
house floor taking orders from his boss mack sometimes ran 
closeddoor meetings for democrats guided policy and sat behind a 
large desk near his mentors office 
when people looked at john mack on the floor they saw and 
heard the speaker said rep joe moakley dmass he really ran 
the procedural part of meetings added rep beryl anthony dark 
mack was not only a professional but a good friend and i 
think that expresses the views of many of my colleagues said

associates a business in merced calif coelhos hometown 
according to david dreyer coelhos spokesman the company is 
developing a system for managing dairy herds 
macks desk was empty thursday hed cleared it out overnight 
but the 35yearold former aides presence seemed to dominate the 
house where hed worked since his release on parole in 1975 from 
the fairfax county jail in virginia 
everybody is very depressed around here said rep barbara 
boxer dcalif 
though mack was sentenced to 15 years in the virginia state 
penitentiary for the malicious wounding of pamela small he served 
less than 27 months in jail before going to work in wrights office 
as a mail clerk for 9000 a year macks brother was married to 
wrights daughter

snowe drew a distinction between employment on capitol hill and 
elsewhere 
we make public law that makes a big difference she said

the aide resigned before she sent it 
i believe in rehabilitation but not when it leads to such a 
high position said schroeder the other cochair of the womens 
caucus 
rep charles wilson dtexas said there is obviously 
resistance to someone being a success 
we all believe in rehabilitation thats everyonee goal he 
said but society wants rehabilitated convicts to be carpenters 
and plumbers not highranking congressional aides he said 
apparently there was outrage among women members of 
congress said rep dan glickman dkan 
there was an immediate reaction that went nationwide said 
anthony chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee i can understand the emotional outcry i heard it 
from my staff we heard it in congressional committees 
but the former prosecutor said that under the countrys criminal 
justice system mack had paid his debt 
even so anthony said society is not quite willing to forgive 
at a certain level 
in a statement on his resignation mack said he had planned as 
early as last december to seek opportunities in private life 
anthony doubted mack would have any trouble in the outside 
world he will land a comparable job someplace the arkansas

missile is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to a target 
up to 6900 miles away 
the threestage missile weighs 37000 pounds stands about 52 
feet tall and is 46 inches in diameter 
the weapon is at the center of a controversy over whether the 
united states should develop one or two mobile nuclear missiles to 
deter the soviet union from attempting a first strike against 
missiles inside silos 
the soviet union has deployed two such landmobile missiles 
the united states none 
defense secretary dick cheney would prefer to develop only one 
a version of the huge 10warhead mx that could be carried and 
launched from a rail car democratic leaders on capitol hill prefer 
the smaller more mobile midgetman 
president bush recently decided however to pursue development 
of both the mx and midgetman 
the major contractors on the midgetman include morton thiokol 
inc and martin marietta corp

the bombings of two minnesota state judges 
homes 15 miles apart were connected authorities say and the us 
marshals service says threats against federal court officials are 
on the rise 
criminals think threatening the judge will solve the 
problem said bill dempsey a spokesman for the marshals service 
it kind of goes with the turf unfortunately said olmsted 
county district judge gerard ring who received several death 
threats last year after a controversial ruling in the case of a 
youthful ax murder suspect 
i dont think theres been a judge whos been on the bench 
more than a couple years who hasnt had some threats or harassment 
of some kind said anoka county district judge lynn olson 
most of us dont take it very seriously and perhaps we ought 
to said olson who is president of the minnesota district judges 
association 
authorities announced monday that an april 26 blast that 
severely damaged the blooming prairie home of freeborn county 
district judge james mork was caused by a bomb the judge his 
wife and an 18yearold son were home but escaped injury police 
chief terry bredeck estimated damage at more than 80000 
fifteen miles away on may 29 1988 an explosion and fire 
destroyed mower county district court judge william nierengartens 
home in austin no one was home at the time 
both judges serve in southeastern minnesotas third judicial 
district 
we can certainly link the two theres no question of it 
said pete mastin special agent in charge of the st paul office of 
the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
steele county sheriff bill hildebrandt said both explosions 
caused the same crater effect or concussion pattern and both 
blew inward into the houses blooming prairie is in steele county 
there have been no arrests and police say they know of no 
motive for the two bombings 
nierengarten does not speak about the incident his law clerk 
said mork would not comment except to express confidence in the 
investigation 
by the grace of god we survived the explosion and we are 
thankful for that we intend to stand firm and move forward with 
our lives mork said 
meanwhile threats against federal court officials are 
increasing said dempsey of the marshals service which has 
protected federal judges for nearly 200 years 
at any one time through the united states we have at least one 
federal judge under 24hour protection dempsey said 
in 1983 119 threats were received against federal judges 
attorneys jurors and witnesses dempsey said by 1988 the number 
had risen to 213 and 152 threats were reported in the first six 
months of fiscal 1989 he said 
dempsey attributes the increase to aggressive law enforcement 
and increased crime particularly in drug trafficking 
theres a substantial effort throughout the nation of getting 
the criminal off the street and to win the war against drugs and 
put the drug pushers away he said 
as for threats against state court judges the national center 
for state courts in williamsburg va does not have statistics 
but phillip lattimore a center staff associate said i think 
there is a general trend across the country for state courts to be 
more security conscious especially judges 
in several recent cases 
us attorney leon kellner in miami was temporarily moved from 
his home and placed under tightened security in 1987 after us 
officials in colombia reported a threat against his life kellner 
was prosecuting carlos lehder rivas one of the leaders of 
colombias cocainesmuggling medellin cartel 
us district judge richard daronco was slain may 21 1988 at 
his home in pelham ny just north of new york city by a former 
new york city policeman embittered by daroncos dismissal of his 
daughters lawsuit 
in another minnesota case albert bolstad was accused in 1987 
of kidnapping and raping a girl out of revenge against winona 
county attorney julius gernes one of her relatives gernes had 
twice helped prosecute bolstad and his brother 
were in an adversarial system gernes said if youre 
going to be a forceful advocate youre going to in some 
individuals create hostility which manifests itself in assaults or 
threats or worse

strong swirling winds called a dust devil 
tore a giant 18 million antidrug radar balloon from its moorings 
causing extensive but repairable damage a customs service official 
said thursday 
jerry young chief of the customs aviation branch office in 
tucson said an investigative panel will try this weekend to 
reconstruct what happened wednesday to the 6ton aerostat 
the blimplike helium balloon is made of lightweight and highly 
resistant thin materials and is 245 feet long and 72 feet in 
diameter 
i think it ripped itself apart by being moored on a pad with a 
tremendous amount of wind force associated with one of these dust 
devils said young 
a dust devil a whirlwind or miniature tornado struck the 
balloon which carries a sophisticated 3500pound lookdown radar 
package underneath and tore it from its mooring pad and caused it 
to deflate rapidly he said 
officials said the balloon which can be tethered up to 10000 
feet in the air was down because of high winds 
the aerostat deployed last june and tethered at the armys fort 
huachuca in sierra vista is definitely repairable weve already 
determined that young said 
no one was injured and there was no damage to other property 
the service says radar coverage is continuing

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev challenged 
the united states and its nato allies thursday with two bold 
weaponsreductions proposals as secretary of state james a baker 
rejected negotiations over nuclear missiles in europe 
gorbachev offered to cut soviet stockpiles of battlefield 
nuclear weapons but baker called the offer a good step a 
small step a modest move 
there has to be a little less of an imbalance baker said 
reiterating the us assessment that the soviets have a 121 
advantage in european shortrange nuclear missiles 
tass the official soviet news agency said that the soviets 
would withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from eastern europe 
this year and that the kremlin is prepared to pull out all nuclear 
munitions from eastern europe by 1991 if the united states 
engineers equivalent steps in western europe 
a senior us official flying with baker to brussels and a 
briefing for nato ministers said the soviets announced they would 
take out of service this year 284 shortrange missiles 166 nuclear 
bombs carried aboard airplanes and 50 nuclear artillery shells 
along with the request to discuss joint reductions in missile 
stocks gorbachev moved boldly on conventional arms cuts 
he told baker during their 3hour meeting at the kremlin 
bakers first since becoming secretary that the soviets would 
offer in exchange for nato reductions to cut warsaw pact tanks by 
40000 combat aircraft by 42000 and artillery pieces by 47000 
the us official who demanded anonymity said gorbachev also 
proposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both alliances and a 55 
percent cutback in natos combat aircraft 
by 1997 the official said gorbachev aims for equal levels of 
135 million troops in the two alliances 1500 strike aircraft 
20000 tanks 1700 helicopters 24000 artillery pieces and 28000 
combat vehicles 
the soviet conventional arms proposal will be presented formally 
friday at natowarsaw pact negotiations in vienna 
baker declined to evaluate the conventional arms proposal the 
us official said baker told gorbachev it would be up to the nato 
alliance to reply 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze summoned foreign 
ministers from the six warsaw pact nations to moscow for a late 
thursday meeting on the conventional arms offer the us official 
said 
gorbachevs announced reductions in soviet tactical nuclear 
weapons appeared aimed at pressuring the north atlantic treaty 
organization to drop plans to modernize its arsenal of 700 lance 
missiles and 88 launchers most in west germany 
west german chancellor helmut kohl backed by several nato 
allies has demanded the negotiations baker rejected foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher is expected to renew the plea when 
he meets with baker on friday at nato headquarters 
baker who will return to washington friday night is striving 
to resolve the dispute with west germany before or at least 
during the nato summit meeting may 2930 in brussels president 
bush will attend with the leaders of the 15 other nato countries 
as for the soviet missile cutbacks baker noted that nato had on 
its own eliminated 2400 nuclear weapons since 1979 only now is 
the soviet union announcing cuts of its own amounting to 5 percent 
of its 10000weapon arsenal 
shevardnadze who met separately with reporters in moscow 
called gorbachevs request for talks on further nuclear weapons 
cutbacks a most important initiative designed to produce a 
comprehensive resolution of this question 
he said that the bush administration position on such talks was 
very negative and added this seriously concerns us 
the soviets contend that the lance missiles could be used to 
deliver a firststrike attack and that their modernization would 
destabilize europe 
baker called his discussions with gorbachev rather extensive 
and indepth he said he and the soviets had agreed to continue 
to disagree agreeably 
the disagreement on tactical nuclear arms discussions contrasted 
with an apparent improvement in ussoviet relations resulting 
from bakers trip 
on two regional fronts there was apparent progress baker 
reported that the soviets would cooperate in peace efforts in 
central america and that the talks with gorbachev made him 
optimistic that soviet military aid to the marxist government of 
nicaragua would be reduced from the current level of about 500 
million dollars a year 
in the middle east baker said we think there may be a fair 
amount of common ground on an israeli proposal to hold elections 
among the 14 million palestinians who live on the west bank and 
gaza strip 
he said the soviets would help try to persuade arabs and 
israelis to convert the election process into a broader peace 
effort 
on human rights baker left moscow with a list of jewish 
refuseniks who are being allowed to emigrate after years of wating 
baker did not say how many would be allowed to emigrate as a 
result of the talks with gorbachev and shevardnadze but 
indications were about 100 families would be allowed to go 
baker pledged to keep working on behalf of 400 to 500 other 
families who are still waiting state department officials said 
they had a list of about 600 refusenik families 
the secretary also noted that the two sides had agreed to resume 
negotiations in geneva next month to reduce longrange nuclear 
weapons and on their space defense programs 
baker said the talks would be reopened between june 1219 with 
the date to be set later 
the two sides also agreed to resume talks on a nuclear test ban 
on june 26

uncle sam has become the employer of last resort 
in expensive places such as boston new york new jersey san 
francisco and washington as quality workers are drawn to 
highpaying private sector jobs according to a group of federal 
employees in massachusetts 
the us office of personnel management says it is considering 
pay scales that are more market sensitive 
private sector salaries rose 228 percent from 1984 to 1987 
while federal pay rates increased only 105 percent according to a 
report from the boston federal executive board which represents 
27000 federal employees who earned an average 21724 in 1987 
the significant pay disparity severely reduces the 
governments ability to attract and retain good and bright 
employees who can provide quality timely and reliable public 
goods and services the report said 
the boston report follows similar studies by boards in new york 
and new jersey last year that found the inability to hire a quality 
workforce has hindered federal agencies 
boston is one of the nations most expensive cities to live in 
it has had one of the highest rates of inflation throughout the 
1980s and home prices and auto insurance rates are among the 
highest in the country 
boston also has one of the tightest labor markets costs 
associated with employee turnover and recruitment in the boston 
area amounted to 60 million or nearly 10 percent of the areas 
federal payroll the report said 
carl brauer a past head of the publicprivate careers project 
at harvard universitys john f kennedy school of government said 
low pay is one of many factors contributing to low morale among 
federal employees 
the system now has such serious problems its worrisome he 
said 
but it would be difficult to raise the salaries of the rank and 
file bureaucrats without first raising legislative and judicial 
salaries those salaries put a ceiling on everything else 
brauer said 
a proposed 50 percent salary increase for members of congress 
federal judges and highranking federal executives got a poor 
public reaction and was defeated last winter 
the report urges broadbased legislation to grant the office of 
personnel management the authority to regulate federal salaries and 
keep them in line with shifting labor market and recruitment 
conditions marketbased pay cost of living differentials and 
recruitment bonuses are among other board recommendations 
barry shapiro the opms deputy director for pay programs 
acknowledged that salaries are partly to blame for difficulties 
filling positions with qualified candidates he said the opm 
already is considering restructuring the federal pay system to 
consider regional costofliving factors 
what were looking into is coming into some alternative 
approaches for redesigning the system so it would be more market 
sensitive he said the pay should be more consistent with 
the demand for that occupation in a given area

the ford foundation said thursday the nations 
welfare system needs a 29 billion overhaul to expand the social 
safety net with services like treatment on demand for drug and 
alcohol problems and longterm care for the elderly 
other recommendations include expanding the head start program 
for 3 and 4 year olds assuring all pregnant women access to 
prenatal and wellbaby care raising the minimum wage and requiring 
welfare recipients to work after receiving benefits for a certain 
period of time 
the foundations report the common good social welfare and 
the american future is the result of a threeyear 3 million 
study by a panel of business civic labor and civil rights leaders 
and educators 
the current social welfare system is out of date and severe 
gaps in protection and opportunity for millions of americans 
remain said irving s shapiro panel chairman the current 
system leaves too many people dependent and vulnerable at 
critical stages in their lives he said 
the panel recommends financing the broad array of additional 
welfare education and health care benefits by taxing social 
security benefits that exceed recipients lifetime contributions 
such a tax would raise more than half the 29 billion annual cost 
of the recommended programs 
the federal government now spends 500 billion a year on social 
programs 
the report proposes spending 62 billion in federal support to 
expand programs such as women infants and children head start and 
medicaid all pregnant women would have access to prenatal and 
wellbaby clinics and 900000 more 3 and 4yearolds would 
participate in the head start program 
states and local governments would be encouraged to begin and 
strengthen programs to combat teen pregnancies to reduce the high 
school dropout rate and coordinate training and youth guidance 
programs 
about 1 billion would be spent to provide drug and alcohol 
treatment on demand 
also the estimated 37 million uninsured would be covered by 
health insurance through a blending of employerbased insurance and 
an expansion of medicaid employers who did not offer a basic 
package of health insurance to its workers would be required to 
contribute to a public fund that would finance coverage for those 
not working and uninsured 
the panels plan would permit unemployed people to receive 
lumpsum payments so they can relocate to areas of greater 
employment opportunities and the minimum wage would be raised to 
restore the purchasing power of the 1981 level

an improperly supervised police training 
session on the effects of alcohol took a wrong turn when a reserve 
officer had to be hospitalized for drunkenness the mayor says 
mayor thomas d schneider said one officer was suspended and 
further disciplinary action is expected because of the may 2 
session which ended with dispatcher linda d offenbacker passing 
out and being taken by ambulance to community north hospital 
obviously something went wrong with the way it was done 
schneider said the indianapolis news reported thursday that 
drinking is supposed to be a controlled situation not getting 
sloppy falldown drunk 
police chief robert a jones said officer mike lair was 
suspended for one day because he drove his police car to a 
parttime security job immediately after taking part in the 
drinking session 
the evening training program in this indianapolis suburb was 
designed to educate 15 volunteer reserve officers about the effects 
of alcohol 
jones said three dispatchers and two police officers drank 
alcohol for the session reserve officers then observed their 
behavior gave sobriety tests and used the breathalizer machine to 
measure blood alcohol content 
officer steve york who is certified to teach the training 
sessions was in charge however jones said the session was run 
improperly without superior officers at the scene 
there was a lack of supervision jones said obviously 
through some unknown means offenbacker got beyond the 10 mark 
and it was not our intention she get that much 
a person who has a 10 percent bloodalcohol level is considered 
legally intoxicated in indiana 
a hospital spokeswoman said offenbacker was treated in the 
emergency room and released she returned to work the next day 
jones said he believes capt lana robinson in charge of 
training for the police department should have supervised the 
program 
it was an oversight on her part he said 
robinson bought two cases of beer and two bottles of wine for 
the five drinking participants at a cost of about 23 her expense 
voucher showed 
i threw in a bottle of seagrams whiskey that i had at home 
because i dont drink myself robinson said 
offenbacker had been drinking the whiskey before she fainted 
jones said 
this was the first time we had a training session of this 
nature and we made some mistakes im not sure well have a similar 
training session again jones said

us delegates to a forum on press freedom accused 
four east bloc nations thursday of doing little to further the 
cause and canada urged the nations to drop what it called their 
same tired old excuses 
the 35nation forum brought together canada the united states 
and every european country except albania to monitor compliance of 
an accord on improving the information flow between east and west 
the us and canadian delegations concluded that czechoslovakia 
romania east germany and bulgaria had shown little progress in 
fulfilling their commitments to the accord signed in vienna in 
january 
czechoslovakia responded to the charges in its concluding 
statement at the monthlong information forum saying the west was 
not looking at the full picture 
chief us delegate leonard h marks told the associated press 
that very little progress had been made with the four east bloc 
countries 
we didnt expect to solve all problems but i dont feel we 
accomplished as much as id like to have said the former head of 
the us information agency 
canadian ambassador william bauer said in a speech that some 
nations remain in a dark age where the only correct facts were 
the governments contacts with foreigners are taboo and free 
communication does not exist 
the london meeting has unfortunately only reinforced our 
view that such backward practices remain the norm in some 
conference on security and cooperation in europe countries he 
said referring to the four nations 
when these countries were justly criticized bauer said 
we were treated to the same tired old arguments that criticism 
was internal interference or deliberately confrontational 
the security conference ended in january in vienna with 
agreements committing the 35 signatories to improve the flow of 
information and improve working conditions for journalists 
czechoslovakian chief delegate dusan spacil the only one of the 
four to speak thursday said in his concluding statement that 
confrontation or bias or disinformation is 
counterproductive 
he said his country was undergoing a transitory period of 
instituting reform and a new system in all spheres would come 
into effect jan 1 next year 
bauer said the czechoslovaks had lied about the circumstances of 
an arrest of a british broadcasting corp reporter may 1 during 
coverage of a dissident protest saying he had no identity papers 
despite the fact that they were holding his passport at the time 
he and other delegates said reluctance by some east bloc 
countries to repeat a vienna promise that all the forums 
undertakings were binding had kept a final communique from being 
composed 
instead as called for under the accord all proposals made at 
the forum were to be passed to the security conference for 
consideration 
soviet chief delegate boris pyadyshev a magazine editor 
expressed overall satisfaction with the forum saying it had 
brought the participants to a new level of understanding he 
refused to comment on criticism of his east bloc neighbors 
bauer and marks said they saw encouraging signs of change in 
hungary poland and the soviet union but emphasized this did not 
mean those countries had completely lived up to their commitments

the bush administration on thursday proposed 
rewriting the nations premier jobtraining program to target most 
spending on the unskilled poor and teenagers and to hinge some 
federal money on improvements in state training and education 
efforts 
the program was coauthored by vice president dan quayle when he 
was a member of the senate 
the suggested amendments to the job training partnership act 
answer most criticisms of the program and are substantially in line 
with changes proposed by several congressional democrats leading 
republicans and democrats alike to predict passage of a revised 
jtpa this year 
there is an urgent need for more than job training labor 
secretary elizabeth dole said in outlining the administration 
proposal to the senate subcommittee on employment and productivity 
many desperately need basic skills training literacy and 
remedial education 
although the proposed amendments would significantly redirect 
the program mrs dole said they are needed because of the changing 
demographics of the american workforce and not because of major 
flaws in the initial legislation 
its record on advancing the employability of disadvantaged 
youth and adults and returning dislocated workers to the economic 
mainstream has been unprecedented mrs dole said but jtpa can 
be made even better 
sen orrin hatch rutah called jtpa the singularly important 
work of this committee during the reagan years but he agreed 
with mrs dole that the recessionspawned program needs to be 
reworked to address current labor shortages particularly in 
highskills fields 
the chairman of the subcommittee sen paul simon dill has 
introduced a package of similar amendments and expressed confidence 
minor differences in the approaches would be resolved 
i think were going to get a good bill out of this committee 
that were all going to be able to agree on simon said 
jtpa is by far the nations largest training program receiving 
24 billion this year to serve an estimated 19 million people 
bush has requested stable spending for next year 
labor department officials have said the proposed amendments 
would increase perperson training costs and therefore cause some 
modest reduction in service levels mrs dole however said those 
reductions likely could be offset if states did a better job of 
coordinating federal state and other education training and 
counseling programs 
current jtpa spending formulas send twothirds of the money to 
areas based on their unemployment rates the amendments would make 
the concentration of economically disadvantaged the overriding 
factor in spending decisions 
also youth training programs now scattered throughout sections 
of jtpa that also deal with adult training would be collected into 
a separate entity which mrs dole said would allow dramatic 
improvements in efforts to curb high youth unemployment 
particularly in inner cities 
during her testimony mrs dole was flanked by three 
participants in jtpafunded programs they sparked applause from 
subcommittee members when they discussed their troubled childhoods 
and achievements made possible by the training and education they 
were receiving they also met briefly later with president bush at 
the white house 
also among the changes proposed by the administration 
rewriting eligibility requirements so that in addition to being 
economically disadvantaged all youths and half the adults seeking 
enrollment in jtpa programs would need to have additional barriers 
to employment such as literacy or basic skills deficiences teen 
parents and the homeless also would be given preference 
rewriting program guidelines to encourage more thorough 
training including deletion of provisions that weigh a programs 
success by the number of placements it makes such provisions have 
been criticized for encouraging programs to select applicants who 
already have marketable skills so that they can be placed in jobs 
quickly 
requiring for the first time that jtpa funding for summer 
jobs programs go only to youths who are enrolled in an approved 
education or training program during the school year 
requiring individual assessments of all prospective trainees 
and for those accepted into programs an individually tailored 
program to meet the distinct education training and placement 
needs of each trainee 
establishing grants for states that set clear goals for their 
training programs and submit to the labor department plans that 
demonstrate improved coordination between training and related 
programs

the soviet union could produce a bumper grain 
crop this year of 210 million metric tons up 8 percent from last 
years production the agriculture department said thursday 
in its first forecast of 1989 soviet grain production the 
department said prospects stem from a relatively good growing 
season to date but moscows push for greater output of livestock 
products for soviet consumers will mean record grain use and 
continued large grain imports to cover shortfalls the report 
said 
the forecast included 915 million tons of wheat 1055 million 
tons of coarse grains such as corn and barley and 13 million tons 
of miscellaneous grains and pulses 
last year when production was 1951 million tons the harvest 
included about 844 million tons of wheat 975 million tons of 
coarse grains and more than 131 million tons of miscellenous 
crops 
if realized the forecast of 210 million tons would mean that 
soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons in three of 
the last four years an unprecedented production record by that 
country the alltime high grain output was 2374 million tons in 
1978 
imports of grain by the soviet union in the 198990 trade year 
which will begin on july 1 were forecast at 33 million tons down 
from 385 million tons estimated for the current year but still 
on a par with the average of the past decade the report said 
the push to increase livestock product output has increased 
the demand for imported corn and grains for feed the report 
said in addition another year of strong wheat prices is likely 
to discourage soviet imports of feed wheat total wheat imports 
are projected to decline to 12 million tons the lowest level since 
197980 
department analysts said the good outlook for the soviet grain 
crop and high world prices for wheat are likely to limit moscows 
wheat imports to not much more than the levels required under 
various longterm agreements with supplying countries

richard secord the retired general enlisted 
by oliver north to run arms to nicaraguan rebels was accused in an 
indictment unsealed thursday of lying to congress to cover up his 
profits from the irancontra affair 
the indictment alleges that more than 1 million was involved 
secord 56 a retired air force major general who already faced 
one set of charges in the affair was accused of seven counts of 
perjury to congress and one count of obstructing the congressional 
irancontra investigation in 1987 
a ninth charge accused him of making a false statement to staff 
members for the congressional panels by saying he wasnt aware that 
any money generated by his irancontra transactions had benefited 
north 
each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison 
and a 250000 fine on conviction 
secord was the leadoff witness in the televised hearings 
conducted in the spring and summer of 1987 by the house and senate 
committees 
the lastest charges by a federal grand jury were handed up april 
7 but werent unsealed until thursday in order to avoid bringing 
them out during the trial of north who was convicted on three of 
12 irancontra counts last thursday 
secords lawyers said in a statement the decision to indict 
again is vindictive and contrary to any notion of fair play and 
professionalism they asked for financial assistance to help pay 
for his defense 
meanwhile thursday secord was convicted of driving while 
intoxicated in late february in nearby fairfax county va 
district court judge barbara kimble found secord guilty 
suspending 200 of a 500 fine and suspending a 30day jail term 
she ordered that he be given a restricted license permitting him to 
drive between his home work and an alcohol safety program the 
penalties were stayed because secord appealed to fairfax county 
circuit court where his case is to be heard aug 24 
the new irancontra indictment was issued by a federal grand 
jury that last fall began investigating possible perjury by various 
figures in the affair 
asked whether other key players would face charges 
independent counsel lawrence walsh declined to comment 
eight of the new charges relate to secords financial interest 
in the enterprise which delivered weapons to the contras and 
shipped arms to iran in 1985 and 1986 walsh told reporters in 
front of the us courthouse 
the enterprise was the maze of companies set up around the 
world by secord and business partner albert hakim to carry out the 
contra arms shipments and the reagan administrations arms sales to 
iran more than 47 million was received managed and 
disbursed said the indictment 
walsh said the ninth count relates to alleged lying about a 
200000 fund set up through hakim secord and swissbased lawyer 
willard zucker for norths family in the event he failed to return 
from a trip to iran in 1986 and about norths acceptance of a 
13800 home security system the charge accuses secord of denying 
to lawyers for the congressional irancontra panels that he was 
aware of any money from the enterprise that went to benefit north 
the convictions against north included illegally accepting the 
security system 
north testified at his trial that he hadnt known about the 
200000 death benefit set aside for his wife and children though 
he had sent his wife betsy to philadelphia to discuss the matter 
with zucker 
the indictment said secord lied when he told congress 
he had no interest in korel assets inc a corporation that 
held his share of the profits from covertly running arms to the 
contras and secretly shipping arms to iran the korel account 
unlike the other enterprise accounts was set aside for the 
personal use of richard v secord said the indictment 
he had waived his interest in profits of the enterprise and 
zucker had managed several hundred thousand dollars maybe 
400000 for him through the years the indictment said secord 
retained a personal interest in the profits of the enterprise and 
didnt advise zucker he was waiving any interest it alleged zucker 
was used to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to 
the defendant richard v secord 
he received only his 6000 a month salary from the arms sales 
to iran and to the contras 
400000 to 500000 paid to his and hakims virginia company 
was money lent from a swiss investment services firm operated by 
zuckers firm compagnie de services fiduciaries 
funds invested in a company called triamerican arms came from 
hakim and not from profits of the enterprise he also was accused 
of lying by denying that one purpose of the triamerican venture 
was to sell arms to the contras 
defex sa a shell corporation was used by the enterprise to 
disguise the source and location of enterprise money from arms 
dealers instead says the indictment secord and others used defex 
sa to hide and disguise from contra leaders and american 
officials the true prices the enterprise was paying for weapons for 
the contras and the profits they were taking for themselves 
he had no beneficial interest in any foreign accounts 
previously secord was indicted on march 16 1988 along with 
north hakim and norths boss former national security adviser 
john poindexter 
all four men were accused of conspiracy and theft of government 
property in illegally diverting more than 14 million in us iran 
arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels the conspiracy and 
theft counts against north were dropped due to national security 
concerns 
other charges against secord from march 1988 were wire fraud 
conspiracy to pay an illegal gratuity offer of an illegal gratuity 
and payment of an illegal gratuity

the bizarre flight of an enraged exhusband who 
commandeered a cessna and flew among city buildings while firing 
randomly at the ground below reminded operators of small airports 
of their vulnerablility 
what can you do to prevent someone from going in and 
terrorizing people asked john leyden a federal aviation 
administration spokesman 
you just have to play the odds said greg chapman manager 
of the beverly municipal airport where the gunman hijacked the 
small plane you go along for years and years and nothing 
happens then all of a sudden everything goes haywire 
alfred j hunter who also is accused of murdering his exwife 
was arraigned wednesday in salem district court on charges of 
murder and armed robbery judge john doyle ordered hunter held 
without bail for 20 days of psychiatric observation at bridgwater 
state hospital 
the sniper flight early wednesday struck a chord among airport 
officials struggling with security 
the rampage began with the hijacking of the singleengine plane 
at beverly about 20 miles north of boston the episode ended three 
hours later at logan international airport one of the nations 
largest facilities 
at both facilities the hijacker had officials backed into a 
corner 
in beverly flight instructor robert golder was alone and had 
little choice but to comply with hunters demand for a plane 
when you have an ak47 assault rifle stuck up your nose and 
someone ask you to provide an airplane you just ask them what 
color airplane theyd like amero said its wise to back off 
and during the flight hunter buzzed logan and sent air traffic 
controllers scrambling from the tower closing the airport 
something like this was impossible to anticipate in terms of 
security said phil orlandella a spokesman for logan and im 
not sure theres a defense for it anyway the whole city was 
helpless 
hunters flight ended about 115 am wednesday when he landed 
at logan with about five minutes worth of fuel left in his tank 
he had no comment and authorities found no weapon in the plane 
although several rounds and spent shell casings were recovered 
leyden said that ideally stringent security measures would be 
mandated at all of the nations 15000 small airports and landing 
strips 
but it would be impossible he said you really cant 
prepare for events like these i dont know what you could do in 
the way of security without imposing a tremendous economic burden 
on small airport operators 
ralph amero who manages the beverly flight center whose plane 
hunter commandeered agreed 
at airports such as beverly there really is no security he 
said generally speaking all we can do is band together as a 
group of fixed base operators and try to hire security but the 
cost is prohibitive 
bill thomas a senior claims representative at avemco insurance 
corp said the frederick mdbased small aircraft insurer one of 
the nations largest receives eight to 10 theft reports annually 
because a singleengine plane like a cessna 210 is valued at 
about 196000 costs can quickly soar for insurers like avemco 
which spends about 1 million annually in compensation for stolen 
and damaged aircraft 
the boston incident was certainly an exception he said 
naturally we like to see solid security using the best 
surveillance technology

farmers soon will be harvesting a skimpy 
winter wheat crop estimated at 143 billion bushels the smallest 
in 11 years the agriculture department said thursday 
although farmers boosted plantings this years harvest is 
expected to be down 8 percent from last years 156 billion bushels 
because of lingering drought in kansas and some of the other major 
production areas 
officials said the average yield based on indications as of may 
1 was estimated at 349 bushels per harvested acre compared with 
last years 392 bushels per acre 
farmers are expected to have about 410 million acres for 
harvest this year up 3 percent from 398 million in 1988 said the 
departments agricultural statistics board 
reggie wyckoff president of the national association of wheat 
growers said drought in the central great plains and freeze damage 
in the pacific northwest have hurt farmers deeply 
as a result farmers in these areas deserve to receive federal 
assistance similar to that offered last year when drought 
devastated the northern plains and the corn belt he said 
last year congress approved a 39 billion emergency aid 
package to help relieve some of the drought damage many have urged 
usda to administratively extend the major benefits to 1989 wheat 
producers who have had similar losses but the administration says 
it is up to congress 
the new estimates provide solid evidence of this seasons 
losses and conditions will probably get worse rather than 
better wyckoff said in a statement issued here 
the kansas wheat crop was estimated at 2024 million bushels 
less than twothirds of the states 1988 production washingtons 
harvest showed a comparable decline with output estimated at 689 
million bushels against 1085 million last year 
despite the sharp losses in the winter wheat areas usda 
economist ralph parlett said the effect will be mild on shoppers 
its going to be small but it will have an effect he said 
in a telephone interview 
parlett said a 1 loaf of bread has about seven cents worth of 
wheat in it theoretically he said if the cost of wheat doubled 
the loaf would still cost only 107 but he emphasized again that 
was a theoretical example 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
summer it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production the remainder is planted in the spring 
no 1989 production estimates for spring wheat corn and other 
major springplanted crops were included those will be issued by 
usda later in the growing season 
however in a related supplyanddemand report usda projected 
based on assumptions of normal weather and trend yields that 
total wheat production in the united states this year could be 
about 205 billion bushels up from last years 181 billion 
bushels 
the report showed wheat prices could rise to a range of 380 to 
420 per bushel on the average in 198990 from 374 estimated 
for the current marketing year that will end on may 31 
at the higher prices wheat exports would drop significantly to 
115 billion bushels from 146 billion bushels currently the 
report showed the us wheat stockpile on june 1 1990 would be 
drawn down to around 500 million bushels from 594 million bushels 
estimated this june 1 
the report also projected the 1989 corn crop at 785 billion 
bushels up from the droughtriddled harvest of 492 billion last 
year soybeans were indicated at 195 billion bushels up from 154 
billion in 1988 
but the projections were described as highly tentative 
subject to change as the season progresses

about 300000 armenians chanting and carrying 
armenian flags massed thursday in yerevan to demand action on the 
disputed territory of nagornokarabakh and freedom for imprisoned 
nationalists activists said 
the situation in nagornokarabakh where unrest broke out again 
recently after four months of calm was called tense and even 
explosive activist martin martirosian said in a telephone 
interview after the protest in the armenian capital 
he said speakers at the demonstration which was officially 
condoned called for a session of the armenian parliament to 
address the status of the disputed region if no session is held by 
may 18 they recommended a general strike he said 
the crowd also demanded the liberation immediately and 
without too much talk of 13 armenian activists under arrest 
said rafael popoyan another activist contacted by telephone most 
of the 13 are members of the karabakh committee which organized 
repeated protests about the region 
people at the demonstration chanted committee committee 
and session session popoyan said 
the recent unrest in nagornokarabakh involved strikes and 
clashes between armenians and azerbaijanis including a village 
brawl fought by 200 people 
nagornokarabakh became the flashpoint for tensions between the 
two peoples last year when the armenians who are generally 
christian and make up threequarters of the regions 162000 
inhabitants began demanding that their homeland be transferred 
from the rule of largely moslem azerbaijan and annexed by armenia 
after more than 90 people died in unrest there the region was 
placed under special administrative control by moscow but 
armenians consider the current government has not justified 
itself everything it does goes against the will of armenian 
karabakh residents said popoyan 
speakers at the meeting described how more and more azerbaijanis 
were being settled in nagornokarabakh threatening the armenian 
majority and its claim to the region popoyan said 
he said beginning friday meetings will be held at armenian 
workplaces to pass resolutions demanding the parliamentary session 
and threatening a strike if it is not held 
meanwhile in the neighboring caucasus republic of georgia 
small groups circulated through the capital of tbilisi carrying 
signs demanding the release of georgian political prisoners an 
activist said 
manana gamsakhurdia wife of jailed political dissident zviad 
gamsakhurdia said three of the protesters were detained and one 
remained in jail thursday night 
they were calling for the release of six activists arrested in 
connection with ethnic unrest april 9 that left 20 dead 
zviad gamsakhurdia who was among those arrested after the clash 
between soviet troops and proindependence protesters is in poor 
health but officials have not let him move from his cell to the 
prison infirmary manana gamsakhurdia said in a telephone interview 
she also said strikes were spreading in the georgian region of 
abkhazia where abkhazians although a minority in their own 
region have begun demanding secession from georgia 
many georgian residents of abkhazia have gone on strike to 
protest the abkhazian demkands she said

renewable energy sources such as hydro and 
solar power could provide as much as 80 percent of the nations 
energy needs by the year 2010 if federal aid were accelerated an 
environmental group said in a study published thursday 
renewable energy technologies offer one of the most promising 
components of any strategy to mitigate the trend toward climate 
change the study said 
public citizen the studys sponsor said the potential for 
renewable energy can only be reached if the energy department 
spends substantially more on research and development 
the group which strongly advocates reduced reliance on nuclear 
power and fossil fuels that are linked to the trend toward global 
climate warming said the energy department budget for renewables 
should be restored to the 1985 level of 263 million the current 
budget provides 1156 million and the bush administration has 
proposed cutting that to 865 million in the next fiscal year 
renewable energy sources currently supply about 8 percent of 
total us energy needs including imports of electricity generated 
from canadian hydro plants the study said the figure could rise 
to 19 percent by the year 2000 and to as high as 80 percent by 
2010 if prices for conventional energy sources go up it said

president bush is considering stiffer 
guncontrol measures including a permanent ban on some 
semiautomatic assault weapons for an anticrime package to be 
announced soon administration sources said thursday 
the options being considered include making permanent the 
temporary import ban on a variety of semiautomatic assault rifles 
that was imposed in march and increasing criminal penalties for 
illegal use of firearms according to one of two sources who both 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the administration is also studying increased penalties for the 
illegal possession of semiautomatic weapons and their use in the 
commission of crimes according to another source 
the proposals are in the final stages of review by white house 
domestic policy chief roger porter the anticrime legislative 
package is expected to be unveiled monday by the president 
under consideration is a proposal that would bar people 
sentenced to at least six months in jail for misdeanors from 
purchasing guns said the second source federal law currently bans 
convicted felons from owning guns 
another measure under consideration is a proposal to link gun 
dealers to a federal registry to determine if weapons purchasers 
are convicted criminals the second source said 
public concern about the use of militarystyle assault weapons 
such as the ak47 used by a gunman to kill five children in a 
stockton calif schoolyard last january has prompted the 
administration review of guncontrol policies 
in march the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms imposed a 
temporary import ban on a variety of foreignmade semiautomatic 
assault weapons while the agency determines if any of them are 
being used for legitimate sporting purposes 
federal law prevents the importation of such weapons unless they 
are used for target shooting or hunting 
one of the options under consideration is a plan to permanently 
ban 15 foreign and domesticmade militarystyle assault weapons

faced with his first crisis as president 
george bush has decided on a measured response to the tumultuous 
situation in panama concerned that more decisive action could 
imperil longerterm us interests in the area 
he said he was sending troops to protect the lives of american 
citizens but he ordered no direct military action and no new 
economic sanctions against the government of panamanian leader 
manuel antonio noriega 
bush warned of the consequences of failing to send a clear 
signal to the enemies of constitutional rule in panama and 
elsewhere 
but the seven points bush outlined indicated that if noriega is 
to be overthrown it will have to be primarily the work of 
panamanians and not americans 
the president obviously is hoping that other democratic nations 
will close ranks against noriega and that the panamanians 
resulting isolation will encourage him to move on to other pursuits 
since sundays national election a number of countries have 
expressed varying degrees of indignation about the irregularities 
reported by hundreds of international observers 
these countries include argentina guatemala el salvador peru 
costa rica spain great britain west germany and venezuela 
and venezuela is leading a campaign to have the organization of 
american states take a strong stand for democracy in panama 
if this fails to impress noriega he might still take note of 
the most controversial step bush announced the dispatch of 2000 
or more us combat troops 
noriega may be concerned that the troops have a more aggressive 
purpose in mind than the stated one of protecting american lives 
it is not unusual for a strong nation to try to achieve political 
goals by projecting military power without actually using it 
bush backed away from a more pugnacious military response out of 
concern that it could provoke antiamerican uprisings in the 
hemisphere that approach might have succeeded in ousting noriega 
but the diplomatic costs would have been exorbitant 
slapping a trade embargo on panama would have made the economy 
there scream but the impact would have been felt for years to come 
long after noriegas departure 
so bush is relying on rhetoric and diplomacy to weaken noriega 
the state department after declaring that the opposition candidate 
in sundays election guillermo endara won the election is now 
calling him presidentelect 
it is a tactic aimed at robbing noriega even further of any 
claim to legitimacy 
as for the diplomatic approach the administration will be 
lobbying hard over the next few days for a strong resolution at the 
oas foreign ministers meeting expected to start next tuesday 
based on the regular oas permanent council meeting on wednesday 
the prospects are not bright 
the us representative william pryce delivered a strong 
attack on noriegas perceived attempts to steal sundays election 
but only three of the 30 other hemispheric countries joined in the 
criticism venezuela peru and el salvador 
but bush indicated that his bag of antinoriega reprisals was 
not exhausted in thursdays speech we do not rule out he 
said further steps in the future

saturday marks the fourth anniversary of the 
confrontation between the move group and city officials that ended 
with an airborne police bomb that incinerated an entire block and 
killed 11 people 
officialdom has spent four years trying to sort out what went 
wrong about two dozen lawsuits have been filed against the city 
and its four top officials at the time of the disaster 
the city already has paid about 2 million in claims to 
neighborhood residents for damages to their property mayor w 
wilson goode appointed a blueribbon investigating commission to 
report on the manmade disaster 
it accused the mayor of gross negligence in his handling of 
move a radical group and called for grand jury indictments in the 
deaths of the five children two grand juries investigated but no 
one was indicted 
on friday attorney charles bowser will publish let the bunker 
burn the final battle with move a 150page book which contends 
the people in the house were executed by their local government and 
it could happen again 
i had to write this book said bowser who served on a 
special city commission investigating the disaster he believes 
someone should have been indicted for what happened 
we think there is a deliberate effort to sweep it under the 
rug said william meek of the move committee a group sponsoring 
a memorial service and seminars this weekend on the may 13 1985 
disaster 
many people in the city would like to forget that it happened 
theyd like to pretend that it didnt happen meek said but 
it did happen and it was our government that did it not some 
government far away 
last december meek said his committee mailed questionnaires to 
70 local state and federal legislators from the philadelphia area 
asking pointed questions about move and its aftermath 
they got three responses 
i was surprised not to hear from a lot of people he said 
a veil of silence has been put over this 
the 1985 confrontation began when police evacuated the block in 
west philadelphia seeking to arrest some members of the radical 
group at their rowhouse fortress and to evict the others 
police had clashed with move in august 1978 when one police 
officer died and three police officers and five firefighters were 
wounded 
when police ordered the 1985 eviction the adult move members 
refused to come out and kept their children with them cursing the 
police through bullhorns and promising to fight them 
a state police helicopter finally dropped a satchel on the roof 
that contained a crudely rigged plastic explosive device it 
started the fire that went out of control destroying the move 
house and 60 other homes on the block

from two defendants 
he was acquitted in 1983 but the house impeached him last year

lied at his trial and in an unrelated matter improperly disclosed 
wiretap information 
us district judge harry claiborne of nevada was impeached by 
the house in 1986 while serving a tax evasion sentence the senate 
removed him from the bench 
a jury convicted nixon of perjury for denying in 1984 before 
both a federal grand jury and justice department investigators that 
he intervened in a narcotics case involving the son of hattiesburg 
miss business executive wiley fairchild 
fairchild helped nixon obtain a lucrative oil and gas investment

of trepidation made his first appearance thursday on the turf of 
latenight talkshow host david letterman since the two began 
feuding four years ago

letterman came at the top of the show as letterman was reading 
the nights customary top10 list this one of questions asked 
prospective nbc employees 
number 7 in the countdown list was any problem carpooling 
with bryant number 4 was want to join squad doing inventory 
of bryant gumbels suits whereupon bandleader paul shaffer

a government report issued thursday said that 
despite 69 hospital closings in 1987 most of those facilities were 
small and few communities were affected because other medical care 
was available nearby 
the report by the inspector general at the department of health 
and human services its first on hospital closings paints a less 
alarming picture of the situation than is seen by many on capitol 
hill and in the industry 
they say the health care of many americans particularly those 
in rural areas will be threatened as more hospitals close their 
doors due to financial pressures including proposed cuts in 
medicare reimbursements 
the report however said the hospitals that closed in 1987 
were small and had low occupancy rates when the hospitals closed 
few patients were affected most could get medical care nearby 
according to the inspector general 69 general acute care 
hospitals closed in 27 states in 1987 while 13 new hospitals 
opened that year eight of the 69 that closed in 1987 reopened the 
next year the report said 
the american hospital association by contrast said 79 
community hospitals closed in 1987 and more than 400 have closed 
since 1980 industry experts project that several hundred more will 
close in the next few years unless financial pressures are eased 
the report made no projections and looked only at 1987 
no single factor was responsible for the closings the report 
said but the common elements include declining revenues due to 
fewer admissions cuts in insurance reimbursements and more 
treatment of uninsured patients who cannot pay their bill other 
factors include rising costs resulting from pressures to add new 
medical technology and skilled personnel the report said 
the 1987 closings accounted for 13 percent of all hospitals 
nationally and one half of 1 percent of the general acute care 
inpatient bed supply 
about 54 percent or 37 of the hospitals that closed were in 
rural areas and 46 percent or 32 of them were urban hospitals 
also the hospitals that closed had about the same medicare and 
medicaid utilization rates as other hospitals 
the report said that despite the closings most of the affected 
communities still had adequate emergency and inpatient medical 
services available nearby 
in 19 of the 37 communities where hospitals closed residents 
have to travel less than 10 miles for emergency care and 29 less 
than 20 miles in seven communities the ride is up to 30 miles and 
its 75 miles an hour by ambulance to the nearest emergency 
services for residents in mullen neb but in all those areas 
ground or air ambulance services are available the report said 
all but one of the 32 urban areas where hospitals closed have 
emergency care available within 10 miles the exception is wasco 
calif where residents have to travel 19 miles to delano the 
report said

reye syndrome a potentially fatal disease 
associated with aspirin in childhood flu and chicken pox cases has 
reached the lowest reported level since its discovery just 20 
us cases last year officials said thursday 
at its peak in 1980 reye syndrome struck 555 people the 
disease struck 101 americans in 1986 the year in which aspirin 
containers were first required to carry warnings about it 
since then reye syndrome reporting dropped to 36 cases in 1987 
and 20 in 1988 the us centers for disease control reported 
reye syndrome first observed in the 1950s causes symptoms 
including severe vomiting and lethargy and can result in coma and 
even death it usually occurs in children and is usually preceded 
by a bout with a viral illness such as influenza or chicken pox 
researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by 
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent 
development of reye syndrome 
the decline in the number of rs cases since late 1980 
coincides with the increased publicity about this association 
the atlantabased cdc said 
that is the reason concluded dr larry schonberger a cdc 
researcher study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause 
of reye syndrome cdcs been pushing this since 1980 
the 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of reye 
cases began in 1976 the cdc said 
nine of the 20 reported reye syndrome patients in 1988 had 
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of reye 
four had chicken pox the previous year 18 of the 36 patients had 
respiratory illnesses and seven had chicken pox 
in 1988 as in 1987 most cases occurred in january february or 
march the peak months for flu or chicken pox cases

rhunetta crumel is one person who thinks avon 
products inc should not be fighting so hard against amway corps 
offer to buy it for more than 2 billion 
opportunity is knocking for avon says mrs crumel who has 
reason to know she is both an avon representative and an amway 
distributor 
the takeover battle between the two giants of direct sales will 
directly affect nearly 3 million people worldwide roughly 15 
million representing avon and more than 1 million from amway 
avons stock fell 37 cents a share to 3950 still slightly 
above amways 39ashare offering price on the new york stock 
exchange on thursday the spread indicated speculators were betting 
a higher bid would emerge from amway or another suitor 
avon is attempting to portray amway as a maverick company that 
has had numerous brushes with the law and sweeps up recruits to its 
sales force through exploitative business evangelism 
in a federal lawsuit this week avon said amway has paid fines 
of more than 20 million in connection with charges involving 
customs duties and recruiting of distributors 
amway touts with religious fervor the development of a 
multilayered distribution scheme in which the people at the top of 
the pyramid become wealthy through sales by those below them of any 
and every product known to man the lawsuit says 
not true said mrs crumel of berkeley heights nj who quit 
her job at exxon corp five years ago to devote more time to her 
amway distributorship people who dislike amway simply dont 
understand it she said 
there are two things you cant penetrate the first is 
ignorance and the second is laziness she said 
avon said its board would evaluate amways offer but noted that 
the board has said previously that the company is not for sale 
in the latest development amway said thursday that if it 
acquired avon it would sell off avons higherpriced retailstore 
fragrance lines stripping the company down to the manufacture and 
direct sales of perfumes cosmetics toiletries and household items 
avon had no response to the statement made in a securities and 
exchange commission filing 
they would be beautiful together mrs crumel said in a 
phone interview from her northern new jersey home after amway made 
its takeover offer wednesday 
mrs crumel thinks amway distributors would benefit by adding 
avon to their product line while avon could learn from amways 
rahrah approach to recruiting and caring for its distributors 
amway is no pyramid as avon charges mrs crumel said 
although recruiters get a percentage of their recruits sales 
the recruits can easily end up making more money than the 
recruiters she said 
mrs crumel said bigticket items and the bonus structure make 
it easier to make money as an amway distributor and she said amway 
takes care of its people better 
avon treated its representatives as stepchildren while it 
went on an illfated diversification drive william nicholson 
amways chief operating officer said in an interview 
in fact avon lost more than 400 million last year from the 
expense of retrenching by selling most of its health care 
businesses to focus on its core businesses of beauty and direct 
sales 
kathryn gaume a berkeley heights resident who sells only avon 
said she knows little about amway and is not sure she likes what 
she has heard 
no problem said mrs crumel 
for the people who are willing to hang around and learn what 
amway is all about i think theyd be very happy

president george bush is poised to announce he 
will negotiate with congress for lifting restrictions on trade with 
the soviet union if the kremlin reforms its emigration policies 
administration sources said thursday 
bush will make his announcement at a speech friday at texas aampm 
university said the sources who spoke only on condition they not 
be identified 
bush is expected to announce he is asking congress to waive a 
1974 law which links trade concessions for communist countries with 
emigration performance the sources said the waiver will be 
granted if the soviets fulfill their promise to codify new 
emigration laws and faithfully implement them the sources said 
his planned announcement follows the first round of talks 
between the administration and moscow conducted this week by 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
baker left moscow with a list of jewish refuseniks who are being 
allowed to emigrate after years of waiting part of a surge of jews 
and other minorities being let out under the liberalized policies 
of mikhail gorbachev 
last month 4557 jews left the highest monthly figure since 
october of 1979 the year emigration reached an annual high of 
51320 as many as 70000 soviets are expected to be allowed out 
this year 
the 1974 law withholds credit guarantees and import duty 
reductions from communist countries which prevent emigration 
only china and hungary have been granted a waiver and been 
accorded most favored nation status which gives them lower 
import duties when they sell goods to the united states 
the soviets have promised that under new laws strict definition 
would be given to eligibility for emigration specifically the new 
laws would limit the number of years that have to elapse before a 
person with knowledge of state secrets is allowed to leave soviet 
authorities have used the provision of their existing law to ban 
some jews from leaving for life 
former democratic rep charles vanik who coauthored the 1974 
law recently called on bush and congress to waive the restriction 
for one year to encourage further improvements in human rights 
under gorbachev 
vaniks plea has been endorsed by several american jewish groups 
who used to be at the forefront of restricting trade with the 
soviets formal approval of the waiver by jewish groups would 
ensure support for such a move in congress

grumpy the lawn dwarf is home safe after 
a fiveweek whirlwind tour of the country but his owners have no 
idea who treated the snarling statue to a vacation 
grumpy a 20inch 80pound concrete statue of the character in 
the walt disney movie classic snow white and the seven dwarfs 
disappeared from carol and gene hornes porch march 16 while the

something was missing carol horne said the next morning my

the battleship iowa on which 47 sailors died 
last month in a gun turret explosion will proceed with its next 
regular deployment this summer without undergoing repairs the navy 
said thursday 
but a decision has been made to fix the damage after it returns 
a spokesman added 
the service in a brief statement said the battleship will be 
departing in june on a scheduled deployment to the mediterranean 
sea along with a number of other warships 
the ship is fully operational except for the no 2 gun turret 
and had already been scheduled to go to the norfolk va naval 
shipyard for postdeployment repairs after returning from the 
mediterranean the navy said 
since it will take several months to obtain all the necessary 
repair parts turret no 2 will not be repaired prior to 
deployment 
but it is now the navys intention to repair the turret 
said lt cmdr jim kudla a spokesman 
the engineering survey team indicates the damage to the ship 
was contained in turret no 2 and all other systems on the ship 
including the engineering plant are in excellent condition and 
fully capable of supporting the upcoming deployment the navy 
concluded the iowa remains one of the most powerful and durable 
ships afloat 
the navy and pentagon announced last week the damage to the huge 
battleship could be repaired for an estimated 15 million to 20 
million at the time however officials declined to say with 
certainty the turret would be fixed and if so when 
there had been some doubt about repairs because of the vessels 
age the iowa was commissioned in 1943 during world war ii and no 
vessel of its type has been built since that war 
fortyseven sailors died on april 19 inside the no 2 gun turret 
while loading a 16inch gun with powder 
the huge battleship still has two other turrets each with three 
16inch guns

out joint measures to overcome its consequences and get down 
immediately to their implementation earlier such procedures took 
days and sometimes whole weeks 
tass said the cooperation envisaged by the agreement began to 
function even before baker and shevardnadze signed the formal 
document a soviet ship designed to skim the surface of the sea was 
hired to help clean up the oil spilled by the exxon valdez tanker 
which ran aground in prince william sound on march 24 
but exxon officials who were paying the soviets 15000 a day

namibia by giving the finnish envoy an executive assistant 
namibias local police force trained by south africa is 
responsible for law and order while the territory goes through a 
oneyear transition to independence under un sponsorship 
perez de cuellar originally recommended 500 un supervisors 
but in early april the local police clashed with about 1900 
guerrillas who crossed the border from bases in angola 
the un police and military observers in northern namibia did 
not have enough personnel to monitor the namibian police and south 
africa soldiers who left their bases to confront the guerrillas

the state supreme court overturning a 
2 million jury verdict ruled thursday that the reprinting of a 
newspaper article was not libelous even though the article was no 
longer true when it was republished 
the 1972 article by syndicated columnist jack anderson which 
reported that the president of a labor union was under federal 
investigation was distributed by a rival union during a 19751976 
battle over which union would represent state workers in cranston 
and newport 
although kenneth t lyons president of the national association 
of government employees was under investigation for alleged mob 
ties when andersons story originally was published the 
investigation ended a few months later with no charges brought 
against lyons 
the jury concluded that council 94 of the american federation of 
state county and municipal employees had libeled lyons and nage by 
reprinting andersons article without showing that lyons since had 
been cleared 
the jury assessed 2 million in compensatory and punitive 
damages against the council and the parent union 
chief justice thomas f fay who wrote the high courts 
unanimous opinion noted that both reprints included the date of 
the original article in type larger than the text print 
aside from the fact that the original article was dated and 
accurate the text referred to richard nixon as president of the 
united states fay wrote the majority of the original column 
was devoted to a discussion of the upcoming 1972 presidential 
election between nixon and mcgovern 
these historical references indicate that the reprints 
referred to prior events and not to matters occurring in 1975 and 
1976 fay wrote 
the fact that the reprints were published during a heated 
laborelection campaign when the important constitutional 
concerns regarding free speech are greatest also weighed in the 
courts finding that they were not libelous fay wrote 
it was the second time the case had been before the state 
supreme court in 1986 after the original jury had rejected lyons 
lawsuit the justices overturned that verdict and ordered a new 
trial 
john r mahoney lyons lawyer said he was puzzled by the 
apparently contradictory opinions he said he had not decided 
whether to seek review in the us supreme court 
milton stanzler the attorney representing the afscme union 
said he believed the court overturned the first jury verdict 
because the trial judge died in middle of the case 
frankly the case should never have gone to the jury because 
it was determined those articles were true as circulated he said

a jury convicted an expolice officer 
of voluntary manslaughter thursday in the shooting death of his 
estranged wife a district judge in her judicial chambers 
clarence ratliff also was convicted of two counts of assault 
with intent to murder and one count of felonious assault resulting 
from a shootout with fellow officers as judge carol irons stumbled 
from her office on oct 19 1988 
the 12member district court jury which began deliberations 
wednesday afternoon also found him guilty of felony use of a 
firearm judge dennis kolenda said sentencing would be in three to 
four weeks 
ratliffs attorney grant gruel argued that his 53yearold 
client was very drunk and under such severe stress from his 
impending divorce he did not have the mental capacity to 
premeditate the killing 
the only real choices in this case are a manslaughter 
conviction or acquittal gruel had said 
were obviously pleased with the verdict gruel said 
afterward it was obvious the jury felt stronger about shooting 
the police officers than shooting his wife 
ratliff a 21year veteran of the grand rapids police department 
who originally was charged with murder in irons death showed 
little emotion when the verdict was read 
the manslaughter conviction carries a maximum penalty of 15 
years in prison the assault with intent charges up to life 
imprisonment felonious assault four years and the firearms 
charge a mandatory twoyear term 
prosecutor mark blumer said he was both gratified and surprised 
by the verdicts 
were gratified that they the jury realized how serious the 
attack on the police officers was it was an understandable 
verdict he said the jury did the job they were called on to 
do 
blumer characterized ratliff in closing arguments wednesday as a 
predatory animal who stalked his wife before killing her 
gruel had contended ratliff was upset because he had just found 
out that irons would not abide by the divorce settlement he 
believed they had agreed upon he also was upset by her alleged 
affair with an old boyfriend gruel said 
gruel had testified that something snapped in ratliffs mind 
when irons picked up her telephone and told a police dispatcher 
across the lobby that ratliff was holding a gun to her head 
after she was shot irons ran out into the hallway clutching 
her bleeding throat and ratliff followed her firing another shot 
police said 
toxicologists have testified ratliffs bloodalcohol level at 
the time of the shooting was about 025 percent more than twice 
the legal limit for intoxication in michigan

mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo 
was sentenced thursday to a maximum 55 years in federal prison and 
fined 500000 in a racketeering conspiracy that included 13 
murders and attempted killings 
he was described by the government as a remorseless and 
profoundly evil man 
scarfo 59 and 16 other members of his philadelphiasouthern 
new jersey mafia gang were convicted last november 
the government said scarfo ran the mob from his home in atlantic 
city nj and was the leader of one of the most important and 
powerful of 24 la costra nostra families in the country as a 
member of the mafias national commission he became one of the 
most powerful criminals in the united states prosecutor david 
fritchey said in court 
the end of this mob family hasnt happened yet but it is 
severely crippled he said 
scarfo stood impassively declining to address the court and 
merely shrugged his shoulders when the sentence was handed down 
afterward his lawyer robert simone told a reporter nicky 
doesnt blame or have ill will toward the judge or the proscution 
because what else were they to do with the false information they 
got his beef is against those who lied about him in the 
courtroom referring to mobsters who turned government informants 
earlier in the day us district judge franklin van antwerpen 
sentenced scarfos nephew philip leonetti of margate nj who 
was identified as mob underboss to the maximum 45 years the judge 
rejected a plea for probation after noting leonetti was involved in 
four murders an attempted murder and 15 extortions 
for the other defendants sentences ranged from 3 years to 45 
years 
scarfo was found guilty of participating in eight murders four 
attempted murders 17 extortions and two drug deals plus bookmaking 
and loansharking he was not accused in a ninth murder 
the judge directed that scarfo serve his racketeering sentence 
after he completes a 14year federal term hes now serving in a 1 
million extortion attempt and a life sentence imposed by a 
pennsylvania judge last month in a murder case 
he should never again be free to prey upon society fritchey 
urged the judge before sentencing

more than 150 lawmakers urged president bush 
on thursday to begin negotiations with the soviet union on the 
phaseout of nuclear weapons tests as part of a treaty banning the 
process by 1995 
a test ban would prevent the soviet union from developing new 
types of nuclear warheads or bombs that might threaten our future 
security such as socalled third generation nuclear weapons 
the 142 house members and 23 senators said in a letter to bush 
the bush administration has not yet indicated where it stands on 
nuclear testing although it is expected to continue the policy of 
the reagan administration which opposed additional testing limits 
the lawmakers said the bush administration has an opportunity to 
act and a ban would significantly advance our nations 
longstanding interest in preventing the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons to other countries 
they noted that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty comes up 
for renewal in 1995 
among the recommendations included in the threepage letter was 
allowing the united states and the soviet union a limited period of 
time to conduct an agreed number of tests to check their arsenals 
progressively lower both the permitted size and number of nuclear 
tests to limit testing of new types of nuclear warheads or bombs 
and install a network of seismic monitoring stations in the united 
states and soviet union to verify compliance with the limits 
the final recommendation is a call for negotiating a formal 
ussoviet comprehensive test ban treaty that could be signed by 
all nations and will take effect from 1995 to 2000

state house members who voted to water down 
the agriculture commissioners power to regulate pesticides 
knuckled under to chemical industry lobbyists environmentalists 
and others charged thursday 
agriculture commissioner jim hightowers aggressive enforcement 
of pesticide rules has angered some chemical and farm interests 
environmentalists said the commissioner is elected in texas not 
appointed 
this is a slap in the face to all those ordinary people 
who cant afford highpriced lobbyists said brigid shea of texas 
clean water action 
when you look at this ask yourself this question would 
the chemical lobby hire a cadre of people spend hundreds of 
thousands of dollars and almost two years time to pass a bill to 
better protect the public or to better protect their profits 
she said 
a spokesman for the texas agricultural chemicals association 
jon fisher disputed the charge and said environmentalists had 
rejected offers to compromise on pesticide regulation 
we have since last fall offered to negotiate a way to 
regulate pesticides that would be in the interests of the people of 
this state and the future because they refused to negotiate 
because they indicated to me they had commitments that would not 
allow them to negotiate we did not get involved we were not 
involved in what happened in the house he said 
the house gave final approval thursday to sunset legislation 
that would continue the agriculture department for 12 more years 
but the house also added an amendment wednesday to take 
pesticide regulation away from hightower and give it to a 
sixmember board that would include the commissioner and five 
others 
the bill was sent back to the senate for consideration of house 
amendments if rejected there the issue would go to a conference 
committee with members from both chambers 
dede armentrout regional director of the national audubon 
society said controversy over democrat hightower whose 
department republican gov bill clements could abolish by vetoing 
the sunset review bill was hurting the public 
eightyeight legislators placed higher importance on placating 
a bigmonied chemical lobby and an uncaring governor at the end of 
his career than in protecting citizens against exposure to 
dangerous pesticides ms armentrout said 
the proposed pesticide board would also include the state 
chemist the texas tech university agriculture school dean the 
dean of the university of texas school of public health a state 
health department epidemiology official and a texas water 
commission official

a prosecutor pursuing a case against two 
former television news executives charged with tapping into the 
computer of a competing station says such a crime is similar to 
burglary 
former wtspchannel 10 news director terry cole and michael 
shapiro assistant news director at the abc affiliate were charged 
wednesday with 17 counts of computer hacking and conspiracy in the 
theft of information through computer phone lines they were 
scheduled for a may 19 court appearance 
its no different than digging a tunnel under their office and 
coming up and rummaging through their desks chief assistant 
state attorney chris hoyer said its hightech burglary 
if convicted each could get up to 85 years in prison 
they are accused of raiding the files of wtvtchannel 13 a cbs 
affiliate between november 1988 and january 
before joining wtsp shapiro was an assignment manager at wtvt 
and helped set up security for that stations newsroom computer 
including passwords and identification codes intended to keep files 
confidential 
shapiro 33 was arrested in february cole 32 his boss was 
arrested in april 
vincent barresi general manager of wtsp said his station has 
never condoned hacking and that shapiro and cole were fired 
hoyer nevertheless said he is considering a civil lawsuit to 
seize the stations assets under floridas racketeering laws which 
let an organization be penalized for profiting from criminal 
activity 
hopefully that would not be the case wtsp attorney c 
philip campbell jr said the station continues to cooperate 
its in mr hoyers hands 
hoyer said his decision on a racketeering lawsuit will be 
affected by whether wtvt sues wtsp 
theyre the victims in this case and were waiting to see what 
they do hoyer said 
wtvt news director bob franklin said corporate executives were 
still discussing that decision with attorneys

the investigation by hud inspector general paul 
a adams into a federal lowincome housing renovation program came 
under fire thursday on capitol hill from legislators who questioned 
the conclusions that there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
adams was also criticized for waiting until a day before former 
secretary of housing and urban development samuel pierce was 
scheduled to leave the department to interview him and for singling 
out for culpability thomas t demery the former assistant 
secretary for housing who was responsible for administration of the 
program 
adams and demery told the house banking housing about their 
roles in the hud section 8 moderate rehablitation program and the 
subsequent investigation of its selection and allocation process 
two weeks ago jack kemp the current hud secretary suspended 
more than 100 million in fiscal 1989 spending for project under 
the program 
kemp said adams investigation had uncovered a system that was 
undocumented ignored existing standards and regulations and was 
based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of 
nonpublic information through which former hud appointees and 
other former government officials won lucrative consultanting 
contracts 
why would you have waited until jan 19 of this year to 
interview the hud secretary samuel pierce who was going out of 
office the next day queried rep henry gonzalez dtexas the 
subcommittees chairman noting that adams probe had begun almost 
a year earlir 
adams said his investigation did not immediately turn up any 
evidence of pierces possible involvement and he said it was just 
a matter of scheduling interviews 
but demery insisted as he had another hearing earlier this 
week that problems existed in the program before he gained his 
post in october 1986 and spending decisions were discretionary 
for pierce 
in january 1987 demery said a selection committee was set up 
that included himself deborah gore dean former executive 
assistant to pierce and an undersecretary for policy 
but demery conceded pierce had final approval over any 
recommendations made by the group 
the hud inspector generals investigation cover activities in 
the program from january 1984 through november 1988 
gonzalez also asked why adams made no specific recommendations 
regarding possible violations of law by former hud officials 
adams answered that his office had consulted with the justice 
department throughout the investigation and found no evidence laws 
had been violated 
i find a disturbing indication in the documents that because 
these allocation formulas and the laws that pertain to hud are not 
criminal statutes that the conspiracies that go on here of 
individuals working together in order to go around established 
procedures are treated as if they are not criminal matters said 
rep bruce morrison dconn 
but the justice department is reviewing the report adams added 
rep joseph kennedy dmass described demery as one of the few 
people that we could ever talk to at hud during the previous 
administration 
but kennedy later took demery to task because of his hesitancy 
to name pierce as the hud official directly responsible for the 
alleged abuse and mismanagement in the program and he said the 
inspector generals conclusions might compromise any future 
investigation 
rep marci kaptur dohio indicated she might request a special 
prosecutor to investigate the program

the republican and democratic leadership of 
congress gave president bush a solid vote of approval thursday for 
a measured careful and deliberate response to election fraud 
in panama and the brutality of its military ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
but some legislators said there is strong pressure on the 
president which he has so far rejected to either invade panama 
or scrap the treaties turning the panama canal over to panama by 
the end of the century 
they rallied behind the course bush did choose reinforcing us 
forces in panama with an additional 2000 combat troops and moving 
to protect the 51000 american civilians in the country 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas acknowleged that 
many members of congress believe bush did not go far enough and 
tougher action is needed to drive noriega from power 
but he hinted that tougher military steps may be needed 
depending on the flow of events in panama and said bushs future 
options are quite limited 
it gets a little tighter from here on if nothing happens and 
noriega refuses to go dole said 
sen richard lugar rind said the people of panama may be on 
the verge of settling the dispute on their own 
but he also declared the united states has the right to to 
keep all further military options opening for response to potential 
crises 
were drawing a much tighter noose around noriegas neck with 
every one of these unified actions lugar said 
in a joint statement the bipartisan leadership of congress 
expressed strong support for the presidents action today in 
taking measured and deliberate steps to assist the panamanian 
people in restoring democracy to panama 
the congressional leaders also urged the democratic governments 
of the hemisphere to condemn noriegas actions in the strongest 
possible terms 
it is the responsibility of freedom loving men and women 
throughout the world to speak out in support of the expressed 
democratic aspirations of the beseiged people of panama the 
statement said 
it was signed by house speaker jim wright dtexas senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine house majority leader tom 
foley dwash house minority leader robert h michel rill and 
dole 
at a news conference mitchell said the president had taken a 
prudent defensive measure 
but he said he had told bush there will be those who think 
this does not go far enough 
dole said the measures have a dual purpose protect american 
lives and put the heat on noriega 
we would hope that the panamanian people and international 
concern and outrage would have an impact on gen noriega dole 
said 
sen alan cranston dcalif the senates deputy democratic 
leader said there is general support in congress for the steps 
the president has taken 
he said that at a meeting with members of congress bush had 
rejected advice to invade panama or to break the treaty with 
panama 
although cranston did not say who gave that advice those 
courses of action have been urged by several lawmakers 
cranston said that although there is no guarantee bushs moves 
will force noriegas departure quickly especially in light of the 
staying power he has shown to date they should reduce the 
prospects that he will stay there a long long time 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee questioned bushs decision to withdraw us 
ambassador arthur davis 
it is precisely when relations are at their worst that we need 
an ambassador in country pell said in this situation the 
continued presence of a us ambassador could provide important 
encouragement to the panamanian opposition 
pell said he supported the decision to withdraw dependents 
maintain sanctions and assert our treaty rights regarding the 
panama canal he warned there is a risk of course that 
increasing our troop strength could provide a convenient pretext 
for noriega to renew his accusations that the united states is 
planning military intervention and to use that charge to take 
further repressive actions 
noriega is under indictment in the united states for narcotics 
trafficking and sen john mccain rariz said the prospect the 
indictment might be withdrawn should figure in any negotiations to 
persuade noriega to leave 
i think that in order to get this guy out of panama that 
should be a part of the negotiations mccain said 
he said the situation is made tougher by the fact that noriega 
has made clear that his goon squads are perfectly willing to 
beat maim and kill people 
sen robert c byrd dwva the senates president pro tem 
saying he found the conduct of the panamanian presidential 
elections saddening and maddening said the united states 
should now embark on a diplomatic offensive throughout latin 
america to isolate noriega from the fruits of international 
economic political and diplomatic intercourse in this hemisphere 
sen phil gramm rtexas said the united states has every 
right to protect its people and protect its property gramm said 
bushs action has got to give noriega more pause 
he will sleep less well tonight gramm said 
but sen john kerry dmass said im not sure gen noriega 
will sleep at all tonight kerry said that in the past the united 
states has underestimated noriega but the panamanian leader 
senses the tide turning 
kerry said that for the first time an entire united 
bipartisan consensus policy has emerged 
the most important thing is that president bush is reaching 
out to latin american allies thats never happened before 
kerry said he currently opposes dropping the drug charges 
against noriega but said he wouldnt rule that out 
if assets are given up other things are achieved which 
balance against it i wouldnt negate any pleabargaining he 
said i have a problem with it but i hope we dont get to that 
lets see what the ingredients are at that time 
sen christopher dodd dconn said he commended the president 
for his action because he believes there was a tremendous degree 
of pressure on the president to take actions that were more 
strident

kenya on thursday urged an international 
ban on the trade of ivory in an attempt to curb the illegal 
slaughter of elephants which has halved africas elephant 
population since the early 1970s 
experts say a dramatic increase in elephant poaching has been 
spurred by record world prices for ivory ivory sells for about 91 
a pound and an average tusk weighs 11 pounds 
the policing of the elephants survival is not easy but it 
will be more practical if any ivory trade is banned n katana 
ngala minister of tourism and wildlife said at a news conference 
conservationists believe there are about 750000 elephants left 
on the continent they say poachers are killing about 75000 of the 
mammals a year if the slaughter continues at that rate the 
population could be wiped out by the year 2000 
an aerial survey last year found an estimated 20000 elephants 
in kenya which 15 years ago had an elephant population of 121000 
ngala said the government will conduct another count in june and 
july 
he said kenya submitted its recommendation on a trade ban 
thursday to the lausanne switzerlandbased convention in trade of 
endangered species 
if twothirds of the conventions approximately 100 members vote 
to list elephants on the conventions appendix one at the groups 
next meeting in october international trade in elephant products 
would be banned 
tanzania and somalia kenyas neighbors to the south and east 
respectively have submitted similar proposals to the convention 
said richard leakey kenyas director of wildlife 
however countries such as japan a major ivory consumer are 
likely to oppose the proposal 
zimbabwe one of the few african nations with a growing elephant 
population has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade in 
elephant products in the last 12 months it has earned about 
600000 in legal ivory sales 
ngala said that while kenya realizes some african countries 
would suffer from an ivory trade ban such action is crucial if the 
elephant is to survive 
kenya also plans to fence parts of its wildlife parks to better 
protect elephants leakey said 
since the beginning of the year he said as many as 300 
elephants have been killed in kenyas parks

a fire that gutted a breeding center 
housing about 500000 laboratory mice will cause a worldwide 
disruption of laboratories researching aids cancer and other 
diseases officials said thursday 
kenneth paigen the incoming director of jackson laboratory 
pledged to get back up as fast as we possibly can as salvage 
teams searched for living mice within the research centers 
stillsmoldering animal production facility 
the laboratory which distributes about 2 million mice annually 
to researchers is the worlds leading nonprofit supplier and 
developer of mutant mice bred in hundreds of genetically identical 
strains 
about a halfmillion mice would be in the facility on any given 
day officials said but there was no estimate of how many or what 
types might have survived 
paigen said the center had saved its foundation stocks of 
specially bred mice but warned that supply disruptions would hamper 
researchers who need the mice to investigate cancer aids and other 
human diseases 
thousands of labs literally all over the world depend on us 
for supplies of mice genetically defined animals paigen said 
i think its safe to say we have some of everything but how 
much we have of anything is not clear right now said philip 
standel director of animal production the laboratory located two 
miles outside the picturesque resort village of bar harbor housed 
about 1000 strains of mice many of them rare 
the impact is going to be terrific really detrimental said 
salome waelsch a professor of molecular genetics at the albert 
einstein college of medicine in new york 
there is no way of restoring this facility by just importing 
mice from elsewhere said waelsch a member of the national 
academy of science 
dr richard sidman a professor of neuropathology at the harvard 
medical school and a senior research scientist at childrens 
hospital in boston predicted the fire would modify the pace of 
research for up to a year 
philip leder chairman of the genetics department at the harvard 
medical school described wednesdays fire at the bar harbor 
complex as a tragedy 
while the lost mice can be replenished eventually leder said 
its just going to take a tremendous amount of energy investment 
and time 
state fire marshal donald m bisset said the fire was accidental 
and was apparently linked to a product that gave off flammable 
vapors that was being used by renovation workers in the building 
one worker suffered extensive burns in the fire and was listed 
in satisfactory condition thursday at maine medical center in 
portland said hospital spokeswoman sharon sturgeon 
two other construction workers injured in the fire remained in 
the mount desert island hospital in bar harbor where they were 
listed in stable condition 
inside the laboratorys research center which was not involved 
in the fire supervisory staff handled a steady stream of phone 
calls from jackson laboratory customers explaining that damage 
assessments had only just begun 
its universities its hospitals its government agencies 
pharmaceuticals said john pomroy an assistant manager 
paigen who assumes the directors post fulltime this summer 
vowed that the center would recover fully from the fire 
the major decision we made in fact we never considered an 
alternative is that were rebuilding he said

latin american nations denounced panama for voiding its 
election but several said thursday they opposed foreign 
interference cuba backed panamas government and said us 
intervention would provoke an explosive reaction 
president bush said he was adding 2000 soldiers to the 10000 
stationed in panama to protect the lives of american citizens 
mexico recalled its ambassador to panama for consultations the 
foreign ministry said 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela urged latin american 
nations to act together to protest vote fraud and he called the 
decision to nullify the count even worse than the fraud itself 
costa rica said the election in which an entire people voted 
with such hope seeking their freedom without violence has been 
betrayed 
britain joined the united states in demanding the resignation of 
gen manuel antonio noriega commander of panamas 15000 soldiers 
and police who has been the countrys de facto ruler since 1983 
a statement by the european economic community condemned the 
repeated use of force and numerous acts of violence during the 
electoral process particularly the brutal physical aggression 
against opposition leaders by batwielding thugs trained by the 
countrys defense forces 
it hinted at sanctions with the declaration the eec whose 
relations with the latin american countries are based on consistent 
and permanent respect for the principles and institutions of 
democracy cannot ignore the seriousness of these developments 
perez said he was in constant consultations with bush and 
other leaders he said he had called for an extraordinary meeting 
of the permanent council of the organization of american states to 
consider action against noriega 
in brazil the foreign ministry said thursday it would support 
an emergency meeting of the oas to find solutions to the panamanian 
crisis 
salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte also said he would 
petition oas president joao baena soares to convene an emergency 
meeting 
all the democratic presidents of latin america see that there 
was obvious fraud in panama and we must now raise our voices he 
said 
international election observers including former president 
jimmy carter said endara had been leading noriegas candidate 
carlos duque by a 31 count when balloting was voided 
in buenos aires argentine foreign minister dante caputo said 
what happened in panama seems to us incredible and unacceptable 
the government of peruvian president alan garcia said it 
denounces and rejects the nullification which it called a 
maneuver against the will of the panamanian people 
peru also said however that it supported the fulfillment of 
the panama canal treaty under which the united states will turn 
over the canal to panama by the year 2000 
in chile the foreign ministry said president augusto pinochets 
government views with concern the violence and the voiding of 
the balloting 
we also view with concern a rise in interference by some 
countries in panamas internal affairs the ministry added 
cubas foreign ministry also said it opposed foreign 
interference 
the statement warns about the grave consequences for all of 
the latin american region and for the interests of relations 
between latin america and the united states because of the 
unavoidable and explosive reaction that would take place among the 
peoples of our america if there is a us military action 
reported radio rebelde monitored in miami 
it did not offer details on what the consequences or reaction 
would be on oct 25 1983 cuban construction workers and a 
handful of soldiers battled us invaders on the caribbean island 
of grenada but were overwhelmed as the united states ousted a 
radical grenadian army junta 
on wednesday seven latin american foreign ministers said the 
turbulence following the sunday election could further isolate the 
country from the regions democracies 
the statement was signed by the group of eight nations which 
actually has seven members peru argentina uruguay brazil 
venezuela colombia and mexico panama was suspended after noriega 
the nations de facto ruler engineered the ouster of elected 
president eric delvalle in february 1988 
spain also condemned the voiding of the elections and britain 
demanded noriega resign 
in moscow the official tass news agency contended the 
nullification was necessary because the opposition directly 
instigated by the united states had attempted to rig the results 
the decision to nullify the election appears to be 
extraordinary but the only correct one it said 
in washington presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
called the tass account very disappointing 
it certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims 
of a new thinking a new openness in foreign relations fitzwater 
said

the town board of health refused thursday 
to ban controversial militaryfunded research at the university of 
massachusetts research that local quakers fear could be used in 
germ warfare 
the university has been wracked by three weeks of protests by 
students and amherst residents over department of defensefunded 
research on campus particularly microbiologist curtis thornes 
work with the anthrax bacteria 
campus police have arrested 151 people since the protests began 
early thursday morning they removed and arrested a group of 
students who had barricaded themselves in a campus building for 30 
hours 
both the town health board and the umass faculty senate held 
special meetings thursday to discuss the issue the faculty agreed 
to review university policy on campus research which holds that 
only nonclassified research whose results can be made public may 
be conducted 
the health board by a 30 vote rejected a call by the american 
friends service committees western massachusetts chapter to halt 
thornes research on anthrax a disease of cattle and sheep that 
can also be transmitted to humans 
the friends spokesman ira helfand said the likelihood of a 
laboratory accident that could spread the disease to the town is 
slight but possible 
helfand also charged that thornes work on improving the vaccine 
against the disease could be used offensively he said the pentagon 
could inoculate us forces against the disease while infecting 
enemy soldiers 
he also charged thorne with working with new and dangerous 
strains of the bacteria in what could be a violation of the 1972 
international treaty banning biological weapons 
thorne in a telephone interview thursday said he deliberately 
chose to work with nonvirulent strains of the bacteria and has no 
reason to develop highly toxic strains of the bacteria since the 
military could already purchase them from a commercial laboratory 
but he said an improved vaccine might protect in peacetime 
us soldiers who go to parts of the world such as australia and 
south america where anthrax is endemic 
thorne said he has never had a safety problem and believes his 
work does not have offensive military applications if i didnt 
feel confident about that i wouldnt be doing it he added 
while recognizing that militaryfunded research on campus might 
be undesirable the health board sided with thorne 
i dont think there is any question that the opponents object 
to the research because of the source of its funding and are using 
this issue as a means to accomplish their ends said chairman 
diana stein a biology professor at mount holyoke college she said 
the last anthrax death in a laboratory was 35 years ago 
initially thornes work begun in 1966 was funded by the 
national institute of health for the past nine years it has been 
financed by 1 million in grants from the pentagon 
about 116 million of the 57 million the 25000student 
university received in grants during 1988 came from the defense 
department 
the quakers said they will appeal the boards decision to the 
state department of quality environmental engineering they have 
also placed an article before town meeting that would ban all 
militaryfunded research at amherst the town will vote on that 
question in late may or early june

opposition leaders thursday rejected 
the governments move to void the election and said the world 
should unite to oust gen manuel antonio noriega whose thugs beat 
them the day before 
president bush ordered us military bases in panama reinforced 
dependents of military and us embassy staff members were moved to 
the safety of fort clayton 
panamanian soldiers patrolled the city us military personnel 
were advised to stay off the streets if possible and to wear only 
civilian clothes in public 
bush said in washington that about 2000 soldiers would be added 
to to the 10000 stationed in panama to protect the lives of 
american citizens about 21300 us civilians live in panama 
many of them retired 
there was no immediate reaction from the panamanian military 
noriega head of the 15000man defense forces has been 
panamas de facto ruler since 1983 the united states has tried to 
get him out through a variety of means including economic 
sanctions 
bush also recalled us ambassador arthur davis and said us 
companies doing business in panama will be asked to bring home 
dependents he said americans in panama would be asked to leave or 
to move into one of the 10 us military compounds 
ricardo arias calderon the oppositions candidate for first 
vice president issued an urgent call to latin american and north 
american and european governments to start a concerted decisive 
diplomatic and political action to help make the will of our people 
prevail and to keep us from sinking deeper into savagery and 
disaster 
he said this should be done by the organization of american 
states 
arias calderon told a news conference he would not let the 
government use fraud as an excuse for nullifying the elections when 
the fraud was committed by the panamanian military 
on the deployment of additional us troops arias calderon 
said it is us policy provoked by noriega and not requested by 
us 
a government statement thursday denounced what it said was an 
attempt to organize a coup in panama organized in part by 
venezeuelan president carlos andres perez 
the release said those contacted about taking part included col 
guillermo wong the chief of intelligence of panamas military 
there was no immediate response from venezuela 
us reporters were barred from an elections tribunal press 
conference thursday on a tape recording of the conference yolanda 
pulice head of the tribunal said she did not know when new 
elections might be called 
for now what is more important is peace among panamanians 
she said there will be decisisons later 
many nations condemned the governments nullification of 
sundays presidential election which the government said noriegas 
candidate won and foreign observers said was a landslide for the 
opposition 
noriega supporters with bats and metal pipes beat guillermo 
endara the opposition presidential candidates and his running 
mates for the two vice presidencies during a demonstration 
wednesday soldiers watched but did not interfere 
the beatings occurred after soldiers intervened in the protest 
of what the opposition calls the theft of sundays election 
endara remained hospitalized thursday with a scalp wound that 
required eight stitches doctors said his condition was stable with 
no neurological complications 
we won and we will continue to fight said guillermo ford a 
vice presidential candidate who was beaten and thrown in jail 
ford who had stitches over his eye and cheek said he was 
sentenced wednesday night to a year in jail for inciting riot and 
attacking soldiers then freed a few hours later 
he said the opposition wants to talk with the military but that 
would require getting rid of noriega because panama cannot have 
two presidents 
the government said it was voiding the election because 
irregularities and us interference made it impossible to declare 
a victor it also cited stealing and buying of votes and missing 
tally sheets 
us embassy spokeswoman cynthia farrell said embassy dependents 
were moved to fort clayton on thursday there are 152 embassy 
dependents in panama and 10560 military dependents 972 living off 
base 
you have these dignity battallions moving around town and 
targeting people ms farrell said 
members of the dignity battallions armed groups of noriega 
supporters were involved in the melee wednesday 
ambassador davis and other officials said one of endaras 
bodyguards was killed and about 20 demonstrators were injured 
wednesday the military said four soldiers were wounded 
more than 300 international observers including former 
president jimmy carter supported opposition claims that endara won 
by a 31 margin 
when the election was voided official results had shown 
noriegas handpicked candidate carlos duque leading by about 21 
washington began its campaign to remove noriega after he 
arranged the dismissal of president eric delvalle who tried to 
fire noriega after the general was indicted in florida on 
drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 noriega denies the 
charges 
noriega claims the united states wants to get rid of him so it 
can renege on the panama canal treaties which turn the canal over 
to panama on dec 31 1999

a prosecutor said thursday that four 
ecclesia athletic association members acted in concert to beat to 
death the 8yearold daughter of the disciplinary groups founder 
they all committed the crime of beating dayna broussard to 
death clackamas county deputy district attorney alfred j french 
iii said in his closing statement 
the jury began deliberations thursday afternoon on the 
firstdegree manslaughter charges against willie k chambers 35 
of san diego brian k brinson 31 constance z jackson 38 and 
frederick p doolittle 28 all of los angeles 
prosecutors have said the girl was struck hundreds of times oct 
13 as punishment for stealing food and as an example to other 
children who were staying in a farmhouse near sandy about 30 miles 
southeast of portland in the foothills of mount hood 
witnesses testified she was beaten with an electrical cord 
rubber hose piece of plastic pipe bamboo pole and weightlifting 
belt 
most of the 53 other children were forced to watch the beating 
prosecutors said several testified that dayna was slammed against 
a wall kicked tripped slapped dropped on the floor shoved 
bitten spit upon and hung out a window 
after daynas body was delivered to a fire station the other 
children ranging in age from 1 months to 16 years were taken 
into state custody the children now are living in foster homes or 
with relatives 
the girls father eldridge broussard jr was in los angeles at 
the time of her death he did not attend the trial 
broussard 35 has blamed negative news coverage for his 
daughters death he denied that the children were beaten or 
abused saying they were only spanked 
broussard formed ecclesia at the watts christian center in los 
angeles to steer children away from drugs and crime and to motivate 
them through tough discipline and athletic training 
the children were brought to oregon last summer while the los 
angeles center was being renovated 
french said the defendants effort to discipline dayna turned 
into a contest of wills 
the wills of the four defendants prevailed that night and 
dayna broussard is dead french said 
jack bernstein the attorney for doolittle responded that 
frenchs selection of witnesses and evidence including graphic 
photographs of the dead girls body had been a calculated attempt 
to misdirect jurors 
the little children who were paraded before you were done to 
inflame you and enrage you bernstein said 
bernstein said french called only a few of the children as 
witnesses because others would have presented conflicting accounts 
of what happened to dayna 
both bernstein and ron thom the attorney for brinson argued 
that french failed to prove their clients were guilty of 
manslaughter 
you wont like it told jurors i dont ask you to like 
it but youve got to follow the law

generals office for questioning could be arraigned as early as 
friday 
although they were sought in connection with the cult killings 
sara aldrete villarreal and the other two main figures in the group 
have been charged only in three mexico city murders 
one of those killed was the godfather of the cult adolfo de 
jesus constanzo who cult members said ordered his own execution

consideration was that when constanzo ordered de leon valdez to 
kill him ms aldrete urged him on 
at a news conference on sunday ms aldrete said she told de leon 
valdez do it do it if you dont do it youre going to pay 
with circumstances you encounter in hell

a braindead teenager whose 
plight became the focus of a righttolife debate delivered a 
premature baby by caesarean section thursday while on lifesupport 
machinery 
the baby girl who weighed about five pounds and was seven weeks 
premature was listed in very critical condition thursday 
afternoon said charles jervis director of the san bernardino 
county medical center 
the baby is suffering breathing difficulty because her lungs are 
insufficiently developed 
the mother tanya marie rivera 15 was pronounced brain dead 
after she was shot in the head two months ago 
in march her divorced parents requested that their pregnant 
daughter be disconnected from lifesupport equipment leading to 
protests by the right to life league of southern california the 
parents later reversed their position 
jervis said the mother began having contractions wednesday 
afternoon the doctors tried desperately to halt them with 
medication but the fetus life became threatened 
on the morning of may 11 the fetus began to demonstrate signs 
of fetal distress in response to the uterine contractions and the 
decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean jervis said 
doctors said the baby girl was suffering from hyaline membrane 
disease caused by a deficiency of a bodily chemical that normally 
coats tiny sacs within the lung where blood in the membrane 
absorbs oxygen without the chemical called surficant the sacs 
collapse with each breath the baby takes 
tanya has continued to remain on lifesupport system pending 
parents notification of their wishes jervis said 
miss rivera was declared brain dead march 15 after she was shot 
in the head allegedly by her 16yearold boyfriend who police 
said is believed to be the father of the child 
the boyfriend known by the gang street name stymie is in 
jail in los angeles in connection with an unrelated murder charge

spiegel lands end and ll bean addicts 
beware the nations governors want you to begin paying sales 
taxes on your mailorder shopping sprees 
governors joined by state legislators and mayors are urging 
congress to overturn a 22yearold supreme court decision and 
require large mailorder companies to collect sales taxes n sales 
to outofstate customers 
as a result of that ruling north dakota gov george sinner told 
a news conference wednesday hometown merchants are at a decided 
disadvantage and states cities and counties are losing more than 
15 billion a year in tax revenue 
because state sales taxes run from 5 percent to 8 percent of 
the cost of the goods sold the unfair tax advantage by

a man who rented a house to an unmarried 
couple and then changed his mind because he believed they were not 
showing respect for christian values is getting support from across 
the country 
i just couldnt allow that type of activity to go on in our 
house said carpenter layle french 33 who reneged on an 
agreement that would have allowed sue jenson and her fiance to move 
into a house he was trying to sell

pay in damages

faced with his first crisis as president 
george bush has decided on a measured response to the tumultuous 
situation in panama concerned that more decisive action could 
imperil longerterm us interests in the area 
he said he was sending troops to protect the lives of american 
citizens but he ordered no direct military action and no new 
economic sanctions against the government of panamanian leader 
manuel antonio noriega 
bush warned of the consequences of failing to send a clear 
signal to the enemies of constitutional rule in panama and 
elsewhere 
but the seven points bush outlined indicated that if noriega is 
to be overthrown it will have to be primarily the work of 
panamanians and not americans

the bush administration on thursday proposed a 
500 million oil spill cleanup fund to be financed by the oil 
industry even as transportation secretary samuel skinner suggested 
the cost of the alaska spill could exceed that amount 
congress has been debating creation of such a fund for 15 years 
but supporters said the effort received little attention until the 
tanker exxon valdez ran aground in march dumping 11 million 
gallons of oil into the pristine waters off alaska 
skinner outlined the administrations proposal at a 
congressional hearing during which he noted that the federal 
government at the time of the alaska spill had only a few million 
dollars available specifically for cleanup efforts 
had that spill been caused by a company less welltodo than the 
exxon corp the government would have had to scramble for funds 
and ask congress for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup 
effort going skinner told the house subcommittee on coast guard 
and navigation

in what seems the unlikeliest of foreign 
exchanges a chinese delegation is touring the trading floors of 
several us futures exchanges looking to create 
socialiststyle commodity markets back home 
although highrolling professional speculators and highrisk 
futures contracts probably wont be part of the first chinese grain 
exchange theres no telling how far things could go once the 
bidding begins 
we will focus mainly on the spot market then we will try to 
introduce some futures mechanism said lu jian guang the only 
englishspeaking member of the fourman group if everything is 
successful maybe it will be enlarged 
it all depends on the outside environment political reforms 
as well as economic reforms lu said thursday as the group 
prepared to visit the minneapolis grain exchange after stops at the

the cabildo the building where the louisiana 
purchase was signed stands echoing and vacant only the 20foot 
ceilings and other architectural details hinting at more than 200 
years of history 
large chunks of the ceilings and floors are ripped out of one of 
new orleans most famous landmarks where maps and pictures once 
hung stenciled instructions order repair cracks entire wall 
and remove plaster 
but there are no workers to follow those instructions or to 
replace the third story destroyed by a fire may 11 1988 because 
the state hasnt come up with 12 million to get things ready for 
renovation 
firefighters rescued most of the cabildos treasures including 
the death mask of napoleon a temporary roof was installed after 
the fire but without a third floor to hold the building together 
the mortar between the massive gray stones of the front wall lost 
its grip the wall had been leaning since at least 1850 but 
daylight now showed through the corners 
crews installing inchthick rods to tie the front wall to the 
back discovered a new problem asbestos used in renovations years 
ago that prompted the state fire marshal to check not only the 
cabildo but other nearby museum buildings and order 12 million in 
repairs 
insurance covers 4 million in fire damage but not the ordered 
renovations so state museum director james sefcik is looking to 
the state at a time when gov buddy roemer is trying to cut 700 
million from the state budget 
but sefcik is confident he can get the 12 million its not 
new money he said but funds left over from other state museum 
capital projects 
it doesnt add to the burden that the legislature is facing at 
all its money that is there from the past he said he is 
worried though about cuts proposed by roemer who has said all 
agencies not protected by the state constitution must slash their 
budgets by onequarter 
those budget cuts are devastating sefcik said theyll 
effectively destroy the state museum system if they go through the 
way theyve been proposed i dont want to be the guy who has to 
lay off 25 people 
the amount of money involved isnt that big were talking 
about the cultural heritage of this state its got to be worth a 
couple million dollars 
if its not im in the wrong business 
meanwhile sefcik is asking for 2 million in donations to 
refurbish and improve exhibits in the state museum buildings near 
jackson square 
new exhibits in sefciks plans include getting someone to 
develop a video game based on the 1815 battle of new orleans which 
actually occurred after the war of 1812 was officially over the 
visitors will represent the british and have to attack andrew 
jacksons position as it was at the time of the battle they will 
discover what the british were up against and will understand why 
jackson chose that spot and why the british lost 
other planned exhibits include plantations louisianas early 
and colonial history and the cabildo itself he said one of the 
problems we have is that so much history took place in the cabildo 
that is germane to new orleans and to louisiana and to the united 
states that i wish we had twice as much space because it all 
deserves telling 
new orleans was under spanish rule when the casa cabildo or 
town hall was built in the 1790s on the site of a police station 
fire had destroyed the roof and woodwork of the corps de garde in 
1788 and 1794 but its heavy brick walls and floor remained and 
were incorporated into the much larger cabildo 
after 1803 when the louisiana purchase doubled the size of the 
united states the cabildo housed the government of the territory 
of new orleans the louisiana supreme court and municipal police 
station moved in 50 years later 
plessy vs ferguson the case that established the separate 
but equal racial doctrine that stood until 1954 was among the 
many cases heard there 
sefcik figures it will take about 18 months to develop the 
exhibits but the work cant start until the money is in hand he 
hopes to reopen the cabildo in the first half of 1991 
the combination of publicity about the cabildo because of the 
fire and the new exhibits should boost the number of visitors from 
about 150000 a year to about 250000 he said when all of the 
jackson square complex is open he figures the number could be a 
million 
as tragic as the cabildo fire was and i dont ever want to 
go through anything like that again i think in many ways it will 
be looked upon as one of the best things that happened in the 
history of the state museum he said 
it has forced people to take a second look at something they 
took for granted to understand that all of these resources are 
precious are special deserve better care than perhaps they had 
been given

dan rather has gotten out his traveling shoes 
again cbs apparently wellpleased with its february road trip to 
japan is going to china next week for the summit meeting between 
mikhail gorbachev and deng xiaoping 
if this isnt a big story what is said rather who 
anchored an ambitious week of coverage in japan that cost an 
estimated 2 million and involved almost all the news divisions 
broadcasts 
abc nbc and cnn also sent their anchors and contingents of 
correspondents to japan for the state funeral of emperor hirohito 
this time cnn is sending its washington anchor bernard shaw to 
china but nbcs tom brokaw and abcs peter jennings will stay in 
new york abc has announced jennings will go to europe later this 
month when president bush meets with nato leaders 
for china cbs is sending rather to anchor the cbs evening 
news from beijing sundays cbs sunday morning also will 
originate from china rather and charles kuralt will anchor the 
coverage cbs this morning and 48 hours went to japan but 
will stay put this time 
rather said in a telephone interview that even though fewer 
programs are going along the china sojourn rivals the japan road 
trip in budget and scale because of the added logistical 
complications of covering sprawling china 
since the japan trip cbs has suffered a blow to its prestige 
losing 60 minutes star diane sawyer to abc and theres 
certainly a prestige boost in anchoring from an exotic locale when 
your competitors are back home in midtown manhattan 
rather sees the trip however in a larger context 
this kind of thing is a real important part of our future 
he said i think if you ask yourself the question which it seems 
to me gets asked about every hour these days is there any future 
for network news i think the answer is yes and the next question 
is if so what is it and i think the answer or part of it is 
keeping a real presence in the worldwide newsgathering business 
not just news packaging but news gathering 
cbs will try to improve on the japan trip with more emphasis on 
maninthestreet coverage that wont be as easy in china as 
in japan 
the chinese have given us extraordinary access and theyve 
been as good as their word said rather this was not always 
true in the past with previous communist regimes there but i will 
say that when theyve made agreements up to now theyve kept their 
word and they have given us what is for them extraordinary access 
and it hasnt been particularly easy these last weeks with whats 
been going on there 
there have been major student protests in recent weeks calling 
for more democracy in china 
rather pulled out a metaphor from the works of texas novelist 
dan jenkins to describe the china trip likening cbs to the 
character astronaut jones who would go to a local basketball 
court shout trying one then shoot from 40 feet out were 
trying one rather said

it sounds like a place of musty closets 
quiet passive and probably pretty dull that is not at all what j 
jackson walter has in mind or on his agenda at the national trust 
for historic preservation 
walter figures that preserving the past doesnt require living 
in it 
so as president of the national trust he is lobbyist 
cheerleader and traveling salesman for what he sees as an effort to 
build americas past into its future by his reckoning the 
preservation movement is the most active and effective force in 
rebuilding and reviving american cities in 1989 
urban renewal tore down what was there and tried to replace it 
with something new the movement as walter calls it seeks to 
revive what is there and put it back to use he maintains that 
works better because people prefer to live shop and work in 
neighborhoods and places they know in buildings with a flavor of 
history about them 
rebuilding with the emphasis on creating housing and facilities 
for moderate and lowincome americans is only part of the 
movement 
it sometimes blocks bulldozers and walter boasts of a leading 
role in opposing development of a suburban shopping mall on part of 
the civil war battlefield at manassas va adjacent to the 
national park that already protects the main site of the battle 
congress voted late last year to buy the land involved 
that and such measures as a 1988 law to protect historic 
shipwrecks and scores of traditional projects to guard and 
maintain historic sites fit one image of the preservationists as a 
movement pursuing worthy projects that really dont have much to do 
with everyday life 
but the same people who fought off the manassas mall are taking 
lessons from the people who build and run malls and applying them 
to the rescue and revival of shopping districts many of them 
shuttered for loss of customers to suburban shopping centers and 
discount houses 
the main street project provides advice and in some cases 
support for projects in 30 states from rural downtowns to old but 
reviving business districts in cities like boston and pittsburgh 
part of the advice is that neighborhood merchants change their old 
ways and adopt the techniques of the malls such as opening and 
closing the shops at the same hours and cooperating on advertising 
and promotions 
the national trusts programs provide loans and grants that 
emphasize restoration for more than its own sake with refurbished 
buildings providing housing community centers and commercial 
space they dont add up to a lot of units but as walter notes 
any dent in the problem helps especially in the era of the budget 
crisis 
a sampling of buildings that trust programs have helped preserve 
a hotel in san franciscos chinatown which now provides 
housing and a community center for elderly tenants living on low 
fixed incomes 
an 1874 municipal building in the dorchester section of boston 
to be converted into apartments offices and shops 
a brooklyn convent built in 1889 now to become 11 low and 
moderate income apartments 
a former ymca in newport ri which is to be rebuilt as 
lowincome housing and a shelter for the homeless 
the national trust has a 26 million budget this year a speck 
in federal budget terms just under a fifth of the money comes from 
the government the rest from contributions and the dues of about 
220000 members 
walter 48 has headed the national trust for five years 
lengthy tenure on the resume of a man who has been a boston lawyer 
a florida state official director of the office of government 
ethics under two presidents jimmy carter and ronald reagan and 
head of the national academy of public administration 
hell need all of his insiders skills as he lobbies to undo 
limits on the credits a taxpayer can claim for investing in 
historic rehabilitation or lowincome housing without the tax 
incentive investment in the restoration of historic buildings has 
plunged by about 60 percent 
putting it back would cost about 200 million a year and thats 
not likely to be a popular prospect in the current budget crunch

one of the most influential players in wall 
streets commodity markets has been subpoenaed in the government 
probe of possible trading abuses but he said investigators 
indicated he isnt a target 
paul tudor jones ii whose trading firm manages more than 500 
million in commodity funds said wednesday he was cooperating with 
the commodity futures trading commission in its civil investigation 
of trading practices on four new york futures exchanges 
another trader craig w effron has been subpoenaed by a 
federal grand jury in a criminal investigation headed by manhattan 
us attorneys office into possibly illegal trading practices on 
the markets his lawyer said wednesday 
effron is the first trader to be publicly named as receiving a 
grand jury subpoena he reportedly is not a target of the criminal 
probe 
the inquiries are separate from a criminal investigation by the 
justice department into allegedly widespread fraudulent trading 
practices on the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile 
exchange the nations largest commodity markets 
jones 34 is chairman of tudor investment corp which he 
founded in 1984 and is considered the most prominent among more 
than 50 traders from whom federal investigators have requested 
information the firm also was subpoenaed 
the subpoenas which reportedly were delivered last week do not 
imply any wrongdoing 
tudor president mark dalton issued a statement that jones and 
the firm were among the many traders and firms that received 
civil subpoenas to provide information in connection with a cftc 
investigation of others 
mr jones and tudor understand that they are not the subject 
of the investigation he said dalton would not say whether the 
government told the firm and jones they were not targets 
market sources who asked not to be named also said jones was 
not a target 
the cftc reportedly is seeking information on jones dealings 
with mark b fisher and effron two futures traders who have been 
mentioned as possible targets 
us postal service inspectors one week ago raided fishers 
offices at the commodity exchanges as part of a federal grand jury 
criminal investigation his attorneys have denied any wrongdoing 
effron 29 has been subpoenaed by the federal grand jury and 
the cftc said his lawyer howard schneider 
in the grand jury probe theyve indicated he is not a 
target schneider said and the cftc hasnt indicated 
anything 
another reported target is preston h semel who runs a 
brokerage in gold silver and other commodities and was fined by 
the new york mercantile exchange for an alleged trading scheme with 
fisher in 1985 semel has refused to comment or provide the name of 
his attorney 
jones whose firm manages money for 15000 customers is a 
director of the futures industry association and board member of 
the cotton exchange where he reportedly made most of his money he 
also conducts ethics training classes with a former cftc chairman 
and is highly regarded in the industry 
he runs a highly successful publicly offered futures fund one 
of what are known as commodity pools in which a group of futures 
investors pool funds run by money managers 
a person familiar with the cftcs order of investigation said 
wednesday it includes review of possible violations of rules 
governing commodity pools under cftc guidelines those could 
include use of customer funds for personal accounts or failing to 
provide customers with necessary disclosure documents 
the cftc probe also reportedly examines violations that include 
prearranged trading use of advanced knowledge of customer trades 
to trade for personal accounts and conducting of trades in order to 
skirt tax obligations 
the government has subpoenaed the cotton exchange the new york 
mercantile exchange the commodity exchange and the coffee sugar 
and cocoa exchange seeking information on brokers it also has 
directly subpoenaed at least 26 traders

the problems remaining at savings and 
loans in iowa and four nearby states are insignificant when 
compared with the troubles besetting the industry nationwide a 
federal regulator reports 
our members have a stronger position to work from than some 
other regions thurman connell president of the federal home 
loan bank of des moines said in the banks annual report the des 
moines office oversees thrift institutions in iowa minnesota 
missouri and north and south dakota 
the report also said that while overall operations were 
unprofitable last year for the 176 savings and loans in the 
district combined outflows of deposits from those institutions 
fell more than 25 percent from a year earlier and assets climbed to 
record heights for a third straight year it said that with most of 
the districts previously insolvent thrifts in new more secure 
hands this year there was an improved earnings outlook for 1989 
the report was distributed as congress wrestled with how to 
finance the 50 billion cash infusion for savings and loan rescues 
proposed by president bush 
unfortunately for our fivestate area the presidents plan 
for resolving the troubles of the nations thrift industry came 
after the majority of district eight insolvencies had been 
resolved connell said the remaining problems in the eighth 
district look quite insignificant when taken in a national 
context 
the des moines district found new owners for 17 insolvent 
thrifts last year leaving just eight troubled institutions in the 
region seven of those insolvent thrifts already have been placed 
under federal conservatorship awaiting completion of congressional 
action and the eighth is scheduled for the same attention said 
hassan honarmand a district spokesman 
there are four missouri problem thrifts two in iowa and one in 
minnesota now under the supervision of the federal deposit 
insurance corp 
they are midwest federal savings and loan in minneapolis sioux 
valley savings and loan of cherokee and first federal savings and 
loan of estherville in iowa and blue valley savings and loan in 
kansas city cass federal savings and loan of st louis financial 
federal savings and loan of joplin and first federal savings and 
loan of southeast missouri in cape girardeau all in missouri 
honarmand said a statechartered sampl in missouri which he would 
not further identify would be placed under federal conservatorship 
later this year 
nationwide about 350 thrifts are listed as insolvent by the 
federal home loan bank board while another 250 are described as 
solvent but in need of government help in 1988 223 thrifts were 
closed or rescued across the country 
the federal home loan bank of des moines said 80 percent of its 
member institutions were profitable last year and improved from 
their performance of a year earlier but widening losses at the 
remaining institutions far offset those gains 
overall thrifts in the des moines district posted a loss of 92 
cents for each 100 in assets in 1988 close to the national 
performance of a loss of 94 cents per 100 
this widely recognized measure of profitability is called return 
on average assets 
for example 43 thrifts in the district representing the top 25 
percent posted what the agency called an exceptional return on 
average assets of 110 for each 100 that compared with 1 in 
profit for each 100 in assets a year earlier but the bottom 
quarter had combined losses of 406 for each 100 in assets in 
1988 sharply higher than the overall losses of 140 for each 100 
in assets for the same group in 1987 
the district regulates 82 thrifts in missouri 45 in iowa 32 in 
minnesota 12 in south dakota and 6 in north dakota 
connell said it appeared that consumer confidence has remained 
fairly stable in the district 
despite the widespread coverage of the crisis in the thrift 
industry deposit outflows from member thrifts in the district fell 
last year 
withdrawals exceeded deposits by 17 billion overall last year 
in the district but that was down from 23 billion in 1987 and 
honarmand said that when accumulated interest earnings were added 
to the deposits remaining at district thrifts there was a net 
increase in deposits of 840 million last year 
most depositors are loyal to their local institutions and want 
to continue doing business with them connell said the bottom 
line in the thrift industry is public confidence

a federal bankruptcy court extended its bidding 
deadline for eastern airlines for at least one potential suitor 
while a bidder for easterns lucrative northeast shuttle raised its 
offer and another airline offered to buy other assets 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland extended wednesdays 5 
pm edt bidding deadline for an investor group led by joseph 
ritchie a prominent chicago commodities trader to give it more 
time to receive financial information from strikebound eastern 
separately america west airlines inc said it would pay a total 
of 751 million for the bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle and 10 
boeing 757 airliners raising by 25 million the cash portion of 
its initial 726 million bid 
that price also would top a rival 365 million offer that 
eastern has accepted from developer donald trump for the shuttle 
in another development eastern rival usair inc offered 525 
million for certain eastern assets including 15 boeing 757s and 
related equipment ground facilities airport landing slots and 
three uscanadian routes 
in a statement usair said its offer was for spare engines 
flight training simulators and other hardware related to the boeing 
757s easterns maintenance hangars in boston and miami airport 
gates in 10 cities already served by usair and its piedmont 
airlines unit and uscanadian routes between pittsburgh and 
toronto baltimorewashington and ottawa and baltimorewashington 
and montreal 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a machinists 
union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that 
virtually grounded the airline 
the bankruptcy court must approve any sale of eastern or any of 
its businesses such as the northeast shuttle 
lifland has pushed for a sale as a means for returning the 
carrier to full operations as soon as possible eastern insists the 
airline is not for sale and is proceeding with a plan to rebuild as 
a smaller carrier and raise 18 billion by selling aircraft and 
other assets 
the deal to sell the shuttle and its 21 boeing 727 jetliners to 
trump still awaits the courts approval lifland scheduled a monday 
hearing on that deal 
america west a regional carrier based in phoenix ariz last 
week submitted a 726 million offer for the shuttle and 10 boeing 
757 jetliners under its revised offer america west stated it 
would pay 415 million cash for the shuttle assets with the balance 
paid in cash and assumption of obligations on the 10 airliners 
eastern spokesman robin matell said in a phone interview from 
miami that although the airline had a deal with trump we also 
have a responsibility to evaluate other proposals and would 
review the america west offer 
bruce nobles president of the trump shuttle said the latest 
america west offer did not affect trumps position 
we have a deal with eastern said nobles we have a blank 
check sitting here waiting to be filled in 
billionaire hotel executive jay pritzker already has proposed 
buying all of eastern for around 500 million although he had not 
previously submitted a formal offer according to sources close to 
the situation an investor group led by william howard the former 
chairman of piedmont airlines also has expressed interest in 
making a buyout proposal 
the chairman of the committee representing easterns major 
creditors confirmed wednesday that bids were expected from the 
ritchie and howard groups alan boyd chairman of airbus industrie 
of north america said neither consortium has detailed its 
financing plans to the creditors 
neither pritzker nor the howard group would confirm whether they 
had made firm proposals to the bankruptcy court by wednesday 
another potential buyer who previously expressed interest 
takeover strategist carl c icahn had backed off a bit on tuesday 
trans world airlines inc which is owned by icahn stated it 
needed more time to discuss with its unions the feasibility of 
integrating the twa and eastern workforces and was not prepared to 
submit a formal bid for eastern at this time 
icahn has held discussions with officials of easterns unions 
last friday he informed the court of his interest in buying 
easterns philadelphia airport hub 
former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth whose 464 
million deal to buy eastern collapsed in midapril was still 
interested in acquiring the airline sources close to ueberroth 
said wednesday however it was unclear whether he would come forth 
with a firm new buyout plan the sources said 
following a recommendation by bankruptcy examiner david i 
shapiro lifland decided that any bids submitted after wednesdays 
deadline would be disqualified except for good cause shown 
lifland granted the twoday extension to ritchies group because 
confidential eastern financial data sought by the group was 
accidentally sent to the wrong person according to harvey miller 
easterns lead bankruptcy attorney ritchie is chairman of crt 
group a futures and options trading company based in chicago 
it was not immediately clear under what conditions lifland would 
accept late bids by others lifland shapiro and the principals of 
the bidding groups did not return phone calls wednesday seeking

the second attempt to turn americas 
bestknown house of ill repute into the countrys first 
publiclyowned bordello has stalled after the stock offering fell 
5 million short of its goal 
eric walloga whose american wallstreet securities inc is 
underwriting the sale said wednesday his company had negotiated an 
extension of the sale of stock in the mustang ranch until oct 31 
to allow time to restructure the offer 
in the meantime the sale of common stock in mustang ranch inc 
has been halted and all the money received for the shares so far 
will be returned to investors walloga said in a statement released 
by his office in tampa fla 
the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
require that we make this move he said walloga the president 
of american wallstreet was out of the office wednesday and 
unavailable for comment 
wednesday was the deadline for the threemonthold bid to take 
the mustang ranch public through a 233 million stock offering at 
20 a share walloga said last week about 75 percent of the 1165 
million shares had been sold leaving the company with a 5 million 
shortfall 
wallogas statement said an amendment would be filed with the 
sec and the states that have approved sale of the stock to reflect 
the terms of the new deal which walloga said would change the 
types of securities mustang ranch inc would offer 
no details of the newly structured offering could be released 
at this time pending a response from the sec to a request for an 
interpretive ruling concerning a technical issue which arose in 
developing the amendment to the offering the statement said 
peter perry a reno attorney and vice president of mustang ranch 
inc said in the statement he expected the amendment to the 
registration to be filed with the sec by june 15 
perry would not comment specifically on the offer citing sec 
rules which forbid parties in a stock offering to discuss them 
mustang ranch inc is an investors group composed primarily of 
reno businessmen and attorneys who are making a second attempt to 
turn the brothel public 
a 1985 bid by strong point inc led by john davis of irvine 
calif fell through after failing to generate enough interest in 
the 18 million proposal 
the money raised in the current sale was to have provided 13 
million to buy the 102room brothel and its 440 acres of land from 
joe and sally conforte 5 million in exchange for the confortes 
promise not to set up a competing brothel and 53 million for 
expansion improvements and working capital 
conforte has been trying to sell the brothel 10 miles east of 
reno since 1985 when he was released from prison after serving 18 
months on a tax conviction 
he has said he expects most of the money from the sale to go to 
the federal government in payment of his longstanding tax debt 
plus the hefty interest and penalties it has run up

the stinky inspiration for sneaker balls came to 
entrepreneur dennis green two years ago after his wife complained 
about an aroma in his car 
she said she borrowed my car and it sure smelled bad she said 
it was the gym bag in the back seat said green an athletic 
45yearold who plays basketball regularly 
it just hit me all of a sudden theres a product there not 
something to freshen the car but to freshen the bag so it wouldnt 
smell the car up he said 
that brainstorm spawned sneaker balls fragrance discs encased 
in colorful pingpongsize balls made of recycled plastic soft drink 
bottles greens invention is designed to cut the odor of moldy gym 
bags rancid tennis shoes and sweaty lockers for up to three months 
each sneaker ball exudes a fragrance and an odorblocker which 
floods the olfactory receptors of the brain so they cannot smell 
sweat green says the chemicals are released by twisting the balls 
to open slots cut into the sides 
according to their motto sneaker balls have the courage to go 
where the ugly stuff grows 
it sounds like a funny idea but since sneaker balls hit the 
market in july 1988 greens company dennis green design group 
ltd has sold 15 million at 250 to 4 apiece a new sneaker ball 
design will debut later this year and the back orders already 
total 5 million 
greens business comes from most of the big us discount store 
chains and athletic footwear retailers and from stores in canada 
mexico europe and asia 
but green isnt in the factory all day supervising production 
hes at home writing fiction 
i have one philosophy in business and that is that i want to 
write books and if i have employees i cant very well do that 
he said 
for that reason green has subcontracted the entire sneaker 
balls manufacturing and distribution operation to a loveland colo 
company called new systems molding 
about 50 employees at the new systems plant work 
aroundtheclock molding sneaker balls and assembling them green 
expects the work force to double within six months 
green is a trained architect who grew bored with his profession 
and began designing and selling his own line of greeting cards 
within five years green and his wife were designing and selling 
greeting cards across the united states and in 24 other countries 
in 1981 they sold the business so green could write but the 
new owners went bankrupt three years later greens income stopped 
and he went back to designing and selling cards until his wifes 
complaint gave him the idea for sneaker balls 
green said it took a year to make a prototype of sneaker balls 
that he could display to potential investors 
i began doing research i didnt know anything about 
fragrances or plastics either he said i made the prototype by 
stuffing fragrance in cotton balls because i didnt know anything 
about fragrance discs i put them in my bag when i worked out i 
put them in my shoes when i wasnt working out 
in a locker room one day someone noticed greens sneaker balls 
and asked him about them the man who was a broker signed an 
option agreement with green that led to a contract with an investor 
group 
but that was a false start the investors made the first 
payment but not the next two green took sneaker balls to a trade 
show and immediately found a distributor who got him a contract 
with k mart corp 
four months later in july 1988 he began shipping sneaker balls 
to customers 
now green spends his mornings writing fiction and his 
afternoons attending to business and playing basketball a 
carryover from his days at boise state college in idaho where he 
was a starting forward 
and as business booms hes also finished his first novel 
double bind a psychological thriller about a washington 
journalist

employees of continental can co are 
entitled to pension benefits they were systematically cheated out 
of by top company brass a federal judge has ruled 
us district judge h lee sarokin said wednesday continental 
can developed a secret and sophisticated computer program used 
nationwide to keep longtime employees from becoming vested in 
pension programs 
an attorney for the workers said the judges remarks proved the 
companys actions have been deplorable and said it could lead to 
individual awards that exceed 100000 each to some workers and 
total more than 500 million 
in a sharplyworded opinion against the company sarokin 
directed continental can to begin negotiating settlements with 
about 2500 continental workers 
the plan was shrouded in secrecy and executed companywide at 
the specific direction of the highest levels of corporate 
management sarokin said in a written opinion 
it was intended to save hundreds of millions of dollars in 
unfunded pension liabilities he continued the evidence of the 
plan its secrecy and its execution comes from the files of the 
defendants themselves the documents are more than a smoking gun 
they are a fusillade 
the case sarokin heard specifically covered 315 layoffs at a st 
louis plant and 43 of the companys other 45 plants conceivably 
could have had their cases heard individually 
a suit on behalf of a los angeles plant was won by the 
employees a suit filed on behalf of pittsburgh employees is still 
in litigation 
but sarokin said in his ruling that there was no need to hear 
the other cases against continental based in norwalk conn 
what the judge has said is that this should end all the cases 
everywhere said robert plotkin an attorney for the workers 
this is not a case of a classaction suit where plaintiffs 
each have a claim to 10 he continued what were talking here 
is you have many former employees who have individual claims worth 
in excess of 100000 
attorney douglas g eakeley of chicago who represented 
continental can did not immediately return phone messages a 
secretary in his office said she would leave a message for eakeley 
and two associates working on the case 
the benefits in question were special magic number pensions 
negotiated in 1977 by the united steelworkers for employees subject 
to periodic layoffs they were designed to protect employees with 
long years of service who had not yet reached normal retirement age 
but attorneys for the workers have maintained and the judge 
agreed that continental management adopted a secret computerized 
plan to prevent employees from vesting in the costly pensions by 
laying them off before they became eligible 
the federal pension law the employee retirement income security 
act prohibits employers from taking any action against workers for 
the purpose of interfering with their pensions 
for a corporation of this magnitude to engage in a complex 
secret and deliberate scheme to deny its workers bargainedfor 
pension benefits raises questions of corporate morality ethics and 
decency which far transcend the factual and legal issues posed by 
this matter the judge said 
plotkin said sarokins ruling should persuade the company not to 
drag the suit on but that he wasnt counting on it 
continentals continued efforts to avoid its obligations to 
those employees any way it can are deplorable he said 
company attorneys had argued there was no secret plan in place 
and that even if there were the employees would have been laid off 
anyway 
sarokin rejected that argument he appointed george l priest a 
professor at yale law school to assist the two sides in settling 
individual claims and he ordered the money to be paid promptly 
the class members are entitled to compensation while they are 
still in a position to enjoy it the judge said they are 
entitled to the benefits for which they bargained for and for which 
they worked

occidental petroleum corp chairman armand 
hammer whose art collection includes works by leonardo da vinci 
and impressionists is wasting millions of dollars in company 
funds on selfaggrandizing plans for a hammer museum of art 
shareholders charged in two lawsuits 
the suits which became public wednesday in delaware chancery 
court seek court orders blocking further occidental spending on 
the planned museum requiring return of money already committed and 
canceling hammers employment contract with occidental 
defendant dr hammer has breached his duty of loyalty to 
occidental and its stockholders by instigating and forcing 
occidental to participate in his personal plan of 
selfaggrandizement in creating his own personal museum one suit 
says 
the 91yearold hammer who carefully cultivates a media image 
of international philanthropist and unofficial business envoy to 
the soviet union will fight the allegations as totally without 
merit a company spokesman said 
the lawsuits filed in the state where the oilandchemical 
giant is incorporated name both occidental and its directors 
including hammer as defendants 
the actions center on a firstquarter expense of 36 million to 
purchase an annuity to fund the planned museum on rentfree use of 
company office space for museum purposes and on a corporate 
commitment to fund construction of a building for the museum at a 
cost estimated at 30 million to 50 million 
requests for a hammer response were referred to philadelphia 
attorney bruce kauffman who represents a special committee of the 
occidental board that approved the museum support 
kauffman said occidental directors acted well within the law and 
in keeping with their duty to the corporation in approving 
charitable spending that would enhance the companys standing in 
the community 
all kinds of companies choose to spread their good will in 
different ways kauffman said we choose to spread our good 
will in a way that will benefit hundreds of thousands of people to 
say for one minute that this is not going to benefit occidental is 
in my opinion just ridiculous 
one suit was filed by alan r kahn trustee for the estate of 
samuel adason jaffe which holds 700 occidental shares the other 
by joseph sullivan and alan i brody who describe themselves as 
occidental shareholders without detailing their holdings 
they seek injunctions that among other things would bar 
further occidental support of the museum including rentfree use 
of company buildings cancel compensation to hammer and require an 
accounting of any losses the company incurred in connection with 
the museum 
they also allege that proxy material mailed to shareholders for 
the companys upcoming annual meeting was misleading about the 36 
million expenditure for the museum including it as unallocated 
corporate expenses 
the sullivanbrody suit paints a particularly unflattering 
portrait of occidentals chairman and chief executive officer in 
detailing a dispute with the los angeles county museum of art over 
the future of his personal collection said to be worth 250 
million to 400 million 
the collection includes works by dutch flemish german and 
italian masters impressionist works and a codex or book of notes 
and drawings by da vinci 
last year hammer canceled what the museum portrayed as a 
promise to donate his art to the county when museum officials 
rejected conditions including posting a fulllength portrait of the 
industrialist at the entrance to the exhibit 
other conditions unacceptable to the museum according the suit 
that the collection be kept intact forever and displayed under 
hammers name that names of other museum benefactors be removed 
from galleries displaying hammers art that the collection get a 
special curator answerable to a hammer foundation rather than to 
the museum 
the dispute led to hammers plan to build his own museum the 
suit says adding unlike other wealthy collectors dr hammer 
does not plan to build his own museum with his own ample funds 
rather dr hammer is requiring occidental to provide substantially 
all the financial support 
company attorney kauffman disputed at least part of that noting 
the considerable value of the collection hammer intended to 
contribute to the project 
hammer whose 1987 pay was 19 million has held sway over 
occidental since 1957 
based on contacts he made during a postworld war ii medical 
mercy mission in the soviet union he served as unofficial envoy 
for the united states government during the cold war as relations 
have thawed in recent years he has led a parade of american 
businesses into the soviet union setting up joint ventures for 
chemical plants and the like 
hammer who holds a medical degree has used his connections and 
company jet to get american doctors to the scene of various 
disasters including the chernobyl nuclear accident and the 
armenian earthquake

agencys fraudfighting effort 
the enforcement program is a very strong program its 
staffed with super professionals i dont think my departure is 
going to have much of an effect said lynch who announced 
wednesday that he will leave the sec staff in midjuly 
a lanky softspoken 38yearold attorney lynch joined the sec 
in 1976 a year after graduating from duke university law school 
he became the agencys youngestever enforcement director in early 
1985 
he steps down four years later amid a chorus of praise for 
playing the central role in breaking open a series of insider 
trading cases beginning with the exposure of stockbroker dennis 
levine continuing through a 100 million settlement with 
speculator ivan boesky and culminating four weeks ago with the 
settlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bondgiant 
drexel burnham lambert inc the nations fifthlargest securities 
firm 
hes done extremely well but the point is the agency will 
survive said stanley sporkin a former sec enforcement chief 
now a federal judge in washington 
its a resilient agency and there are no indispensable persons 
in life said sporkin the man who hired lynch 
lynch took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoil 
for the sec and is credited with restoring morale damaged when his 
predecessor john fedders departed amid charges he had beaten his 
wife 
harvey pitt boeskys attorney and a former sec general counsel 
said lynch leaves behind four strong deputies including associate 
director john h sturc and all are capable of succeeding him 
i think the secs enforcement division is incredibly deep in 
talent he said 
although some securities lawyers say privately that lynch 
happened to be in the right place at the right time to lead the 
crusade against wall street greed pitt and others say he was 
crucial to the effort 
i think his contribution really cannot be overstated pitt 
said he has given direction and leadership to a program that 
really had not produced anywhere near the results he has now 
produced 
lynch is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecy 
surrounding the bahamas branch of a swiss bank where dennis levine 
maintained an account 
it was three years ago this friday that the sec filed its 
charges against levine whose cooperation led to boesky who in 
turn implicated drexel burnham in the largest securities fraud case 
ever brought by the government 
drexels agreement on the civil case brought by the sec is 
paving the way for it to pay a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution to settle criminal charges 
other prominent cases credited to lynch include martin a 
siegel managing director of drexel who paid 9 million to settle 
civil charges and boyd l jefferies who was forced to resign as 
head of the los angeles firm he founded 
the scandals uncovered during lynchs tenure forced wall 
streets big brokerage houses to reevaluate their compliance and 
ethics codes and led congress to increase the penalties for insider 
trading 
as a government employee lynch worked 11hour days and 
weekends earning an annual salary of about 72000 far less than 
he could earn in private practice but neither the salary nor the 
long hours played a major role in his decision to leave he said 
lynch said he has made no specific plans for his future 
on capitol hill rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house energy and commerce committee which oversees the sec and a 
frequent critic of the agency said hell be missed hes been a 
good public servant whose done a superb job of marshaling limited 
resources 
the sec is losing a strikingly successful public servant 
said rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the energy and 
commerce subcommittee on finance

the drought of 88 is now the drought of 
89 in parts of the central plains and farmers and stockmen are 
worried as dry conditions worsen and congress fails to provide help 
this year 
i guess they havent decided yet we have a disaster said 
central kansas wheat farmer darwin mccall 
drought conditions have led experts to predict the kansas winter 
wheat crop will only make around 200 million bushels 123 million 
bushels fewer than last year despite a 22 percent increase in 
acres seeded the projected harvest is about half what the crop 
should have yielded based on the 124 million acres planted in the 
fall 
analysts say that translates into a 500 million to 800 million 
loss to the kansas economy reduced harvests also are expected in 
nebraska eastern colorado oklahoma and texas 
the first official agriculture department estimate of the 1989 
winter wheat crop was to be released this afternoon 
the kansas livestock association the kansas association of 
wheat growers the kansas farm bureau and the kansas farmers union 
have written repeatedly to agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
seeking help 
the groups are asking for several breaks for cattlemen 
it would be hard to overstate the severity of the current 
situation and the need for an extremely rapid decision on these 
requests said warren weibert president of the livestock 
association 
because there isnt enough pasture or hay kansas cattlemen are 
selling off cows they use to produce calves for beef slaughter 
many stockmen have spent years building the genetics in their herds 
many producers and kansas farm groups favor extending the 
provisions of the 39 billion 1988 drought relief bill to cover 
1989 losses 
yeutter was asked to take that step by administrative action he 
refused saying it was up to congress to act several house 
measures have been introduced and a subcommittee of the house 
agriculture committee has scheduled hearings in texas and kansas 
may 19 and 20 
the 89 drought is simply an extension of the 88 drought we 
feel farmers in the midwest should receive the same consideration 
for disaster payments in 1989 that corn farmers in the western corn 
belt received in 1988 said ivan wyatt president of the kansas 
farmers union 
doyle rahjes president of the kansas farm bureau the states 
largest farm group said the 250 million to 350 million that 
drought assistance might cost could be covered by the anticipated 
decrease in federal wheat subsidy payments because of the poor crop 
it could be done without affecting the budget hardly at all 
because of the deficiency payment reduction rahjes said we 
feel it isnt something that would be a burden to taxpayers 
farmers enrolled in federal grain programs get deficiency 
payments to make up the difference between market prices and target 
prices set by the agriculture department since the wheat crop is 
poor and market prices are up the subsidy payments are expected to 
cost far less than expected 
to make the federal bailout pill less bitter the cattlemen have 
proposed costsharing projects instead of outright direct federal 
payments 
the livestock association wants a retroactive water project 
costshare program and federal help with the costs of transporting 
cattle to pasture in nearby states 
howard tice spokesman for the kansas association of wheat 
growers said farmers are seeking only enough assistance to cover 
their planting costs so they can keep going another year he said 
for many farmers who have struggled back to their financial feet 
the past two years the drought could be a knockout punch 
when it comes to keeping farmers in farming and keeping wheat 
production going in the largest wheat producing state in the 
nation i really believe there is no doubt washington is going to 
come around and come up with a disaster program to help us out 
tice said

a new requirement by the securities and 
exchange commission making brokerage houses point out contract 
language that prevents customers from suing offers too little 
protection a house subcommittee chairman says 
the commission by a 50 vote wednesday approved several rule 
changes including one spurred by complaints from unhappy investors 
who discovered after the october 1987 stock crash that they had 
signed away their right to sue their brokers 
many firms in the fine print in paperwork to open an account 
require customers to agree in advance to settle any disputes 
through industryadministered arbitration proceedings rather than 
through the courts 
the sec under the new rule effective in 120 days will require 
firms to highlight and fully explain arbitration clauses so 
investors know what theyre signing 
the commission decided against an outright ban of the clauses 
some members were reluctant to dictate the terms of contracts 
entered into by private parties 
also brokerage firm executives had argued that banning the 
clauses could destroy the arbitration system and push more cases 
onto the nations already crowded court dockets 
i regret the sec ducked the central issues of choice and 
voluntariness rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on finance individual 
investors will still be denied the option in many instances of 
choosing to go to court instead of arbitration 
arbitration because it is cheaper and faster than suing in 
court is a good deal for many investors particularly those with 
small claims but there is only a limited right of appeal and some 
investors may be better off in court 
but sec chairman david s ruder said enough firms offer cash 
accounts without arbitration clauses that investors still have 
access to the market even if they want to keep their right to go to 
court however he warned that the sec will be checking to see if 
more firms start using arbitration clauses 
the rules governing arbitration have become increasingly 
critical following a supreme court decision in 1987 that upheld the 
validity of arbitration clauses also the number of arbitration 
cases has mushroomed from 830 in 1980 to 6101 last year 
the sec in adopting the changes acted on proposals from the 
new york stock exchange the american stock exchange and the 
national association of securities dealers 
i think they will make the arbitration process better and 
clear up some of the perception problems that have nagged the 
system said commission member charles cox 
another important change requires the exchanges to keep track of 
the amounts of arbitration awards the amounts originally sought 
the issues in dispute and the brokers and firms involved 
we now for the first time really will be in a position to 
effectively monitor the arbitration process said commissioner 
mary schapiro 
other changes are aimed at ensuring that the public members 
of arbitration panels do not have ties to the securities industry 
that arbitrators disclose any ties that may affect their decisions 
and that arbitrators get more power to compel brokers and 
plaintiffs to turn over relevant documents in a timely manner

spiegel lands end and ll bean addicts 
beware the nations governors want you to begin paying sales 
taxes on your mailorder shopping sprees 
governors joined by state legislators and mayors are urging 
congress to overturn a 22yearold supreme court decision and 
require large mailorder companies to collect sales taxes n sales 
to outofstate customers 
as a result of that ruling north dakota gov george sinner told 
a news conference wednesday hometown merchants are at a decided 
disadvantage and states cities and counties are losing more than 
15 billion a year in tax revenue 
because state sales taxes run from 5 percent to 8 percent of 
the cost of the goods sold the unfair tax advantage by 
outofstate firms in sales taxes is greater than the average 
profit margin of main street merchants sinner said in fact he 
added the average hometown merchants profit margin is less than 3 
percent 
opponents of the proposal held their own news conference to warn 
that consumers wont put up with it 
this will have the maximum irritation effect on tens of 
millions of consumers who would have to do the tax calculations 
every time they order said robert levering vice president of 
the direct marketing association 
sen robert w kasten jr rwis whose state is home to lands 
end added that the bill unfairly targets the elderly the 
handicapped farm families and the millions of consumers who rely 
on mailorder purchases for many of their basic needs 
not so said the national governors association which chose to 
emphasize the bills effect on wellheeled yuppies 
many of the goods sold by mailorder firms are expensive 
highquality designertype goods that appeal to young urban 
professionals pastel sweaters 24 cotton tshirts fancy 
briefcases electronic gizmos and exercise or recreational 
equipment the association said in a written statement 
the supreme court held in 1967 that a company could not be 
required to collect sales taxes on purchases from an outofstate 
company unless that company had a retail outlet in the state 
sears and jc penney for example collect sales taxes on 
catalog orders because they have retail stores in every state but 
lands end the giant mailorder clothing company in wisconsin 
collects no tax on outofstate shipments because it has no other 
outlets 
the national governors association the national league of 
cities and other government organizations are supporting a bill to 
require large companies to collect tax on shipments to any state in 
which they regularly solicit business thus if lands end shipped 
a catalog to tennessee that would be interpreted as soliciting and 
the company would have to collect the states sales tax on 
tennessee orders 
the bill is sponsored by rep jack brooks dtexas chairman of 
the house judiciary committee it would apply only to the estimated 
5 percent of mailorder outlets whose sales exceed 125 million a 
year but those 5 percent account for 70 percent of mailorder 
sales 
similar legislation stalled last year and opponents led by the 
direct marketing association are geared up for the renewed battle 
if this legislation were to pass direct marketers would be 
saddled with tax collection duties for over 7000 municipal and 
state tax jurisdictions said levering that means we can be 
audited by every one of those jurisdictions even where our 
companies dont have physical presence in a state and dont 
receive benefits 
across the capitol at the session sponsored by backers of the 
bill james goldberg counsel for the national association of 
retail dealers of america said most mailorder customers charge 
purchases to their credit cards and so would not have to calculate 
the sales tax

the environmental protection agency is failing 
to notify other countries about dangerous pesticides shipped to 
them even though the substances may be used on fruits and 
vegetables eaten by americans the general accounting office said 
the epa received repeated warning about such notification more 
than a decade ago 
western europe is the biggest market for pesticides taking 25 
percent of world sales followed by the far east which accounts 
for 23 percent according to the report the fastest growing 
markets are india brazil china and spain 
the report quoted the epas office of pesticide programs as 
saying about half the pesticides that latin american countries 
import are bought from the united states latin america furnishes a 
substantial amount of the fruits and vegetables americans eat in 
the winter 
not having notices issued could result in continued use in 
foreign countries of a pesticide that may damage the health of its 
citizens or damage its environment the report said 
additionally the crops treated with the pesticide could be 
imported into the united states to the detriment of the health of 
us citizens and the environment 
the report dated april 25 was sent to rep mike synar dokla 
chairman of the environment subcommittee in the house committee on 
government operations the general accounting office looks into 
activities of the administration on behalf of congress 
copies were made available to reporters this week 
the gao said us manufacturers had canceled the registration of 
four pesticides after the agency started or threatened to start 
special reviews because of dangerous effects on humans or 
laboratory animals it found that notices were sent to foreign 
governments on only one of these pesticides called cyhexatin 
saying it could cause birth defects if pregnant women worked in 
fields where it was used 
no notices were sent on the three others epn captafol and and 
carbon tetrachloride according to the office which quoted epa 
officials as saying that they only send notices when they feel 
there is a health concern 
according to the report epn damages the nerves of laboratory 
animals and captafol gives them tumors and is highly toxic to 
fish it said carbon tetrachloride may cause damage to peoples 
livers lungs kidneys and nervous systems and is regarded by 
cancer researchers as a probable cause of cancer 
in april 1978 the gao reported that the agency was not making 
notifications and therefore not complying with the law it 
recommended the agency work out a system with the state department 
for telling other countries about dangerous pesticides gao made 
another report the following year 
in the decade since we issued these reports these problems 
have not been resolved though epa has told us that it has made 
attempts to address them the report said 
although publicly acknowledging the need for improvements the 
pull of conflicting priorities has generally made it difficult for 
epa to effect these needed changes according to officials 
responsible for the notification program

a federal budget that critics say does not do 
enough to tackle inflation and deficit spending has aggravated 
fears of economic bust after years of sometimes booming growth 
finance minister michael wilson is sticking to his view that 
inflationary pressures can be reduced and that new budget gives the 
central bank the scope to reduce interest rates more quickly than 
would otherwise be the case 
however the conference board of canada an ottawabased think 
tank says in its budget analysis that the risk of recession has 
grown as a result of the fiscal decisions announced last month 
we think the economy is going to be very very soft for the 
next six months james frank the boards chief economist told 
the globe and mail newspaper 
since a second straight majority government of the progressive 
conservative party was elected in november prime minister brian 
mulroney wilson and other senior officials have led a steady 
drumbeat calling for a reduction of government debt 
although the 198990 budget raises taxes and cuts federal 
spending in areas from the military to rail service and child care 
it still leaves a deficit of 256 billion up slightly from the 
previous years 252 billion deficit 
wilson says the new budget is the first step in bringing the 
annual deficit down to 126 billion in four years 
however achieving that goal may depend on a drop in interest 
rates continued economic growth and tough tax policies 
george vasic of the data resources forecasting firm says 
mulroney missed the chance to make more progress on the budget 
deficit at the outset of his second term when election worries are 
at their lowest 
its a major opportunity that was squandered he said we 
feel that theres about a 40 percent chance of a recession between 
now and the end of 1990 
he said however that slower growth is more likely 
warren jestin chief economist of scotiabank is more 
optimistic he predicts growth of 3 percent this year slowing to 2 
percent or less in 1990 
the canadian economy has grown at times dramatically since the 
end of the 1982 recession the gross national product rose beyond 
inflation by 4 percent in 1987 and 45 percent in 1988 
inflation has been running about 4 percent each year but 
concern that the economy was overheating prompted bank of canada 
governor john crow to increase interest rates over the past year to 
their current 12 percent levels 
forecasts of recession or slowdown have surfaced persistently in 
canada since the stock market crash of 1987 in large part because 
of the long expansion

wall street corruption may provide the 
windfall the government needs to finance its efforts against 
illegal drug traffickers some members of congress say 
leaders of the house appropriations committee said wednesday 
that they are weighing a plan that would channel 150 million to be 
collected in fines from drexel burnham lambert inc this year into 
federal antidrug initiatives 
under the proposal the money would be used to pay for prison 
improvements additional law officers grants to state and local 
governments and other programs during the last months of fiscal 
1989 which ends sept 30 
the appropriations panel would claim the extra spending is not 
adding to the federal deficit because it would be financed with the 
unanticipated fines 
thus in my way of thinking its an offset for that 
spending said rep neal smith diowa chairman of the 
appropriations justice subcommittee who proposed the idea 
drexel burnham agreed last december to pay 650 million in fines 
and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle 
securities fraud charges brought by the us attorneys office in 
manhattan 
the plan is expected to meet opposition from some democrats and 
republicans who likely will argue that with an potential deficit of 
more than 160 billion this year the drexel fine can hardly be 
considered unaccountedfor money 
in addition some lawmakers have argued that fines collected by 
the securities and exchange commission should be used to strengthen 
that agencys law enforcement efforts 
the proposal is part of an effort by the appropriations 
committee to revamp a 47 billion domestic spending bill for this 
year a measure rejected by the house last month because ot its 
high cost 
the bill contained money for veterans college students 
antidrug efforts and other programs 
included in the package was 726 million in new spending 
authority from smiths subcommittee for antidrug programs about 
300 million of which would have actually been spent this year 
to make the overall bill more appealing the appropriations 
committee would offset most new spending with cuts in other 
programs thus reducing the packages impact on the federal deficit 
the appropriations committee hopes to bring the new version of 
the spending bill to the house floor next week and smith said he 
expects the use of the drexel burnham money to be included 
there is a general approval by the members of the committee of 
this approach but there is no concrete agreement he said 
the chairmen of the 13 appropriations subcommittees have agreed 
to drop from the bill 250 million for reparations to 
japaneseamericans who were held in internment camps during world 
war ii and most of 153 million that would have been used for the 
homeless 
the final package will be less than 47 billion but the total 
will not be determined until the subcommittee chairmen meet again 
next tuesday

a preliminary study by the agriculture 
department says the era of irrigation expansion in the united 
states may not be over 
after irrigated farmland peaked at 503 million acres in 1978 
there was a gradual downtrend evidenced by the governments 1982 
farm census and by a 1984 usda survey many experts believed 
irrigation expansion had run its course 
the report by the departments economic research service showed 
that crop irrigation dropped to 49 million acres in 1982 and then 
plummeted to 423 million acres in 1983 as federal acreage programs 
and low prices prompted farmers to make sharp cutbacks 
some recovery was reported in several years following 1983 but 
irrigation still lagged behind the old peak of the late 1970s 
last year when drought parched crops across much of the nation 
irrigation edged up slightly to 459 million acres from 445 
million acres in 1987 
irrigated area in 1989 could be the highest since 1982 
reflecting strong crop prices moderate energy prices and low 
annual acreage setasides reduction programs the report said 
in the east last years drought is expected to stimulate some 
investment in irrigation as a form of insurance 
in the west where most of the nations irrigation is located 
the water supply has improved from a year ago 
the report in the may issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
was written by economists bill quinby and john hostetler 
crop prices and acreage diversion programs have more influence 
on irrigated area than do weather conditions or energy prices 
the report said after expanding about 30 percent per decade 
from 1900 to 1930 irrigation development slow to 4 percent in 
the 1930s a period marked by low crop prices 
when crop prices rose in the 1940s and 1950s irrigation growth 
was encouraged once again 
the expansion of crop irrigation in the mid1970s was a 
substantial deviation from the pattern the report said that 
was due to favorable crop prices and expanding exports which 
helped push irrigation growth to about 23 million acres per year 
slower growth in the early 1980s reflected adjustments to crop 
surpluses and low prices the report said 
hostetler added wednesday in a telephone interview that last 
years severe drought will encourage people to at least think 
about irrigation and that some will invest in new systems or 
expand operations as a result 
he said its too early to conclude whether irrigation is back on 
an expansion track because all the figures arent in yet 
the report said the national figures mask regional trends for 
example the pacific and mountain regions account for more than 
half the us irrigated area in 1987 the two regions had 241 
million acres under irrigation down about 2 million acres from 
1982 but almost 700000 acres more than in 1983 
last year the west had poor soil moisture prior to planting and 
there was reduced streamflow during the crop growing season the 
irrigated area was cut back to 239 million acres in 1982 the 
area was 26 million acres 
in the plains states which straddle the nation between the arid 
west and the humid east irrigation grew to 137 million acres last 
year from 126 million in 1987 but that was well behind the 153 
million acres in 1982 in 1983 however the irrigated area 
plummeted to 115 million acres 
because much of the irrigation water in the southern plains is 
pumped from deep wells that have declining water tables energy 
costs represent a substantial share of production costs the 
report said irrigated area declined in 1974 and 1982 following 
steep rises in natural gas prices 
the east had a record 82 million acres under irrigation last 
year up from 77 million in 1987 and 76 million in 1982 the 
report said 
irrigation has more than quadrupled since 1969 in the corn 
belt and lake states the report said in these regions 
irrigation is supplemental and there is strong evidence that 
weather affects irrigated acreage 
the easts irrigation is also supplemental used when and if 
needed last years drought helped push irrigation to a record 
level the report said

the governments exportimport bank is 4 
billion to 6 billion in the red and the figure could reach 10 
billion by 1992 the chairman of the house banking committee says 
with the billions it will cost to fix the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp fresh on our minds we must surely face the 
eximbanks insolvency which was heedlessly disregarded by the 
reagan administration the chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said wednesday 
gonzalez was referring to the savings and loan crisis the 
eximbank lends mostly to third world countries to encourage sales 
of american goods 
the exportimport clearly fulfills a very useful even 
essential purpose gonzalez said it creates jobs domestically 
and helps our export industry lower our massive trade deficit 
but the eximbank is insolvent this means the budget deficit 
and cost of subsidizing our export industry are both understated by 
4 to 6 billion 
we have seen with the tragic fslic crisis that masking the 
true insolvency of a government agency has disastrous results and 
the taxpayer ultimately bears the burden of this irresponsibility 
william ryan the banks acting president replied that normal 
accounting practices do not apply because the bank is backed by the 
full faith and credit of the federal government 
gonzalez complained that it still carries as assets loans made 
to cuba before president fidel castro took over and to china before 
the victory of the communists on the mainland 
eximbank has not received a cent on these loans in over 40 
years he said 
ryan said these were debts of sovereign countries and there is 
some hope of collecting them 
gonzalez spoke at a hearing of his panels subcommittee on 
international development ryan was appearing before it to say that 
demand for the banks loans last year exceeded its 693 million 
ceiling by 150 million and it expected the same thing to happen 
again in the year that ends sept 30 
as a result we may again have to defer 150 million to 250 
million in authorizations into 1990 he said

the makers of rolling rock beer believe they 
have steered around a bottleneck and are nearing a solution on how 
to comply with a new law requiring warning labels on beer bottles 
the law requires that alcoholic beverage containers carry labels 
warning of possible adverse health effects from drinking wine 
liquor or beer by nov 18 
but pennsylvanias latrobe brewing cos distinctive green 
rolling rock bottles carry painted rather than paper labels 
therefore the law would make as many as 1 million cases of 
rolling rock each containing 24 bottles of beer obsolete 
because the cost to alter them is prohibitive 
the answer may be a grace period during which latrobe would be 
permitted to print the warning on bottle caps instead of on the 
containers 
were a small player and we dont want to send out a message 
that something special is being done for latrobe albert 
spinelli vice president of operations said wednesday 
all were looking for is a time period to phase out the 
existing bottles as we bring new bottles in he said in the 
meantime weve had samples made up with the warning message on 
the cap and its legible 
writing the 41word warning on the cap would be only a temporary 
solution congress specified that the warning must appear on 
containers and that the print on bottles 12 ounces and larger must 
be at least two millimeters tall 
the law also would affect rolling rocks sevenounce bottles 
rolling rock has refused to change to a paper label because it 
feels the painted label gives it its distinctive identity 
rep john murtha dpa has received permission from the house 
appropriations committee to insert language in a spending bill that 
would grant rolling rock a grace period murtha spokesman bill 
allen said wednesday the bill is likely to be considered by the 
house within a week 
it is uncertain how long latrobe might have to fully comply with 
the law latrobe has said it could take 10 years before the 24 
million bottles wear out or get broken or lost although the 
brewery does not expect to win a grace period nearly that long 
on the senate side strom thurmond rsc the author of the 
law has indicated he wants to accommodate latrobe officials if he 
can according to aides to sen john heinz rpa 
everybody seems to agree this is a unique situation allen 
said everybody seems agreeable

the union representing most 
black mobil corp employees in south africa said thursday it is 
preparing for a strike to protest the us companys refusal to 
negotiate terms of its planned pullout 
pat horne a spokeswoman for the chemical workers industrial 
union said a strike ballot was planned for next week 
if approved she said a strike would be launched against mobil 
and other multinational companies that have not complied with a 
union demand to negotiate terms favorable to workers in the event 
of disinvestment from south africa 
mobil the largest us company operating in south africa 
announced april 28 that it was selling its holdings in the country 
to the general union mining corp a conglomerate known as gencor 
which owns a petroleum company 
the sale price was not disclosed and the ownership change will 
not take effect until various financial arrangements are completed 
mobil said gencor had pledged to continue the companys 
employment policies and honor all existing agreements with the 
union but union officials nonetheless were angered saying mobil 
had rebuffed past attempts to open negotiations by insisting there 
were no plans for disinvestment 
of mobils 2800 employees in south africa about 1500 are 
black including about 1200 represented by the chemical workers 
union 
the union had approached several foreign companies including

minnesota mining amp manufacturing co 
said it plans to create an employee stock ownership plan to help 
pay for employee retirement accounts not fend off unwanted 
takeovers 
the company said wednesday it plans to establish the esop and 
buy back up to 10 million shares in the next year 
such plans have been used to thwart takeover attempts by putting 
more stock in friendly hands but the 3m plan will put less than 4 
percent of the companys outstanding common stock into the esop 
said jon greer 3ms program manager for investor relations 
it is not being adopted as a takeover defense greer said 
its being done because its a more costeffective way to finance 
contributions to retirement accounts 
3m will borrow 550 million to fund the esop with 75 million 
new shares of common stock the shares will be allocated to 
employees over a 15year period 
even though 3m for years has been giving stock to its employees 
as part of retirement plans it had never officially established an 
esop greer said under the esop 3m will be able to deduct for tax 
purposes both the principal and interest on the borrowings greer 
said 
in addition certain tax benefits to the lenders will allow 3m 
to borrow the money at lower rates greer declined to say how much 
money 3m will save under the strategy 
in a related action 3ms board authorized the company to 
repurchase up to 10 million shares between may 31 1989 and june 
1 1990 the purchases expected to be made on the open market 
will be used to replace the previously authorized shares sold to 
the esop for existing employee stock plans and for other 
corporate needs 3m said

campbell can say its soup is mm mm 
good but can longer tout it as promoting good health unless it 
can prove it 
the nations no 1 soup company settled a yearold dispute 
wednesday with nine states over advertised claims that it soups 
provide health benefits and may help prevent some types of cancer 
where we make a specific claim it has to be true said 
james h moran a campbell soup co spokesman if we say 
something is promoting good health weve got to be able to 
document that 
the agreement does not affect a complaint filed against campbell 
in january by the federal trade commission which accused the 
company of overstating the health benefits of its chicken noodle 
soup 
campbell advertisements misled consumers by failing to alert 
them of the soups sodium content the agency charged 
campbell halted the ads challenged by the nine states a year 
ago but moran said the company plans to fight the ftc complaint 
were standing by the ad and were going to court and prove 
our case said moran 
camdenbased campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year 
garnering about 65 percent of the 22 billion retail soup market 
in the united states its advertising claims have come under heavy 
criticism from the center for science in the public interest 
since 1983 the washingtonbased consumer group has twice asked 
the ftc to review campbells advertising and sodium content claims 
the amount of sodium and salt in the soups is a serious 
concern said charles mitchell a staff attorney for the group 
most of their soups are so high in sodium that the increased risk 
of high blood pressure from the soups might outweigh any other 
positive benefits that are or are not in the soups 
the agreement announced wednesday ended an 11monthold dispute 
the states contended that campbells ads generally 
mischaracterized the health effects of campbells soup products 
said wisconsin attorney general don hanaway 
among them he said were high fiber claims about products that 
were not high in fiber calcium source claims about soupsthat are 
not a good source of calcium and claims that its bean and pea soups 
can prevent some kinds of cancer 
under the settlement campbell agreed to pay the states 35000 
each and to change certain advertising practices the money will be 
used by each state for consumer education and aid 
this settlement helps send the message to food marketers that 
they cannot claim falsely that a product is high in desirable 
nutrients said minnesota attorney general hubert humphrey iii 
wisconsin also worked with attorneys general of california 
illinois iowa massachusetts missouri new york and texas in 
reaching the settlement 
this type of action by this many states is unprecedented 
said mitchell it reinforces our belief that state governments 
will continue to be the most reliable watchdog for consumers 
in early 1988 campbell voluntarily halted the advertising 
campaign that focused on the theme soup is good food moran 
said the company resumed using the theme mm mm good which 
had not been used since the 60s he said 
in 1986 campbell spent more than 200 million on advertising 
moran said current figures were not available he said 
the company which produces 6 million cans of soup daily said 
that it chose not to fight the matter in court because of the 
peripheral nature of the dispute and of the drain on campbell 
resources that would result from pursuing the matter in each of the 
nine states 
were not accepting any guilt and theyre not giving any 
said moran this was a settlement that we could live with

the united states and soviet union formally 
pledged thursday to help each other fight pollution emergencies in 
northern waters like the oil tanker spill that fouled sections of 
alaskas coastline this spring 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and us 
secretary of state james a baker iii signed the agreement on the 
last day of bakers twoday visit to moscow it pledges superpower 
cooperation in combating spills of oil and other pollutants in the 
bering and chukchi seas between alaska and siberia 
the soviet news agency tass said the agreement provides for the 
development of a joint plan of drastic measures in the event of 
a spill each country is required to notify the other immediately 
of a pollution emergency and us and soviet officials will hold 
joint exercises on fighting ocean pollution tass said 
the signing of the agreement is a major step toward developing 
sovietamerican cooperation in dealing with the consequences of 
ecological disaster at sea oleg khalimonov an official in the 
soviet merchant marine ministry told tass 
the developed mechanism of interaction will allow specialists 
to define within hours the scope of an accident map out joint 
measures to overcome its consequences and get down immediately to 
their implementation khalimonov said earlier such procedures 
took days and sometimes whole weeks 
tass said the cooperation envisaged by the agreement began to 
function even before baker and shevardnadze signed the formal 
document a soviet ship designed to skim the surface of the sea was 
hired to help clean up the oil spilled by an exxon tanker off 
alaska in late march 
however exxon officials who were paying the soviets 15000 a 
day for the aid said tuesday the ship was being sent home because 
it was not designed to handle the hardened taffylike mass the oil 
spilled by the tanker has turned into

amway corp said today it would sell avon 
products incs prestige fragrance business if its attempt to buy 
avon for more than 2 billion succeeds 
the business includes higherpriced perfumes like giorgio 
beverly hills oscar de la renta cher valentino perry ellis and 
deneuve which are sold in stores instead of by avons 
persontoperson sales force 
avon said the business is expected to run up sales of more than 
300 million this year spokesman john cox said the company had no 
comment on amways stated plan which was in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission 
amway made its offer for avon on wednesday and urged its larger 
rival to stop its kneejerk defensive activities avon said it 
was not for sale although its board of directors would evaluate 
the offer 
analysts predicted a long battle complicated by the culture 
clash between amways patriotic peprally style and its larger 
rivals image as the home of the refined avon lady 
amway in partnership with minneapolis investor irwin jacobs 
owns 103 percent of avons outstanding common shares but jacobs 
is not participating in the purchase offer amway said 
avon rose 387 a share at 3987 in new york stock exchange 
consolidated trading above amways 39ashare offer the spread 
between the stock price and amways offer indicated speculators 
were betting a higher bid would emerge from amway or another suitor 
however there also was speculation that avon management would 
succeed in blocking the takeover or that amway would not be able 
to arrange financing for its offer 
analysts disagreed over whether a much higher bid for avon was 
justifiable while some valued the stock at up to 50 a share 
andrew shore of shearson lehman hutton inc valued avon at no more 
than about 41 a share based on its cash flow 
amways bid places a value of 21 billion on avon based on 
nearly 54 million outstanding avon common shares amway would also 
have to acquire 18 million preferred shares which could be 
converted into common in the event of a takeover adding about 700 
million to the price 
after careful consideration we have concluded that our 
respective businesses are complementary amways letter said 
amway reserved the right to lower its offering price if avon 
took further defensive actions it asked for a response to its 
offer from the board of directors by 5 pm edt on may 24 
amway assured avon sufficient financing would be available in 
the form of bank loans 
in a letter responding to amway released late wednesday avon 
repeated that it was not for sale but said the board will review 
your proposal in due course consistent with its fiduciary 
responsibilities 
avon spokesman john cox also said amways proposal was 
conditional and unfinanced 
avon sells cosmetics toiletries and household products and 
recorded worldwide sales of 306 billion last year most of its 
15 million sales representatives are women who sell parttime 
either doortodoor or to friends and coworkers 
amway is a private consumer products sales company in ada 
mich closely held by cofounders jay van andel and richard devos 
it has more than 1 million distributors and recorded retail sales 
of 18 billion in its last fiscal year in an effort to block a 
possible bid avon this week filed a federal suit against the 
partnership in us district court in manhattan on the grounds that 
amway and jacobs had not complied with federal securities laws 
ownership disclosure requirements 
avon also has asked a new york state court to rule on the legal 
validity of the companys shareholder rights stock plan known as a 
poison pill aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively 
expensive 
william nicholson amways chief operating officer said amway 
informed jacobs as a courtesy that it was making a bid 
jacobs was traveling wednesday and not reachable for comment a 
person in his office said

the tangled takeover battle between the two of 
the largest gold producers took another twist today as a federal 
judge declined to hold minorco sa in contempt of court for now 
south africancontrolled minorco largest gold producer in the 
noncommunist world has been trying to acquire rival britishbased 
consolidated gold fields plc since last fall 
gold fields and its us subsidiary newmont mining corp sued 
in new york to block the takeover and us district judge michael 
mukasey issued an injunction blocking minorco from acquiring more 
gold fields shares on antitrust grounds 
minorco incorporated in luxembourg already held almost 30 
percent of gold fields shares and has tenders for about 25 percent 
more although mukaseys injunction bars minorco from buying those 
shares 
gold fields owns 49 percent of newmont the largest us gold 
producer 
on tuesday britains panel on takeovers and mergers ordered 
gold fields to drop out of the american lawsuit leaving newmont as 
the only obstacle to the 59 billion takeover minorco said it 
would try to find a thirdparty bidder for newmont 
but newmont asked mukasey to hold minorco in contempt claiming 
minorcos maneuvering to try and find a buyer for newmont as a way 
of forcing the american concern out of the litigation violated 
mukaseys injunction 
mukasey however declined to find minorco in contempt for the 
time being 
in a twopage order issued early today mukasey said he would 
entertain another request to hold minorco in contempt of court if 
it attempted to alter gold fields interest in newmont so that it 
couldnt vote its shares which total 493 percent 
newmont expressed concerns at a hearing wednesday that if 
minorco could get a third party to acquire a large stake in the 
us concern they could effectively force it to drop the law suit 
blocking the takeover

to the poor and teenagers 
it also warned states that their programs will have to be 
improved to receive federal support 
for years the government has been distributing money to youth 
programs in a fragmented and piecemeal fashion and sometimes 
without clear expectations of what these youths should achieve 
labor secretary elizabeth dole told the senate subcommittee on 
employment and productivity 
mrs dole and three jtpa participants who attended the hearing 
were meeting with president bush this afternoon in a session 
designed to demonstrate the presidents support for the changes 
the amendments would significantly change the job training 
partnership act created by quayle then a republican senator from 
indiana and sen edward m kennedy mrs dole said the revisions 
were necessary because of the changing american workforce not 
because of any major flaws in the program 
but jtpa can be made even better she told the subcommittee 
which has jurisdiction over the act funds do not always reach 
the individuals and areas who need help the most in some 
communities it is felt that the program does not always result in 
good jobs and a higher standard of living 
the changes aim at ending a practice that has prompted criticism 
of jtpa and other training programs the creaming of applicants 
with some marketable skills in order to place them quickly in jobs 
with little future 
they also would also separate youthtraining efforts from the 
various adult programs in which they are now found and both the 
state and federal governments would be required to do a far better 
job coordinating training programs with education counseling and 
other services provided by federal state and local governments 
most of the changes were recommended by an advisory panel named 
by former labor secretary ann mclaughlin some also have been 
suggested by subcommittee members including the panels chairman 
sen paul simon dill 
simon told mrs dole he was sure that democrats and republicans 
could work out minor differences in their approaches to amending 
jtpa 
i think were going to get a good bill out of this committee 
that were all going to be able to agree on he said 
sen orrin hatch rutah called jtpa the singularly important 
work of this committee during the reagan years but said changing 
workforce demographics made revisions necessary 
mrs dole dedicated most of her testimony to how the changes 
would improve training for teenagers something she has said would 
be among her highest priorities as secretary 
she said all youths and half the adults seeking enrollment in 
jtpa programs would need to overcome illiteracy other basic skills 
deficiencies or a poor school record teen parents and the homeless 
also would be given preference 
and for the first time employers who accepted jtpa money to 
help pay for summer jobs for youths would be required to provide 
some form of approved education or training 
the changes mrs dole said are designed to address projected 
shortages in the labor force and the related skills gap 
exacerbating shortages for jobs in hightech and other industries 
department officials have said the amendments if approved 
likely would require a modest reduction in the number of people 
served by jtpa mrs dole made no reference to that in her prepared 
testimony 
the federal government allocated 24 billion for jtpa this year 
and bush has requested stable funding for next year jtpa programs 
are expected to serve 19 million people this year 
because most of the money is spent to support programs 
administered by state and local agencies the proposed changes 
include a number of guidelines those agencies would have to meet 
before being deemed eligible for jtpa funding 
at the state and local level the proposed changes would for the 
first time require individual assessments of prospective trainees 
and for those accepted into the programs an individually tailored 
program to meet the distinct education training and placement 
needs of each trainee 
removed would be guidelines that encouraged rapid job placement 
something jtpa critics have said leads to creaming and 
placement of trainees in lowskill jobs with few career 
possibilities 
instead program administrators would be encouraged to offer 
more thorough training with their efforts monitored through a 
followup survey to determine a trainees progress in the job 
market

house democrats are rejecting as blue smoke 
and mirrors president bushs proposed solution to the savings and 
loan crisis a move the administration contends may thwart an 
agreement not to raise taxes next year 
in the biggest challenge yet to bushs campaign promise to 
reduce the federal deficit without new taxes the house ways and 
means committee voted 2511 wednesday to dump the 50 billion sampl 
bailout costs on the governments budgets for fiscal 1989 1990 and 
1991 
the amounts would not count against the grammrudman laws 
deficit limits according to the plan which democrats contend 
would cost taxpayers 45 billion less than bushs proposal over 
the next 30 years 
an angry treasury secretary nicholas brady called the vote a 
mistake and said it could lead to months of stalemate 
if adopted this action could force us to go back to square 
one on both the budget and the savings and loan plan he said 
this is not the way either to lower interest rates or solve the 
savings and loan crisis 
two republicans reps willis gradison of ohio and raymond 
mcgrath of new york joined all 26 democrats in rejecting bushs 
offbudget financing scheme 
the ways and means alternative would swell this years budget 
deficit by 9 billion or 10 billion and next years by between 22 
billion and 25 billion 
all the money would go toward closing or merging some 350 
insolvent thrift institutions that have lost an estimated 100 
billion in federally insured deposits through poor and often 
fraudulent lending practices 
this is the first step in ending the period of ronald reagans 
blue smoke and mirrors said the committees chairman rep dan 
rostenkowski dill 
prior to wednesdays vote brady met for an hour with committee 
members behind closed doors repeating a threat to recommend that 
bush veto any sampl plan that without a tax increase or spending 
cuts elsewhere would raise the deficit 
senate democrats bowed to a similar threat last month rejecting 
an alternative proposed by its banking committee chairman sen 
donald riegle dmich to put the entire bailouts cost on this 
years budget 
the ways and means committee meets again on may 18 to affirm its 
vote formally before the bill goes to the full house on the 
following week but rostenkowski said he hopes his panel will not 
reopen the issue 
rep charles schumer dny an early proponent of including 
the sampl bailouts costs in the budget said the committees action 
wednesday has breathed new life into a onceabandoned effort to 
force bushs hand 
the democratic caucus is pretty much on board now that ways 
and means has said it wants this on the budget schumer said i 
think the odds are 70 percent to 80 percent that well win on the 
house floor 
both the administrations plan and the alternative separate the 
cost of cleaning up the sampl mess from the grammrudman law which 
requires a reduction in the federal deficit to less than 100 
billion for the next fiscal year beginning in october 
bushs proposal gets around the requirement by borrowing the 50 
billion through a new offbudget government corporation and 
including only the 35 billion in interest costs as part of 
federal budget for the next three years 
the ways and means measure allows the budget deficit to swell a 
total of 50 billion over that time but exempts it from the 
official grammrudman target deficits of 136 billion this year 
100 billion in 1990 and 64 billion in 1991 
everybody knows that its already breached said rep ed 
jenkins dga referring to the 163 billion deficit anticipated 
this year and assumptions that interest rates will fall to 55 
percent so that the 1990 target can be met 
while bushs plan prevented the cost of solving the sampl crisis 
from showing up on the budget it also swelled the overall costs to 
taxpayers because higher interest rates would have to be paid on 
the borrowed 50 billion 
the congressional budget office estimates the savings in lower 
interest rates from what the ways and means committee did at 671 
million over the first five years 15 billion by the year 2000 
and 45 billion over 30 years

savings and loan customers withdrew 85 
billion from their accounts in march the government said today in 
a report that showed only slight improvement from the record pace 
set in the first two months of the year 
the federal home loan bank board said net withdrawals for the 
first three months of 1989 totaled 285 billion more than triple 
the 84 billion in withdrawals for all of last year withdrawals 
totaled 92 billion in february and a record 108 billion in 
january 
james barth chief economist of the bank board attributed the 
bulk of the outflow to the failure of sampls to keep pace with rising 
interest rates offered by competitors such as mutual funds 
apart from a few isolated instances there is no evidence that 
the outflows reflect a loss of depositor confidence he said 
march marks the 11th consecutive month of net withdrawals and 
the fifth straight month of withdrawals in excess of 7 billion 
earlier from october 1987 through may 1988 money flowed into sampls 
as stock market investors sought the safety of federally insured 
accounts 
administration officials have been citing the withdrawals as 
evidence that congress should move swiftly to enact president 
bushs bailout plan to close and merge failed sampls 
however the plan is in danger of becoming bogged down in a 
dispute between the administration and congressional democrats over 
whether the bailout spending should be counted as part of the 
budget deficit

the bush administration sent legislation to 
congress today calling for a 500 million federal oil cleanup fund 
to be financed by a fee on domestic and imported oil 
officials said the government now has little money earmarked for 
such an emergency 
transportation secretary samuel skinner outlined the 
administrations proposal for a comprehensive oil spill liability 
and compensation law saying that in light of the alaska spill it 
is imperative to move quickly to establish a federal response 
fund 
rep bill tauzin dla chairman of the house subcommittee on 
coast guard and navigation promised that a bill for such a fund 
would be scheduled for a vote by the panel later this month 
skinners proposal prompted some subcommittee members to note 
that congress has debated but failed to enact such a contingency 
fund for the past 15 years 
it took a tragedy like the exxon valdez to cause the entire 
congress to focus on the issue said rep walter jones dokla 
who is the sponsor of a bill already under consideration to 
establish a fund similar to the one proposed by the administration 
skinner said that while the cost of the oil spill in alaskas 
prince william sound on march 24 has yet to be determined it could 
exceed the maximum of 500 million envisoned for the proposed 
cleanup fund 
under the legislation proposed by the administration an oil 
company or shipper would be liable to up to 78 million in cleanup 
damage and recovery costs costs in excess of that would be covered 
by the federal fund which would be collected over the next five 
years from a 13 centabarrel fee on domestic and imported 
petroleum 
when the exxon tanker spilled 11 million gallons of oil in 
alaska the worst spill in us history a federal oil spill 
contingency fund had only 4 million in it skinner told the 
congressmen that had the spill been caused by someone with less 
resources than the exxon corp the government would have been left 
scrambling for money and asking congress for special appropriations 
whatever the price officials said a day earlier they doubt 
exxon can clean the oil from hundreds of miles of rocky alaska 
coastline by next september as the oil company has said it hopes to 
do 
exxon announced wednesday that it plans to sharply increase the 
number of workers assigned to coastal cleanup duties and deploy 
more barges and boats to the effort the decision to increase 
manpower came after bush administration officials said exxons 
earlier summer cleanup plans were inadequate 
but adm paul a yost the us coast guard commandant told a 
senate hearing that despite the increased manpower he considers it 
almost impossible for exxon to clean all the oil from more than 
300 miles of shoreline by the sept 15 target date 
skinner told reporters wednesday that while exxon plans to 
complete the cleanup this summer he considers it a massive 
massive effort and a big challenge that might not be 
possible 
skinner said the bush administration will closely monitor the 
effort and direct exxon back to work next spring if the cleanup 
does not meet expectations 
nevertheless william d stevens president of exxon usa told 
openly skeptical senators the company fully expects to clean up 
the beaches by september after which poor weather would likely 
make efforts impossible 
confronted by figures showing that only 17 miles of the 300 
miles of shoreline have been cleaned so far stevens said work 
started slowly because the company tackled the worst beaches first 
he promised that even if the september deadline is met exxon will 
return in the spring to ensure the work is done 
the company announced plans to increase the number of cleanup 
workers from 3400 to 5000 this summer after being told by skinner 
and presidential chief of staff john sununu at a white house 
meeting monday that earlier cleanup plans were inadequate 
exxon also said it would increase the number of barges and boats 
used in the cleanup bringing the total to 70 vessels 
the coast guards yost however expressed doubt in testimony 
before the senate commerce committee that the cleanup will be 
anything short of a long arduous task he described how his hands 
dripped with oil after he reached underneath the gravel on a beach 
that 200 workers had been cleaning for 10 consecutive days 
increasing the number of cleanup workers will not keep the oil 
from washing back onto the beaches yost told the senators

the house today approved raising the hourly 
minimum wage from 335 to 455 by 1991 bringing congress just 
one step from its first domestic policy showdown with president 
bush who has promised to veto the measure 
the 247172 vote followed brief debate democrats accused bush 
of turning his back on the working poor while republicans said 
democrats were passing up an opportunity to raise the minimum wage 
by accepting the presidents offer of a more modest increase 
what we consider today is a matter of elemental fairness 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said in a floor speech 
supporting the 455 target contained in the legislation drafted by 
a housesenate conference committee it goes to the heart of what 
our country is all about 
but rep fred grandy riowa said democrats did not have the 
twothirds majority vote to override bushs expected veto and were 
surrendering their chance for some increase in the minimum wage to 
fight a political battle with the white house 
the people who are hurt are the people who could be making 
425 an hour said grandy referring to the final minimumwage 
target in bushs proposal 
a senate vote could come as early as next week both sides in 
the debate so sure bush will veto the legislation already are 
hard at work drafting postveto battle plans 
if he vetoes it then he has declared the end of the 
honeymoon said rep austin murphy dpa i regret to say 
that but if that is the case i think there will be no holding it 
back 
the it to which murphy referred is a flood of 
democraticsponsored bills dealing with such issues as parental 
leave child care mandatory health insurance and others 
a veto would tell other members there is no reason to say the 
president is trying to get along said murphy that would 
undoubtably cause the sponsors of those bills to demand that they 
advance 
after senate passage the democratic congressional leadership 
plans a mock signing session at which it will try to bring pressure 
on the president 
nevertheless bush repeatedly has promised that the legislation 
awaits the first veto of his presidency 
those urging the president to hold fast to that promise also are 
quick to bring up the lengthy democratic domestic agenda 
the labor agenda is the term used by chamber of commerce 
lobbyist frederick j krebs 
this has taken on such symbolism krebs said in a telephone 
interview on legislative issues things work much like they do 
in an athletic contest you want momentum the implications of the 
minimum wage carry over to the entire labor agenda and also in a 
broader context for the bush administration because they think they 
can win this one and they need a few wins 
both sides view the house and senate votes as perfunctory only 
gaining importance if democrats can substantially cut into the 
strength bush now has to sustain a veto that however appears 
unlikely leading to the intensified postveto planning 
bush is being urged to take the initiative in that fight by 
venturing out of washington for a veto ceremony in the south or 
west in a community where the administration can make its case 
that too large an increase in the minimum wage will result in major 
job losses 
business and labor are planning media campaigns through letters 
and columns submitted to newspapers and appearances on local 
television news programs in communities represented by lawmakers 
considered to be potential swing votes in an attempted veto 
override 
the aflcio which conducted a nationwide conference call 
tuesday to plot strategy also is working on a radio advertising 
campaign in hopes of bringing pressure on lawmakers who now side 
with bush on the expected override vote 
proponents of the bill also are trying to draft another minimum 
wage bill for quick consideration should they lose the veto fight 
which appears likely 
murphy said such a measure could take a number of forms ranging 
from a oneyear increase during which congress and the white house 
could seek a longterm compromise to a three or fouryear 
incremental plan not unlike the current bill 
that decision would depend largely on the language in any bush 
veto message 
if he tells us in that message that he wants to work it out 
and makes a suggestion im sure we will try to work from that 
murphy said if not then it becomes a partisan battle and well 
go it alone 
without the votes to override a veto sponsors of the current 
bill are asked increasingly whether they would eventually accept 
bushs proposal if he alternative was a ninth consecutive year with 
the hourly minimum wage frozen at 335 
murphy said the choice would be the latter if bush refused to 
soften his demand for a provision allowing newly hired employees to 
be paid a subminimum wage for six months 
if thats the case theres no point in having a bill murphy 
said the proponents will stick to their guns

developing a network of magneticlevitation 
trains to replace shorthaul aircraft could save the airlines money 
and reduce airport congestion some researchers say 
standing in the way of development of the maglev system is 
money and a lack of enthusiasm 
the market for maglev trains is not well defined said 
larry r johnson an economist and director of the argonne national 
laboratorys center for transportation research who conducted a 
yearlong study with five colleagues there is not a constituency 
that would push the idea 
in a report soon to be made public researchers at the argonne 
laboratory outside chicago say the costs of building a 2000mile 
network of 300 mph magneticlevitation trains would be largely 
offset by multibilliondollar savings from reducing airline delays 
energy costs and airplane acquisition 
a maglev network could open gate slots at major us airports to 
longer domestic and international flights eliminating the need to 
build many new airports the researchers said 
magnetic levitation uses powerful magnets to lift a train above 
a guideway and propel it at high speeds on a cushion of air 
although the technology exists there are no maglev trains 
operating anywhere in the world skeptics suggest that a working 
shortline demonstration model be built first to prove the 
feasibility of maglevs 
another obstacle is the highspeed conventional electric train 
now in use in france and japan and under development in germany 
sudhir kumar a professor of engineering and ground 
transportation at the illinois institute of technology said 
johnson is right about the need to reduce air traffic congestion 
but he said a maglev system would be too expensive 
it would be cheaper than building another airport he said 
but even less expensive would be highspeed trains which 
travel at speeds up to 200 mph 
johnson said at speeds of 300 mph and distances up to 600 miles 
maglevs could compete economically with aircraft 
he said a maglev system linking chicagos ohare international 
airport with cities such as detroit st louis indianapolis 
milwaukee and minneapolis could significantly reduce congestion at 
the worlds busiest airport 
if you want to expand longerrange domestic and international 
service at ohare maglev certainly is a way of doing it he said 
this week 
johnson said more than half the flights arriving or departing 
daily at ohare or about 1100 of a total of 2000 flights 
cover distances of less than 500 miles 
the argonne report estimates that delays and overcrowding at 
airports cost airlines 5 billion a year and that it would cost 2 
billion to 3 billion to build each of the 15 to 20 us airports 
that experts say are needed to expand the airtransport system into 
the next century 
the maglev system could be built at a cost of 15 million a 
mile and the cost of the individual vehicles is estimated at 25 
million to 5 million each johnson said 
maglevs could be operated on elevated structures built along 
existing interstate highways to link airports to cities in the 
region johnson said for example connecting burlington vt to 
new york city or phoenix to los angeles 
but kumar said trains that dont use magnetic levitation such as 
frances tgv or germanys ice offer advantages of cost 
compatibility with existing track and the capability of hauling 
freight 
highspeed trains are a proven technology maglevs are not 
he said adding that a short line should be constructed to probe 
maglevs feasibility 
a japanese firm has proposed constructing a 20mile maglev line 
between the airport at orlando fla and disney world the idea is 
being considered by florida officials

businesses with products and services ranging from robot cashiers 
to toxicwaste neutralizers 
a california company for example is working on a system that 
would prevent waste through recycling another is trying to perfect 
chemicalfree purified water from industrial sewage 
others see riches in warehouselike stores of the future that 
eliminate the middleman or take customer orders via sophisticated 
computers 
hitting it right usually requires a combination of foresight 
and luck said dennis sughrue a researcher at needham

speculative investments 
the foresightluck mix was electronics in the 60s and computers 
in the 70s people who foresaw that a company hatched in someones 
garage would grow into todays apple computer inc for example 
would have multiplied their investment many times over 
but investing in highrisk businesses is not for the timid like 
the professional poker plays say dont bet what you cant afford 
to lose 
for every apple there are probably 30 to 40 other 
companies you could lose money on said barry r feirstein

difficult for an individual investor to get in the ground floor 
of something unless its an industry he knows 
even mrs raney who profited enormously by beating the crowd on

professional venture capitalists arent flocking to any

within each industry theres a narrowly focused niche and if 
you hit it right you can make it big said sughrue 
finding that niche is the hard part we look at probably 500

strong demand in the absence of central bank 
intervention drove the us dollar higher against the major 
currencies in european trading on thursday 
gold prices also rose after dipping in asia 
dealers said the news that us retail sales in april rose by a 
lower than expected 04 percent failed to shake confidence in the 
american currency 
one london dealer said the days performance confirmed the 
underlying demand for dollars and the markets reluctance to sell 
them 
the central banks again made no effort at a concerted 
intervention to bring the dollars exchange rate down by selling 
dollars although dealers said they can be expected to enter the 
market if the dollar rises much above 192 west german marks 
the dealers said the absence of intervention suggests that the 
central banks tacitly acknowledged their sales of dollars had been 
unable to bring the exchange rate down

sears roebuck and co hopes to announce in june 
where its 6000employee merchandising group will be moved but is 
nowhere near a decision now chairman edward a brennan said 
thursday 
all i can say is that were looking very hard at all of the 
alternatives brennan told reporters following the companys 
annual meeting the truth is that we really dont have all of the 
costs laid out 
separately sears announced that wayne e hedien 55 had been 
named chairman and chief executive of its allstate insurance group 
the appointment takes effect on july 1 on the retirement of 
richard j haayen hedien has been president of allstate since 
october 1986 raymond h kiefer 62 succeeds him in that job 
brennan said officials including illinois gov james r thompson 
and chicago mayor richard m daley were working to hard to keep the 
sears subsidiary in illinois 
he would not discuss what incentives were offered or compare 
them to those offered by other states 
he declined to comment on reports that the company is looking at 
sites in dallas and charlotte nc but did say sears will not 
move the merchandise group to northern indiana 
brennans news conference followed the companys first annual 
meeting since it announced last october that it would sell the 
sears tower the worlds tallest building offer more brandname 
products and shift to everyday low prices 
in 1988 a year of transition sears demonstrated that it is a 
very strong company he said for the first time we exceeded 
50 billion in revenues an increase of 95 percent 
we also recorded the second most profitable year in our 
history 145 billion yet we should do better and i have every 
confidence that we will brennan said 
brennan said company officials would like to keep most major 
operations headquartered in the chicago area for emotional 
reasons but he said sears would need at least 1 million square 
feet to house the merchandise group space that would be greater 
than most of the parcels it owns in the chicago area 
brennan also reported that sears expects 15 billion in 
revenues this year from specialty stores western auto eyecare 
centers of america tire america ntw and pinstripes petites 
each of these companies acquired in the last year has a 
winning formula for success he said

amway corp plans to spin off avon products 
incs retail operation comprising the popular giorgio perfume and 
other fragrances if its 2 billion takeover bid for avon succeeds 
amway said thursday 
the company disclosed in a document submitted to the securities 
and exchange commission that it would retain avons worldwide 
direct selling division if acquires its much larger rival 
put up for sale would be the business responsible for fragrances 
avon owns that are sold by department stores and other retailers 
but not by the independent sales representatives who offer avons 
makeup toiletries and jewelry 
amway also said it would continue avons strategy of selling its 
interests in the health care services field 
the retail operation includes higherpriced prestige 
perfumes such as giorgio beverly hills red and uninhibited by 
cher avon expects to more than 300 million in retail division 
sales this year 
most of avons sales which totaled 306 billion in 1988 are 
made through an international sales force of about 15 million 
representatives 
william nicholson amways chief operating officer said in a 
telephone interview that several parties have expressed interest in 
buying the avon retail division he declined to identify them 
several consumer products companies have stated their intentions 
to expand and a wellestablished successful prestige perfume line 
might be a lucrative addition 
nicholson said amway finds avon an attractive takeover prospect 
partly because ownerhip of avon would open the door to markets 
amway has been trying to enter 
avon is well established in some international markets thatd 
wed love to get into he said naming mexico and brazil as 
examples 
latin american countries have sufficient incomes to support 
significant growth in their direct sales markets so far amway is 
operating only in guatemala and panama he said 
amway also was motivated to pursue avon by the opportunity to 
turn avons sales representatives into distributors of a wider 
array of products 
amway a privately held company based in ada mich has about 1 
million distributors around the world selling amway household 
personal care and environmental products amway distributors also 
sell tandy computer gear mci communications services office 
coffee making equipment and other brand name products 
nicholson said avon has failed so far to capitalize on its 
cosmetics business and broaden it into a full health and beauty 
aids operation amways cosmetic interests represent only a small 
portion of the companys operations so an acquisition of avon would 
cause little duplication 
amways 39ashare takeover proposal places a value of about 
21 billion on the company based on nearly 54 million outstanding 
avon common shares amway also would have to acquire 18 million 
preferred shares which could be converted into common in the event 
of a takeover adding about 700 million to the price 
speculators on wall street have indicated they believe that a 
higher bid may be forthcoming 
avon shares closed at 3950 off 37 cents in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading thursday after gaining 387 on 
wednesday 
avon chairman james preston has said repeatedly the company is 
not for sale but has said avons board would give amways offer 
consideration 
to bolster its defense against amway avon has sued amway and 
its investment partner irwin jacobs the partnership has said they 
own about 103 percent of avon common stock 
jacobs a minneapolis investor is not involved in amways 
takeover offer but in its sec filing amway said jacobs may 
explore the possibility of purchasing some of avons assets if 
the takeover succeeds but no agreement arrangement or 
understanding has been reached 
avon spokesman john cox said the company had no comment on 
information in amways filing 
nicholson said amway is awaiting a response from avon 
we believe that the board will invite us in for discussion and 
were waiting for that invitation nicholson said

the house voted thursday to raise the minimum 
wage to 455 an hour by october 1991 leaving only a final senate 
vote before the bill goes to president bush who has promised to 
veto it 
in the first major domestic policy dispute of the bush 
administration neither house of congress has backed down despite 
bushs insistence that the minimum should be raised only to 425 
by january 1992 and then only if the proposal allows employers to 
pay a lower training wage to new workers for six months 
the minimum is now 335 where it has been since 1981 
the only congressional action still required is a senate vote on 
the bill drafted by housesenate negotiators and that could come 
as early as next week 
there is virtually no doubt that bush will follow through on his 
promise to veto the measure and the 247172 house vote for passage 
suggested the democrats remain short of the twothirds majority it 
would need to override the president 
the house insisted on sending president bush a bill that would 
cost hundreds of thousands of americans their opportunity to work 
a bill he most certainly will veto labor secretary elizabeth 
dole said shortly after the house vote 
still democratic leaders in both chambers have promised to 
attempt an override 
in the meantime democrats hope to bring public pressure on the 
white house by characterizing bushs position as unfair to the 
working poor and by juxtaposing his veto threat with his plan to 
spend billions of dollars to rescue troubled savings and loans and 
his proposal to lower capital gains tax rates 
the wealthiest of the wealthy would get tax breaks big enough 
to hire two minimum wage workers each to take care of their gardens 
or do their laundry said rep william d ford dmich is this 
the bush full employment program 
speaker jim wright said the meager increase included in the 
legislation still would leave the minimum wage trailing inflation 
increases since the wage floor last was raised 
today we seek to provide fairness for the working poor of this 
country wright said there are at least 4 million of them who 
receive no more than the minimum wage 
republicans however said democrats were passing up an 
opportunity to increase the minimum wage by accepting bushs more 
modest offer and instead had decided on waging a political battle 
with the white house for control of the domesticpolicy agenda 
the republicans also reiterated their contention that raising 
the minimum wage without also establishing a sixmonth subminimum 
for newly hired workers would trigger massive job losses 
the bottom line is it will cost at least 650000 new jobs in 
three years the very people that we want to bring into the 
workforce to help them become productive members of society rep 
steve bartlett rtexas said of the bill passed thursday there 
can be no further compromise that throws people out of work 
president bush has offered the compromise 
bush had proposed raising the minumum wage to 425 an hour by 
january 1992 provided employers could pay new hires the training 
wage for six months 
in rejecting that offer democratic leaders said bushs proposed 
increase was too small and also assailed his training wage 
because the provision requires no actual training in their final 
bill democrats allowed workers with less than 60 days of work 
experience to be paid a subminimum 
in the senate much like the house sponsors have more than 
enough votes to gain passage of the measure but seem short of the 
twothirds majority needed to override a veto 
if he vetoes it then he has declared the end of the 
honeymoon said rep austin murphy dpa 
the result of a veto murphy said will be action on a lengthy 
list of democratsponsored bills dealing with such issues as 
parental leave child care and mandatory health insurance 
a veto would tell other members there is no reason to say the 
president is trying to get along said murphy that would 
undoubtedly cause the sponsors of those bills to demand that they 
advance 
but administration aides have said one of the reasons bush will 
veto the minimumwage bill is to assert his position on domestic 
policy to prevent the democrats agenda from gaining momentum 
business and labor groups plan media campaigns and other 
lobbying efforts to pressure lawmakers considered to be potential 
swing votes in an attempted veto override 
proponents of the bill also are trying to draft another minimum 
wage bill for quick consideration should they lose the veto fight 
which appears likely

gold prices rose partly in response to the tension in panama 
foreignexchange dealers said demand for dollars appeared 
unaffected by a commerce department report that retail sales rose 
by only 04 percent in april economists said the weak sales figure 
showed the extent to which higher interest rates and inflation are 
discouraging consumer spending

panama frequently during times of political unrest or other 
uncertainty investors buy gold as a safe haven for their money 
bush said he was sending 2000 combat troops to panama and

a federal judge declined to hold minorco sa in 
contempt of court thursday giving the south africalinked gold 
producer a victory in its tangled takeover battle for consolidated 
gold fields plc 
however us district judge michael b mukasey said he might 
reconsider his decision if minorco tries to prevent gold fields 
from voting its shares in an american mining concern 
last fall minorco which is largely controlled by two south 
african corporations anglo american corp of south africa and de 
beers consolidated mines ltd launched a hostile takeover bid for 
gold fields minorco a luxembourg corporation already held almost 
30 percent of gold fields shares 
britishbased gold fields and its us subsidiary newmont 
mining corp the largest gold producer in the united states sued 
in new york to block the takeover by minorco 
last october mukasey issued an injunction barring minorco from 
acquiring more gold fields shares on antitrust grounds he noted 
that the combined entities would control nearly a third of the 
noncommunist worlds gold market 
minorco now owns or has tenders for about 55 percent of gold 
fields shares but mukaseys injunction bars minorco from buying 
those shares it doesnt own 
gold fields owns 493 percent of newmont 
on tuesday britains panel on takeovers and mergers ordered 
gold fields to drop out of the american lawsuit leaving newmont as 
the only obstacle to the 59 billion takeover 
but unless minorco can get newmont to withdraw its lawsuit the 
bid for gold fields will expire next wednesday under british 
regulations 
minorco which previously promised to divest itself of newmont 
if allowed to complete the takeover has been trying to find a 
bidder for the shares of newmont not owned by gold fields 
newmont expressed concerns at a hearing wednesday that if 
minorco could get an ally to buy 51 percent of newmonts stock 
minorco could break the effective control over newmont that gold 
fields now has with its 49 percent stake then minorco could 
effectively force newmont to drop the lawsuit blocking the takeover 
newmont asked mukasey to hold minorco in contempt claiming 
minorcos maneuvering to try and find a buyer for newmont violated 
mukaseys injunction 
mukasey however declined to find minorco in contempt for now 
in a twopage order issued early thursday mukasey said he would 
entertain another request to hold minorco in contempt if it took 
any steps that altered gold fields effective control over newmont 
mukasey gave newmont until monday to reply in writing to 
minorcos latest request to dissolve the injunction minorco will 
make its counter reply on tuesday and has until wednesday to 
complete the bid for gold fields or let it lapse

some of the concern may be unfounded in terms of endangering the 
supply of oil although alaskan crude moves through a pipeline in 
panama en route to the gulf coast analysts noted that the volume 
of oil carried is not significant 
gains in gasoline prices were particularly strong traders said 
prices that were knocked down in previous sessions presented 
investors with an incentive to buy

the government said in federal court thursday 
several former top executives of goodyear international corp were 
involved in a scheme to pay bribes to iraqi officials to get tire 
business 
the akron ohio company paid a 250000 fine after pleading 
guilty to a single count of violating the antibribery provision of 
the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the firm is a subsidiary 
of goodyear tire amp rubber co 
from the fall of 1979 to the fall of 1983 goodyear 
international obtained 19 million in iraqi government orders for 
truck tires based on an agreement to pay nearly 1 million in 
bribes according to documents released in court 
the activities were carried out by david j janasik then the 
companys regional export manager for the middle east also 
involved were senior goodyear officials including the exdirector 
of export operations and the former executive vice president the 
documents said 
janasik and mohammed jassem an official of the iraqi 
stateowned trading organization discussed goodyears interest in 
getting a share of the tire business during a meeting in the 
storage room of a baghdad company the papers said 
jassem told janasik that goodyears competitors in france korea 
and japan had been willing to pay cash commissions to ensure a 
good relationship with the purchasing organization iraqi trading 
co 
jassem also said that absent such payments goodyear could hope 
for only limited business according to a government statement of 
facts released in court 
janasik told jassem that such payments were against goodyear 
corporate policy janasik related the meeting in a telephone call 
to his superior then gics assistant director for export 
operations at his office in akron ohio the statement of facts 
continued 
janasiks superior discussed the conversation with his superior 
goodyear internationals regional director for europe and with a 
company vice president 
regarding janasiks contact in iraq the vice president told 
the assistant export director to get the business i dont want to 
know how according to the statement of facts the assistant 
export director telephoned janasik and urged him to increase his 
sales by using his contacts to get business with iraq 
when janasik reminded his superior of the conditions for 
obtaining such business the supervisor repeated his instruction 
that janasik was to obtain new business with the government of 
iraq the statement said 
a goodyear spokesman in akron ohio walter mcclenny declined 
to comment when asked whether the other officials referred to in 
the governments statement had left the firm or were transferred to 
other positions 
we dont want to name the people named in those allegations 
mcclenny said in an interview he said the company is not in a 
position to comment on the governments statement 
goodyear generated the bribe money by arranging with a greek 
marketing company to perform superficial marketing studies not 
worth the 430000 that goodyear paid goodyear generated an 
additional 551124 to pay the iraqi officials through fictitious 
invoices purporting to reflect arab language advertisements of 
goodyear products in baghdad newspapers 
the payments went to ayub al shakiri an iraqi who said he was 
acting on behalf of several officials of the iraqi trading co the 
iraqi government purchased almost all of its tires for sale through 
itc 
janasik pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in which he 
failed to declare a 75000 kickback he received from the iraqi 
intermediary for his services he was fired by goodyear sentenced 
to two years probation and fined 10000 
goodyear said in a statement it uncovered the wrongdoing after 
initiating its own investigation into the case and that it alerted 
the justice department and turned company findings over to the 
government in 1985

opec secretary general subroto on thursday 
repeated the cartels call for stability in world energy markets 
while acknowledging that those markets were inherently unstable 
subroto told a luncheon audience of about 1600 that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries was determined that 
recent oil market turmoil never be repeated 
one need only look back three years to witness the collapse of 
prices in the international oil market which brought in its wake 
chaos in the energy industry subroto said 
the 13nation cartel agreed last november to limit its 
production to levels that would support a benchmark price of 18 a 
barrel about 185 million barrels a day the action has helped 
crude prices recover from their october 1988 lows of near 12 a 
barrel 
opec plans to review its production at a meeting scheduled to 
begin june 5 in vienna austria there has been speculation the 
cartel would increase its selfimposed production limits if demand 
was strong enough to support higher output without depressing 
prices 
subroto pointed to several inherent oil market factors that 
cause instability including the different levels of oil reserves 
in opec member countries and the varying views leaders of those 
countries have on longterm pricing 
he also pointed to regionalization of the world oil market 
because of the dispersal of these regional markets our member 
countries crudes are either longhaul or shorthaul which implies 
certain market disadvantages based on the relative costs of moving 
them to the market 
subroto also said situations where member nations are 
dissatisfied with their assigned quotas and unilaterally increased 
production were destabilizing 
declaring there was no need for concern by us consumers about 
the security of opecsupplied oil subroto also said he expected 
security of demand 
in return for opecs commitment to security of supply 
therefore our organization is entitled to expect from consumers 
policies which promote an orderly transition from finite oil 
reserves to other energy resources policies which do not seek at 
any cost to throttle oil demand he said 
the real need is for total cooperation in defense of market 
stability and not in defiance of market forces he said 
later at a news conference subroto said the cartels history of 
instability was behind it 
opec now is a different opec subroto said the 
composition of oil ministers is differentmore technocratic more 
businesslike

the bush administration on thursday proposed a 
500 million oil spill cleanup fund to be financed by the oil 
industry even as transportation secretary samuel skinner suggested 
the cost of the alaska spill could exceed that amount 
congress has been debating creation of such a fund for 15 years 
but supporters said the effort received little attention until the 
tanker exxon valdez ran aground in march dumping 11 million 
gallons of oil into the pristine waters off alaska 
skinner outlined the administrations proposal at a 
congressional hearing during which he noted that the federal 
government at the time of the alaska spill had only a few million 
dollars available specifically for cleanup efforts 
had that spill been caused by a company less welltodo than the 
exxon corp the government would have had to scramble for funds 
and ask congress for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup 
effort going skinner told the house subcommittee on coast guard 
and navigation 
estimates of the cost of the exxon spill the worst in us 
history have ranged widely from about 100 million to many times 
that amount 
skinner said it was too early to predict the total cost but 
said the amount would be substantial he said exxon expects to pay 
as much as 75000 an hour to workers cleaning the oilfouled 
alaska shore in the coming months 
the number are very big he continued indicating at one 
point that even the proposed 500 million cleanup fund would have 
been inadequate he suggested that something in the range of 500 
million to 1 billion should cover it 
the administration proposal which is expected to be combined 
with a similar bill already introduced in the house calls for the 
petroleum industry to finance the cleanup fund through a 
13centabarrel fee on each barrel of domestic or imported oil 
over the next five years 
a maximum of 500 million could be spent in cleaning up any 
single spill but the president would have the authority to exceed 
that amount in some cases said skinner the government would then 
seek additional fees from the industry he said 
at the same time the administration proposed making the oil 
company or shipper involved in a spill liable for up to 78 million 
in recovery and cleanup costs before the federal fund would be 
tapped the maximum civil fines also would be increased to 10 
million 
skinner said in light of the exxon accident there is a need for 
quick congressional action on establishing a comprehensive federal 
liability and compensation system for oil pollution damage 
members of the house subcommittee noted that legislation calling 
for such a cleanup fund has been introduced repeatedly in congress 
since 1975 
it took a tragedy like the exxon valdez to cause the entire 
congress to focus on the issue said rep walter jones dnc 
chairman of the merchant marine and fisheries committee 
rep bill tauzin dla chairman of the coast guard and 
navigation subcommittee said he plans to schedule a vote on the 
cleanup fund legislation before the end of the month 
the fund could be used to pay for cleanup costs damage to 
natural resources damage to private property and economic losses 
directly related to a spill 
but several members of the panel suggested that some of the 
money in the fund should also be earmarked for coast guard efforts 
the coast guards emergency response teams have been largely 
dismantled from 14 strike teams envisioned in the late 1970s to 
only two in operation today said rep gerry studds dmass 
adm paul yost the coast guard commandant said that in recent 
years budget cuts have forced the coast guard to eliminate most of 
its emergency response strike teams and cut back on research and 
development programs involving oil spill damage control

legislation giving the secretary of 
transportation the power to block buyouts of airlines if a 
transaction would imperil flying safety was introduced thursday by 
rep bob carr of michigan 
carrs bill would bar any acquisition that would give the 
airline an even ratio of debt to equity unless the transportation 
department after a full review found the airline could function 
properly after the takeover and that the transaction wouldnt harm 
the public interest 
the east lansing mich democrat said his bill was prompted by 
the recent offer for northwest airlines by billionaire oilman 
marvin davis 
this is not an effort to shield inept management from market 
forces carr said the legislation was intended rather to shield 
the public from highstakes billionaires who would play 
monopoly with the nations air transportation system he said 
the transportation department in ruling whether a takeover 
could proceed would under carrs bill be required to consider the 
financial fitness of the new owner the likelihood that the 
purchaser would comply with federal aviation laws and the 
managerial competence of the purchaser 
if passed the legislation would be retroactive to the beginning 
of this year carr said he knew of no transactions so far concluded 
that would be affected by the bill 
the us airline industry has been largely free from federal 
regulation since 1978 although a takeover must comply with federal 
antitrust laws 
carr argued that safety considerations mean corporate takeovers 
of airlines deserve special treatment 
davis has offered 27 billion or 90 a share to buy 
northwests parent nwa inc northwest based in eagan minn is 
the nations fourthlargest airline 
corporate takeovers are often financed by the issuance of 
highyield junk bonds paid off through the sale of corporate 
assets or stringent costcutting carr argued that reduced 
maintenance was one area where a debtridden airline could cut 
expenditures thereby imperiling the safety of the flying public

a genericdrug company executive thursday 
accused the food and drug administration of holding up approvals of 
its products to retaliate against the firm for having sparked an 
investigation into alleged bribery at the agency 
roy mcknight chairman of mylan laboratories in pittsburgh told 
a house subcommittee the company has met all the regulatory 
requirements for approval to make a number of drugs at its new 
puerto rico plant drugs for which mylan has approval to make at 
other plants 
we believe that the generic drug division is holding up 
approvals because they believe mylan started this investigation and 
that this was one way to retaliate mcknight told the panel 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee said he will inform fda 
commissioner frank young personally that any retaliation by any 
fda employee against the firms or individuals who testify before us 
will not be tolerated 
dingell also said he will ask young to explain the steps he will 
take to assure that mylan and other companies testifying before the 
subcommittee will not be discriminated against by the fda 
in response to dingells comments acting fda deputy 
commissioner jim benson sent a letter to the congressman assuring 
him there would be no retribution toward any of the companies that 
testify fda spokesman jeff nesbit said in addition a memo was 
sent to the generic drug division warning against any retaliation 
he said 
mylans complaints about arbitrary and discriminatory treatment 
by the fdas generic drug division sparked the investigation that 
so far has resulted in criminal charges against two fda employees 
and a drug company executive 
mcknight chairman and chief executive officer of mylan said 
his company began having trouble with the generic drug division in 
1985 
he said the fda with no uniform standards for drug approvals 
applied the few policies governing the process inconsistently 
also chemist reviewers slowed down the process by making 
unreasonable and repetitive requests for information and mylans 
applications were inexplicably transferred from one chemist to 
another during the process he said 
cheryl blume mylan vice president for scientific affairs said 
the company also has trouble getting information from the agency 
often its walking through the halls of fda and if you see a 
reviewer hell share his information with you she testified 
mcknight and edwin cohen president of barr laboratories one of 
the nations largest generic drug makers recounted a number of 
instances in which they claimed their approval requests were 
mishandled by the agency both alleged that the generic drug 
division favored some companies over others 
mcknight said he brought his complaints to supervisors in the 
division but when they did nothing his company launched its own 
investigation hiring its own investigators 
mylan turned its information over to the house investigations 
subcommittee which began an inquiry a year ago the subcommittee 
later turned over its evidence to the us attorney in baltimore 
for criminal prosecution in april charges were filed against two 
people in the case and earlier this week charles y chang a former 
generic drug division supervisor was charged with taking bribes 
the house panel is continuing its investigation as is the us 
attorney 
fda spokesman nesbit noted that the fda asked the health and 
human services departments inspector general two weeks ago to 
audit the management and practices of the division 
mcknight said little at the agency has changed 
he said mylan has been trying for more than 18 months to get fda 
approval to make several drug products at its new plant in puerto 
rico the company already has approval to make the drugs at its 
morgantown wva plant he said 
he said the company was told by an fda employee that we would 
never get approvals for puerto rico he said the employee was 
walter kletch who appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena 
last week but exercised his fifth amendment right and declined to 
answer any questions 
its business as usual mcknight told the panel

the securities and exchange commission in a 
rare action censured the chicago board options exchange on 
thursday accusing the board of failing to enforce its own rules on 
trading manipulation 
the cboe the largest options exchange in the world accepted 
the censure without admitting or denying the governments 
allegations it is only the third time in 10 years that the federal 
commission has censured one of the exchanges it regulates 
the commission said that in 1986 the exchanges business conduct 
committee ignored compelling circumstantial evidence in failing to 
initiate disciplinary action against 12 market makers including a 
former cboe vice chairman and seven affiliated firms 
the agency and the exchange refused to identify the individuals 
or their firms however an exchange source who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity identified one of the 12 as gary lahey who 
was cboe vice chairman at the time of the alleged misconduct in 
1985 
the 12 individuals and their firms were accused of a practice 
known as chumming that is they arranged to trade options 
among themselves primarily for the purpose of creating an 
artificial appearance of activity 
as part of the settlement with the exchange the sec agreed not 
to pursue action against the individuals and firms involved 
according to mary h weiss an attorney in the secs chicago office 
the government is also requiring the exchange to increase its 
surveillance of trading and to periodically inform its members 
about its rules prohibiting trading done to artificially influence 
price or volume 
the options involved included a number of overthecounter 
stocks and options on the standard and poors 250 which tracks 250 
overthecounter industrial stocks the options were listed on 
several exchanges so falsely pumping up activity on the chicago 
exchange could attract more business to it and away from the others 
warren moulds a spokesman for the exchange declined to answer 
questions but he read a statement which said in part in the 
interest of closing out an old matter the cboe voluntarily agreed 
to the entry of the sec order the exchange had already 
completed all undertakings called for in the order prior to the 
order being entered

the us dollar hit an eightmonth high against the 
japanese yen friday morning while share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange were sharply lower 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 8914point 
gainer thursday ended the morning session at 3383936 points 
down 24213 points or 07 percent 
after opening at 13540 yen up 085 yen from thursdays close 
of 13455 yen the dollar moved in a range of 1354065 yen the 
currency was being traded at 13548 yen at midday 
it was the first time that the dollar traded at the 13565 level 
since sept 6 
traders said the dollars surge followed overnight gains against 
most major currencies including the japanese yen on overseas 
markets 
the dollars rise was triggered by a decision thursday by us 
president george bush to send more us troops to panama to help 
protect the 51000 american civilians living in that country said 
a trader at the bank of tokyo who spoke anonymously there are 
10000 troops already based at us installations along the panama 
canal 
the us currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of 
international tension 
in a press confernce friday morning finance minister tatsuo 
maruyama said he was not alarmed by the dollars surge the 
dollar was bought due partly to its potential strength at the 
time of an emergency such as confusion over the panamanian 
presidential election maruyama said 
on the tokyo stock exchange share prices declined on a broad 
front due to concerns over the yens fall and the possibility of a 
discount rate hike 
some japanese economists have said the nations monetary 
authorities are waiting to assess price data due later this month 
before deciding on the timing for cutting the discount rate which 
now stands at a postworld war ii low of 25 percent
