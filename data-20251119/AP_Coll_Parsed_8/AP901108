president bush on thursday ordered massive 
land and sea additions to the us military force in the persian 
gulf to give an adequate offensive option if needed to drive 
iraq from kuwait 
bushs order will add more than 150000 military personnel to 
the 230000 us troops already in the area 
he ordered troops and tanks transferred from europe sent in new 
warships and called up combatready national guard units 
bush asked directly whether he was going to war against saddam 
hussein said i would like to see a peaceful solution to this 
question 
if this movement of force is what convinces him so much the 
better bush said lets hope he comes to his senses he 
added 
defense secretary dick cheney giving details of the new 
buildup said it would include two armored divisions and smaller 
armored units from germany and a division from the united states 
the famous big red one first infantry division mechanized 
based at fort riley kans 
neither he nor bush would say just how many troops would be 
joining the 230000 us forces already in the gulf area 
however full deployment of the units listed by cheney would add 
more than 150000 troops to the us forces there pentagon 
officials said in private conversations even without sending all 
of their support units the additional combat and essential support 
forces total about 100000 
iraq has more than 400000 troops in the region 
cheney said the navy would send three additional aircraft 
carrier battle groups and their escorts the battleship uss 
missouri and a second marine amphibious group of 5000 men 
and the defense secretary said combatready national guard 
brigades the 48th in georgia the 155th in mississippi and the 
256th in louisiana would be called up for the first time for 
possible reassignment to the middle east they total about 10000 
people 
also cheney said the air force probably would also send 
reinforcements 
hundreds of additional tanks will be deployed the secretary 
said 
whether it will be adequate in the event of going to war with 
saddam husseins army im not going to speculate said gen 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
bushs escalation of the us gulf presence was greeted with 
skepticism from congressional democrats 
i am concerned that the administration is moving to establish 
an offensive capacity in advance of a un resolution authorizing 
offensive action said senate foreign relations committee 
chairman claiborne pell dri 
pell said the international trade embargo against iraq has not 
yet had a decent chance to produce results 
a house armed services committee member rep ike skelton 
dmo said bushs use of the word offensive was ominous the 
whole attitude seems to be changing from defense to offense he 
said this is a new chapter 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the middle east 
subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee said he 
believed the president has been concerned that the focus has been 
drifting away from the military option with european political 
figures visiting iraq to negotiate for the release of their 
citizens held hostage 
the president said hamilton wants to let the iraqis know 
that were deadly serious about this 
the additional troops were ordered as two marine corps generals 
warned in interviews with the washington post that war stockpiles 
in saudi arabia need strengthening 
logistics is a concern of all of us because we are 
stretched farther than weve ever been in our nations history in 
terms of trying to sustain a large force in the field lt gen 
ernest t cook jr head of the combat development command was 
quoted in friday editions as saying 
a deputy to cook maj gen matthew p caulfield had similar 
comments and the commandant of the marine corps gen alfred m 
gray spoke in the same vein in a speech at peeksill ny last 
week the newspaper said 
bush spoke as secretary of state james a baker iii was in 
moscow consulting senior soviet officials over persian gulf 
strategy 
soviet officials said they could not rule out the use of force 
bush called this statement very helpful and said were on 
the same wavelength with president mikhail s gorbachev on goals 
in the middle east

the man accused of assassinating rabbi meir 
kahane may have been taking prescription drugs for depression 
police said thursday 
el sayyid nosair 34 entered no plea wednesday night at his 
arraignment in bellevue hospitals intensive care unit he was shot 
in the throat by a us postal police officer after kahanean 
antiarab extremist was shot monday night at a manhattan hotel 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli said thursday that relatives 
told police they thought nosair had been under a doctors care 
nosair was taking prozac a drug facing lawsuits that contend it 
induces violent and persistent homicidal and suicidal behavior the 
new york times said in fridays editions quoting a law enforcement 
official it did not identify 
the drugs manufacturer eli lilly amp co inc denies any 
association between the drug and violence in patients the food and 
drug administration has also found no such association 
nosair was on documented sick leave from his job with the citys 
department of general services five days last week said department 
spokesman john beckman the diagnosis was confidential beckman 
said 
investigators have not linked nosair to any terrorist groups 
borrelli speculated that nosair a native egyptian who has an 
engineering degree may have felt frustrated because he couldnt 
fulfill his potential in this country 
nosair began working for the city in april 1988 on a crew that 
tends to heating air conditioning and ventilation at courthouses 
in addition nosair injured his hand or arm in an accident at 
work in which he was nearly electrocuted borrelli said 
the combined stress was acting on him he wasnt getting 
ahead borrelli theorized 
one source told new york newsday that nosair threw a tantrum in 
a locker room monday because he was being transferred to brooklyn 
but beckman and borrelli said they had no indication that was true 
beckman confirmed that nosair was to be transferred effective 
thursday from manhattan to brooklyn it wasnt punitive said 
beckman he was a satisfactory worker 
beckman said the department has 108 other workers who do the 
same job as nosair these guys take these jobs with the 
understanding they will be transferred of the 109 last year there 
were 61 transfers he said 
on wednesday the department of general services suspended him 
without pay until further notice based on his alleged criminal 
activity and because he allegedly used a false brooklyn address 
nosairs job has a new york city residency requirement nosair 
lives in cliffside park nj beckman said 
borrelli said police had raised the filedoff serial numbers on 
the murder weapon a 357caliber revolver the federal bureau of

six scientists on an environmental protection 
agency panel on smoking including its chairman have ties to a 
tobacco industry research group but the epa says thats no 
problem 
we went to our lawyers and said does this constitute a 
conflict of interest and they said no said donald barnes 
staff director of the epas scientific advisory board 
we were concerned about the appearance of conflict of 
interest barnes said but he said the link between the panel 
members and the tobacco organization does not cause any question 
to be raised about their technical capabilities 
the 16member panels task is to assure the accuracy and 
objectivity of two forthcoming epa studies on the health effects of 
secondhand cigarette smoke in addition to the six members with 
ties to the tobacco research organization a seventh member of the 
panel was appointed at the urging of the philip morris tobacco 
company epa officials said 
theyve stacked the deck with people who have close ties to 
the tobacco industry said dr alan blum a founder of the 
antismoking group doctors ought to care its pathetic 
the panel members are linked to the center for indoor air 
research of linthicum md 
the center is financed by philip morris rj reynolds tobacco 
co and lorillard corp three of the nations largest tobacco 
companies its board of directors is made up of employees of those 
companies said pamela phillips an administrator at the center 
the chairman of the epa panel morton lippmann of new york 
university is on the science advisory board of the tobacco 
industry center 
lippmann and another member of the epa panel dr jonathan samet 
of the university of new mexico helped devise the centers 
research agenda 
samet and three other members of the panel are listed as peer 
reviewers for the center they help determine which research 
projects the center supports 
yet another panel member delbert eatough of brigham young 
university receives research funds from the center 
a seventh member geoffrey kabat of the american health 
foundation had been recommended by philip morris epa officials 
said kabat said i have no direct contact with the tobacco 
industry at all and i certainly dont see myself as being an agent 
of theirs in any respect 
the makeup of the epa panel aroused controversy when it was 
reported last month that the agency had dismissed dr david burns 
from the panel after the tobacco industry lobbied to get rid of 
him 
burns of the university of california san diego was the 
author of the us surgeon generals report on passive smoking and 
is regarded by his colleagues as a leading authority on the issue 
he was reinstated to the panel after his dismissal was disclosed 
lippmann said he didnt see any problem working with the epa and 
with the tobacco research center 
it can always raise questions he said i dont view it as 
any conflict 
samets office said he was on vacation and couldnt be reached 
eatough who has received research funds from rj reynolds as 
well as the center for indoor air research said the money does not 
compromise his objectivity 
im sure that it does raise questions in many peoples 
minds he said but he said he is not constrained by the tobacco 
research funds what we do is what we do and were free to go 
down what seem the reasonable roads to go 
the scientists serving as peer reviewers for the center for 
indoor air research are michael lebowitz of the university of 
arizona jan aj stolwijk of yale university and james e woods of 
virginia polytechnic institute and state university 
woods didnt return a call to his office lebowitzs office said 
he was out of the office until nov 16 stolwijk said i review 
grant applications they send me i dont have anything else to do 
with them

democrats recouped some of their sunbelt losses 
from the reagan era and took firm control of redistricting as 
southern voters showed they had no love for taxes and no affection 
for big spenders 
democrats regained the governorships in florida texas and 
oklahoma and won a majority in the virginia congressional 
delegation for the first time in 24 years 
north carolina sen jesse helms and alabama gov guy hunt 
however bucked the trend and provided reelection victories for 
republicans in key races hunt the first republican governor in 
alabama since 1874 won despite a virtual sweep of top state 
offices by democrats 
on congressional reapportionment which will draw the lines of 
political power for the next decade republicans will share control 
only in alabama and south carolina democrats will be in command in 
the rest of the region including florida which will gain four 
seats in the house of representatives and texas which will pick 
up three 
you have to be careful when you say one party has taken the 
torch from the other but the momentum in the south is clearly with 
the democrats said del ali an analyst with masondixon opinion 
research the democrats have done something theyve been unable 
to do in 12 years and that is steal an issue from under the 
republicans 
taxes were an issue republicans had made inroads with in the 
south over the past decade but some democrat candidates turned the 
tables tuesday 
tax increases signed by republican florida gov bob martinez 
were blamed for his defeat by former sen lawton chiles who 
grabbed 56 percent of the vote bigspending was another issue 
chiles imposed a 100 limit on contributions to his campaign and 
raised 52 million to oust martinez martinez only the second 
republican governor florida has had since reconstruction raised 
106 million 
taxes and big spending proved to be key issues in the texas 
race too democrat ann richards the state treasurer best known 
for her biting keynote speech at the 1988 democratic national 
convention came from behind to defeat millionaire rancher and 
oilman clayton williams 
williams who spent 8 million of his own money on a 20 million 
campaign to keep the governors office in gop hands disclosed in 
the final week of the campaign that his tax bill in 1986 was 0 it 
was just one of a string of setbacks for the loosetalking 
republican 
a cbstv exit poll said 25 percent of tuesdays texas voters 
made their choice in those last seven days 
i just would shoot myself in the foot and then id load up and 
try it again williams said after his defeat 
in oklahoma david walters recaptured the governors office for 
the democrats by easily defeating republican bill price walters 
has accused price of oilprice gouging price denied that 
allegation and filed a libel suit against walters 
georgia democrat zell miller defeated republican johnny isakson 
in the governors race retaining the office for the democrats 
georgia democrats also threw a scare into rep newt gingrich the 
fiery secondincommand house gop leader gingrich hung on to

arkansas gov bill clinton and tennessee gov ned mcwherter 
both democrats and south carolina republican gov carroll campbell 
all were reelected 
in senate races democratic incumbents howell heflin of alabama

of west virginia won reelection handily as did republicans mitch 
mcconnell of kentucky strom thurmond of south carolina and phil 
gramm of texas 
senators david pryor dark sam nunn dga j bennett 
johnston dla thad cochran rmiss and john warner rva 
were reelected either in uncontested races or with only 
thirdparty or writein opposition 
helms the torchbearer of the right wing who had been trailing 
in some polls shortly before the election launched a lastminute 
blitz of attack ads against civil rights legislation his opponent 
former charlotte mayor harvey gantt is black 
gantt according to thad beyle a university of north carolina 
at chapel hill political scientist ran right into the jaws of a 
racial campaign helms won 54 percent of the vote

the money problems of the recessionstruck 
northeast inflicted casualties on both democrats and republicans 
not only in tuesdays elections but throughout the long political 
season 
some candidates were knocked out others were bloodied even if 
they did win four incumbent governors lost their seats and five 
others were reelected 
we had a lot of restlessness in the northeast said lee 
miringoff director of the marist college institute for public 
opinion in poughkeepsie ny weve had a lot of moving vans come 
up and change the occupants of the statehouses there was major 
concern about the economy and state budgets directed at the 
occupants 
just the same voters stopped short of carrying out tax revolts 
in massachusetts and maryland that would have resulted in the 
biggest state rollbacks in history 
analysts said they apparently were swayed by slick 
milliondollar campaigns that warned of desperate consequences if 
the referendums passed jobs lost and cuts in education police 
protection and services to the elderly instead voters opted for 
political newcomers to carry out a less drastic mandate to hold the 
line on spending and taxes 
democratic gov mario cuomo of new york was among tuesdays 
survivors he won a third term and remains a 1992 presidential 
prospect 
but cuomo captured 53 percent of the vote against three weak 
opponents well short of the recordsetting 65 percent he received 
four years ago he won despite a record 18 billion tax increase 
and a state credit rating that is the third worst in the nation 
he had a solid victory said miringoff but to some degree 
the same kinds of trends were affecting new york concern over the 
economy and state budgets and a general sense on the part of the 
voters that things were going in the wrong direction 
voters in new jersey angry over democratic gov jim florios 
28 billion tax package took out their wrath on sen bill 
bradley florio was not up for reelection and at 6foot5 the 
former new york knick presented a big target bradley received 50 
percent of the vote compared to 48 percent for christine todd 
whitman a littleknown republican he reportedly spent 105 
million on his campaign nearly 20 times what mrs whitman spent 
i think bradley was caught in the restlessness and the 
frustration that existed in new jersey said miringoff he was 
the visible target sort of the surrogate governor 
new governors were elected in massachusetts connecticut 
vermont and rhode island where budgets and taxes rose by the 
billions and workers lost their jobs by the thousands 
correctly gauging the mood of the voters three democratic 
governors michael dukakis of massachusetts william a oneill of 
connecticut and madeleine kunin of vermont bowed out of the 
primaries 
in massachusetts william weld a former assistant us attorney 
general became the first republican elected to the governorship in 
20 years he narrowly defeated tarttongued democrat john silber 
on leave as president of boston university 
both campaigned as outsiders who would return the states 
economy to good health each defeated his partys endorsed 
candidate in the primary 
weld supported question 3 a referendum that would have rolled 
back taxes and some fees to their 1988 levels cutting 39 billion 
from state revenue over the next 18 months silber opposed the 
measure the voters backed weld but rejected question 3 
paul watanabe a political analyst at the university of 
massachusetts at boston said the taxbusting referendum was too 
drastic it was defeated because voters guaranteed there would be 
substantial change by electing political newcomers in the september 
primary he said 
voters rejected caps on property taxes in anne arundel and 
baltimore counties in maryland 
lowell p weicker jr former threeterm republican us 
senator won the connecticut governorship as an independent he 
will be the states first thirdparty governor since the civil war 
and its first nondemocratic governor in two decades 
in vermont republican richard snelling gov kunins 
predecessor was returned to the office he held 14 years ago 
defeating democrat peter welch a former state senator 
bruce g sundlun a millionaire democratic businessman soundly 
defeated the incumbent republican governor in rhode island edward 
d diprete 74 percent to 26 percent sundlun had lost twice before 
to diprete who had reversed himself on a pledge of no new taxes 
i think the voters were focusing on the economy in the 
northeast diprete said i think they had made up their minds 
and that was it 
in maine the incumbent republican governor john r mckernan 
narrowly won over his predecessor us rep joseph e brennan a 
democrat brennan had campaigned on charges that mckernan failed to 
move quickly enough to counter the faltering economy brennan 
served two fouryear terms as governor before changing offices with 
mckernan in 1987 
govs robert casey of pennsylvania and william d schaefer of 
maryland both democrats won reelection easily both held the 
line on taxes and both states declared budgt surpluses for the 
fiscal year ended june 30 
another incumbent winner was republican gov judd gregg of new 
hampshire who pledged to keep the state free of income and general 
sales taxes

voters delivered a knockout punch to incumbents 
in the nations midsection ousting four governors and one us 
senator the only senator in the nation to lose a reelection bid 
two veteran democrats and two freshman republicans were defeated 
tuesday in heated gubernatorial contests and in a stunning upset 
in the senate minnesota gop incumbent rudy boschwitz lost his bid 
for a third term 
in the most tumultuous race minnesota gov rudy perpich was 
narrowly defeated by republican arne carlson who was a 11thhour 
replacement after the gop candidate withdrew amid charges of sexual 
improprieties 
in michigan twoterm gov james blanchard lost by a razorthin 
margin to republican state senate majority leader john engler the 
governor is the first michigan chief executive to be booted from 
office in nearly 30 years 
in two other contests republicans blamed for higher taxes lost 
bids for second terms in kansas state treasurer joan finney 
defeated gov mike hayden and in nebraska businessman ben nelson 
eked out a win over kay orr the states first woman governor 
some poliical analysts speculate the gubernatorial losses are 
tied to the office itself 
the governors were a lot more vulnerable than legislators 
said burdett loomis a university of kansas political science 
professor governors have to deal with the fiscal problems on the 
ground that certainly may mean raising taxes cutting budgets 
things likely to be unpopular 
someone like blanchard over eight years has done a lot of 
unpopular things he said hayden created a number of enemies 
perpich was seen as flaky and ticked off a variety of people the 
potential to lose is much greater with the governors youre much 
more accountable for your actions 
in two of three gubernatorial races in which taxes dominated 
gop incumbents lost 
in kansas mrs finney who will became the states first female 
governor blamed hayden for high property taxes resulting from 
statewide reappraisal and implementation of a classification system 
completed in 1989 
it was pretty clearly a vote on hayden mostly on the property 
tax issue loomis said 
one thing finney did really hit on was this kind of prairie 
populism thats always here in the plain states rural kansans 
rural nebraskans are normally republican theyre not that far 
from the edge of the economy when they have economic fears the 
tendency is to move toward populist ideas 
in nebraska mrs orr was on the defensive for endorsing a 1987 
income tax increase that hit many lower and middleincome 
residents 
but in illinois gop secretary of state jim edgar won a close 
race over democrat neil hartigan even though the republican 
supported an extension of a temporary income tax increase 
i think people like to have a public official who will level 
with them before the election and not surprise them after the 
election said edgar longtime heirapparent to gov james 
thompson who retired after 14 years 
hartigan also was hurt by a low turnout in chicago disaffection 
among blacks with the democrats and doubts about his campaign 
pledges 
i think hartigan scored some points on the tax issue but 
he lost points in other settings among people who simply found his 
message lacking in credibility said jim nowlan professor of 
public policy at knox college in galesburg ill they just 
couldnt believe hartigan was going to cut taxes and do all he said 
he was going to do 
in ohio the gop captured one of its biggest prizes as former 
cleveland mayor george voinovich won the gubernatorial race over 
state attorney general anthony celebrezze jr democratic gov 
richard celeste was barred by law from seeking a third consecutive 
term 
and in minnesota the republicans added another gubernatorial 
seat to their column with carlesons victory over perpich who 
sought a fourth term the gop state auditor became the republican 
candidate only last week after jon grunseth withdrew from the race 
amid sexual misconduct charges 
the republican turmoil spilled over into the minnesota senate 
race in which boschwitz lost to college professor paul wellstone 
a liberal activist who was outspent by a 71 margin but captured 
voters attention with clever campaign commercials 
in two other senate races capitol hill veterans originally 
among the gops brightest prospects failed to unseat liberal 
democrats 
in illinois paul simon trounced us rep lynn martin who 
never gained momentum in her campaign and in iowa tom harkin 
scored a solid win over us rep tom tauke becoming the first 
democratic senator in the state to win reelection 
in other contests 
iowa gov terry branstad swept to a third term over democrat 
don avenson state house speaker 
wisconsin republican gov tommy thompson scored a doubledigit 
win over assembly speaker tom loftus 
south dakota gop gov republican george mickelson handily won 
reelection over former state sen bob samuelson 
and in the senate 
south dakota republican sen larry pressler won a third term 
over businessman ted muenster 
indianas dan coats who inherited vice president dan quayles 
seat defeated democratic state rep baron hill 
michigan democrat carl levin won in a landslide over us rep 
bill schuette 
nebraska democrat james exon scored an easy win over former 
us rep hal daub 
kansas republican nancy kassebaum crushed democratic challenger

western voters voiced antigovernment sentiments without kicking 
out those in government approving limits on politicians terms but 
removing few incumbents from office 
economic worries meanwhile appeared to dull enthusiasm for 
sweeping environmental reforms proposed in several states voters 
rejected most of the measures including californias closely 
watched big green initiative 
and republican pete wilsons victory over democrat dianne 
feinstein in the california governors race was a bright spot for 
the gop it will give the party leverage when it comes time to 
reapportion the nations largest congressional delegation 
tuesdays election provided plenty of evidence of western 
voters disillusionment with government 
voters in colorado and california approved limits on how long 
politicians can hold office arizona voters defeated a proposed pay 
raise for legislators by a margin of 2 to 1 
and in alaska walter hickel capitalized on an antigovernment 
mood winning the governors race as an independent the longtime 
republican elected as alaskas second governor in 1966 said his 
campaign appealed to those fed up with traditional 
democratrepublican politics 
i think alaskans just want a change they want to have more 
of a say in government hickel said its sort of an 
antigovernment feeling out there 
but when it came time to judge incumbents holding office 
western voters were kinder in keeping with a nationwide trend that 
returned more than 95 percent of incumbents to congress 
voters supported the five western governors seeking reelection 
all democrats they were govs roy romer of colorado john waihee 
of hawaii cecil andrus of idaho mike sullivan of wyoming and 
acting nevada gov bob miller 
four us senators seeking reelection coasted to victory ted 
stevens ralaska pete domenici rnm alan simpson rwyoming 
and sen max baucus dmont 
even two incumbent senators that appeared vulnerable managed 
victories sen daniel akaka dhawaii defeated gop challenger 
rep pat saiki and in oregon republican sen mark hatfield 
survived the biggest scare of his senate career winning a fifth 
term over democrat harry lonsdale 
in washington firstterm rep jolene unsoeld a democrat was 
targeted for defeat by the gop but weathered a strong challenge by 
republican bob williams 
why the loyalty to incumbents in a year when people are 
supposedly disgusted with congress 
you cant beat somebody with nothing said kent briggs of 
the center for the new west a denverbased research group it 
may have been in a lot of these races there wasnt a credible 
alternative the antiincumbency sentiment didnt really get going 
until the end of this year and by that time everyone had filed 
exceptions to the staying power of incumbents were fiveterm 
rep denny smith rore who lost to democrat mike kopetski and 
rep charles pashayan jr rcalif defeated by democrat calvin 
dooley observers say links to the savingsandloan scandals 
contributed to both losses 
wilsons win in california was not the only gop success the 
party retained two western seats where its senators were retiring 
rep hank brown beat democrat josie heath in colorado and rep 
larry craig of idaho won over democrat ron twilegar 
but democrats made inroads too in idaho democrat larry 
larocco filled the seat vacated by craig and in utah the house 
seat held by retiring gop rep howard nielson went to democrat bill 
orton making it the first time since 1974 that utah has had more 
than one democrat among its three congressmen 
some blamed republican slides on antitax sentiment but few 
voters opted to cut taxes themselves 
oregon voters were the exception passing a measure to phase in 
a 15 percent property tax ceiling over five years but montanans 
refused to scrap their state income property and sales taxes in 
favor of a transaction charge of 1 percent on all financial 
dealings colorado voters rejected a measure requiring voter 
approval for any state or local tax increase and utah voters 
refused to abolish a state sales tax on food 
the strongest message among ballot propositions was the defeat 
of sweeping environmental reforms 
california voters rejected 2 to 1 the closely watched big 
green initiative that would have stiffened regulation of air 
pollution pesticides offshore oildrilling and logging they also 
rejected forests forever a proposed limit on clearcutting of 
forests 
washington voters defeated a strong growthcontrol measure and 
oregon voters rejected strict recycling rules and a proposal to 
close the states only nuclear power plant 
i think concerns on the economy were a factor briggs said 
theres a perception out there that the economy is sliding into a 
recession when people are confronted with charges that if we do 
something it will cause x loss of jobs it gives them pause 
other highlights in western races 
in arizona republican fife symington held a small lead over 
democrat terry goddard in a gubernatorial race headed for a runoff 
symington led goddard by about 3600 votes with 99 percent of 
104 million votes counted and about 7000 votes went to writein 
candidates a state constitutional amendment requires runoffs in 
races in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes but 
no laws are in place to implement a runoff it could be next spring

rep newt gingrich says hes gotten the 
message from georgias 6th district voters who came within a hair 
of retiring him from elected office 
its to pay more attention to listen more to reach out to 
people more to make sure youre their incumbent the jonesboro 
republican said wednesday after complete but unofficial returns 
showed him defeating democrat david worley by less than 1000 
votes 
worley who won only 41 percent of the vote against gingrich two 
years ago clearly shocked the house gop whip who was so confident 
of victory he didnt bother to come home and campaign during the 
entire month of october 
theres no question that if i had to do it over again i would 
have flown home more often gingrich said but we thought we 
were in pretty good shape 
worley didnt even have the formal support of house democratic 
leaders who backed him in 1988 but decided not to this year after 
worley made an issue of gingrichs support for a 35000 
congressional pay raise 
that was clearly a very negative factor gingrich said of 
the pay raise issue there is no question in my mind that without 
that the race would have been dramatically easier 
gingrich cited three other contributing factors for his close 
shave an antiincumbency mood among voters a democratic tide that 
overwhelmed most republicans in georgia on tuesday and the long 
bitter strike against eastern air lines the largest employer in 
his district 
worley 31 a jonesboro lawyer said he intends to demand the 
recount that in georgia is automatic when the difference between 
candidates is less than 1 percent 
we had hundreds of grassroots supporters worley said we 
got the right message to the voters that its time for a change 
roger ailes the republican consultant who managed president 
bushs media campaign in 1988 said voters were angry at gingrich 
for leading the house gop revolt against president bush and the 
presidents deficit reduction agreement 
but gingrich said his opposition to the budget agreement and its 
tax increases probably saved him from defeat 
other gop political experts agreed 
i dont think republicans abandoned newt gingrich because of 
what he did on the budget said ed rollins cochairman of the 
national republican congressional committee 
rollins said gingrich ran into trouble because voters who always 
had viewed him as a outsider challenging georgias democratic 
establishment began to see him as a congressional insider once he 
won election as gop whip 
worleys surprising showing did seem to rejuvenate house 
democrats 
newt gingrich now becomes target no 1 for 1992 if he wins the 
recount said rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the 
democratic congressional campaign committee

a group of wellknown conservatives is taking 
out advertisements in major newspapers and on television to drum up 
support for president bushs persian gulf policy 
sam zakhem a former us ambassador to bahrain said tuesday 
that he and others formed the coalition for america at risk to back 
bushs policies 
the idea for the coalition came two months ago when some 
conservatives seemed to waver in their support of bushs decision 
to send 225000 troops to defend saudi arabia from iraq zakhem 
said in a telephone interview from his denver home 
many people run out of patience and this is a very important 
thing for the national interest of the united states he said 
support president bush and the brave men and women of 
operation desert shield working to free kuwait reads part of a 
fullpage ad 
it has appeared in the new york times the wall street journal 
the los angeles times the washington times the washington post 
and usa today a fullpage ad in the washington posts front 
section costs 19000 
zakhem said he informed bush of the coalitions plan in early 
september white house spokesmen did not immediately return a 
telephone call seeking reaction a recent public opinion poll by 
abc news found about 65 percent of americans approve of bushs 
handling of the gulf crisis 
zakhem said the ads are being paid for by the coalitions 
wellheeled backers but otalie english a spokeswoman for keene 
shirley amp associates the public relations firm representing the 
coalition said the campaign is supposed to be selfsupporting once 
it gets off the ground 
the newspaper ad invites readers to call a tollfree telephone 
number for a free emergency action kit 
english said the kit includes a bumper sticker and several 900 
telephone numbers callers can for a fee receive updates on the 
situation in kuwait and learn to set up a grassroots organizing 
campaign she said 
the tollfree number has been flooded with requests zakhem 
said 
zakhem said the coalition hopes for a peaceful solution to the 
gulf crisis but he added that question is up to iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
the group includes retired maj gen john k singlaub who was 
involved in sending weapons to the nicaraguan contra rebels in the 
reagan administration david keene of the american conservative 
union grover norquist of americans for tax reform lewis tambs a 
former ambassador to costa rica and doug wead who resigned 
earlier this year as bushs liaison to conservative and religious 
groups

republicans may not have won many 
redistricting skirmishes but they feel lucky to merely have 
survived democratic efforts to shut them out of the process in 
several key states 
theyd have killed us into the end of the next century said 
bill stevens a spokesman for the new york state senate 
republicans the gop repelled democrats attempts to take the 
chamber in tuesdays elections 
its not a game in which gentlemen draw district lines 
theres no marquess of queensberry rules stevens said thats 
not the way its done 
the game was to gain control of the state governments that will 
reassign us house seats based on population shifts a process 
that can reshape congressional delegations and legislatures for the 
coming decade 
democrats racked up big redistricting victories taking the 
governorships in florida and texas which together will gain seven 
us house seats and adding rhode island new mexico and oklahoma 
to the list of states where they hold a lock on recharting 
political lines 
the gop won a round by taking the california governors race 
but that only ensures republicans negotiating power there because 
the states legislature is controlled by democrats 
because new york has a democratic governor and democratic state 
assembly the gop had to have the state senate to maintain any 
bargaining power population shifts will cost the state three us 
house seats 
a similar breakdown was at stake in pennsylvania which will 
lose two house seats and where the gop hung onto control of the 
state senate 
if we hadnt held on we would have been subject to a 
reapportionment steamroller pencil that would have drawn the lines 
in a highly partisan manner said senate president robert 
jubelirer who led the republicans successful defensive at 
least now we are a player at the table 
in florida democrats hold all the power because they retrained 
slim majorities in the state senate and house and snatched the 
governors seat as well 
florida will gain four us house seats allen stonecipher 
executive director of the florida democratic party said the 
partys monopoly will help democrats regain the ground they lost in 
the 1980s 
after a decade of unadorned republican economics its 
important that democrats have an opportunity to advance a different 
approach to economic and domestic problems he said 
the states that will gain or lose house seats are most often 
thought of as key redistricting states but all political lines 
such as state legislative district lines are remapped 
state control can be equally important creative juggling of 
district lines stacking a district with precincts that generally 
vote either republican or democratic can oftentimes guarantee 
whether a republican or democrat will win in that district 
the process can come in handy when party leaders are looking to 
help out a budding young political star they can redraw a district 
that will better position a politician for a run for higher office 
down the road 
the same is true if the party that controls the redistricting 
process sees a future threat from a young politician on the other 
side 
you can either blunt the other persons talent pool or you can 
use redistricting to enhance your own talent pool stevens said

nasa is literally going back to the drawing 
board to live within its budget and still find a way to build a 
space station to put americans into space permanently 
we have 6 billion more program planned than we have money 
for william b lenoir the head of the national aeronautics and 
space administrations space flight program said wednesday 
congress gave the agency three months to revamp a space station 
design that was six years in the making 
it is our intention to come back in 90 days with the answers 
to what can we do what makes sense and still have a useful 
affordable program lenoir told reporters if we cannot come up 
with what we consider a reasonable program then we would have to 
readdress whether we should even go forward with the space 
station 
the bush administration had asked congress to spend 251 
billion in 1991 to propel the 37 billion space station into the 
hardwarebuilding stage the lawmakers allotted 19 billion 
instead and told nasa to build the station in smaller steps each 
independent of the other 
they also squashed nasa plans to increase yearly spending for 
the station to 4 billion in 1996 telling the agency it could 
count on no more than 25 billion to 26 billion in any one year 
nasa had long planned to hold a comprehensive design review 
during the last two months of this year and lenoir said that 
process will go forward even though the final design will have to 
be reduced in scope 
we are not going to start over he said we are going to 
use as much of the existing system as possible some of the 
modules may be built halfsize to save money but the whole station 
will be designed to accommodate additions later 
congress told nasa it should be able to build a mantended 
station with three or four shuttle flights instead of six 
mantended is the term used for periodic visits to the station by 
astronauts who fly there on the space shuttle for stays of 16 days 
lenoir said plans remain to start construction in the spring of 
1995 meaning the station would be ready for work early in 1996 
the revised plan however wont permit nasa to have crews aboard 
permanently by the end of the decade as had been envisioned 
a frequent criticism of nasa is that it is building a cadillac 
of a space station with all possible options when it should be 
building a chevrolet instead 
asked about this lenoir recalled that johnny cash once had a 
song called one piece at a time and said maybe we are going 
to build a cadillac one piece at a time 
meanwhile wednesday nasa announced that it will launch the 
shuttle atlantis on nov 15 on a military mission reportedly 
carrying a spy satellite that will gather intelligence information 
on the persian gulf 
the mission had been delayed by hydrogen leaks on the shuttle 
the agency also reported that a special investigative team found 
no pattern in a series of accidents on the ground involving shuttle 
equipment

enough on the election now for a word or two 
from the silent majority the 110 million americans who didnt 
vote 
i never took the time said melissa withers 20 of 
mabelville ark on her way to a babysitting job im always 
well usually mad when it turns out the way it does but ive just 
never taken the time to go down and register 
its just sleazeball a or sleazeball b said civil engineer 
jim allerton of seattle explaining why he didnt vote 
i dont believe in santa claus said college student 
jennifer toledo in rhode island i dont believe in the tooth 
fairy i dont believe in politicians 
they worry the experts these nonvoters proportionately there 
are more of them in america than any other democracy in the world 
there are more in this century than in the last century there are 
more in the 1990s than there were in the 1950s 
about 64 percent of votingage americans didnt vote tuesday 
according to curtis gans who gathers turnout statistics 
abc news surveyed 1028 likely nonvoters it found their 
political views were pretty much like those of everyone else 
they are concerned about the crisis in the persian gulf they 
worry about the economy drugs the deficit taxes 
sixtyfour percent say they trust the government to do what is 
right only some of the time sixty percent say local elected 
officials care more about serving special interests than helping 
people 
gans has been studying them for 15 years as director of the 
nonpartisan committee for the study of the american electorate 
he said people voted in heavier numbers on tuesday in places 
where there was something important to decide but in places 
where the public only saw messages framed by political consultants 
and sensed that nothing real was at stake turnout was down he 
said 
gans conclusion when serious candidates discuss important 
issues people respond 
bruce buchanan a university of texas political scientist said 
only some of the nonvoters are the disenchanted turned off 
feeling impotent convinced their vote wouldnt make a difference 
others are kept away by procedural barriers difficulty in 
registering or in getting to the polls others especially the 
young simply feel government has no relevance 
most people in america come close to regarding politics as 
very distant from their lives he said its just not an urgent 
matter 
the washington post commissioned a study of people who havent 
registered and put them into three groups too busy young 
educated somewhat more affluent than the others too cynical 
middle age and middle class or physically impaired or illiterate 
older 
associated press reporters across the country talked to 
nonvoters tuesday and wednesday they fell into all the 
categories 
turned off was skyp krantz 43 of dayton ohio a 9000ayear 
clerk in a record store why bother he asked no matter who 
is voted in once they are elected they do what they want or worse 
what somebody with a lot of money wants 
unregistered was jim madzinski 28 manager of a tulsa okla 
food service company honestly im not registered in oklahoma 
he said the last thing i want to do is get pulled in for jury 
duty 
untouched by it all was college student kevin moore 25 in 
madison wis im just not interested he said while waiting to 
cross a street on his bicycle i dont think anyone running for 
office can do anything for me 
kim cruea 26 a nanny who cares for four children in 
indianapolis wasnt registered but even if she were she said 
with all these horrible campaign commercials i wouldnt know who 
to vote for they make everyone sound so horrible 
hostile was bert heacock 39 a building services manager and 
parttime night watchman in boston theyre all backstabbers 
he said they need to clean up politics its all mudslinging and 
cutting each other down 
heacock intends to vote with his feet he said hes saving his 
money for a move to nova scotia canada

the halloween night rampage in which a homeless 
man was slain and nine others were wounded in a frenzy of bats and 
cleavers caught the citys attention but activists say other 
assaults on the homeless go virtually unnoticed 
unfortunately nobody seems to care said keith summa a 
advocate for the homeless 
as he sees it every day is a scary halloween for the homeless 
and the horrors are mostly masked by a society that cares little 
about those who have nothing 
on halloween a gang of 18 youths dressed as vampires the grim 
reaper and the horror film character jason poured across the 
footbridge linking manhattan to wards island in the east river 
where more than 100 men live at a city mens shelter 
wielding a meat cleaver bats and lengths of pipe they attacked 
10 men using the cleaver to slash the throat of 35yearold carlos 
melendez who died on a deserted path on the wooded island one 
victim was hospitalized for a head injury and eight others were 
released after treatment for deep cuts 
six people ages 13 to 23 and from the upper manhattan housing 
projects facing wards island have been arrested and charged with 
murder 
some residents of the area are afraid of the homeless claiming 
they mug people to get drug money others know that the homeless 
sometimes are defenseless 
the youths pick on the homeless said project resident 
ronell bailey theyll kick them theyll bother them its rough 
here 
recent studies of the homeless at wards island show they also 
have other problems 
the first study of aids among homeless in new york city in 1989 
found that 105 of 169 men tested at the wards island shelter were 
infected that is a rate of 62 percent 
earlier this year a study found that 428 percent of the men at 
the shelter tested positive for tuberculosis compared with 5 
percent to 15 percent of the general population six percent of the 
homeless men actually had the disease 
on monday four of the nine men who were injured in the 
halloween attack came to the coalition for the homeless where 
summa works as the advocacy director 
they were looking for some assistance he said there was 
a feeling among all four of them that they want justice they 
wanted to make sure the folks were prosecuted and convicted and 
that this doesnt happen to somebody else 
but increasingly he said it does 
on sept 23 a batwielding gang of brooklyn teenagers was 
blamed for the torching of an abandoned van in which three homeless 
people were asleep nora reilly 25 was burnd over 100 percent of 
her body and died two men were critically injured 
on sept 26 a homeless man in his 50s known as ruben was set 
on fire and burned over 85 percent of his body in queens 
in may a homeless woman died after she was beaten on a 
brooklyn street after someone accused her of stealing a radio 
on nov 4 1989 samuel jenkins was burned over 30 percent of 
his body when a woman set fire to his makeshift shelter in a 
manhattan park he later died 
on sept 18 1988 a homeless man known as johnny was killed 
when a gang of teenagers chase him onto a busy highway where he 
was struck by a car 
summa said about 200 homeless people in new york die on the 
streets each year many victims of the winter cold some are 
electrocuted when they try to seek refuge in subway stations 
from the information we see homeless people are much more the 
victims of crime than the perpetrators although i dont think 
thats the perception of the general public he said 
homeless people at this point are not prone to report this 
sort of crime because they dont think theyll get justice 
mary brosnahan director of the coalition for the homeless said 
part of the problem is that the city through its indifference to 
the homeless issue sends out a message that homeless people are 
disposable 
it takes as grisly a crime as this to get peoples 
attention she said this stuff is on the rise and a lot more 
mean spirited its alarming

growing republican frustration over lopsided 
democratic majorities in the house and senate hangs over a crucial 
gop meeting that could lead to a shakeup of its congressional 
campaign apparatus 
republicans yielded at least nine more house seats and a senate 
seat to the democrats in tuesdays polling top gop figures said 
the party fared better than expected given the historic midterm 
losses suffered by the party in power in the white house 
rep guy vander jagt of michigan joined other top republicans 
putting the best face on the gops midterm election performance 
but on the side vander jagt is campaigning quietly for reelection 
as chairman of the republican national campaign committee 
he has held the top rncc job for 15 years but the gop has not 
made substantial gains in the house during that time some 
republican sources had suggested he might be considering stepping 
down but he said wednesday he was lining up votes for reelection 
party sources have said that rep don sundquist of tennessee is 
challenging vander jagt 
the climate surrounding that early december organizational 
meeting is clouded by another lingering problem white house 
displeasure with ed rollins the rncc cochairman and onetime 
political director for ronald reagan 
rollins who was brought into the campaign committee two years 
ago by vander jagt got into hot water for advising republicans 
with tough antitax records and pledges to distance themselves from 
bush his advice came after the president abandoned his 
nonewtaxes pledge in the quest for a deficit reduction deal with 
majority democrats 
bushs top spokesman marlin fitzwater gave no indication 
wednesday that the rollins rift with the white house had healed 
asked during his daily news briefing if the president wanted 
rollins to stay on at the campaign committee fitzwater said ed 
rollins situation is up to the committee and thats for them to 
consider 
for his part rollins said he wasnt about to leave voluntarily 
i made a fouryear commitment to guy vander jagt because i 
felt it would take four years to change the way we run 
congressional campaigns around this country he said 
he acknowledged that his advice to republicans about shying away 
from bush was a source of irritation with the white house but 
said he continues to support the president 
i think we probably saved a couple campaigns he said i 
didnt in any way shape or form want to go to war with the white 
house and i certainly dont want to go to war with the white house 
in the future

minnesotas new governor arne carlson 
has a long record of public service and an equally lengthy slate of 
political controversy 
even the way carlson won was fraught with upheaval he lost the 
sept 11 gop primary to jon grunseth and threatened a few days 
later to mount a writein campaign for the general election but 
changed his mind 
he actually did start a writein bid when grunseth became 
embroiled in sexual impropriety allegations and finally was 
awarded the ballot spot after grunseth withdrew nine days before 
the election 
with 98 percent of precincts reporting carlson had 808182 
votes or 50 percent to 772543 votes or 48 percent for gov 
rudy perpich 
at his best carlson supporters see him as a deep thinker who 
cares passionately about public policy 
arne is a consummate politician said barbara carlson his 
first wife its his vocation his avocation he is really 
extraordinarily good at what he does the best thing about him 
is he is really committed and caring about people and he is 
committed to solving problems 
but she added hes got a terrible temper i think his worst 
fault is his terrible temper 
his critics see carlson 56 as a political brawler who shoots 
from the hip with reckless abandon 
his political career began in controversy in 1965 when he 
unseated minneapolis alderman richard franson 
franson brought an unfair campaign practices suit on the ground 
that carlson mailed out 12000 documents resembling a county tax 
statement containing an accusation that franson wanted to raise 
homeowners taxes the election was overturned but the state 
supreme court overruled the lower court on a technicality 
in 1967 carlson ran a hardhitting campaign against threeterm 
mayor arthur naftalin a former aide to the late hubert h 
humphrey naftalin narrowly won 
he conducted a campaign that was really quite unfair said 
naftalin 73 coming out of that 1967 thing ive never had a 
very positive impression of carlson 
carlson served four terms in the minnesota house before running 
for state auditor in 1978 unseating a maverick democrat whom he 
later called a lazy buffoon he was reelected in 1982 and 
1986 
his moderate stances on many issues and his prochoice position 
on abortion have aroused the ire of conservatives in his own party 
the second son of swedish immigrants carlson grew up poor in 
the bronx borough of new york city he won a scholarship to choate 
a prestigious prep school in connecticut graduated from williams 
college in massachusetts and attended graduate school at the 
university of minnesota

from his rural roots in southern nebraska 
earl benjamin ben nelson branched out on a career that led him 
to the statehouse 
nelson grew up in the small town of mccook the son of a lineman 
for a power company he became an attorney specializing in 
insurance issues and worked both for a private insurance company 
and in state government before deciding to campaign for the 
governors office 
at 49 he made it he narrowly defeated republican gov kay orr 
but his margin of victory was so slim that the absentee ballots 
could force a recount 
nelson had thought about the governors race in 1982 but said he 
changed his mind after one of his childrens teachers said it might 
not be a good time to put his family in the spotlight 
at the time nelson and his second wife diane had been married 
two years both were widowed and each had two young children 
it just wasnt my time he said 
nelson has learned to be patient 
he had to wait 42 days after the may 15 democratic gubernatorial 
primary before being named the partys nominee in one of the 
closest races in nebraska history after a recount the state board 
of canvassers declared nelson the nominee by a 42vote margin over 
bill hoppner of lincoln 
nelson has said he doesnt believe its a hindrance that he has 
never held an elected office 
it may be an advantage to come in from a business approach 
he has said 
but his business ties to first executive corp of california an 
insurance holding company criticized for its involvement in 
highrisk securities known as junk bonds became an issue in the 
campaign 
nelson who served on first executives board of directors said 
he was not responsible for the companys management and its 
investment policy 
nelson graduated from the university of nebraska in 1963 then 
received a masters degree in philosophy in 1966 
he worked for seven years for the consumer division of the 
nebraska insurance division eventually becoming supervisor of 
compliance and enforcement 
after he earned a law degree in 1970 he worked for the central 
national insurance group of omaha until 1980 except for two years 
when he was state insurance director in thengov jim exons 
cabinet 
he reentered private law practice in 1981 and in 1982 became 
executive vice president of the national association of insurance 
commissioners an organization of state insurance commissioners 
he joined an omaha law firm in 1985

the elections proved once again that money can 
be an unbeatable political asset but it doesnt guarantee 
victory 
a handful of upsets and surprising turnabouts showed money 
sometimes isnt everything when it comes to winning votes 
while the vast majority of incumbents with their superior 
fundraising ability won their races there were notable 
exceptions 
they were seen in 
minnesota where democrat paul wellstone beat republican sen 
rudy boschwitz after boschwitz spent nearly 5 million to less than 
800000 by wellstone entering the home stretch of the campaign 
wellstone said he won on shoe leather power 
florida where former sen lawton chiles ousted republican gov 
bob martinez after chiles set a 100perdonation limit on his own 
campaign contributions martinez thus had a 21 money edge over 
chiles 
kansas where democratic challenger joan finney beat gov mike 
hayden despite haydens spending about 2 million to finneys 
318000 the figures reflect their primary and general election 
spending as of last week 
oregon where democratic govelect barbara roberts raised 18 
million and beat republican attorney general david frohnmayer who 
raised 32 million as of nov 1 
nebraska where republican gov kay orr had raised 22 million 
as of last week but was ousted by democratic challenger ben nelson 
who had raised 15 million 
texas where democratic gubernatorial contender ann richards 
eked out a victory over republican oilman clayton williams despite 
williams 204 million war chest that included 8 million of his 
own money richards raised just over 11 million 
several of the 13 house members who were defeated heavily 
outspent their victorious opponents according to their spending 
reports on file with the federal election commission among them 
reps bill grant rfla roy dyson dmd john buechner rmo 
doug walgren dpa and robert kastenmeier dwis 
despite those exceptions the general pattern of cashrich 
incumbents hanging on to their seats held true 
the vast majority of house members were returned to office with 
just 13 of the 406 who sought reelection being defeated two 
california races remained undecided 
the overwhelming campaign finance advantage held by 
congressional incumbents dominated and controlled the races said 
fred wertheimer president of the citizens lobby common cause 
in north carolina sen jesse helms used more than 11 million 
to turn back a strong challenge by democrat harvey gantt who had 
raised 6 million as of midoctober 
money helped some challengers as well 
in rhode island republican gov ed diprete was outspent 21 and 
went down in defeat to democrat bruce sundlun 
but sen john kerry dmass fended off a challenge from james 
rappaport whose campaign war chest included more than 3 million 
in personal loans kerry who reported raising more than 5 million 
as of midoctober to rappaports 37 million said we have 
proven that money cant buy you a us senate seat 
the senate race in new jersey was noteworthy for christine 
whitmans strong showing against incumbent democratic sen bill 
bradley despite bradleys huge spending edge bradley spent 126 
million to her 1 million according to their campaigns but beat 
her by just two percentage points 
similarly republican rep newt gingrich of georgia barely hung 
on to his seat although he had raised 13 million by midoctober 
to 274000 for democratic challenger david worley 
such races prove that money is not always the price of 
admission special circumstances mean that voters do what they want 
to do said larry sabato professor of government at the 
university of virginia 
worley had problems with money he might have been able to 
beat gingrich easily with a bigger war chest said sabato 
in california where the governors race was the top priority

the next time president bush hits the campaign 
trail it will be for himself and many analysts suggest he can 
take little comfort from tuesdays midterm election results 
bush could even face a primary challenge from within his own 
party with republicans still splintered after this years bruising 
battle over taxes and the budget 
but then it all depends on whos doing the talking 
let me tell you something president bush wasnt on the ballot 
yesterday if he was he would have won big asserted charlie 
black spokesman for the republican national committee 
if either new york mayor mario cuomo or new jersey democratic 
sen bill bradley had run against bush on tuesday they would have 
had their clocks cleaned black said 
but another republican hardline conservative richard viguerie 
saw it differently if he bush had been on the ballot yesterday 
against a credible democrat he would have suffered a massive 
defeat 
bushs only recourse if he wants to be reelected in 1992 
viguerie suggested is to clean house get rid of most of his 
wall street country club advisers and bring in some conservatives 
who are in touch with grassroots america 
even so most mainstream politicians and analysts seem to agree 
that the midterm elections should not be seen as a referendum on 
bushs presidency but many say there are lessons in it that will 
have a bearing on the 1992 race 
white house and other gop strategists clearly are sifting 
through the results of the elections as they focus their sights on 
1992 
the most serious problem bush could face is a primary challenge 
from within his own party with conservatives still angry about 
bushs abandonment of his nonewtaxes pledge this looms as a real 
possibility many analysts suggest 
i think there is likely to be a primary challenge from the 
right said norman ornstein a political analyst at the american 
enterprise institute the question is whether itll be a minor 
annoyance like that john ashbrook provided nixon in 1972 or more 
like what ronald reagan provided for president ford in 1976 
taking him to within an inch of his political life 
republican consultant john sears who engineered reagans nearly 
successful 1976 challenge to ford said bushs main problem now 
is that hes lost some of his credibility in the last month 
he has got to be sure in the next couple years that when he 
takes a position he sticks with it sears said otherwise 
hell end 1992 in a bad position people already dont trust 
congress and they dont want to not trust their president 
lyn nofziger another former reagan aide blames bushs switch 
on taxes for the losses the party did incur in congress it means 
hes got some fencemending to do he cant afford to alienate 
people any further hes got to get hold of things again 
the base that elected bush in 1988 is really kind of 
shattered nofziger said 
ed rollins whom bush has tried to get fired as cochairman of 
the national republican congressional committee said bush 
obviously has had a little setback in the polls but hes still 
the most popular president going into midterm elections in modern 
times 
i think theres tremendous opportunity to get ready for 92 
with strong leadership the next two years said rollins whose 
memo suggesting house republicans distance themselves from bush on 
taxes drew presidential ire 
for the record the white house was being blase about the 
outcome of tuesdays midterm elections 
you win some and you lose some we campaigned hard in texas 
and lost campaigned hard in california and won it goes back and 
forth said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said the oneseat republican loss in the senate and 
the nineseat loss in the house means little actual change in 
congress 
and he declined to see any message in the election results as a 
result of bushs turnabout on tax increases 
still fitzwater noted nobody likes taxes generally its 
better politically to be against taxes you dont win points by 
raising taxes thats been clear 
theres little doubt that the elections leave bush in a weakened 
position with respect to congress but fitzwater said the veto will 
remain a primary legislative tool for the president 
bush is going to be marginally weaker in congress said 
david mason an analyst with the conservative heritage foundation 
and mason said if he cant get a more defined message in 92 
than he did in this year hes going to have a problem 
if we have a recession between now and 92 the economy will 
be the overriding issue mason added a view echoed by nearly 
all analysts 
meanwhile the white house is playing coy on the subject of 
bushs reelection efforts hasnt declared yet fitzwater 
said hasnt said

the tempestuous tenure of vishwanath 
pratap singh as head of indias first coalition government started 
with enormous goodwill lurched through a series of crises and 
ended in public invective 
in 11 months as prime minister singh found little time to 
tackle indias endemic problems poverty separatist revolts by 
embittered minorities and the peoples growing feeling of isolation 
from the government 
instead he got bogged down in feuds within his janata dal party 
and the constant need to appease partners in his unwieldy 
coalition 
singhs defeat in a confidence vote in parliament on wednesday 
night came amid allegations he had used the ageold divisions in 
india caste and religion to try to further his own political 
interests 
when singh and his hurriedly assembled national front coalition 
prevented former prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party from 
winning november 1989 elections he was hailed as a crusading angel 
out to end patronage and corruption 
the coalition formed an unlikely government with support from a 
rightwing hindu party and a leftwing group who barely concealed 
their antipathy for each other singh also had to contend with 
feuding within his own party which was riven by factions and had 
at least two other men who fancied the top job 
nevertheless he received a good amount of public support in his 
early days in office 
we join the people in extending our good wishes to mr vp 
singh said a february editorial in the economic times he not 
only deserves but requires the nations good wishes in tackling the 
tremendous tasks that lie ahead 
just days after singh took the oath of office on dec 2 trouble 
brewed in the moslemmajority state of jammu and kashmir moslem 
separatists escalating their struggle to secede from mostly hindu 
india kidnapped the daughter of singhs home minister and launched 
a cycle of violent protests and assassinations 
the governments crackdown on the kashmiri movement represent 
one of the darker spots of singhs tenure kashmir once indias 
showplace for tourists is now fully in the grip of the separatist 
campaign 
in punjab state scene of a lingering rebellion by sikh 
militants singh started out promisingly he made a trip to 
amritsar the sikh holy city within a week of taking office and 
waded through crowds of sikhs in an open jeep disregarding the 
pleas of worried security men 
three months later his party piloted a bill through parliament 
postponing elections in punjab for six months because of the 
violence another sixmonth postponement was sought in october 
there is no difference between this government and gandhi a 
sikh member of parliament said at the time 
this year the number of killings by sikh militants in punjab 
has surpassed 2650 higher than any single year in gandhis 
fiveyear tenure 
secessionist sentiment has also flared in the northeastern state 
of assam where belligerent tribes want independence 
meanwhile the national economy is in a woeful condition 
gasoline prices have been raised twice this year inflation is 
rampant and the economic crunch caused by the persian gulf crisis 
has hit india harder than most other nations 
through all of this singh waged a running feud with deputy 
prime minister devi lal who was accused of exemplifying the 
cronyism singh had vowed to eliminate singh forced the issue out 
into the open in july by threatening to resign his party backed 
him and he ousted devi lal 
but within weeks singh pushed through what many saw as a 
divisive plan to strengthen his power base he made into law an 
affirmative action program that reserved almost half of all 
government jobs for lowercaste hindus 
at least 150 people committed suicide or died in protests 
against the law critics said singh was using it to gain favor 
among lower castes who form a majority of voters among indias 880 
million people 
the supreme court temporarily eased the situation by blocking 
the job quota plan while it studied its legality 
but then fundamentalist hindus who had been threatening for two 
years to build a temple on the site of a mosque in the remote 
northern town of ayodhya began whipping up hindu sentiment over 
the campaign 
the issue aggravated tensions between hindus who make up 82 
percent of indias population and moslems who comprise 12 
percent 
at least 22 hindus were killed by police in two attempts to 
storm the shrine and hindumoslem riots have claimed the lives of 
more than 340 other people in the past two weeks 
singh said he would uphold indias tradition of secularism and 
prevent hindus from taking over the mosque it was a laudable 
stand but critics saw it as an attempt to woo moslem votes 
in the end the 59yearold singh was brought down by the 
combination of a split in his own party and the withdrawal of 
support by the rightwing hindu fundamentalist bharatiya janata 
party 
singh has one thing in common with gandhi whom he served as 
defense and finance minister before their fallingout both were 
called mr clean at the start of their terms both resigned 
amid allegations of dirty politicking 
of singh the sunday observer newspaper said last month 
history will remember him as one who willfully sought indias 
social dismemberment in the crass pursuit of votes nearly a year 
after he came to power on the vote of just onefourth of the 
electorate vp singh has left the economy in tatters and society 
in ruins is it possible to recall even one laudable step the 
government has taken

a us government program that sends chinese on 
american tours is back in official chinese favor a us embassy 
spokesman said today underscoring the muchimproved relations of 
recent months 
though tensions persist both sides appear determined to stress 
pragmatic cooperation and put aside ideological and human rights 
issues 
the chinese government never formally blocked the us 
international visitor program which has given more than 600 
selected chinese a brief taste of us society since 1979 
but since june 4 1989 when the chinese army killed hundreds of 
unarmed civilians in crushing a prodemocracy movement about half 
the chinese invited by the program have begged off apparently 
under official chinese pressure 
the west had reacted to the army assault with outrage imposing 
sanctions on china 
us embassy spokesman sheridan w bell said today that chinese 
sources recently informed the embassy that the chinese government 
is now encouraging people selected for international visitor 
program grants to take part in the program there was no official 
chinese notification of the change he said 
bell said it was too soon to see any improvement in the chinese 
acceptance rate but added we hope this will lead to a full 
resumption of the program 
we view this development as a positive step and believe it 
reflects a renewed chinese government realization that such 
exchanges are highly beneficial both to the chinese participants 
and to our two nations he said 
contacts between the two governments have reached a postjune 
1989 high in the past few months as the united states has sought 
chinese cooperation in the persian gulf crisis 
as a permanent member of the un security council chinas vote 
has been needed on resolutions demanding iraq withdraw from kuwait 
although china had good relations with iraq it has supported 
all resolutions so far earning it reacceptance by western nations 
president bush has helped opposing moves in congress to punish 
china for its crackdown by withdrawing its mostfavorednation 
trade status 
china has in turn freed more than 800 jailed political activists 
over the past year and allowed its most famous dissident fang 
lizhi to leave the country after he spent a year in hiding in the 
us embassy 
after a oneyear halt china also resumed participation in the 
fulbright program this year sixteen american professors were sent 
to china to teach and do research and 16 chinese professors went 
to the united states 
the international visitor program run by the us information 
agency at a cost of about 10 million a year brings about 2800 
people from around the world to the united states annually 
program officials began inviting chinese participants after 
uschinese relations were established in 1979 before the june 
1989 crackdown 70 to 80 chinese were taking part each year 
the visitors participate in programs related to their fields of 
work touring us schools businesses hospitals or government 
institutions

a voting analyst says turnout in elections 
this week appears to be near the 1986 level the lowest in nearly 
half a century 
analyst curtis gans said tuesdays turnout was up in 26 states 
and the district of columbia and down in the rest 
in the 1986 midterm election 364 percent of those eligible to 
vote actually went to the polls the lowest percentage since 1942 
after inspecting returns from all 50 states and the district gans 
estimated the turnout again was 364 percent on tuesday 
this year maine has the higest turnout at 5518 percent gans 
reported based on nearly complete returns 
other states with strong showings for an offyear were montana 
at 5461 percent north dakota 5324 percent and minnesota at 
5251 percent 
the biggest gainer was massachusetts where a hotly contested 
race for governor boosted turnout 1191 percentage points to 4932 
percent 
on the other end of the scale mississippi managed only 169 
percent turnout there the only statewide contest found sen thad 
cochran unopposed 
gans said the 169 percent figure was likely to be revised 
upward when all ballots are counted but he could not guess by how 
much 
tennessee managed only a 2248 percent turnout with 2248 
percent in virginia 28 percent in south carolina and 2903 percent 
for west virginia 
biggest declines in turnout from four years ago were in idaho 
down 143 percentage points tennessee down 137 points and 
mississippi down 118 points 
by party democratic turnout declined by 045 percentage points 
and republican turnout increased by the same share according to 
gans director of the nonpartisan committee for the study of the 
american electorate 
the number of voters choosing independent or others jumped 177 
percentage points however the vote for independents was boosted 
by the election of independent governors in alaska and connecticut 
and an independent house member in vermont

the new heads of infotechnology inc the 
troubled parent of financial news network and united press 
international say they will recommend selling the companies 
principal operations 
alan j hirschfield and allan r tessler appointed cochief 
executives in a management shakeup on oct 24 said wednesday they 
have retained the investment banking firm wertheim schroder and co 
for the purchase negotiations hoping to conclude sales contracts 
by the end of the year 
we believe the prices that fnn and infotech businesses are 
anticipated to command could satisfy the companies financial 
obligations they said in a statement 
they said they were asking banks and creditors for a 90day 
moratorium on payments fnn has outstanding about 495 million in 
bank loan principal and approximately 88 million in equipment 
lease obligations infotech has outstanding about 207 million in 
bank loan principal 
united press international had already said it was seeking a 
buyer but on monday the news agency said it would have to 
liquidate if members of the wire service guild reject its proposal 
to cut wages by 35 percent for 90 days a similar pay cut for 
management staff was announced last week 
as a result of recent contract cancellations and other ongoing 
factors upi currently has a substantial negative monthly cash 
flow hirschfield and tessler said wednesday it has been 
necessary to make some painful decisions regarding layoffs and 
reduced compensation to continuing employees in order for upi to 
remain in business until suitable purchasers are identified 
the news agency has declined to specify how many people are 
losing their jobs in the continuing layoffs 
financial news network provides business sports and market data 
to cable systems in the united states and canada fnn and 
infotechnology collectively own 51 percent of the learning channel 
and infotechnology also has investments in other media 
communications and biotechnology companies 
hirschfield and tessler who replaced earl brian as the head of 
fnn and infotechnology said they were distressed by many of the 
unfounded rumors surrounding current events at the company 
first and foremost any and all allegations concerning fraud 
or misappropriation of funds at the companies have been and are 
being taken extremely seriously by the boards of directors and 
have been or are being thoroughly investigated by the companies 
outside auditors they said 
in addition the companies are cooperating with the securities 
and exchange commissions inquiries that we have previously 
disclosed 
they said only one case had been found in which company funds 
were improperly paid out that incident previously disclosed by 
fnn involved the receipt by fnns former chief financial officer 
of compensation payments which were not properly authorized in 
the approximate amount of 795000 
the financial officer c steven bolen was fired last month

gary franks is the first black 
republican elected to the house in 58 years and his political 
agenda probably wont appeal to many minorities 
the 37yearold real estate developer opposes racial quotas and 
he is a fiscal conservative 
from the conservativeliberal perspective theres a major 
difference between me and my future colleagues in the house of 
representatives who are black franks said following his victory 
in tuesdays election 
he is an opponent of the 1990 civil rights reform act which was 
vetoed by president bush the son of a mill worker franks won a 
scholarship to yale and worked for two fortune 500 companies before 
starting his own real estate firm 
republicans were delighted 
its a great win said gary koops a spokesman for the 
national republican congressional committee not only have we 
held a republican open seat and elected a strong new congressman 
whos a republican it also broadens the republican party 
it was a bright spot amid gloomy news in congressional races 
the gop lost at least nine house seats 
franks defeated liberal democrat toby moffett a former 
fourterm congressman seeking to make a political comeback 
despite a sometimes chilly reception from local black leaders 
and organizations during the campaign franks carried the black 
precincts of his home city waterbury and he insisted that while 
opposed to racial quotas he is procivil rights to the hilt 
ive had crosses burnt in front of my house when i was nine 
years old said franks who was born and raised in waterbury i 
had a dead opossum put in my mailbox which i had the misfortune to 
open with a note saying youre next 
still franks hardly rivals jesse jackson for liberal 
credentials that remain popular in the black community 
for some time you have only heard from black democrats from a 
national perspective now for the first time you will hear from a 
black republican in the house said franks an alderman in 
waterbury 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
criticized franks on the civil rights issue and withheld its 
endorsement and during the campaign two prominent waterbury black 
leaders and members of the republican party endorsed moffett 
over franks about 4 percent of the population is black in franks 
congressional district 
moffett 46 congratulated franks 
lets understand that he has made history moffett said 
franks becomes the first black from connecticut ever to sit in 
congress the last black republican in the us house was oscar de 
priest who represented illinois from 1929 to 1935 he last won 
reelection in 1932 
the win was a highly soughtafter prize that drew more than 
50000 in national gop aid a visit by president bush to the 
district and a reception for the candidate at the white house when 
word came through of franks victory bush telephoned the winner 
with his congratulations 
with franks conservative agenda national democrats arent 
concerned that his election will mark the beginning of a drain on 
one of their most dependable voting blocs 
i dont expect youll see minorities flocking to the 
republican party because of gary franks unless he changes his 
philosophy which i dont expect hell do said howard schloss a 
spokesman for the democratic congressional campaign committee 
still franks doesnt plan to champion a gop agenda 
my no1 priority is to serve my constituents franks said 
franks won the seat vacated by republican rep john rowland who 
lost a gubernatorial bid to independent lowell weicker

urban sprawl and longdistance commuting have 
helped boost population growth in rural america but new government 
figures show the number of farm people continues to dwindle 
the farm population dropped by 150000 to an estimated 4801000 
in 1989 a decrease described as not a statistically significant 
difference from 1988 
last years farm population was reported at 19 percent of the 
us total of more than 2482 million people the smallest share on 
record 
in 1980 the 605 million living on farms represented 27 
percent of the 2217 million people in the united states at the 
turn of the century the 1900 census showed 299 million living on 
farms 393 percent of the population of 76 million 
the annual report was released wednesday by the census bureau of 
the commerce department and the economic research service of the 
agriculture department 
overall the rural population was estimated at more than 662 
million up from just under 648 million people in the 1988 survey 
the rural population includes those in living in the open 
countryside and small towns large cities and their suburbs plus 
towns of 2500 or more are considered urban 
as used in the report the farm population consists of those 
living on farms in rural areas but does not include the relatively 
few who live on farms in urban areas a farm is defined as a place 
that sold agricultural products worth 1000 or more in the 
previous year 
the farm population definition is based on residence only many 
people reside on farms but do no agricultural work and many 
farmers and farm employees do not reside on farms 
felicia leclere of the economic research service one of the 
reports authors said there were no real surprises in this years 
figures 
the things that have come out have been longterm trends and 
none of them has been surprising she said in a telephone 
interview 
leclere cautioned that all the figures are subject to revision 
when the official 1990 census results are available next year she 
is confident that the annual figures are on track however 
officials have noted the increase in rural population rising 
by 12 million people since 1950 and point out that urban sprawl 
and a willingness of city workers to commute greater distances have 
been important factors 
one possible effect of the 1990 census is a reclassification of 
some of these distant areas from rural to urban that could show up 
later as a slowdown in rural growth 
the report said the largest share of the rural population about 
44 percent continues to be in the south that has been the case 
since the first us census was taken in 1790 
although the regional distribution of the rural population 
changed only slightly in the last 40 years the regional 
distribution of the farm population shifted markedly the report 
said 
in 1950 onethird of all farm people lived in the midwest and 
slightly more than half in the south 
a rapid decline in the southern farm population rather than 
growth in the midwests farm population reversed the regional 
rankings the report said half of the total farm population 
now lives in the midwest and less than a third lives in the 
south 
other observations in the report included 
farm people continue to be older than the nonfarm population 
in general with a median of 38 years in 1989 compared with 325 
years for nonfarm residents a median age means half of the people 
are older half younger nonfarm refers to urban plus rural 
nonfarm people 
last year 974 percent of farm residents were white and 18 
percent were black compared with 84 percent white and 125 percent 
black in the nonfarm population the remainder were described as 
of other races 
only 29 percent of the farm residents were of hispanic origin 
nearly 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were 
married and living with spouses in 1989 compared with 554 percent 
of the nonfarm people

a black sect that won civic honors for renovating 
innercity buildings fighting drugs and operating businesses under 
its charismatic leader built its empire on extortion firebombings 
and murder prosecutors charged 
a federal grand jury accused the groups leader yahweh ben 
yahweh and 16 followers of involvement in the slayings of 14 
people including socalled white devils who were killed to 
gain entrance to the sects inner circle 
some victims were decapitated others ears were cut off us 
attorney dexter lehtinen said 
yahweh and several members of the sect were arrested in early 
morning raids wednesday 
any dissenter was subject to extreme violence including 
murder to maintain control of the organization lehtinen said 
the sect also used random violence as a ritual membership 
initiation rite he said 
the indictment accuses those named of racketeering conspiracy 
and extortion from 1981 to 1987 
yahweh 55 born hulon mitchell jr regulated all aspects of 
his followers lives including when and how they had sex 
sometimes ordering women members to his own bed lehtinen said 
the yahwehs consider themselves the true chosen people and 
yahweh ben yahweh who claims to be the son of god and whose name 
is hebrew for god son of god had in the past referred to all 
whites as devils 
recently the yahwehs who have claimed about 10000 members 
diminished their antiwhite rhetoric and became known as hard 
workers who built a modest empire of 27 small businesses and 
properties their combined tax value has been assessed at 3 
million but their market value is believed to be more 
yahweh was arrested by the fbi in a new orleans hotel three 
others were arrested in lafayette la his top aide judith israel 
or linda gaines was taken into custody in atlanta and another 
arrest was made in durham nc 
seven members were arrested at the sects temple of love in 
miami 
the groups enterprising spirit strict religious practices 
promotion of family values and strong opposition to drugs drew 
praise from local officials 
mayor xavier suarez recently attended a ribboncutting at a 
yahweh store with the sects leader who has also received civic 
honors for rebuilding the inner city a proclamation declared oct 
7 yahweh ben yahweh day in miami 
but the indictment said the businesses were built in part by the 
threat of violence and by extortion of contributions from reluctant 
black neighborhoods the charges include firebombing homes after 
people opposed fundraising efforts 
the sect first became widely known in 1986 when it took over a 
druginfested opalocka apartment complex evicting residents and 
promising to make it a crackfree haven 
two residents who resisted were shot to death and sect member 
robert rozier a former pro football player was convicted in the 
slayings 
rozier who could have faced the electric chair agreed to 
provide much of the evidence against yahweh in exchange for a 
22year sentence sect lawyer ellis rubin said 
most of the slaying victims listed in the indictment were yawheh 
members who left the group or opposed their leader some were shot 
others decapitated and some beaten to death 
seven white men were killed by those applying to join the 
brotherhood a secret group within the sect yahweh ordered the 
ears cut off some victims as proof they were killed lehtinen said 
rubin who has accused authorities of persecuting the group 
said he was surprised by wednesdays raids he said he told 
authorities that sect members would surrender after the 
longexpected indictment was handed up 
in washington fbi director william sessions denied there was 
any harassment or racism involved in the prosecution 
rubin said he would appear with yahweh at a new orleans hearing 
scheduled for friday four of the 17 defendants were still being 
sought

voters elected independent governors in 
connecticut and alaska in a historic warning to republicans and 
democrats that they arent the only choices in american politics 
but experts are saying the winners are not true independents in 
that if they hope to get anything done they wont stay independent 
for long 
in connecticut former us sen lowell p weicker jr completed 
a political comeback tuesday with a narrow victory in a threeway 
field in alaska former gov walter hickel was the winner in 
another close threeway race 
their victories mean two independent governors will be in office 
simultaneously for the first time in us history 
both men are former republicans who left the party after falling 
out of favor weicker because he was considered too liberal 
hickel because he was viewed as too conservative theyll lead 
states whose legislatures are still partycontrolled 
hickel said an antigovernment feeling among voters carried him 
back into office i think alaskans just want a change they want 
to have more of a say in government he said 
weicker said bypassing party politics will make his state more 
efficient 
we didnt ask or bequeath upon any particular party to run our 
business for us he said we can run it better than anybody 
else can 
weickers independent attitude surfaced in 197374 while serving 
on the senate watergate committee he was one of president nixons 
most outspoken critics later he also was arrested outside the 
south african embassy in washington during an antiapartheid 
protest 
nixon appointed hickel interior secretary in 1968 and fired him 
in 1970 because of what hickel says were industry pressures hickel 
also had written nixon a letter chiding him for failing to listen 
to americas youth protesting the vietnam war 
weicker ran under the banner of a connecticut party excluding 
his running mate only one legislative candidate joined in and he 
lost 
hickel adopted the banner of the alaska independence party an 
established third party that wants to make alaska an independent 
country it was a move of convenience since hickel ignores the 
partys independence plank 
the former gop mavericks are making history by shunning 
majorparty affiliation and winning but it is widely felt they 
could not have won without their high namerecognition and their 
former majorparty ties 
the message is very guarded said william schneider a 
political scientist at the american enterprise institute it 
helps if youre a known quantity for a third party to succeed a 
major party has to split 
experts tended to agree that the independent victories send a 
warning to republicans and democrats 
these are more than blips said james reichley an expert on 
party politics with the brookings institution theyre indicators 
that neither of the major parties are attracting voters 
in another sign of anger at the two established parties 
socialist candidate bernard sanders won vermonts congressional 
seat defeating republican and democratic candidates 
our small state might go down in history as the leading state 
in a political revolution which takes power away from the 
multinational corporations and the wealthy and gives it back to the 
people sanders said 
the independent governorselect face the prospect of lonely 
times in office weicker for example will be unable to file a 
bill without legislative sponsorship 
reichley predicted that both would move back into a close if 
not official relationship with the gop 
and as so often happens in politics a feature that can help a 
candidate get elected can often make governing more difficult 
they have no party they can call on allies who will support 
them if they get in trouble schneider said thats a big 
problem without a political party youre on your own its sink

the magellan spacecraft has found 
evidence that oceansized floods of molten rock once inundated more 
than half the surface of venus 
nasa scientists said they dont yet know if there was one great 
outpouring of lava from cracks in venus or a series of smaller 
flows each hundreds of thousands of square miles that engulfed 
parts of venus at different times 
the scientists at the space agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
reported the findings wednesday 
magellan uses radar to make pictures of cloudcovered venus the 
spacecraft was launched from space shuttle atlantis in may 1989 
went into orbit around venus on aug 10 and formally began making 
maps and pictures of the planet on sept 15 
geologist steve saunders magellans chief scientist said he 
favors the view that the lava gushed out of cracks called vents in 
a global set of eruptions that happened all at once maybe 400 
million years ago 
brown university geologist and magellan scientist jim head said 
however the evidence is incomplete 
theres no question that the vast majority of the surface of 
venus has been formed by lava flows and volcanic activity he 
said but the question is did it all happen catastrophically 
the lava covers roughly 60 percent of the planet according to 
saunders 
saunders said he began to suspect venus was subject to such 
catastrophic volcanic activity because magellans pictures of venus 
show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than 
earths moon and because the ones we find are all relatively 
fresh 
that suggests theres a process of very widespread volcanism 
that occurs from time to time that destroys all the craters and 
everything else he said 
saunders said venus widespread lava flooding was similar to 
but much larger than vast lava deposits such as indias deccan 
traps and the pacific northwests columbia river basalts 
the deccan lava floods happened when earths crust split open as 
india drifted away from africa about 66 million years ago allowing 
huge volumes of molten rock to pour onto the landscape 
the columbia river basalts which formed in massive eruptions 
roughly 12 million to 20 million years ago cover much of the 
pacific northwest east of the cascade range 
magellans 744 million mapmaking mission was suspended oct 26 
because the sun is lined up almost directly between venus and the 
earth impairing communications between controllers and the 
spacecraft the suspension also was meant to allow engineers time 
to fix magellans wobbling solar power panels 
nasa hopes to resume mapping saturday

the food and drug administration has banned 
223 ingredients in overthecounter drugs on grounds manufacturers 
have offered no proof they were effective for problems they were 
supposed to treat 
the ingredients range from pine tar in dandruff fighters to 
dehydrated garlic in digestive aids to aspirin in medications for 
external use 
the fda action wednesday does not ban the ingredients entirely 
just in certain uses for example aspirin may still be used in 
products for pain relief taken internally because it has been 
shown to be effective pain reliever 
the overthecounter drug industry said most of the ingredients 
already had been withdrawn but some familiar drugstore and 
supermarket products will be affected 
for example tegrin lotion sold for use against psoriasis may 
no longer contain allantoin also packers shampoo and soap may not 
contain pine tar and donnagel used to treat diarrhea may no 
longer include atropine sulfate hyoscyamine sulfate and 
scopolamine hydrobromide 
the ban becomes effective in six months the agency said none of 
the ingredients posed a safety problem in any of the banned uses 
the ruling is part of an 18yearlong review of about 300000 
nonprescription products that were on the market when a new took 
effect in 1972 
as part of its effort to complete that review the agency last 
week proposed to ban 111 drug ingredients in overthecounter diet 
products most companies have stopped using those ingredients 
industry officials said 
manufacturers have been on notice since may that the agency 
wanted to ban the list of 223 ingredients and most have 
reformulated their products said jack walden a spokesman of the 
nonprescription drug manufacturers association 
overwhelmingly this is a housekeeping action he said 
the industry long ago came into compliance it affects 
products now on the market very very little

the late emperor hirohito said shortly after world 
war ii that he had not opposed attacking the united states because 
he feared civil war might otherwise break out in japan newly 
released documents indicate 
in an eighthour conversation with aides about his role before 
and during the war hirohito also rejected the japanese tradition 
that reveres the emperor as a living god japanese media reported 
on wednesday citing the transcript 
the conversation was held in spring 1946 when allied occupation 
forces were considering whether to charge the emperor with war 
crimes the discussions appear to have been part of preparations by 
aides for a possible trial 
the japan broadcasting corp said the transcripts were recorded 
by hirenari terasaki a former diplomat terasaki also translated 
for the emperor in some of his meetings with douglas macarthur 
supreme commander of the allies during the postwar occupation of 
japan 
the broadcasting corporation said that when terasaki died the 
transcripts of the conversation were given to his daughter mariko 
terasaki miller who lives in the united states and recently 
rediscovered the documents 
if i had tried to veto the beginning of the pacific war a 
coup detat would have occurred and my trusted aides would have 
been killed my life also could not have been guaranteed 
hirohito said he was referring to fears of an uprising in japans 
powerful military 
even if that were acceptable a violent civil war would have 
occurred resulting in a tragedy several times worse than world 
war ii and leading to circumstances that the war would not have 
ended i believe that japan would have been destroyed kyodo news 
service quoted the transcripts as saying 
he appeared to be referring to the possibility of a civil 
conflict between those japanese who favored going to war and those 
who did not 
japanese officials met and decided to attack the united states 
shortly before the bombing of pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 
the radio network quoted hirohito as saying he did not halt the 
war later because he feared the public might believe the government 
had given in to the united states despite japans strong army and 
navy 
before he died in january 1989 hirohito made few public 
statements about his role during the war however he had 
consistently said he did not intervene in the war plans because he 
could not as a constitutional monarch interfere in decisions made 
by the government 
to my knowledge i have not heard him say that refer to a 
possible coup before said otis cary a professor at kyotos 
doshisha university and an acquaintance of the emperor 
in contrast cary said hirohito took a strong role in 1936 in 
putting down a coup attempt within the army 
but by december 1941 the situation was so tight the military 
had complete hold on the government cary said in a telephone 
interview the emperor just held his peace 
the transcript quoted hirohito as telling the five aides that it 
was troubling for him to be referred to as a living god 
biologically i have the same body as ordinary people so i am 
not a god kyodo quoted the transcripts as saying 
although hirohito is considered to have renounced his divinity 
in a new years message in 1946 japanese rightists have maintained 
he did not explicitly deny his prewar status as a shinto god in the 
japanese translation of those remarks the comments were originally 
written in english and probably intended primarily for western 
consumption 
critics charge that next weeks enthronement ceremonies for 
emperor akihito hirohitos successor will violate japans postwar 
constitution by once again linking the emperor with the shinto 
religion akihitos formal coronation has been delayed more than a 
year by an official period of mourning

those for dick tracy the back to the future films and an 
unfinished sylvester stallone movie oscar 
the blaze on the backlot tuesday night came within several 
hundred yards of the amblin entertainment complex a sprawling and 
luxurious sante festyle adobe showpiece where spielberg robert 
zemeckis and other directors work 
if the wind had shifted we would have been in big trouble 
here amblin spokesman marvin levy said gusts up to 50 mph 
helped spread the fire 
when homeowners flee flames they grab pets photo albums and 
irreplaceable documents when filmmakers do it they take 
screenplays artwork and other creations 
spielberg and his staff along with other filmmmakers made a 
dash through offices before getting out levy said spielberg 
focused his efforts on preproduction work for hook a tale 
based on the peter pan character capt hook 
dustin hoffman is slated for the title role with robin williams 
scheduled to costar 
oscar a 1930sera gangster comedy featuring stallone as a 
mobster hounded by his father to go straight had finished filming 
for the day before the fire broke out 
we lost the entire set and are going to shut down for a week 
to 10 days we have to build new york street somewhere said 
publicist spooky stevens we also lost 21 vintage cars the 
camera equipment props every bit of wardrobe 
the guard michael j huston 40 of tujunga was booked for 
investigation of arson and jailed on 1 million bail 
he was on duty when the fire started and after questioning he 
was arrested early today at the studio said sheriffs deputy 
rich erickson we wont disclose a possible motive 
how the fire was set also was not disclosed 
huston had been on the job one month said dan slusser general 
manager of universal city studios 
bob gale writer and producer of the back to the future 
films told his assistant at amblin to collect some artwork and a 
computer disk containing script revisions for princess of mars 
gale lamented the loss of the back to the future sets where 
michael j fox rode a futuristic skateboard it was one of many 
popular stops on the universal studios tour 
theres nothing there gale said i couldnt believe it 
youre just looking at this big expanse of nothing it was a 
shock 
zemeckis who directed all three back to the future films 
and who framed roger rabbit heard of the fire as he sat down 
for a dinner party 
i called my office and the phone machine was working so i knew 
there had to be a pretty good chance the building was ok he 
said

visitors got to see scorched sets from films like to kill a 
mockingbird the sting and tvs kojak

the 12th and final us game in the championship 
chess match between garry kasparov and anatoly karpov ended in a 
draw leaving the pair tied 66 in points as the duel moves to 
france for up to 12 more games 
each player won one game in new york the 10 other games 
including wednesday nights ended in draws 
only once in the previous 33 world championship matches have 
there been so many draws in the first 12 games in 1978 when 
karpov beat viktor korchnoi 
the championship resumes nov 24 in lyons france the first 
player to gain 12 points wins the championship and 17 million of 
a 3 million purse a win is worth a point a draw a halfpoint 
grandmaster patrick wolff who did commentary during the match 
said the biggest surprise in the new york portion of the match was 
the inconsistency 
the first five games could be considered the best opening 
quintet in world championship history wolff said games six 
through nine were terrible and the final three were a slight 
improvement he said 
wolff also said chess experts had expected kasparov the 
defending champion to take a substantial lead but karpov 
surprised them 
its very unclear whos better now its getting hot said 
international chess master norman weinstein 
danny martin a member of a new york city chess club said the 
draws were expected 
its what happens when the best play the best he said 
chess lovers paid 25 to 100 for tickets to watch the games in 
the hudson theater or on video monitors in the adjoining hotel 
macklowe where grandmasters explained the moves in several

former contra rebels and their 
supporters have cut off the isolated southeast with roadblocks in a 
widening protest demanding the government deliver the land and 
other aid it promised the exguerrillas 
last week excontras began erecting blockades on the only road 
that connects the southeast with other parts of the country by 
wednesday they had gained the support of villagers along the 
route 
the blockades have barred trucks carrying produce grains milk 
and beef to markets in juigalpa and managua causing mounting 
losses to farmers in this rich agricultural and cattlegrowing 
region 
at least 20 former guerrillas staged a peaceful occupation 
wednesday of interior ministry offices in juigalpa the midpoint on 
the strategic rama road between managua and the atlantic coast city 
of bluefields which is 150 miles east of the capital 
riot police ousted the occupiers later in the day 
but in bluefields the city hall a roman catholic church and a 
relay station for national television occupied nonviolently on 
tuesday remained in control of excontras protesting against 
president violeta chamorros administration 
to publicize their complaints a group of demobilized rebels 
have also occupied managuas cathedral since monday 
the former rebels have erected 14 roadblocks on the rama road in 
the past week gaining increasing support from villagers as 
displeasure with the sixmonthold administration speads 
throughout the region 
the roadblocks reach as far as la palma some 75 miles east of 
managua 
we are not contras but we support the boys said efrain 
rodriguez 45 a farmer from la palma violeta has got to deliver 
on what she promised and these piricuacos have got to go 
piricuacos is an indian word meaning curs an insult 
opponents throw at the sandinistas whom mrs chamorro defeated in 
feb 25 elections the sandinistas who ruled for 10 years remain 
the countrys most powerful political force 
former members of the usbacked contra rebel force that fought 
the sandinistas for nine years are demanding that they be given the 
aid promised in exchange for their having disbanded and returned to 
civilian life 
they also want the sandinista peoples army and the sandinista 
police dissolved 
in a process that ended in june about 20000 rebels accepted 
amnesty and turned in their weapons they were promised land food 
medicines and materials to build simple homes in the countryside 
like the exrebels antisandinista civilians complain of 
harassment by police and soldiers most of whom are sandinista 
sympathizers 
we want to see what the president promised we want to see the 
army changed said wenceslao centeno 19 also of la palma 
they army threaten us all the time this is not democracy 
interior minister carlos hurtado on wednesday invited the mayors 
of the blockaded region to meet with him in managua today to 
resolve the crisis 
mayors of eight towns in the region are backing the former conta 
fighters the fact they belong to the 14party coalition that 
helped bring mrs chamorro to power indicates the extent of 
discontent with her government 
villagers allow only reporters and emergency medical cases to 
cross the roadblocks 
were ready for them to attack said a woman at a roadblock 
near la palma we have no weapons but we are ready to die were 
not going to let the government continue ignoring us 
an attempt earlier this week to advance the blockade 10 miles 
west of la palma was frustrated when police took over the entrance 
to juigalpa the most important town in the region 
juigalpa riot police showered tear gas on about 200 people 
monday and beat them with nightsticks to disperse the protesters 
who had started pushing large rocks across the highway four people 
were reported hospitalized with injuries 
since then police and rmy units have set up roadblocks of

imelda marcos has agreed to give the 
philippines 60 percent of the money she has in five hong kong banks 
if the government drops a lawsuit against the former first lady in 
california an official said today 
david castro chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government said president corazon aquinos administration will 
drop the 5 billion suit if its share of the hong kong money 
exceeds 200 million 
mrs marcos would admit no guilt to charges of embezzlement 
if the agreement is carried out it would be the first known 
settlement between the government and the marcoses 
castros agency has had little success recovering the billions 
the government claims mrs marcos and her late husband former 
president ferdinand marcos stole during his 20year 
administration 
castro told reporters he would leave later in the day for los 
angeles where he is to appear in federal court friday to explain 
the planned settlement 
mrs marcoss lawyer james p linn spoke of the arrangement in 
los angeles on monday 
linn and the governments attorneys said they did not know how 
much money is in the hong kong accounts 
writer reynaldo fajardo a confidant of mrs marcos told 
reporters at his own news conference that he witnessed signing of 
the agreement in los angeles last month 
fajardo said the accounts were in standard chartered trustee 
ltd hong kong and shanghai bank wing lung bank wing hang bank 
and the banque de lindochine et suez 
castro said the government was prepared only to drop the 
california suit and not other legal moves against the marcoses 
the los angeles suit filed in 1989 alleges marcos and his wife 
stole 5 billion from the government during their 20 years in 
power 
castro said settlement would not provide for mrs marcos to 
return to the philippines 
the marcoses left the country during the 1986 civilianmilitary 
uprising that toppled the marcos administration and propelled mrs 
aquino to power 
marcos died september 1989 in hawaii mrs aquino refused to 
allow him to be buried in the philippines and banned his family 
from coming home

if american crowds have trouble keeping quiet at 
tennis matches its hard to see chess catching on here as a 
spectator sport 
chess fans have to sit on their hands there are no hot dog or 
beer vendors you cant shout exd4 or bf6 and most 
matches end in a tie 
the us open here two months ago was raucous compared to the 
inside of the hudson theatre on wednesday as titleholder garry 
kasparov and anatoly karpov played to a draw in the last game of 
the us half of their world championship chess match 
chess folk take their quietness seriously as they followed game 
12 watching the players in person and on video screens and 
listening to running commentary via headsets spectators would 
occasionally murmur at an audacious move 
immediately their neighbors shushed them and the words 
silence please flashed on the largest screen 
for stage presence kasparov and karpov are no john mcenroe and 
jimmy connors 
both players sat at the board leaning forward heads in hands 
kasparov occasionally jiggled his right foot there was no dialogue 
and there were certainly no tantrums nobody threw any chess 
pieces 
in a whimsical touch the stage was flanked by giant cutout 
chess pieces that looked like illustrations from lewis carrolls 
through the looking glass 
although known for their dislike of one another the champion 
and challenger were polite during the 12 matches in new york 
most of the time the two took turns sitting down as one 
pondered his move the other would wait offstage 
chess does have its share of excitement though on wednesday 
after move number 31 the pace picked up considerably 
because of the time rules karpov was left with only nine 
minutes to make his next nine moves while kasparov had 20 minutes 
left for the same number of moves for this both sat at the table 
for those fans who cant take the silence the analysis rooms in 
the adjoining hotel macklowe offer a diversion there the chess 
buffs follow the game on monitors while grandmasters provide color 
commentary 
in lecture room 508 grandmaster roman dzindzichashvili was 
holding forth energetically 
i think absolutely terrible move by karpov he said 
absolutely terrible 
another kibitzer shouted do you think he didnt see bishop 
e6 
no he saw bishop e6 dzindzichashvili said he just 
underestimated 
lack of tv coverage of this years championship is a sore point 
for true chess fans syndicated columnist shelby lyman was host for 
the movebymove coverage of the 1972 championship between boris 
spassky and bobby fischer on pbs 
i have three four five people come up to me every day 
asking why arent you on tv lyman said some of them are 
almost crying 
if the united states is not agog with the championship which 
began oct 8 and resumes nov 24 the hotel macklowe at least 
was buzzing with nothing else in lounges and on elevators people 
talked chess in a dozen languages 
its exciting to be in a chess milieu said steve shapiro of 
new york when youre playing youre with a buddy or in a club 
rarely are you part of a chess scene there are lots of scenes in 
this town and chess aint one of them 
for their patience and good behavior the spectators who paid 
from 25 to 100 per ticket to attend game 12 were rewarded with 
a draw 
ever polite the audience waited a few seconds before 
applauding the players shook hands with each other and with match 
officials and withdrew silently 
the bestof24game match now moves to lyons france tied 66 
in points

a philosopher grappling with the morality 
of abortion says the beginning of protected human life should be 
defined in terms similar to those used in declaring a person 
braindead 
the concept is not entirely new but making it law would be 
hansmartin sass of the kennedy institute of ethics in washington 
told colleagues at a conference here this week 
his socalled uniform determination of life protection act would 
permit abortion until the 70th day after conception when some 
normal brain functions begin sass said after the 70th day the 
fetus would be a protected human life 
braindeath is the legally recognized termination of human life 
defined by cessation of brain activity establishing the 10week 
timetable for fetuses would mark the earliest onset of fetal brain 
development or brainlife sass said 
the absence of brainspecific cells in early embryonal 
development could be understood as the absence of brainlife 
sass said under those conditions abortion of inanimate life 
must be legally protected 
sass is a senior research fellow at the kennedy institute and 
professor of philosophy at georgetown university he also is 
codirector of the center for medical ethics in bocum germany 
he proposed the act at a university of iowa symposium that ended 
wednesday about 60 medical ethics and legal experts from 15 
countries attended the fourday symposium examining the question of 
when life actually begins 
in strong contrast to the consensus regarding the end of life 
we do not have a uniform understanding regarding the beginning of 
human life which has to be morally recognized and legally 
protected sass said 
for strong moral as well as cultural legal and political 
reasons i argue for a uniform determination of life protection 
act 
people would be free to use contraception or have an abortion 
within the 70day timeframe abortions are now legal in the united 
states through the sixth month of pregnancy or later if the 
womans health is threatened

walter leroy moody jr indicted in the mailbomb 
assassinations of a federal judge and a savannah alderman is a 
selfemployed editor who was convicted in 1972 of possessing a pipe 
bomb 
moody emerged as a suspect in february when it was disclosed 
that fbi agents searched his home in rex a small town rapidly 
becoming part of atlantas southern suburbs 
according to his mother moody is a bookworm an attorney of 
his michael ford says hes a quiet man who very much desires to 
be left alone 
but the quiet man at least twice before has tried to kill 
people prosecutors say and he has stayed in the news this year in 
connection with the bombings other legal problems and even a plan 
to cash in on his misfortune 
in florida moody was charged in 1983 with three counts of 
attempted murder prosecutors said he bought insurance policies on 
three divers he then tried to kill during a photo project in the 
gulf of mexico the case ended in a deadlocked jury 
before the indictment on wednesday moody 56 already was 
imprisoned without bond on federal bribery perjury and 
obstructionofjustice charges stemming from his 1972 case he is 
scheduled to go on trial nov 26 
his 28yearold wife susan also charged in the 
briberyobstruction indictment has petitioned for divorce 
moody said in court papers filed in march that another man an 
atlanta paramedic and former private investigator not publicly 
identified is the person probably responsible for last 
decembers mail bombings 
by july moody was outlining plans to cash in on his notoriety 
by selling tshirts and soliciting screenplays he said proceeds 
from tshirts with logos including moody motion pictures a 
company that didnt exist would be used to finance a movie about 
his travails 
moody also created an associated writers guild a company put 
out of business by the us postal service in june for fraudulent 
claims 
a psychiatric evaluation requested by federal prosecutors in 
connection with the briberyperjury case found there may be 
reasonable cause to believe moody is mentally ill 
a psychiatrist who treated moody in the late 1960s described him 
as the type of individual who could sell you the brooklyn 
bridge 
moody a native of fort valley in middle georgia served two 
years in the us penitentiary in atlanta after his 1972 
conviction 
prosecutors contended he planned to send a bomb and an extortion 
note demanding 65000 to a dealer who had repossessed his car but 
the bomb exploded when his thenwife hazel opened the package 
injuring her 
moody appealed to vacate his conviction in 1988 contending that 
new evidence showed he was innocent but the appeal was denied the 
following june by a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals 
six months later a judge on that court robert s vance was 
killed when a package bomb exploded in his suburban birmingham 
ala home 
vance was not one of the three judges who ruled on moodys 
appeal but he had served on two court panels that did consider 
cases involving moody one that rejected his appeal over the 
dismissal of a florida lawsuit and one that heard arguments in 
august 1989 on a second appeal 
two days after vances dec 16 assassination savannah alderman 
and civil rights lawyer robert robinson was killed by a bomb at his 
law office 
along with his history of trouble in the courts moody has 
something of a legal background he attended john marshall law 
school in chicago for two years in the late 1960s and represented 
himself in at least one appeal

12895 yen and 12970 yen 
trading totaled 1392 billion up from wednesdays 12646 
billion 
the dollars early strength stemmed from british prime minister 
margaret thatchers remarks wednesday that iraqi troops would be 
removed forcefully if they did not withdraw from kuwait dealers 
said 
at midmorning however market players became uncertain about 
the dollars trend bank of tokyo dealer naohiko yasuda said 
trading became totally directionless today but the dollar was 
no longer in a continuing downtrend yasuda added 
he said the dollar was weaker than other major currencies but 
the yen was even weaker mainly because of political uncertainties 
resulting from the governments lack of leadership in deciding 
japans role in the middle east 
other dealers said growing concern about mideast tensions 
especially before the threeday weekend in tokyo helped spur 
buying of the dollar seen as a safe haven in times of 
international crisis 
japans financial markets will be closed monday for emperor 
akihitos enthronement 
dealers said there also was demand for dollars to pay for oil 
purchases japan imports virtually almost all of its oil of which 
70 percent comes from the middle east

three days 
volume on the first section amounted to some 360 million shares 
up slightly from wednesdays 330 million

war in the persian gulf in addition to discouraging economic 
factors including a weaker yen falling bond prices and the 
overnight plunge in the dow jones industrial average in new york 
nobody wanted to buy amid the poor performances in the yen and 
the bond prices especially just ahead of a threeday weekend

the proportion of american teenage girls and 
women having sex climbed in the 1980s but the pregnancy rate 
changed little because of increased use of condoms a study found 
all the publicity about using condoms has had some impact 
said susheela singh coauthor of the alan guttmacher institute 
study released wednesday 
the study of sexual behavior from 1982 to 1988 also found one of 
every five teenagers having sex in 1988 used no birth control 
among poor teenagers one in four failed to use contraceptives 
during intercourse and onethird of all young women are still 
unprotected from pregnancy the first time they have sex the study 
found 
the proportion of girls ages 15 to 19 who had sexual intercourse 
rose from 47 percent in 1982 to 53 percent in 1988 the study 
found the increase was greatest among whites and in higherincome 
families 
in 1982 the proportion of whites who were sexually active was 
45 percent compared to 52 percent in 1988 the increase among 
teenagers in families with income of more than 200 percent of the 
poverty line was from 40 percent to 50 percent 
the levels of sexual activity were already high among 
nonwhite and poor girls singh said the white and nonpoor 
are catching up as attitudes change and become more liberal 
the study found that 58 percent of the overall sexually active 
group reported having intercourse with two or more partners 
according to the study 48 percent used a contraceptive method 
at first intercourse in 1982 mainly a condom compared to 65 
percent in 1988 regular condom use jumped 25 percentage points to 
47 percent it said 
thus male involvement in contraceptive use at first 
intercourse increased substantially the study found 
the study also found that 57 percent of all pregnancies 
conceived in 1987 were unintended while that is about the same as 
in 1982 the proportion of unintended pregnancies terminated by 
abortion fell from 54 percent in 1982 to 50 percent in 1987 
among teenagers there were 127 pregnancies per 1000 women in 
both 1982 and 1988 according to the study 
the institutes study is based on data released in the spring by 
the national center for health statistics the national survey of 
family growth compiled the 1988 data from interviews with 8450 
women a total of 7969 women were interviewed in 1982

the chemical building blocks for life on earth 
may have arrived aboard comet dust two scientists say 
the nasa scientists examined a discovery made in denmark last 
year to develop the hypothesis reported in todays issue of the 
british journal nature 
kevin zahnle and david grinspoon of nasas ames research center 
at moffett field in california tried to explain the discovery of 
ancient soil that contained concentrations of amino acids believed 
to have come from outer space 
amino acids are vital to life combining to form proteins and 
other organic structures 
the buried amino acids in denmark appeared in strata above and 
below a layer of the element iridium which some scientist say 
marks the impact of a huge meteorite that killed off the dinosaurs 
65 million years ago 
the scientists who found the amino acids suggested that they had 
arrived on the meteorite an idea that met with some skepticism 
zahnle and grinspoon suggested instead that the meteorite was 
only a chunk of a large comet that created a dust cloud rich in 
organic molecules 
dust from this cloud deposited the amino acids in the soil 
before and after the meteorite struck they propose 
a similar rain of organic molecules far earlier in the planets 
history could have provided the raw materials for life grinspoon 
theorized in an interview

president fw de klerks 
national party easily won a special parliamentary election 
considered a referendum on his efforts to end apartheid results 
showed today 
residents of the affluent suburb of randburg north of 
johannesburg gave national party candidate marthinus van schalkwyk 
10882 votes to 1969 for leonie steele of the proapartheid 
conservative party 
van schalkwyk had been expected to win in traditionally liberal 
randburg he replaces the resigning wynand malan of the 
antiapartheid democratic party the democrats did not contest the 
seat 
the larger question was whether south african whites backed de 
klerks dramatic reforms such as releasing black leader nelson 
mandela legalizing opposition groups and eliminating parts of the 
apartheid system of segregation and white dominance 
the conservative party favors strict racial segregation and 
considers de klerk a traitor for attempting to negotiate 
powersharing with the black majority 
de klerk said wednesdays balloting ratified his reforms 
i think the exorbitant claims of support by the conservative 
party have been disproved the president said thursday 
before the election the conservatives predicted they would 
receive a substantial shift in support from national party voters 
only a small shift occurred 
in the 1989 general election 755 randburg residents supported 
the conservative candidate compared with some 6000 for the 
national party candidate and 8000 for malan 
the conservative vote more than doubled wednesday but fell 
short of the 12 to 17 percent swing predicted by party leaders 
despite the drubbing conservative leader andries treurnicht 
proclaimed victory he noted the combined national partydemocratic 
party vote in 1989 exceeded 14000 while van schalkwyk received 
less than 11000 wednesday 
similar results nationwide would give the conservatives victory 
in a whitesonly election he said the conservative party has most 
of its support in rural and bluecollar areas 
amber solomon 19 said she wanted to avoid the conservative 
party at all costs 
i cant understand how they can still want to racially 
discriminate solomon said after voting the countrys going 
through a transitional stage no doubt about it the conservative 
party seems to be terrified of that 
the national party now holds 95 elected seats in the dominant 
white chamber of parliament the conservative party has 39 and the 
democrats have 32 
there also are chambers for asians and people of mixed race but 
not for the black majority

iraqs interior minister said today that 
the multinational forces in saudi arabia will all be targeted by 
iraqs forces if us troops initiate an attack from saudi soil 
the official iraqi news agency said 
the minister latif nassayif jassim was reacting to the new 
saudius agreement on the command structure for joint military 
action 
the agency quoted him as saying 
we will retaliate on any american aggression against iraq and 
all the allies of the american forces in saudi arabia will be our 
target 
more than 300000 troops have massed in the kingdom to stand up 
to iraq after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait they include some 
230000 americans 
secretary of state james a baker iii reached agreement with 
saudi leaders earlier this week that in the event of military 
action against iraq us officers would command their own troops 
a joint ussaudi command would be retained in the event of an 
iraqi incursion into the kingdom 
this agreement confirms the plot which we warned of before 
the real agressive and imperialist aims of the american and western 
presence in saudi arabia and exposes saudi arabianamerican claims 
and lies that iraq is threatening saudi arabia jassim was quoted 
as saying 
we repeated many times that there are no iraqi threats to 
saudi arabia jassim said that if an attack is launched on iraqi 
forces from saudi arabia we will make all saudi lands where these 
foreign forces are now stationed a battlefield ina reported

lemuel ricketts boulware who devised 
managements oneoffer formula for labor negotiations that became 
widely known as boulwarism has died at age 95 
boulware died wednesday at his home in delray beach fla the 
general electric co reported 
boulware took charge of employee relations for ge in 1947 a 
year after the company had gone through a devastating strike 
he quickly developed what became known as boulwarism a practice 
he said was designed to improve labormanagement relations by 
showing employees that the company wanted to do what was right 
voluntarily 
under boulwarism ge would listen to union demands compare 
wages and benefits at other companies and make an offer from which 
it would not budge during further negotiations 
the policy flowered in the 1950s and 60s but fell out of favor 
after ge was hit with a nationwide strike in 1969 and several 
court rulings that went against boulwarism 
boulware who retired from ge in 1961 graduated from the 
university of wisconsin in 1916 and later served as an infantry 
captain in world war i 
he also taught accounting and commercial law at the university 
of wisconsin florida atlantic university and the plymouth 
institute night school in new york 
he also wrote the books the truth about boulwarism and 
what you can do about inflation unemployment productivity 
profit and collective bargaining 
his wife norma died in 1987 and there are no immediate 
survivors

entomologists say they want endangered 
species protection for a recently rediscovered butterfly that 
experts believed had been extinct for more than 50 years 
paul hammond an oregon state university entomologist and 
butterfly expert said he rediscovered the butterflies by accident 
in the spring of 1989 i hiked out onto a southfacing slope of 
a hill that had native prairie on it and here was this very 
unusual kind of lupine plant with all these little blue butterflies 
swimming around on it 
i knew immediately what it was he said 
it was fenders blue butterfly a relic of the ice ages found 
only in oregons willamette valley the butterfly was last seen 
near the small town of wren west of corvallis in 1937 
since that find last year several pockets of the species have 
been found in western oregon 
a petition is being prepared to ask the us fish and wildlife 
to declare the butterfly a threatened species under the federal 
endangered species act 
hammond said the butterfly has a wingspan of only about 1 inch 
the male is a brilliant iridescent blue he said they 
really stand out the female is a drab brown 
the butterfly dates back more than 10000 years hammond said 
surrounded by glaciers to the north and mountains to the south 
east and west the butterflys habitat was limited to a small area 
of the willamette valley

the egyptianborn american who allegedly 
killed militant rabbi meir kahane was described by his father in 
interviews published today as a caring son who shied away from 
politics 
i cant imagine he did that said abdelaziz nosair whose 
son elsayyid a nosair was charged with murder following tuesdays 
assassination in a new york hotel 
cairos three major governmentowned newspapers today published 
interviews with the elder nosair in his home at port fouad across 
the northern tip of the suez canal from port said 
the son identified by authorities in the united states as a 
native of port said who immigrated from egypt in 1981 took us 
citizenship last year he was seriously wounded after the kahane 
shooting when he exchanged gunfire with a us post office 
policeman who also was wounded 
on wednesday as police from egypts interior ministry stood 
guard at the nosair house in port fouad the ministry in cairo 
denied that the kahane assassin was egyptian ministry officers 
said a check of records in port said turned up no one with his 
name 
abdelaziz nosair told the newspaper alakhbar that a day after 
kahanes slaying government intelligence had summoned him to ask 
about his son 
he said he was asked whether i had heard from him recently and 
whether any family members were even remotely connected to any 
political activites 
the questioners never indicated why they were interrogating him 
nosair said he said he later read in newspapers that his son was a 
suspect in the assassination 
the newspaper said nosair chainsmoked cigarettes nervously as 
he and another son ahmed talked with alakhbar 
attempts today to contact the family in port fouad were 
unsuccessful journalists said government security agents had 
ordered family members not to talk after they met with local 
reporters 
in the alakhbar interview the reporter asked nosair his 
feelings about kahane a usborn israeli who rejected his 
american citizenship to serve in the knesset israels parliament 
kahane was a founder of the jewish defense league and advocated 
deporting arabs from israel and the occupied territories 
from what i read he was strongly fanatical against all 
arabs the elder nosair said no doubt what happened to him is 
gods vengeance i cant really describe my feelings now 
nosair said he was certain his son had no links with palestinian 
groups and that he was never politically active but he said 
i believe his egyptian and arab friends in the united 
states with their feelings that america is biased toward israel 
may have led him to commit this act against a leading jewish 
extremist 
the suspect in the kahane killing had worked for the last two 
years for the new york city department of general serivces as an 
airconditioning and heating maintenance man he lived in cliffside 
park nj where his neighbors described him as quiet and devoutly 
moslem man he married an american woman who converted from all 
accounts he was not politically active 
alahram the only egyptian daily with greater circulation than 
alakhbar played down nosairs egyptian background 
it carried only a brief statement from his father on the 
suspects education and what is described as his apolitical life

former prime minister rajiv gandhis 
congress party announced today it will support a bid for power by a 
leftist politician who helped lead a historic noconfidence vote 
that brought down the government 
gandhis decision to back chandra shekhar and not seek the prime 
minister post himself cleared the way for president ramaswamy 
venkataraman to ask chandra shekhar to form a government a 
congress party spokesman said today 
earlier today venkataraman had asked gandhi if his congress 
party was able to form a government 
the declaration by ghandi capped a day of meetings following 
prime minister vp singhs defeat wednesday in a 346142 
parliament noconfidence vote it was the first time an indian 
government was ousted by parliament since the country won its 
independence from britain in 1947 
singhs 11monthold government collapsed under a wave of 
religious and caste violence and political bickering 
chandra shekhar a veteran leftleaning politician led the 
faction that broke away from singhs centrist janata dal party and 
opposed him in the vote 
the party has decided to suppport mr chandra shekhar from 
outside congress party spokesman vn gadgil told a news 
conference today that has been conveyed to the president 
gandhi when asked why he was not willing to form a government 
himself said i dont think we will be able to put together a 
stable government on our own 
no single party in parliaments policymaking lower house has a 
majority by agreeing to support chandra shekhar from outside the 
government gandhi and his congress party can make or break the new 
government but would not hold any cabinet posts gandhi could use 
the opportunity to prepare his own party for new elections 
chandra shekhars dissident faction of the janata dal party had 
only 56 votes in the 522member parliament when the vote agianst 
singh was taken the congress party has 195 seats and its allies 
have another 15 
singh remains caretaker prime minister until a new government is 
formed 
venkataraman could call new elections but most major parties 
are reluctant to face a campaign at a time when the country is in 
political sectarian and ethnic turmoil 
singhs coalition government was shaken by continued separatist 
struggles in kashmir and punjab states rising prices and by 
singhs program to raise the government job quota for lowcaste 
hindus 
the jobquota policy led to violent demonstrations and a wave of 
suicides among uppercaste hindus 
the government was ultimately crippled last month when a 
rightwing hindu party withdrew from the broad singhled coalition 
in protest over a shrine claimed by both hindus and moslems about 
370 people have been killed since in sectarian riots or clashes 
with police 
about 82 percent of indias 880 million people are hindus while 
12 percent are moslem and 2 percent are sikh

it started as a sleeper among issues but the 
drive to limit politicians terms is awake and kicking now and the 
people pushing the idea say theyll seek to put it on at least 15 
state ballots in 1992 
claiming headway in both the victories and frustrations of 
tuesdays offyear elections termlimit campaigners will meet in 
washington early next month to talk about their next steps 
while the immediate target is the state legislatures their 
ultimate aim is to limit tenure in congress 
term limits were approved tuesday in colorado and california 
the two states that had the issue on the ballot and for good 
measure in kansas city mo which put a ceiling on city council 
tenure oklahoma voted for term limits earlier in the fall 
and then 95 percent of the house incumbents who ran again won 
again an outcome one strategist said would help the push for 
limits even in an antiincumbent year you cant beat em 
said eddie mahe a republican campaign consultant and advisor to 
americans to limit congressional terms 
it is largely a republican movement although some democratic 
candidates signed on during the campaign measures that force 
turnover would work to gop advantage they are outnumbered in the 
legislatures as in congress and democrats have just extended their 
house control to 38 years 
proposed constitutional amendments to limit congressional tenure 
to 12 years have predictably gone nowhere in congress the 
measure approved in colorado on tuesday would apply to members of 
congress as well as state officeholders and therefore it is 
certain to be challenged in court 
so the political pressure point is in states especially those 
that hold direct elections on such questions elsewhere mahe said 
the term limit drive will be pressed in the legislatures where 
lawmakers may be loath to limit their own tenure but likely to 
approve a call for limits in congress that might just offer some 
openings for ambitious state lawmakers whod like to get to 
washington 
in the three states that have approved term limits the voters 
overrode opponents who insisted that limits are no cure for the 
ills of government state or federal and could make them worse 
strong seasoned legislators would be dismissed along with weak 
ones the opponents say while bureaucrats and lobbyists would gain 
even more clout 
i think term limits is really a reaction against the fact that 
so many of our congressional elections and our other elections 
are not really competitive said gov richard f celeste of ohio 
chairman of the democratic governors association 
mahe said that when and if more states impose limits or at 
least call for them nationally congress will start to feel the 
political heat once those are in place at the state level the 
pressure at the national level is going to be geometrically 
increased he said 
this is going to be an issue says vice president dan 
quayle you had the tax revolt in the 1970s and early 1980s and 
in the 1990s i think youre going to see the voter revolt 
campaigning for republican candidates this year both quayle and 
president bush pushed term limits the 1988 republican platform 
endorsed limits on house and senate tenure without saying what the 
ceiling should be quayle says he favors 12 years 
all around this country there is a growing momentum for 
limiting terms of legislators bush said before the elections 
term limitation is an idea whose time has come and i think 
its time has come to capitol hill frankly 
quayle built part of his set campaign speech around the issue 
the chairman listen to this the chairman of the house 
appropriations committee has been in the congress longer than my 
mother and father have been married he had seven years of 
seniority when i was born he would say drawing ripples of 
laughter i tell you there is an idea that is sweeping this 
country and that is the idea that it is time to limit the 
terms 
the chairman rep jamie l whitten dmiss just won his 26th 
term 
but there is turnover for all the power of incumbency and more 
than 60 percent of house members have been elected since 1980 
mahe said the organizations pushing term limits will seek 
commitments from house candidates in 1992 that they wont seek to 
serve more than a dozen years in congress when theyre running 
for the first time 12 years looks like a long time he said 
to a veteran though it doesnt look that long former sen 
eugene j mccarthy who also served in the house once recalled 
that hed arrived as a foe of the seniority system 
but the longer he stayed mccarthy said the more he saw the 
wisdom of it

gov jim florio took responsibility for the 
democratic partys election losses and close calls in new jersey 
and said parts of his bitterly disputed 28 billion tax package 
may be rewritten as a result 
i got the message that the results were really directed at 
me florio said at a news conference wednesday it was a strong 
message a humbling message 
the backlash by new jersey taxpayers nearly cost us sen bill 
bradley his bid for reelection to a third term tuesday bradley 
considered nearly invulnerable barely fended off a challenge from 
littleknown republican christine todd whitman who lost by fewer 
than 55000 votes 
florio who wasnt on the ballot because he was elected governor 
just last year said that in the wake of bradleys close call 
elements of his tax legislation were open to possible changes 
particularly the school funding formula 
in his first six months in office florio raised the state 
income tax for wealthy new jersey residents and increased the state 
sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent 
the higher income tax which goes into effect jan 1 will pay 
for a complex program of property tax relief and higher funds for 
the states disadvantaged schools 
republican leaders touted the election results as a repudiation 
of the democratic party under florio top gop legislators repeated 
their call for a repeal of the tax package 
he just spawned an electoral disaster for his own party gop 
state chairman bob franks said 
florio conceded that he might have pushed his agenda too fast 
and without regard for opinions outside his administration 
at his news conference florio stopped well short of saying he 
would consider repealing any of his tax legislation but the 
governor repeatedly said the school aid formula might be modified 
and that he would discuss his administrations policies with 
democratic legislative leaders 
everything is on the table for people who are responsible and 
constructive florio said in response to a question about the 
school funding formula 
state senate minority leader john dorsey said republican leaders 
have acknowledged the need for higher taxes to increase revenue for 
poor school districts to comply with a state supreme court ruling 
but dorsey disputed the size of the tax increase needed to comply 
with the ruling 
in its ruling issued in june the court said that new jerseys 
system of using property taxes to fund schools was unfair to poor 
districts and unconstitutional the state has until july 1991 to 
devise a plan to improve the funding for disadvantaged schools

charles a kellihers 40 years a fugitive from a 
virginia chain gang have come to an end but he says he has paid 
society all it has coming and at least 100 of his friends agree 
kellihers past caught up with him last week when federal 
marshals knocked on the door of his brooklyn apartment diane 
kelliher his wife of 20 years said she had no idea i was 
shocked about the whole thing 
kelliher was taken to a new york city jail where he has been 
held without bond since oct 31 
the 59yearold former moonshine runner and selfdescribed 
hellraiser said he fled a prison road crew in 1950 when he was a 
19yearold rowdy from manassas 
we were out on a highway cleaning ditches kelliher said 
wednesday something happened on the other side of the road and 
the guards turned and i took off 
kelliher had served only a few months of a 22year sentence when 
he fled to new york he had been convicted of getting drunk 
breaking into the county courthouse and stealing his own car which 
police had confiscated when they caught him hauling illegal 
whiskey 
i thought he had lost his mind 22 years he said of the 
judge 
virginia authorities who have a program to locate longmissing 
fugitives enlisted the help of federal law enforcers who after 
hours of stakeouts and computer record searches traced kelliher to 
his bay ridge apartment 
donald zimmerman of the virginia department of corrections in 
richmond said the state still wants kelliher to serve the 21 
years eight months he owes 
kelliher with the help of attorney philip a dipippo who 
learned of his case through news reports is resisting extradition 
i dont owe anybody anything ive damn sure paid my dues 
kelliher said 
this to me is truly all unnecessary he said 
at a hearing wednesday criminal court judge seymour gerschwer 
said he had no jurisdiction in the matter and sent the case to the 
state supreme court 
some two dozen of kellihers friends many he met through 
alcoholics anonymous attended the hearing to show support for 
kelliher 
for 10 years kelliher has been sober and has helped and 
inspired recovering alcoholics his friends said 
friend bettyann seccia said kelliher and his wife have helped 
me tremendously 
a petition submitted to the court with more than 100 signatures 
described kelliher as a man of conscience and heart through the 
years that we have known him he has been an exemplary role model 
for all of us

driving home through the borough of brooklyn when he stopped his 
car to talk to his killer

killer opened fire police said the car crashed into a fence

member of the gambino crime family when gotti allegedly took 
control after the death of paul castellano in 1985

codefendants conspired to distribute heroin for a drug ring

infiltration 
he also suggested the persian gulf crisis could have had an 
influence many palestinians in jordan have been strong supporters 
of saddam hussein 
defense minister moshe arens said the persian gulf crisis has 
burdened jordans king hussein and suggested perhaps this

us officials have prepared a resolution 
authorizing un military force against iraq but are not 
introducing the measure until they are sure they have enough votes 
for passage diplomats have said 
secretary of state james a baker iii is abroad lining up key 
support for the security council resoution the diplomats said 
wednesday on condition of anonymity he was visiting moscow today 
after a quick tour of several middle eastern nations 
we know theyve got it on paper but it would be absurd for 
them to pass it around until theyve got all the crucial support 
lined up one official said 
in washington us officials close to the situation confirmed 
the account they also spoke on condition of anonymity 
if approved the us draft resolution would mark the first time 
the security council approved un military force under a joint 
military command 
iraq has defied 10 security council resolutions they include an 
embargo on trade with iraq and demands that baghdad free all 
foreign hostages withdraw unconditionally from kuwait and allow 
the restoration of kuwaits government 
baker said in turkey that iraqs invasion of kuwait is after 
all the first real crisis of the postcold war era and it is very 
important that when the united nations takes action and passes 
resolutions those resolutions and the act be implemented 
baker flew to moscow on wednesday to continue his diplomatic 
initiative on the persian gulf crisis which includes rallying 
support for the use of unsanctioned military force he then 
travels to paris and london 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a sept 25 
speech to the general assembly hinted at a un military 
operation saying the united nations has the power to suppress 
acts of aggression 
on tuesday chinese foreign minister qian qichen indicated to 
baker that his country would not oppose a resolution authorizing a 
military strike to force iraq out of kuwait us officials said 
qian who met for two hours with baker in cairo did not 
explicitly approve sending troops into action 
well have to wait and see qian told reporters china is 
one of the five un security council members with veto power over 
resolutions the others are the united states britain france and 
the soviet union 
iraq seized oilrich kuwait on aug 2 and then annexed the 
emirate 
in response the pentagon has sent 230000 us troops to the 
region among a multinational force of more than 300000 they face 
about 430000 iraq troops deployed in kuwait and southern iraq 
the new us draft resolution marks the first time the security 
council would approve of un military force under article 42 of 
the un charter 
article 42 permits the council to take such action by air 
sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore 
international peace and security 
such actions may include demonstrations blockade and other 
operations by air sea or land forces of members of the united 
nations it says 
the security council has never had a unified military command 
the closest approach was during the korean war when it authorized 
the united states to command the un forces repelling north 
koreas invasion 
that was only possible because the soviets were boycotting the 
security council to protest taiwans being seated as the delegation 
from china

a camper has been acquitted of criminal 
negligence for accidentally igniting a 9000acre forest fire in 
hells canyon by burning his used toilet paper 
us magistrate mikel williams found philip j arnold innocent 
wednesday in connection with the aug 20 1988 blaze in the 
payette national forest which took more than two weeks to control 
williams noted that campfires were not banned at the time and 
ruled that arnold of santa barbara calif was not aware of the 
substantial risk of fire during that droughtplagued summer in 
addition he said the forest services evidence did not prove 
arnold committed a criminally reckless or negligent act 
part of arnolds defense was based on the fact that camping 
books and even some forest service maps instruct campers to burn 
their toilet paper after use 
however payette national forest supervisor sonny lasalle said 
the only safe way to deal with human waste is to bury it he 
said toilet paper will decompose if it is put in a 6inchdeep hole 
and covered with dirt

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze today said 
the shooting incident near soviet leaders in red square should not 
be taken very seriously but officials charged the suspect with a 
terrorist offense 
the incident occurred wednesday just 80 yards from president 
mikhail s gorbachev and other officials during revolution day 
celebrations to mark the 73rd anniversary of the bolshevik 
revolution no one was injured 
the gunman identified as alexander a shmonov 38 was being 
held in custody today on charges of committing a terrorist act 
said aleskei kandaurov deputy director of the kgbs public 
relations office the suspect is an unemployed metal craftsman who 
was last employed at the izhorsky metal working factory in 
leningrad kandaurov said 
kandaurov could not confirm a report by one newspaper that the 
gunman was carrying a light explosive in addition to a hunting 
rifle 
he confirmed the man was carrying at least one device but said 
laboratory tests have not confirmed whether it is an explosive 
the suspect charged by the moscows chief prosecutor will 
undergo psychiatric tests kandaurov said he gave no other 
details 
a plainclothes officer knocked the gun away from the man after 
shmonov fired once into the air and into the ground newspapers 
said 
i dont think this incident should be taken very seriously 
shevardnadze said before meeting with us secretary of state james 
a baker iii this is a huge country where something is always 
happening somewhere 
newspapers today were filled with glowing reports about the 
celebrations across the country but gave only brief reports of 
several large protest rallies around the nation pravda criticized 
the rallies as extravagant escapades verging on simple 
hooliganism 
the newspapers also offered few new details about the shooting 
near the lenin mausoleum where gorbachev stood with other 
officials to watch the festivities 
the conservative labor newspaper trud said the suspect was 
carrying a small explosive usually used for military rehearsals and 
that could cause no serious damage 
it is hard to tell now whom he was aiming at but one thing is 
clear if it were not for the immediate reaction of a policeman 
who succeeded in knocking the gun into the air a disaster might 
have happened the paper said in a short pageone report 
during the celebrations gorbachev stood near officials 
including russian president boris n yeltsin and moscow mayor 
gavriil popov

iraqi president saddam hussein has 
dismissed his military chief of staff prompting western officials 
to speculate there is dissension among iraqi military leaders about 
the invasion of kuwait 
saddam replaced lt gen nizar alkhazraji with the commander of 
the elite republican guards the iraqi army newspaper and us 
officials said today 
western analysts with considerable knowledge of iraqs military 
said the move could indicate opposition to holding onto conquered 
kuwait in the face of the growing usled multinational force and 
unimposed sanctions 
the officials in washington said it might even indicate 
opposition to saddams decision to invade the oilrich emirate on 
aug 2 
the sacking of khazraji a hero of the 198088 iraniraq war 
came amid mounting us and british warnings that force might be 
used to dislodge the iraqis from kuwait if necessary 
its very ominous said hansheino kopietz a former analyst 
with londons international institute for strategic studies now 
with control risks an international security firm in london 
its not wise to change horses in midstream at this point in 
time khazrajis dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to 
saddam within the military who after all may have to take on the 
multinational force said kopietz he has just returned from a 
lengthy middle east tour 
the iraqi army newspaper alqadissiya named the new chief of 
staff as gen hussein rashid but did not say when he was named to 
replace khazraji 
it mentioned rashids new title in a report of a graduation 
ceremony he attended at baghdads military academy on wednesday 
in washington officials confirmed khazraji had been replaced by 
rashid they said khazraji was replaced because he objected to the 
invasion khazraji has been made a special military adviser to 
saddam believed a demotion for the military commander the 
officials said 
khazraji was promoted to a nonjob said one official 
the us officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
khazraji had been chief of staff since 1985 and was one of the 
top officers in saddams inner circle of military advisers 
its very odd said analyst shahram chubin of the 
genevabased graduate institute of international affairs and author 
of books on the persian gulf war 
its very easy to speculate its not yet clear why saddams 
done this but hes taking a big gamble he said 
rashid was khazrajis deputy and commanded the 120000strong 
republican guards saddams best troops who are considered loyal to 
him and form a virtual separate army within the millionstrong 
army 
the republican guards spearheaded the invasion of kuwait during 
the gulf war rashid commanded an armored division with some 
success 
he is believed to be from takrit saddams birthplace north of 
baghdad saddam has packed the hierarchy of the ruling baath arab 
socialist party with relatives by blood or marriage who come 
mainly from takriti clans 
rashids appointment is the second known toplevel change in 
baghdad in the past two weeks 
oil minister issam chalabi was fired on oct 28 and replaced on 
an interim basis by brig gen hussein kamel saddams cousin and 
soninlaw who is also minister of industry and military 
industrialization 
kamel who is also from takrit has been responsible for 
developing iraqs arms industry and producing new 
surfacetosurface missiles 
chalabi was purportedly replaced after he imposed gasoline 
rationing because of shortages prompted by the un trade embargo 
that order was later rescinded and officials denied there was any 
shortage 
but kopietz noted there was more to chalabis dismissal than 
meets the eye hes a moderate close to the west and the oil 
industry where he was widely respected he was understood to be 
trying to persuade saddam from pursuing his strategy of 
confrontation 
it may well be that theres growing opposition to saddam 
within the iraqi hierarchy kopietz added 
iraqi dissident groups have reported several purges of senior 
officers since the invasion possibly because the officers 
disapproved and because saddam apparently miscalculated how the 
west would react 
there has been no independent confirmation of reports that 
officers have been executed or imprisoned but saddam has regularly 
purged senior officers whom he suspected could threaten him since 
he took power in 1979 
analysts believe this opposition heightened after saddam 
seeking to secure iraqs border with iran as his international 
isolation increased made concessions to iran on aug15 
he agreed to iranian demands to withdraw his forces from 
territory seized in the closing stages of the iraniraq war and to 
share sovereignty of the shattalarab waterway on the southern 
boundary between the two countries 
kopietz said at the time it must have been a bitter pill for 
the army to swallow they must have wondered what the hell theyd 
fought the iranians for eight years for 
chubin said today im sure theres considerable disquiet in 
the military whore not necessarily all convinced takriti 
baathists

civil rights leaders breathed easier with the 
indictment of a georgia man in a series of mail bombings that 
killed a federal judge and an naacp lawyer and put the south on 
edge just before christmas last year 
the indictment unsealed wednesday also accuses walter leroy 
moody jr a 56yearold selfemployed editor of sending racist 
threatening letters 
he was to be arraigned in federal court today 
the bombings and threats spread a wave of prechristmas terror 
that had lawyers judges and civil rights officials contacting 
authorities when they received unexpected packages 
we are relieved that federal authorities believe that a 
suspected perpetrator has been identified and cautious that no 
other persons are or may be implicated said earl shinhoster 
southeast director of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people 
he said the bombings created a climate of uneasy apprehension 
for many of us in the civil rights community that will not be 
easily abated even with the indictments 
moody for months a leading suspect in the case was charged in 
the slayings of appeals judge robert vance of mountainbrook ala 
on dec 16 1989 and civil rights lawyer robert robinson of 
savannah two days later 
the nailpacked bombs bore marked similarities to one that moody 
was convicted of possssing in 1972 federal authorities said they 
said all three bombs were constructed by a method not used in any 
of more than 10000 bombs they had examined over the years 
the indictment also accuses moody of sending bombs to the 11th 
us circuit courthouse in atlanta vance was a member of the 11th 
circuit and to the naacp in jacksonville fla those two bombs 
were safely defused 
in addition moody was charged with sending dozens of 
threatening letters to naacp officials lawyers judges and tv 
stations and with sending a teargas bomb that went off at the 
naacps atlanta office 
us attorney general richard thornburgh and fbi director 
william sessions who announced the indictment in washington said 
authorities believe moody acted alone 
officials declined to say what his motive might have been but 
it has been speculated that racism or revenge against the judicial 
system prompted the attacks moody is white as was vance 
robinson a savannah city alderman who did legal work for the 
naacp was black 
the letters some signed americans for a competent federal 
judicial system said the killings were in retaliation for court 
decisions on school desegregation and blackonwhite crime they 
threatened more violence against lawyers judges and the naacp 
six of the charges including murder of a federal judge carry 
up to life in prison 
moodys attorney bruce harvey charged that the indictment 
lacked evidence linking his client to the crimes 
we need to see some facts he said we need to see some 
hard evidence 
moody described by his lawyer as a quiet man who very much 
desires to be left alone has been known to be a prime suspect in 
the case since fbi agents searched his home in rex in february 
robert wayne oferrell an enterprise ala junk dealer who 
wrote numerous letters to the 11th circuit had also been a 
suspect 
authorities declined to say if he has been cleared but his 
lawyer paul harden said oferrell had been told wednesday he is 
no longer a suspect 
thornburgh declined to say what if any relationship moody had 
with oferrell police at one time believed that oferrell had been 
in possession of the typewriter used to write the letters that 
followed the bombings 
oferrells wife mary ann oferrell picked moodys wife 
susan out of an fbi lineup in alabama oct 18 identifying mrs 
moody as the woman to whom she sold a typewriter in the spring of 
1989 jefferson county ala sheriff mel bailey told the 
birmingham news 
bailey was out of his office this morning and anthony bishop a 
lawyer for oferrell declined to comment on the lineup report 
mrs moodys lawyer sandra popson would not confirm that her 
client participated in the bessemer ala lineup on oct 19 mrs 
moody filed for divorce 
moody and his wife have been in custody since july when they 
were indicted on perjury and witness tampering charges involving 
his 1972 bomb conviction 
that bomb was intended for an auto dealer who had repossessed 
moodys car but moodys first wife mistakenly opened the package 
and was seriously injured authorities said

that kahanes men would let our friend the submachine gun our 
friend the knife talk for us kahane was assassinated by an arab

the kahane supporters were arrested at the jewish idea seminary 
run by the late extremist rabbis kach movement a spokesman said 
police said the seven were being held on suspicion of incitement 
meanwhile police guarded israeli arab leaders jewish leftists 
and journalists after they received death threats from supporters 
of the antiarab kach movement police said four shots were fired 
outside the home of the mayor of the israeli arab town of shfaram 
on wednesday 
todays fatal stabbing occurred in jenin prison in the occupied 
west bank a military source said the victim a druze guard was 
attacked by a palestinian visiting an inmate 
the incident was the latest in a rash of knifing attacks by 
palestinians following the temple mount killings last month in 
which 20 arabs were killed by police during riots 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers shot and wounded an arab 
after he tried to stab a soldier at a roadblock the soldier 
escaped unharmed because he was wearing a flak jacket israel radio 
said 
the army said that in the wake of the knifings it has begun 
issuing the padded jackets to some soldiers including those 
manning roadblocks and standing guard in the occupied territories 
the haaretz newspaper meanwhile quoted a kach leader as saying 
the group had drawn up a hit list security officials told the 
daily that kahanes heavily armed followers may go underground to 
organize attacks 
mayor ibrahim nimer hussein of shfaram said police have warned 
him he might be in danger he said a police van passes by his house 
at regular intervals and police frequently call him to make sure 
he is all right 
israeli arab legislator wahab abdel daroushe said he received a 
call from someone who identified himself only as a good 
israeli 
he said that kahanes people have put you on their list and 
decided to kill you daroushe said adding that police posted 
guards outside his home 
another israeli lawmaker yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens 
rights movement reported receiving death threats and said police 
were guarding him 
im a target and i know it sarid said the mood now is 
very tense if you look at the reports about kahanes funeral one 
name was mentioned specifically by the crowd my name 
during the funeral attended by 15000 people hundreds of 
kahane supporters went on a rampage attacking arabs stoning 
police and smashing shop windows at one point scores of rioters 
stoned and beat members of an israel television crew 
suddenly you find yourself a target for the mobs television 
reporter benny liss told army radio worse than the blows is the 
humiliation they pulled off my skullcap 
another journalist sima kadmon wrote conservative maariv daily 
today that she was shocked by the hatred at the funeral 
i covered arab demonstrations full of hatred and violence 
and i swear by our god and their god that i was never as afraid as 
yesterday in the streets of jerusalem she wrote 
few palestinian workers came to jerusalem apparently out of 
fear or as part of a twoday general strike beginning today to mark 
the onemonth anniversay of the temple mount riots

albanian president ramiz alia said his 
hardline communist country should rethink enshrining the communist 
partys leading role and policy of atheism in the constitution the 
state news agency said 
alia who is trying to introduce cautious reforms and bring his 
balkan country slowly out of selfimposed isolation also decried 
bureaucracy and a lack of discipline while calling for stronger 
rule of law 
the comments by alia head of the communist albanian labor 
party to the partys central committee appeared to be another 
cautious step toward reform 
the speech also seemed timed to influence a paris summit that 
will decide later this month whether to admit albania to an 
alleuropean system of cooperation and human rights 
in the speech reported by the ata news agency on wednesday alia 
did not say the communists should give up power or legalize a 
political opposition nor did he suggest a specific constituional 
ammendment 
the constitution refers to the party as the only leading 
political force in the state but alia said communists won that 
status through struggle work selfdenial and adherence to the 
interests of the people and the homeland 
that echoed soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs rationale 
earlier this year for calling on the soviet communist party to give 
up its guaranteed monopoly on power 
alia called for strengthening the rule of law saying it would 
only solidify the party since the law is based on party policy 
the law stands above all he said no instruction 
decision order or authority exists above the law failure to 
recognize the supremacy of law leads to injustice and chaos and 
causes great social damage 
albania is the only hardline communist country left in eastern 
europe where revolution last year toppled communist governments 
but earlier this year cracks began showing in albanias 
communist edifice as well about 5000 albanians slipped past 
guards to make their way to embassies in the capital tirana and 
were allowed to emigrate 
alia also said the 1976 constitution which declares an official 
policy of atheism violates the right of religious belief 
just as it is anyones right to be an atheist so he must not 
be prohibited from believing alia said but he did not make a 
clear statement calling for that policy to be eliminated

the hero of tom mardirosians new play a 
character not unlike mardirosian himself faces 40 fearfully talks 
to dinosaurs in the museum of natural history favors loud bowling 
shirts and suffers from a low sperm count 
this autobiographical trivia doesnt sound like the stuff of 
good comedy but it is particularly because the protagonist is 
played by mardirosian himself a balding raconteur with a wry 
humorous outlook on life 
his play is called subfertile and it opened wednesday in 
the tiny studio theater at offbroadways playwrights horizons 
mardirosians last comedy saved from obscurity was done 
there two years ago and dramatized his struggle to become an actor 
with subfertile he struggles to become a father 
the journey to parenthood isnt easy according to mardirosian 
you think connie chung and maury povich have problems the 
roadblocks for our hero arent just physical there are expensive 
and uncaring doctors humiliating medical examinations the endless 
questions of wellmeaning friends and the inevitable tensions 
between husband and wife 
but mardirosian manages to make the difficulties comic often 
outrageous fun the playwright takes a personal conversational 
tone with the audience he talks directly to them 
the actor starts with his first sexual experiences back as a 
teenager in buffalo ny and works his way up to the present he 
covers his college and postcollege dalliances as well as the 
problems he and his wife jackie have when they try to conceive 
one highlight is an operation mardirosian endures to improve his 
sperm count the anesthetic produces a hilarious fantasy sequence 
right out of star trek call it sperm trek in which 
mardirosian becomes a spock with soul and sensitivity 
the playwrightactor gets expert help from four other actors 
some in a variety of roles they include frederica meister who 
plays his beleaguered wife richard council as two different 
doctors and his obnoxious bluecollar childhood friend susan 
knight as a giggly beautyparlor operator he beds and kitty crooks 
as a third doctor who tries to get him out of his predicament 
director john ferraro doesnt let the evening spin too long at 
90 minutes its exactly right subfertile further cements 
mardirosians reputation as a playwright of promise whose best 
subject is himself

lawrence durrell the british novelist whose works 
evoked the exotic imagery of the mediterranean has died at his 
home in southern france his family said today he was 78 
the cause of his death on wednesday was not disclosed durrell 
had been fatigued for about two weeks a family member said 
durrell told the washington post in 1986 that he was suffering from 
emphysema 
durrell who was a close friend of american novelist henry 
miller died in sommieres a small town in the provence region near 
the mediterranean coast where he had lived for 24 years 
his bestknown work was the alexandria quartet series the 
elements of which came from the time he spent in alexandria egypt 
during world war ii the novels written from 1957 to 1960 are 
justine balthazar mountolive and clea 
durrells verse romantic taut and often humorous began 
appearing in 1938 it includes collected poems red limbo 
lingo and vega and other poems 
durrell was born in 1912 in india and spent his boyhood in the 
northern city of darjeeling near the tibetan border his father a 
civil engineeer had gone to india to help build the countrys 
first railroads 
lawrence was one of four children his younger brother gerald 
a zoomaniac as lawrence called him is a wellknown naturalist 
and author 
the elder durrell said in a 1982 interview 
when i was looking back the other day to what the hell my 
career had been i found i was really trying to find my way back to 
india i think i really must have been marked by that enormous 
silence up in the mountains 
at the age of 18 he left india for london where he dabbled in 
jazz and poetry without much success in 1935 he first encountered

vivid manyfaceted account of cyprus during the 
britishturkishgreek struggles there 
it was also while living in france that durrell wrote the

president bush conceded today that im not 
talking victory about the 1990 elections in the wake of 
democratic gains in congress but the president quickly added that 
gop losses were less than the historic average 
i didnt do as well as id like the president said at a 
news conference 
democrats strengthened their hold on congress by gaining one 
senate seat and nine in the house republicans were quick to 
contend that those losses were below the historic average for a 
firstterm president in his first congressional elections 
democrats counter that the average loss of two dozen house seats 
normally occurs after the president carries many house candidates 
into office with him that didnt occur in 1988 when democrats 
gained three house seats despite bushs victory 
im not talking victory because i am very disappointed about 
how some of the races turned out bus said in his first public 
discussion of the elections results 
he cited the defeat of republican sen rudy boschwitz of 
minnesota by democrat paul wellstone as particularly disappointing 
invited to announce his plans for 1992 bush brushed off the 
question by saying no decision has been made 
the president did not accept any responsibility for gop losses 
although many analysts said before the voting that republicans were 
hurt when bush dropped his tough line against any tax increases 
i dont think there is any confusion about how i feel about 
taxes he said im going to hold the line on taxes 
the president was less bullish about the election results than 
some of his party leaders who were energetically arguing that the 
losses were a victory because they were not much worse 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown and republican party 
spokesman charles black raced from one joint appearance to another 
wednesday brown declared the 1990 outcome a noconfidence vote 
on bush while black found in the results a good day for the 
republican party 
the conflicting views mean little to citizens of arizona who are 
headed for a runoff vote perhaps months away to determine the 
identity of their next governor 
republican fife symington held a lead of fewer than 5000 votes 
over democrat terry goddard in the race to succeed rose mofford as 
governor of arizona about 10000 votes went to other candidates 
and the state constitution requires that if no candidate gets 50 
percent of the votes the top two meet again in a runoff 
until the race is settled mofford will remain governor 
also undecided are two house races in california two of them 
involving democratic incumbents doug bosco and jim bates 
with all other races decided the 1990 outcome was this 
democrats gained one senate seat to increase their majority to 
5644 all democratic incumbents won only one republican lost 
wellstone unseated boschwitz 
the democrats also picked up nine house seats to pad their 
majority to 268167 assuming the two unsettled california races go 
to the republican candidates who now are leading 
governors provided the most excitement the republicans 
retained california but the democrats captured statehouses in 
florida and texas from the gop when the dust had settled the 
democrats held 28 governorships and the republicans 19 two were 
won by independents lowell weicker in connecticut and walter 
hickel in alaska 
those are the numbers defining them was the job of the browns 
and blacks 
americans read george bushs lips yesterday and they made it 
clear they didnt like his message said rep beryl anthony 
dark chairman of the house democratic campaign committee 
the outcome wasnt due to any kind of national trend i dont 
think or issue so much as it was something about each 
individual member said house minority leader robert michel 
rill 
control of congressional and legislative reapportionment was a 
special goal of both the 1990 campaign in this area the democrats 
looked like clear winners 
overall democrats emerged from tuesdays vote with 
redistricting monopolies in 17 states republicans control the 
process outright in just three states new hampshire utah and 
vermont none of them redistricting battlegrounds 
the victories of lawton chiles over republican gov bob martinez 
in florida and ann richards over gop businessman clayton william in 
the texas governors race gave the democrats the monopoly of the 
redistricting process in those two key states that will gain seven 
house seats between them 
black insisted that our party is very wellpositioned not only 
for 1992 but for the rest of this decade 
that assessment was based on the gops having a voice in 
redistricting for 231 of the 435 congressional districts roughly 
65 more than 10 years ago 
one of the biggest surprises in the results was the defeat of 
democratic gov jim blanchard of michigan by republican john 
engler this is simply an overpowering moment said engler who 
a week ago looked to be far behind in the polls 
other incumbent governors who lost were republicans kay orr of 
nebraska mike hayden of kansas and edward diprete of rhode island 
why were governors hit harder than members of congress 
larry sabato a political analyst at the university of virginia 
traced their vulnerability to the policies of the reagan 
administration 
reagan transferred the authority and the responsibility and 
the fiscal burdens to the states and the governors were forced to 
raise taxes he said

one woman lost an eye after using eye drops 
that were contaminated by bacteria and at least 10 other people are 
under treatment after using the same drops made by a local 
pharmacy doctors said 
at least four city hospitals are treating patients whose eyes 
have been injured by the contaminated drops the pittsburgh press 
reported in todays editions 
so far one woman who used the drug has had a badly infected eye 
surgically removed at least two others could lose eyes and two 
more have lost sight in an eye the newspaper said 
the patients mostly women 55 to 78 years old underwent 
cataract surgery in the past month 
joseph kilkeary who identified himself as the manager of 
hiebers drug store said wednesday night that he was unsure how 
many people received the medicine the pharmacy produced but its 
somewhere between 20 and 200 
eye surgeons at allegheny general hospitals ophthalmology 
department determined the drops were contaminated by bacteria as 
they cared for a woman suffering from a severe internal eye 
infection the newspaper said 
her doctor thought the stitches from her cataract surgery 
three weeks ago had broken and become infected but it turned out 
to be far more severe said dr john kennerdell the departments 
chairman 
the womans right eye was removed last week when large doses of 
antibiotics failed to save her vision 
laboratory tests linked the infection to the indocin drops a 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication made at the pharmacy by 
mixing powdered indocin with other solutions 
kennerdell on monday got the names of the four physicians who 
were prescribing the medication later that day three more 
patients with identical symptoms were referred to allegheny 
general 
at the same time patients were being treated for infection at 
other hospitals three at central medical center one at st 
francis hospital and three at eye and ear hospital 
indocin produced by merck sharp amp dohme is taken orally for 
pain caused by diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis many eye 
specialists prescribe it in the form of drops 
kilkeary said hiebers has made the drops for years without 
any problems whatsoever

handling of its 2weekold strike 
this is a new york situation and it will be solved by the 
daily news management in new york said charles brumback

advertisers had pulled out and that distributing the paper was a 
major problem

during negotiations that it could not survive without ending what 
it called union featherbedding the paper began recruiting 
permanent replacements in the spring in anticipation of a strike 
a group of clergymen expressing concern over the economic and 
social damage of the strike went to the news building on wednesday

their barbs at the company 
speaking for a clerical coalition of conscience the rev 
james a forbes jr senior minister of riverside church said the 
tactic of hiring permanent replacements for striking employees 
seriously undercuts managements claim to be bargaining in good 
faith 
this company is not antiunion said lisa robinson a

involved

the soviet union today gave its qualified approval 
to the use of military force to push iraqi occupiers out of kuwait 
if peaceful measures fail 
secretary of state james a baker iii came to moscow seeking at 
least soviet acquiescence to the bush administrations intention of 
having the un security council authorize the use of force to 
liberate kuwait as a last resort 
whether or not the use of force could be ruled out probably 
this could not be ruled out and a situation may emerge which 
effectively would require such a move soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze said following talks with baker 
baker said the two governments had agreed on the principle that 
a peaceful settlement to the crisis in the gulf is preferable but 
the use of force could not be ruled out 
earlier shevardnadze had said the use of force would be 
undesirable and that the no 1 task of the international 
community is to see that the un resolutions are implemented 
baker met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at his 
official country residence outside the city and held sessions with 
shevardnadze before and after that meeting 
more than three months of economic and political sanctions have 
failed to persuade iraqi president saddam hussein to reverse the 
aug 2 invasion of his smaller oilrich neighbor kuwait 
shevardnadze stressed that any decision to use force against the 
iraqis should be taken by the united nations we should not doubt 
the ability of the security council to take wise and mature 
decisions he said 
i would advise against looking for some difference in the 
positions between the soviet union and the united states 
shevardnadze said 
meanwhile differences still stood in the way of a treaty to cut 
nonnuclear weapons in europe less than two weeks before the 
landmark treaty is due for signing at a 34nation summit meeting in 
paris 
my guess is that we would be able to find a solution to all 
the problems shevardnadze said during a break in his talks with 
baker 
president bush has said he would not attend the nov 1921 
summit in paris unless the treaty is ready a us official said 
the problems were more than technical but he did not describe 
them 
hanging in the balance is another accord to cut us and soviet 
longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by 30 percent 
shevardnadze said there were some difficult problems with that 
pact which bush had hoped to sign at another summit meeting this 
winter 
the outlook is clouded by disagreement over several issues 
including how much leeway the soviets would have to keep testing 
their ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles 
a senior us official said wednesday the worldwide economic 
boycott was inadequate to force iraqi leader saddam hussein out of 
kuwait 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen told baker on tuesday in 
cairo that beijing would not block a resolution authorizing the use 
of force against iraq however the chinese minister stressed his 
governments preference for a political settlement 
baker needs acquiescence from gorbachev before the united states 
makes its move in the un security council for a resolution 
authorizing force and another demanding that iraq permit the 
resupply of the beleaguered us and british embassies in kuwait 
after more than three months of a trade cutoff and other 
sanctions the iraqi president has not budged in his determination 
to hold on to kuwait as an annexed province 
president bush and baker had expressed confidence that once the 
sanctions bit the iraqi leader would have to reassess 
as he left ankara baker said we would all like to see a 
peaceful diplomatic political solution to this problem at the 
same time it is the view of our president and the united states 
that we cannot rule out the use of force 
he added that credibility of the united nations is at stake 
one step baker took in cairo was to assure egyptian president 
hosni mubarak of logistical help getting the 14000 egyptian troops 
in saudi arabia into combat if there was a war 
gorbachevs special middle east envoy yevgeny primakov was 
more positive about the chances for peace saying there had been a 
big difference in the tenor of his discussions with saddam 
between a first meeting in september and a second on oct 27 
in the second meeting thre was no mention by saddam that 
kuwait is part of iraqi territory primakov told reporters at a 
kremlin reception 
i put it like this to him if you do not withdraw you will 
face a military strike against you he said that he was in a 
position to do something i am still optimistic

one loser in this years election planned to 
sleep for 24 hours another already is casting a hopeful glance 
toward the next contest still another is rumored to be under 
consideration for a post in president bushs cabinet 
im not a wealthy person ill get a job to pay my bills 
said rep bruce morrison dconn who failed to capture the 
gubernatorial seat in his home state 
the final outcome of tuesdays voting was a major disappointment 
for eight of the 12 house republicans and democrats who harbored 
higher political aspirations 
but three gop house members larry craig of idaho hank brown 
of colorado and bob smith of new hampshire won open senate seats 
in their home states the results were hardly a surprise as 
republicans formerly held the posts 
and in ohio rep mike dewine was elected lieutenant governor on 
a republican ticket headed by george voinovich 
an ignominious finish was evident in illinois michigan rhode 
island hawaii and iowa where the republican party had heavily 
recruited rising house gop stars to battle longtime democratic 
incumbents 
earlier this year the gop believed the senate seats were for 
the taking however it wasnt so and it left defeated republican 
candidates mulling their future 
i have no idea zip zero rep claudine schneider said 
after losing to sen claiborne pell 62 percent to 38 percent i 
am a public servant and i have not even begun to think about where 
my next service will be 
the fiveterm congresswoman considered one of the most liberal 
republicans in the house never managed a serious challenge to 
pell who chairs the senate foreign relations committee 
in illinois republican lynn martin had little to say wednesday 
after a lopsided loss to sen paul simon the democratic incumbent 
cruised to a 65 percent to 35 percent victory even winning 
martins home county 
martin has been mentioned as a possible replacement for 
elizabeth dole who stepped down as bushs labor secretary to head 
the american red cross 
and a defeated republican might also land a job in the 
administration as director of drug control policy william bennett 
is resigning 
questioned about future jobs in the administration for either 
martin or schneider white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
wednesday that no decisions had been made bush reiterated that at 
a news conference thursday 
fitzwater described martin and schneider as good candidates whom 
the administration plans to work with on their futures 
rep tom tauke riowa who failed to unseat democratic sen tom 
harkin said he planned to sleep for 24 hours he also expressed an 
interest in returning to the state to work with the people of 
iowa perhaps in teaching 
in michigan rep bill schuette lost to democratic sen carl 
levin 58 percent to 42 percent despite the republicans upset 
victory in the gubernatorial race john engler knocked off 
incumbent democrat james blanchard 
the win for engler could be a blessing in disguise for the 
37yearold schuette who could receive a job in the state 
government until a possible challenge to michigans other senator 
democrat donald riegle 
riegles reputation has been tarnished by his ties to the 
savings and loan scandal 
im taking a break from politics i have no immediate plans 
schuette said after the loss 
in hawaii rep patricia saiki failed to defeat democratic sen 
daniel akaka but already is being mentioned as a possible candidate 
for governor in 1994 or perhaps for a cabinet post in the 
administration 
democratic rep joseph brennan who once served as governor of 
maine failed in his bid to return to the post but vowed to remain 
in public life after more than 30 years of service 
elsewhere in new england republican rep john rowland and 
morrison lost to independent lowell weicker in a close race for 
governor of connecticut in his concession speech the 33yearold 
rowland indicated future bids are in the offing 
perhaps the state of connecticut was not ready for a new 
generation of leadership but sometime in the future they will 
be rowland said 
morrison who discussed doing political work outside an elective 
office said after the loss that he wanted to get a good nights 
sleep

a man who opened fire on red square during the 
revolution day parade has been charged with committing a terrorist 
act a spokesman for the kgb secret police said thursday 
alexander a shmonov 38 of leningrad will undergo psychiatric 
tests to determine whether he was sane at the time of the shooting 
wednesday said alexei kandaurov deputy director of the kgb public 
relations office he gave no other details on the case 
no one was hurt in the incident in which the man pulled out the 
hunting rifle in the heavily guarded square about 80 yards from 
president mikhail s gorbachev the shooting came during a 
communist party march that followed the military parade 
a plainclothes officer knocked the weapon away as the man fired 
once into the air and again into the ground newspapers said he 
then was subdued by about 20 plainclothes officers and carried into 
the gum department store across the square from gorbachev 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze played down what may 
have been an assassination attempt categorically denying that it 
indicated a loss of public support for gorbachevs perestroika 
reform policies 
i dont think this incident should be taken very seriously 
shevardnadze told reporters before meeting with visiting secretary 
of state james a baker iii this is a huge country where 
something is always happening somewhere 
shmonov was interrogated and spoke in detail about his 
preparations for the act the official tass news agency quoted kgb 
investigator pyotr sokolov as saying 
soviet deputy prosecutor janis dzenitis on thursday sanctioned 
shmonovs arrest tass reported shomonov is charged with 
committing an attempted terrorist act the news agency quoted 
sokolov as saying 
kandaurov could not confirm a report by one newspaper that the 
gunman was carrying a light explosive in addition to the rifle 
the conservative labor newspaper trud said shmonov was carrying 
a small explosive usually used for military rehearsals that could 
cause no serious damage 
kandaurov said the man was carrying at least one device but 
added that laboratory tests would have to confirm whether it was an 
explosive 
it is hard to tell now whom he was aiming at trud said 
but one thing is clear if it were not for the immediate reaction

william bennett stepping down today as 
president bushs antidrug abuse chief said convicted cocaine user 
mayor marion barry made his job harder because he was part of the 
problem 
bennett said that as head of the office of national drug control 
strategy he devoted special attention and resources to the 
district of columbia not to make it a showcase but because it was 
a basket case 
bennett was asked how barrys cocaine problems which resulted 
in a conviction for cocaine possession and a sixmonth prison 
sentence affected the bush administrations efforts on drugs 
did the fact that the mayor used cocaine and crack make it 
easier or harder it made it harder he said you got a real 
serious problem when the chief executive officer of the city that 
has a drug problem is taking crack i didnt know it at the 
time but i suspected that his interest in the topic was different 
from mine and we were going to get less than 100 percent 
cooperation 
he said however he did not find any hard evidence that would 
have held up in a court of law about barrys drug use 
i did not think he was part of the solution hes part of the 
problem said bennett who was criticized in some quarters for 
bringing the federal antidrug effort into washington dc 
without much consultation of city officials 
bennett gave a vote of confidence to the citys mayor elect 
sharon pratt dixon a democrat who beat the republican bush 
supported maurice turner 
bennett also said that a frequent critic of his drug policy 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select committee 
on narcotics abuse and control is a gas bag he has nothing to 
do with drug policy 
president bush accepting bennetts resignation saying he had 
done a superb job for this country in fighting the war against 
drugs 
asked if he had anyone in mind to replace bennett or labor 
secretary elizabeth dole who resigned two weeks ago bush said 
not yet i havent even begun to sit down seriously with lists 
bennett said that he is leaving government to become a fellow at 
the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank 
as to speculation he might seek public office the outspoken 
conservative said not any time soon 
with his trademark feistiness bennett said he wanted to dispel 
rumors he was leaving out of unhappiness 
so far i have read that i am bored restive restless tired 
unhappy moping about lack of media attention sulking about not 
being in the cabinet in a snit with john sununu all sorts of 
things and being stampeded out of town 
bennett said it there are people who dont like me but that 
im not the stampeded out of town type 
bennett was asked about reports of threats against his life 
during the time he headed the governments efforts against drug 
kingpins 
theres threats they have been there since the beginning of 
this job he said but he brushed off that aspect as a factor in 
his decision to leave 
he said that when he traveled to alaska on an antidrug mission 
he received some anonymous threats from some pot heads that 
they were going to blow me up but the effort misfired he said 
because one of the notices from the pothead societies said come 
confront bennett but it was distributed after he already had 
left the state 
bennett plans to complete a book contract that he had agreed to 
before he took the antidrug job friends said the book deal was 
to focus on his experiences as education secretary under president 
reagan but bennett also is interested in writing about the drug 
war one source said 
he is expected also to speak on the lecture circuit

secretary of state james a baker iii today gained ground in his 
attempt to win support for a un resolution authorizing military 
action against iraq when the soviet union gave its qualified 
approval for using force 
also today iraqs army newspaper and us officials said saddam 
hussein has replaced his military chief of staff with the head of 
the elite republican guards western analysts said the move could 
indicate dissension within the military over saddams decision to 
invade kuwait and annex it despite condemnation by the west and the 
deployment of the multinational force 
it was the second replacement of a highlevel iraqi official in 
two weeks and also pointed to a tightening of saddams inner 
circle 
in another development today former german chancellor willy 
brandt secured the release of 50 more westerners trapped in iraq in 
a second meeting with saddam the iraqi news agency reported it 
listed those to be freed as 20 germans 15 italians 10 dutch and 
five britons it did not say when they will be able to travel out 
or provide their names 
on wednesday saddam agreed to allow 100 germans and 20 people 
of other nationalities to leave in response to a plea from brandt 
he is the latest of several former government officials who have 
come to iraq seeking the release of captives hundreds of other 
hostages many of them americans remain trapped in iraq some held 
as human shields at strategic sites to forestall an attack by 
the usled mutinational force 
at the united nations diplomats said on wednesday that the 
united states has readied a security council resolution that would 
authorize the use of military force to drive iraq from kuwait 
if such a measure were adopted it would be the first time the 
un authorized a joint military command during the korean war it 
authorized the united states to command the un forces repelling 
north koreas invasion 
the text has not yet been circulated because baker is trying to 
line up support for it on a middle eastern and european tour said 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in moscow baker met today with president mikhail s gorbachev 
and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze baker wants moscow to 
acquiesce to using force as a last resort to liberate kuwait which 
iraq seized on aug 2 
whether or not the use of force could be ruled out probably 
this could not be ruled out and a situation may emerge which 
effectively would require such a move shevardnadze said after 
the talks 
he reiterated however that any decision to use force against 
iraq should be taken by the united nations 
i would advise against looking for some difference in the 
positions between the soviet union and the united states 
shevardnadze told reporters 
earlier at the opening of his first session with baker 
shevardnadze had said the use of force against iraq would be 
undesirable 
the patience of us and british officials with iraq appears to 
be running short on wednesday in her strongest statement yet 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher said time is running 
out for a peaceful solution 
but egyptian president hosni mubarak said in an interview with 
the new york times today that the multinational force massed in 
saudi arabia to counter iraq should give the un sanctions at 
least two to three more months about 14000 egyptians are in the 
multinational force 
iraqs army newspaper alqadissiya today disclosed in an article 
about a graduation ceremony that gen hussein rashid head of the 
revolutionary guards is the new chief of staff it did not say 
when he was named or what happened to gen nizar alkhazraji 
chief of staff since 1985 the change of personnel was confirmed by 
officials in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
saddam regularly purges those he perceives as a threat and the 
republican guards are considered saddams best troops 
but one londonbased analyst called the firing very 
ominous 
khazrajis dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to 
saddam within the military who after all may have to take on the 
multinational force said the analyst hansheino kopietz he 
works with control risks an international security firm in 
the us officials who confirmed khazrajis dismissal said he 
was replaced because he had objected to saddams decision to invade 
kuwait 
meanwhile 260 poles left for home today aboard an iraqi jet 
after saddams government agreed they had fulfilled work contracts 
and were free to go a polish embassy spokesman said 
more than 70 japanese freed by iraq arrived today in tokyo and 
three britons two australians and a dutchman arrived in amman 
ten british women left for baghdad today against the advice of 
their government hoping to secure the release of their loved ones 
they urged restraint by the countries facing off with iraq 
iraq still holds hundreds of americans britons japanese 
german and other westerners calling them guests some have 
been put at strategic installations as human shields against a 
feared attack

president bush said today republicans didnt 
do as well as he had hoped in midterm elections and that the lesson 
he learned from tuesdays defeats of incumbent governors was that 
people feel theyve been taxed too much 
he said he would absolutely promise to oppose any new tax 
increases however bush hedged somewhat adding that sometimes 
you run into realities 
in a gloomy assessment about the economy bush said were in 
some tough times right now he said he would consult with 
economists both in and out of the government to discuss ways to 
soften the blow 
bush avoided use of the word recession describing the 
economy as in a slowdown 
in his first public appearance since the disappointment of 
election night bush was asked whether he thought he had damaged 
himself politically by accepting 140 billion in tax increases as 
part of a budget reduction accord with the democrats 
i oppose raising taxes he said we had this one 
compromise and that just reenforced my views he added i 
dont think what i did was popular with anyone but like the umpire 
youve got to call them as you see them 
bush said i wish i had a congress that would do it just my 
way because i am convinced we can do it cut the deficit without 
any tax increases but he acknowledged that voters had rebuffed 
his campaign efforts to put more republicans in the house in the 
senate instead the gop lost ground in both legislative chambers 
im not talking victory after moderate gop losses in the 
house and senate six incumbent governors of both parties went 
down to defeat generally reflecting tax or economic woes 
bush said he expected democrats would attempt to pass more tax 
hikes and said theyre going to do it over my dead veto 
if thats the case were in for a whale of a fight he said 
were not going to compromise on that 
he revived his nonewtax pledge saying can i make a promise 
i wont support them absolutely but sometimes you run into some 
realities but im girding up my loins to go into batle to beat 
back the tax attempts that i think are coming 
house speaker tom foley said on wednesday there is support among 
democats for attempting to pass a surtax on millionaires one of 
the provisions that was omitted from the deficit reduction plan 
that the president signed earlier this week 
at the same time bush said republican losses in gubernatorial 
and congressional races were well below historical trends for a 
party that controls the white house he said the results wont 
tie my hands at all in dealing with the democraticcontrolled 
102nd congress that convenes in january 
bush ducked a question about his own reelection plans for 1992 
he is widely expected to run for a second term his remarks came in 
a press conference that followed his appearance with retiring drug 
policy administrator official william bennett 
bennett said he believed bush would run for reelection and win 
bush said he was not at the point of deciding on a replacement 
for bennett or elizabeth dole who announced last month she was 
resigning as labor secretary 
bush turned aside attempts to question him about the persian 
gulf where the administration is expected to increase the current 
force of more than 200000 troops 
bush offered his assessment of the midterm elections after 
nearly complete returns showed a democratic gain of one seat in the 
senate and nine in the house several incumbent governors of both 
parties were turned out of office and democrats took away the 
governorships in texas and florida 
bush mentioned two other politicallycharged issues he said he 
would be submitting a new crime bill to congress and called on the 
democrats to pass it 
and he said he would submit a civil rights bill that would not 
include hiring quotas the president vetoed a civil rights bill in 
the final days of the congressional session saying it would lead 
to hiring quotas the senate sustained the veto by one vote

advertisements in major newspapers and on television to support 
president bushs policies in the persian gulf 
sam zakhem a former us ambassador to bahrain said in a 
telephone interview from denver colo that he and others formed 
coalition for america at risk two months ago whn some 
conservatives seemed to waver in their support of bushs decision 
to send 225000 troops to defend saudi arabia 
many people run out of patience and this is a very important 
thing for the national interest of the united states he said 
the coalitions prominent rightwing members include david keene 
of the american conservative union retired maj gen john k 
singlaub who was involved in sending weapons to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels in the reagan administration and doug wead who 
resigned earlier this year as bushs liaison to conservative and 
religious groups 
to bolster support for bush the coalition took out ads in 
several newspapers as well as on television 
support president bush and the brave men and women of 
operation desert shield working to free kuwait reads part of a 
fullpage ad 
it has appeared in the new york times the wall street journal 
the los angeles times the washington times the washington post 
and usa today a fullpage ad in the washington posts front 
section costs 19000 
zakhem said he informed bush of the coalitions plan in early 
september a recent public opinion poll by abc news found about 65 
percent of americans approve of bushs handling of the gulf crisis 
zakhem said the ads are being paid for by the coalitions 
wellheeled backers 
but otalie english a spokeswoman for keene shirley amp 
associates the public relations firm representing the coalition 
said the campaign is supposed to be selfsupporting once it gets 
off the ground 
the newspaper ad invites readers to call a tollfree telephone 
number for a free emergency action kit 
english said the kit includes a bumper sticker and several 900 
telephone numbers callers can for a fee receive updates on the 
situation in kuwait and learn to set up a grassroots organizing 
campaign she said 
the tollfree number has been flooded with requests zakhem 
said 
he said the coalition hopes for a peaceful solution to the gulf 
crisis but he added that question is up to iraqi president saddam 
hussein

with pulsating pelvises two male police 
officers wrapped their legs around a microphone stand and got down 
on all fours and shook their posteriors at a jury 
the performance wednesday was intended to mimic the dancing of 
nude women in the chippendolls nightclub the officers hoped to 
offend the jurors and convince them that the dancing was obscene 
instead they made the jurors smile and drew laughter from 
courtroom spectators 
the jury began deliberations thursday 
the trial of jennie davis 24 was expected to help establish 
the richland countys standards of obscenity three other dancers 
are to go on trial at a later date 
solicitor jim morton pleaded with jurors to ignore the humorous 
aspects of the case 
the officers arent too excited about getting out here and 
dancing a little morton said but you are being asked today to 
determine what the community of richland county will allow or not 
allow 
but jurors and spectators laughed when ms davis attorney 
brian dumas submitted copies of playboy magazine to show that 
county residents can obtain material that is just as sexually 
suggestive as nude dancing 
the officers jim potash and scott desrochers admitted during 
crossexamination they had purchased playboy for themselves or 
viewed xrated movies at home 
the us supreme court has ruled that nude dancing that is not 
obscene is protected under the constitution communities must 
define their own obscenity standard based on what forms of 
expression are so offensive that the average citizen would find 
them obscene 
ms davis is charged with exposing her body in an obscene 
manner a misdemeanor that carries a maximum punishment of six 
months in jail or a 500 fine 
columbia police arrested the dancers and the nightclubs manager 
during an early morning raid july 28 after a fourweek 
investigation

at bellevue hospitals intensive care unit wednesday but entered no 
plea

he was conscious but unable to speak during wednesdays

since april 1988 maintaining the manhattan court complexs air 
conditioning and heating systems 
joe warren a general services supervisor said nosair was a 
good employee and the transfer was routine 
from time to time we just send our people around he said 
warren said he was unaware nosair was unhappy newsday cited an 
anonymous source who said he threw a tantrum but john beckman a 
spokesman for the general services department said today that he 
had checked into the newspapers report and concluded that story of

the us economy if it does topple into a 
recession will be rescued by an export boom led by foreign demand 
for chemicals aircraft and scientific equipment a trade group 
said thursday 
the national association of manufacturers said a survey of 120 
of its member companies found them expecting exports to double from 
10 percent of their total sales to 20 percent by 1993 
an export boom has accounted for more than onethird of total 
economic growth in the country since 1986 american companies have 
benefited from a weaker dollar which has boosted demand for us 
products overseas 
with the us economy mired in a period of sluggish growth and 
possibly headed for a recession many analysts believe domestic 
demand will remain weak for some time 
the best opportunities for american companies and the american 
economy are going to be outside us borders between now and 
1995 said jerry jasinowski the president of nam 
in forecasting which american products will do well the nam 
report said highgrowth export areas such as chemicals aircraft 
and scientific instruments should continue strong 
foreign sales of us chemicals jumped 70 percent between 1985 
and 1989 while aircraft sales were up by 67 percent and scientific 
instruments climbed a sharp 75 percent during the same time period 
in its report us manufacturers in world export markets 
the trade group said traditional industries such as machine tools 
textiles and paper products would also see export growth in coming 
years however america is still running trade deficits in those 
areas because of foreign sales in this country the group said 
while much attention has focused on the emerging economies of 
eastern europe as potential markets for us goods the nam report 
said those countries were likely to play only a small role in 
boosting export sales in coming years 
the countries of western europe and canada now buy more than 50 
percent of us manufacturing exports and the nam report forecast 
demand for us goods would remain strong especially with the 
creation of a single market in the 12nation european community 
thats scheduled to take place in 1992 
more modest trade opportunities will be found in eastern europe 
mexico and china the report said 
us companies traditionally have been more interested in the 
huge us market but jasinowski said the growing importance of 
exports had made many industries reconsider their sales strategy to 
place more emphasis on foreign markets 
he said that with many economists forecasting a recession 
issues of how to promote economic growth were likely to move to the 
forefront a primary area of opportunity should be boosting 
americas competitiveness by removing foreign trade barriers he 
said 
one key way to do that he said would be to have a successful 
conclusion of a fouryear effort to reform world trade rules the 
talks involving more than 100 countries under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade are scheduled to conclude 
in december

decent call

a philosopher proposes applying the same 
legal standard to abortions as is widely used in determining if a 
person is dead is the subjects brain active 
a model law proposed at an international conference in iowa 
city called the uniform determination of life protection act 
would permit abortion of a fetus until the 70th day or 10th week 
after conception 
hansmartin sass of the kennedy institute of ethics said that 
after the 70th day the fetus should be a protected human life 
because it then begins developing a brain capable of determining 
individual characteristics and thought processes 
the absence of brainspecific cells in early embryonal 
development could be understood as the absence of brainlife he 
said in that case abortion of inanimate life must be legally 
protected 
sass senior research fellow at the washington dcbased 
kennedy institute and professor of philosophy at georgetown 
university proposed the act at a university of iowa symposium that 
ended wednesday he also is codirector of the center for medical 
ethics in bocum germany 
about 60 medical ethics and legal experts from 15 countries 
attended the fourday symposium to examine when life actually 
begins 
the proposed act essentially describes protected human life as 
starting when the brain begins to function and ending at death 
when the person is declared braindead that life could be called 
brainlife sass said 
advances in technology forced doctors to consider the value of 
human life when organs such as the heart stop functioning an event 
that previously would have meant death sass said because of that 
a uniform determination of death act was created to define when a 
person is braindead many state statutes are based on that model 
in strong contrast to the consensus regarding the end of life 
we do not have a uniform understanding regarding the beginning of 
human life which has to be morally recognized and legally 
protected sass told symposium participants 
sass said the model act would not force a person opposed to 
abortion or contraception into using either method people should 
be free to exercise their own personal philosophical and religious 
views when dealing with themselves he said 
he rejected claims that aborting a fetus before its brain 
develops unfairly destroys that fetus potential for becoming a 
specific human being 
we violate the potentiality principle all the time sass 
said every lost opportunity for cohabitation violates the 
principle so do all forms of contraception chastity of priests

here is the text of president bushs morning 
news conference on thursday 
president bush well i am announcing today that bill bennett 
americas first director of the office of national drug policy has 
offered his resignation and with much regret i have accepted it 
his decision to return to private life is obviously welcome news to 
his family but there is no doubt that his energetic contributions 
to public life will be sorely missed 
when we took office bill bennett took on one of the most 
important initiatives of our administration the national drug 
control strategy our blueprint if you will for the war on drugs 
and he confronted the problem head on helping lead americas 
determined effort to take back the streets and his hard work has 
paid off we devoted unprecedented new resources to the fight new 
money new material new manpower for law enforcement for 
treatment for prevention and never before has so much effort 
involving so many people been applied to the battle against drugs 
bills efforts have helped spark a fundamental change in 
attitude an awareness that drugs can take away your family your 
job your health your freedom and indeed your very life as we 
have seen on the road first hand hes inspired communities across 
the country to get involved in this battle and i have enjoyed my 
many travels with him 
both bill and i are encouraged by recent very promising signs 
that suggest the drug problem is diminishing not only in the 
suburbs but in the cities as well and i know he believes as i 
do that were on the road to victory so were going to stick to 
our comprehensive drug strategy were going to renew our call for 
congress to pass a true crime bill one thats tough on criminals 
not on the police and my administration will remain on the front 
lines until this scourge is stopped 
on behalf of all americans i want to thank bill for his 
leadership on this issue and express my gratitude for all that he 
has done to unite the nation against the scourge of drugs block by 
block school by school child by child we will take back the 
streets and we will never surrender and bill bennett has done a 
superb job for this country and i will always be very very 
grateful to him now id like to ask him to say a word or two and 
then id be glad to take a couple of questions and im sure he 
would as well 
bennett thank you sir thank you very much 
bush well done 
bennett thank you mr president thank you very much for your 
words and for the confidence that you put in me in asking me take 
this job as you remember i volunteered for the job i had an 
opportunity earlier on in the reagan administration to serve this 
country and the children of this country and then to have a second 
opportunity to do that was a rare privilege indeed 
all i want to say now and of course ill be happy to take 
questions later on about our policies and our programs but all i 
want to say now again is thank you and talk a minute about the 
difference that you have made 
your taking this issue on your saying in that inaugural address 
that this scourge will stop coincided with the great american 
change of mind about drugs but your leadership at crucial points 
has made a great deal of difference you said in your inaugural the 
scourge will stop that was against the advice of some to take on 
this issue but you took it on 
second you remember that trip to cartagena and many advised 
you not to go and public opinion polls were advising you not to 
go but we thought it was serious you thought it was serious and 
merited your being there and you were there 
about a month and a half ago when we issued our report 
update on the war on drugs you stated again that this was a 
top priority of yours you have been there every time we have asked 
you to be there and you have taken this issue unto yourself the 
american people know that and are grateful to you for it 
the elections midterm elections just took place no one has 
commented because i guess it hasnt been noticed yet but there was 
hardly any sign during those elections that any democrats sought to 
challenge you on the issue of drugs because you are credible 
because you have taken this task up because everyone knows that 
you have taken it seriously and made an unprecedented commitment 
while were on politics its my belief mr president you will 
conclude this term very successfully you will be reelected as 
president of the united states in 1992 and in 1996 you will be 
thanked by your countrymen for a profound and great service not 
least of which because in 1996 when the american people look at 
this issue they will see the drug problem much improved thank you 
very much sir

a judge today barred the cable news network from 
televising recordings of telephone conversations between jailed 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega and his attorneys cnn called 
the order unconstitutional and said network will continue our 
coverage 
its becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure 
that both parties get a fair trial us district judge william 
hoeveler said as details of the tapes came out in court 
following an emergency hearing this morning the judge ordered 
the network not to televise any tape that could infringe on 
noriegas attorneyclient privilege 
the emergency hearing revolving around attorneyclient issues 
and first amendment rights was called after cnn used excerpts from 
the jailhouse tapes this morning and said it planned to televise 
another installment this evening 
after issuing a temporary injunction hoeveler said he would 
continue to study the issue and expected to have a final decision 
by around 6 pm when the network was scheduled to have the second 
installment 
cnn president tom johnson issued a statement saying that an 
appeal of the temporary injunction was being readied and adding 
because of our belief the order is unconstitutional we will 
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the 
courts 
cnn attorney daniel waggoner said an any order even one of a 
few hours as the court has imposed here that prevents any 
publication or telecast is an unconstitutional prior restraint 
steve haworth cnn spokesman said the network was continuing to 
televise a segment that was first used this morning which includes 
segments of noriega audio tapes that do not involve his attorneys 
haworth declined to comment on whether any tapes involving 
attorneys would be used later 
federal prison officials said inmates phone conversations are 
routinely monitored except when they are talking to their lawyers 
but cnn said in its report this morning that it has a tape which 
appears to be excepts of a conversation between noriega and his 
defense team cnn has also been shown evidence that there are other 
such recordings 
conversations between a lawyer and client are deemed to be legal 
secrets except in extraordinary circumstances 
noriega has been held at the metropolitan correctional center 
southwest of miami since shortly after he surrendered to us 
troops in panama following the invasion last december 
he is awaiting trial on a february 1988 drug trafficking 
indictment accusing him of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling 
operations through his country 
noriega attorney frank rubino told the judge that a cnn team 
informed him wednesday night they had obtained seven recordings 
made by the justice department at the metropolitan correctional 
center 
cnn televised excerpts today offering a translation of a 
spanish conversation between noriega and an unidentified man about 
consolidating noriegas power base in panama and a message to the 
cuban embassy in panama 
but cnn also played another tape for rubino who identified it 
as noriegas conversation with three defense team members 
can general noriega receive a fair trial when every day we 
wake up to the threat of our case strategy being aired to 400 
million listeners and the prosecution learning details of our 
defense rubino asked 
without a doubt this is the most serious violation of 
attorneyclient privilege i have ever experienced in my years of 
practice rubino told hoeveler 
the judge asked waggoner whether he thought the network had the 
right to shoot his noriegas defense right in the head by 
cablecasting the tapes 
gregory bogdan spokesman for the us bureau of prisons in 
washington said all telephone calls leaving federal prisons are 
monitored 
all prisoners sign a release form in both english and spanish 
notifying them of the procedure and signs are posted over prison 
phones reminding inmates that the calls are monitored he said 
but if they let us know they are calling their attorney then 
we dont monitor them bogdan said 
tapes are kept to prevent crimes from being planned behind bars 
and are not normally released he said 
he said he did not know if cnns tapes were official government 
tapes adding right now the matter is under investigation 
where the tapes came from where they were made 
hoeveler said he would order the fbi to determine the source of 
the tapes 
prosecutors told the judge they had not heard the tapes and 
would be blindfolded during the investigation of how they were 
released

q mr president margaret thatcher said yesterday that either 
saddam hussein must get out of kuwait soon or britain and its 
allies will remove him by force do you agree with that and how 
soon 
a well let me say i should have thrown a caveat in im going 
to take some questions on the middle east this afternoon so if 
youll excuse me ill defer them till then but im not i wont 
take any now on that subject at all 
q do you have a replacement 
q all right what about politics 
a sure try that 
q ok you went around the country telling americans you had to 
have more republicans in congress to get the economy going and to 
cut the deficit you didnt get any more republicans in fact you 
lost a little ground what does that mean for your relationship 
with congress 
a hey listen it means i didnt do as well as id like and 
id like to have had more i still feel that way i think if you 
want to put it in proper perspective i think everyone is aware of 
the fact that the party in power normally loses in an offyear and 
im told we did a little better than the norm but that doesnt 
make me happy id like to have more republicans 
q well does it tie your hands now i mean the fact that 
a no it doesnt tie my hands it has the changes were very 
small i regret terribly the loss of senator boschwitz hes an 
outstanding republican member of the senate but we lose one there 
i dont want to go into a lot of political statistics but im told 
thats far fewer than normally happens in an off year 
and certainly in the house nine compared to some of the 
gloomanddoom predictions there is not as substantial but hey 
look everyone that we dropped i dont like i dont like to see 
us lose seats at all id like to see us gain 
yeah helen 
q mr president do you have a replacement for bennett and do 
you have a replacement for elizabeth dole as a result of the 
election 
a not yet not yet and i havent even begun to really sit down 
seriously with lists bill out of courtesy whispered in my ear 
not so long ago that he wanted to go back to private life and 
maybe ive just been hoping he would think more rationally but i 
understand that i love his family and it is right for him and his 
family and somehow i think thats going to prove to be right for 
me and this administration in the long run 
but i have no but weve got to start soon on that helen and 
we havent i wanted to wait till after the election keep my 
focus on the campaign trail and then on these big problems were 
wrestling with halfway around the world but we so im not 
misleading you ive heard a lot of names floated but were not 
down to the decisionmaking point on either of these two or 
q well will it be a woman and will it be 
a well as i say were not there yet so i cant help you 
nice try however yeah 
q mr president a couple of months ago predictions were that 
republicans might actually make gains in the midterm election 
a hey listen thats what i wanted 
q their fortune seemed to turn when you changed your mind on 
the possibility of new taxes and then during the drawnout budget 
process to what extent do you blame yourself if at all for the 
republican showing in this past election 
a well i think if the past year were significantly different 
than other years in other words if wed taken a bath for every 
year off year heretofore people had gained the party in power 
i think maybe i would have had to accept a little more 
responsibility and blame im not talking victory because i am very 
disappointed the way some of the races turned out 
and i on the other hand when you look overall i think most 
people that understand american politics are saying this 
administration did not come out worse than predecessors indeed 
some make the point that we came out a little better so its 
pretty hard to assess that 
and i havent looked at it in terms of those who supported the 
budget package whether they did worse than others but i made very 
clear to the american people i was concerned with some of the 
provisions in the budget package i happen to believe in the long 
run its going to prove in the best interests of this country and 
so im not suggesting that that was popular or made me popular with 
everybody but i cant really answer it till we see a little more 
analysis youve asked a very technical question in a sense 
yeah 
q mr president are you running for reelection in 1992 
a ann im going to put you down as one of the first ill let 
know when i make that decision no decision has been made 
you all go through this kind of coy dance now for a while the 
minute the election is over everybody shifts gear and starts 
pointing at 92 its understandable so therefore i understand 
where youre coming from but i cant give you an answer yet 
more

q are you giving any consideration to not running is that a 
possibility 
a not today not today im shifting gears now and trying to 
shift into the role of trying to lead this country in getting 
things done and were going to have a good agenda to take to the 
congress and clearly i want to see the country remain united in 
our determination to succeed halfway around the world so i really 
have not started a focus on 92 
yeah 
q mr president some of the polling taken in conjunction with 
the election exit polls and so forth showed an impression growing 
in the country that the united states is headed for war in the 
middle east and very serious economic problems here at home would 
you address those fears 
a well im concerned about the economic situation ive been 
very frank about that i will be meeting with our top economic 
people in the next few days a series of meetings both inside 
top economic people in the white house and then ill be inviting 
some others in to talk about it because i am concerned about a 
slowdown in this economy 
and im concerned what that means to the average working man in 
this country and the women that are work with their kids having 
to support them i mean its a terrible worry that people have and 
id like weve been enjoying rather robust growth for many years 
and now we all know the economy is slower so i want to be sure 
that to the degree a president can do something to soften the blow 
or to stimulate economic growth that he tries to do it so well be 
having a lot of discussion about that and what was your part on 
the gulf 
q about the prospects forwar in the persian gulf 
a well ive been very clear that we want to see the sanctions 
be so successful that we dont have to have anybody shooting over 
there and ive also said were not ruling any options out 
yeah 
q sir are you getting a lot of free advice on which way to go 
for the next couple of years 
a yes 
q mr viguerie and howard phillips are telling you youve got 
to go right and reestablish your conservative credentials marlin 
did remind us yesterday that you are a conservative but people 
like ed rollins are saying youve got to be more broadbased and go 
after the democrats which way do you what do you see now have 
you got to appeal to a wider section and have you got to go after 
blacks again after the veto of the civil rights bill 
a well one of the things that since you raised the civil 
rights bill is that i want to have a good civil rights bill and 
so well be sending one up early on it will not have quotas it 
will not lead to quotas it will be fair play in trying to 
eliminate discrimination in the workplace 
and there were some politics involved in that john we sent a 
bill up there that was a very good bill and the leaders wouldnt 
even permit it to be voted on because they thought they could stick 
me with being anticivil rights i am procivil rights i am 
profairness in the workplace against discrimination in the 
workplace 
and we can fashion that kind of civil rights legislation if we 
can get some of the politics out of it and maybe we can as we 
start a new congress because ive got a good record in that 
regard i have not changed in that regard but i dont think it is 
fair to recommend to the american people legislation that in my 
view would inevitably result in quotas but now were out of the 
political giveandtake on that and i think maybe we can get 
something positive done 
q can i ask you about that reaching out in a broadbased way 
and would you reach out to ed rollins are you willing to work with 
him and let him stay on 
a all right look im not going to get into this beltway 
stuff one of the things that i loved was outside you know i got 
needled by some lets see if i can find him or her here writer 
about saying its nice to be outside of the beltway it is i 
didnt get one single question about the future of any individual 
consultant or member of whatever congressional or senate committee 
or national committee we stayed on different subjects so yes 
were here but im not my mind is out there so i refuse to get 
into all of that 
yes ann 
q mr president as you approach the new congress do you think 
you will be able to extend the hand of friendship the way you the 
tone of the first your first inaugural or do you think this will 
be partisan and confrontational from the outset 
a well it takes two to when you extend the hand somebody 
else has to reach out and shake it and weve been through a highly 
partisan political dance here for a while its the great american 
way and those with whom i have worked cooperatively needless to 
say went out and tried to bash the president and weve heard all 
kinds of rhetoric about how i should be doing things differently 
but look there are going to be certain things where we will 
continue to try to work with the congress i also will be doing 
you know being sure i can do the best job i can in leading a 
united republican party we have some he mentioned a couple of 
critics that arent in the congress or anything who theres 
nothing i can do to placate those who have been some of the 
severest critics of ronald reagan even so im not going to even 
worry about that 
but i do think that its worth trying to move the country 
forward and on some areas were going to have to do it and on 
some im going to be appealing strongly for democratic support and 
in some im going to use the veto so as to stop a lot of bad things 
from happening to this country and that veto power is there and i 
am more determined than ever to use it

new york reps chuck schumer and stephen 
solarz won reelection with 80 percent of the vote but they might 
already be thinking about their next jobs 
redistricting could put them out of work in 1992 
the onceadecade debate now begins to get personal 19 house 
districts need to be erased in 13 states that lost population in 
the 1980s 
in the bigego ambitionfilled world of politics that wont be 
easy 
the decisions will be made next year in most cases by state 
legislatures if history is any guide members of congress who 
could be affected by the plans will have considerable input in 
person and through contributions to state lawmakers who draft the 
plans 
the thing we fear most is being thrown into a district with 
another colleague rep henry hyde rill said last year we 
are at the tender mercy of those whose agendas are not necessarily 
our own 
in most states losing seats including all losing more than one 
power of redistricting is shared between democrats and republicans 
that generally means the losses or at least the risk of losses 
will be shared too 
because available census data ostensibly the guide for 
redistricting is preliminary and the process so complex its 
difficult to say with any certainty who will be squeezed out or 
forced into a race with another incumbent and retirements or bids 
for other office would affect the outcome 
here is a statebystate look at early speculation among 
consultants for both parties 
new york 3 a republican district upstate likely will be 
eliminated probably rep bill paxons and two districts in new 
york city are vulnerable leading to speculation that brooklyn 
districts represented by schumer and solarz could be merged 
but the possibilities arenearly endless in the 20district 
city 
queens democrat james scheuer will be 72 in 1992 and could 
retire or be squeezed out democrats schumer or solarz might 
challenge republican sen alfonse damato 
if retirements ambition or other developments dont make the 
third cut clear republican bill green and democrat ted weiss might 
find themselves in the same district 
pennsylvania 2 the pittsburgh and philadelphia areas each 
will lose a seat several members of the delegation are in their 
mid60s so retirements are possible 
otherwise democrat joseph kolters district might be carved up 
in the west and a republican incumbent perhaps curt weldon pitted 
against a democratic incumbent maybe thomas foglietta in the 
philadelphia suburbs 
ohio 2 a clevelandarea democrat maybe edward feighan and 
a downstate republican are vulnerable republicans clarence miller 
and chalmers wylie could retire 
illinois 2 the chicagoarea seat to be lost is likely to be 
dan rostenkowski or sidney yates 
if rostenkowski retires in 1992 hes eligible to keep 1 
million in campaign money and yates who will have been in 
congress for 42 years will be 83 and could call it quits 
the other seat will come from republican country in the north 
michigan 2 republican william broomfield will be 70 in two 
years and might retire if not he could end up in a race against 
fellow republican carl pursell 
the other seat likely will come from the democratic detroit 
area 
massachusetts 1 unless republican silvio conte or democrat 
joe early retires a democrat will be squeezed perhaps into a race 
against rep joseph kennedy 
the prime candidates are chester atkins and ed markey both of 
whom have enemies in the state legislature controversial barney 
frank is another possibility 
new jersey 1 democrats control the pen so newly elected 
republican rep richard zimmer could be in trouble but his wont 
be the easiest district to draw out 
kentucky 1 democrats will draw the lines republican rep 
larry hopkins looks like the odd man out forced either to run 
against a gop colleague or for another office if he wants to stay 
in politics 
west virginia 1 democrats control the process but all four 
house members are democrats one will be squeezed out probably 
either alan mollohan and harley staggers 
louisiana 1 democrats control the process which likely 
means bad news for one of the delegations four republicans 
kansas 1 democrat jim slattery was the oddson favorite to 
go until democrats took the governors office and state house from 
gop hands 
he could still end up in a race against a republican colleague 
but with better odds 
iowa 1 republicans have a say but the population losses in 
the western part of the state might force gop reps jim ross 
lightfoot and fred grandy into the same district anyway 
montana 1 the state goes from two seats to one forcing 
democrat pat williams against republican ron marlenee unless one 
bows out

i was elected to take this country in a certain direction and 
the liberals in the congress want to take it in another direction 
so our system decrees who wins how are we going to move it and 
theyre going to shoot stuff back at me over and over again that i 
cannot accept now will i try to avoid that will i say to them on 
the civil rights bill look i want civil rights and i dont want 
quotas you tried it your way now lets give me a vote my way 
absolutely i have to do that thats part of my responsibility 
all kinds of growth incentives when the economy is slow you 
want growth incentives and so ive got an agenda were going to 
be fashioning it and whether they are going to you know be 
willing to cooperate i dont know but its hard when you have a 
majority take capital gains there was a majority last year in 
the house for it there was a majority last year in the senate for 
it it never could get voted on now i think the american people 
can see that and so lets hope we can make progress on some of 
these incentives when you have a slow economy or the worry about a 
slower economy thats a good time to put incentive into the 
economic spectrum 
yeah frank 
q mr president cnn has obtained tapes which apparently were 
recorded between manuel noriega in prison and his defense team 
now while certain calls are permitted to be monitored we 
understand that those with a defendants attorneys are supposed to 
be privileged were you aware of this monitoring or any specific 
order that would have authorized monitoring of privileged 
conversations 
a no and im not aware of it now youre im learning 
something from you so im not going to comment on it if i dont 
know anything about it and i dont 
q under what circumstances would you favor monitoring 
a i would favor abiding by the law 
q mr president with all of your explanations on midterm 
perspective taken as a given do you think you paid a political 
price for compromising with the democrats and agreeing to new 
taxes 
a i dont know because i used to get accused in this very room 
by question not direct accusation but by living and guiding 
myself by the polls that was when they hey you wont make a 
tough decision because of the polls ive not heard that 
recently and maybe that has something to do with how id answer 
your question because i dont think it was popular what i did 
with anybody 
but i think it was the right thing to do and so i will try to 
make that point and i you know you just like the umpire youve 
got to call them as you see them and so i have some remedial work 
to do i think and i cant i wish i could go back and give a 
clearer answer to whether this helped or hurt in the election 
because i just dont know the answer to that but its i think in 
the final analysis if its good for the economy longrun were 
in some tough times right now but in the long run if its good 
for the economy then that should be good for the country and if 
its good for the country now hopefully it would be good for the 
views that i represent 
q i asked that because so many of the governors on the 
democratic side and your own side seem to have certainly been 
punished where they raised taxes and i wonder if thats a lesson 
you take away from this election 
a well i think there is a lesson i think people feel theyre 
taxed too much i happen to believe that and ive said that and i 
havent changed my view that we ought to go out and raise people 
and think we ought to go out and raise peoples taxes 
what i think were going to see coming down the pike at me in 
terms of the offered hand is a whole wide array of tax proposals 
out of the democrats maybe i misread what some of their leaders 
said when they talked about now going back and trying to raise 
income tax rates and theyre going to do it over my dead veto or 
live veto or something like that because it aint going to 
happen ill guarantee you and so i can identify with that ive 
always felt that way i made one compromise to try to get a budget 
agreement that in my view i felt was essential and i dont i 
got the message i had the message long before america went to the 
polls to say hey we dont want any more taxes we want to do 
something about spending 
and one of the great things about this budget agreement is that 
theres some enforcement provisions in here that i am determined to 
live by and that i am determined to make congress live by and if 
we live by them then we can negate the insatiable desire on the 
part of some in the congress on the democratic side to raise taxes 
but the good news on that wyatt is i think some of the 
democrats got the message as well as republicans weve had the 
message weve understood this and youre right they spoke up 
against governors some democrats some republican but i dont 
think theres any confusion on the part of people as to how i feel 
about taxes i oppose raising taxes and we had this one compromise 
and that just reinforced my view frankly

among the varied breeds of sports fanatics 
chess enthusiasts are the quietest they have to sit on their 
hands they cant stand up to order a hot dog or step out to buy a 
beer 
and they definitely cant shout armchair suggestions like 
exd4 or bf6 during a match 
the us open at flushing meadows was downright raucous compared 
to the inside of the hudson theatre where garry kasparov and 
anatoly karpov played to a draw in their last stateside game 
wednesday of the current championship 
the dueling chess mavens leave new york to begin the second half 
of theirchampionship match in lyons france tied 66 each player 
won one game in new york the 10 others ended in draws 
the second half of the championship resumes nov 24 the first 
player to gain 12 points wins if tied after 24 games kasparov 
keeps his title 
as for stage presence kasparov and karpov are no mcenroe and 
connors 
there was no hulk hoganiron sheiklike dialogue between these 
two sworn enemies and certainly no tantrums most of the time they 
didnt even stay on stage together as one pondered his move the 
other waited off stage 
nobody slamdunked any chess pieces to the ground or sent an 
errant queen spiraling across the stage 
but thats not to say the sport lacks excitement on wednesday 
after move number 31 politeness and solitude took a back seat to 
hurriedness 
because of time constraint rules karpov was left with only nine 
minutes to make his next nine moves while kasparov had 20 minutes 
left for the same number of moves for this both sat at the table 
and while there were no lavish tailgate parties or interruptions 
as mutinous fans were escorted out there was a certain 
fairytalelike ambiance 
when not straining to see the taut expressions on the players 
faces fans who paid between 25 and 100 per ticket could 
focus on the giant cutout chess pieces that looked like they came 
straight out of lewis carrolls through the looking glass 
one thing theres plenty of is quiet 
these fans would likely be out of place in the blue seats at 
madison square garden or at any new york jet football game where 
rudeness is the prevailing rule 
chess folk take their quiet seriously as they followed game 12 
spectators would break into an occasional murmur they were 
immediately shushed by neighbors and the words silence please 
flashed on a giant screen 
for those fans who cant take the silence the analysis rooms in 
the adjoining hotel macklowe offered a diversion there chess 
buffs followed the game on monitors while grandmasters provided 
color commentary 
i think absolutely terrible move by karpov grandmaster 
roman dzindzichashvili exploded at one point absolutely 
terrible 
do you think he didnt see bishop e6 someone shouted 
no he saw bishop e6 dzindzichashvili said he just 
underestimated 
if the united states as a whole was not agog with the chess 
championship the hotel macklowe at least was buzzing with 
nothing else 
in lounges and on elevators people talked chess in a dozen 
languages 
its exciting to be in a chess milieu said steve shapiro of 
manhattan who watched the final american match with his brother 
when youre playing youre with a buddy or in a club rarely 
are you part of a chess scene there are lots of scenes in this 
town and chess aint one of them

saddam hussein has dismissed his military 
chief of staff for opposing the occupation of kuwait and analysts 
said thursday the move indicated growing dissension in his armed 
forces hierarchy 
the iraqi armys alqadissiya daily reported thursday that lt 
gen nazir alkhazraji chief of staff since 1985 was replaced by 
gen hussein rashid commander of the elite 120000strong 
republican guards force 
the newspaper did not say what happened to khazraji or when he 
was dismissed 
but several western military and intelligence sources said 
khazraji opposed the kuwait occupation they also believe saddam 
might be seeking to surround himself with relatives and loyalists 
as the standoff with the multinational gulf force enters its fourth 
month 
a western intelligence source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said rashid is a hardliner in iraqs baath socialist 
party who would be expected to support saddams policies rashid 
had been khazrajis deputy chief of staff for operations 
us officials in washington said rashid is considered a very 
competent commander and led an armored brigade in the 198088 war 
against iran 
its very ominous said hansheino kopietz a former analyst 
with londons international institute for strategic studies who is 
now with control risks an international security firm in london 
khazrajis dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to 
saddam within the military kopietz said in a telephone 
interview 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
khazraji was named a special military adviser to saddam in what was 
seen as a demotion 
alqadissiya mentioned rashids new title in a report of a 
graduation ceremony he attended at baghdads military academy 
wednesday 
the shakeup comes amid increasingly tough us and british 
warnings they might use force to dislodge the iraqis from kuwait 
saddams taking a big gamble said analyst shahram chubin of 
the genevabased graduate institute of international affairs and 
author of several books on the gulf war 
some analysts said rashids appointment was in part designed to 
keep the republican guards on saddams side the guards considered 
to be iraqs best troops led the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the rest of the army may be neutralized but the republican 
guards could turn against him if he takes the country down the road 
to national suicide said bernard trainor a former us marine 
general who has visited iraq several times 
as he tightens up hes gathering around him all the 
hardliners and sycophants who are afraid to challenge him said 
trainor who heads the national security program at harvard 
universitys kennedy school of government 
rashid is believed to hail from takrit saddams birthplace 
north of baghdad saddam has packed the hierarchy of his ruling 
baath arab socialist party with relatives by blood or marriage 
who come mainly from takriti clans 
rashids appointment is the second known toplevel change in 
baghdad in the past two weeks 
oil minister issam chalabi was fired oct 28 and replaced by 
brig gen hussein kamel saddams cousin and soninlaw kamel is 
also minister of industry and military industrialization and is 
believed to head saddams internal security apparatus 
kamel a takriti has been responsible for developing iraqs 
arms industry and producing new surfacetosurface missiles 
chalabi was purportedly replaced after he imposed gasoline 
rationing because of shortages due to the un trade embargo that 
order was later rescinded and officials denied there was any 
shortage 
but kopietz noted there was more to chalabis dismissal than 
meets the eye hes a moderate close to the west and the oil 
industry where he was widely respected he was understood to be 
trying to persuade saddam from pursuing his strategy of 
confrontation 
it may well be that theres growing opposition to saddam 
within the iraqi hierarchy kopietz added 
chubin noted im sure theres considerable disquiet in the 
miliary whore not necessarily all convinced takriti baathists 
iraqi dissident groups have reported several purges of senior 
officers since the invasion of kuwait possibly because they 
disagreed with it and saddams apparent miscalculation about how 
the west would react 
there has been no independent confirmation of reports that some 
officers have been executed or imprisoned but since saddam took 
power in 1979 he has regularly purged senior officers who he 
suspected could pose threats 
some have disappeared or died under mysterious circumstances 
including a defense minister gen adnan khairallah saddams 
cousin and brotherinlaw killed in a 1989 helicopter crash 
analysts believe opposition heightened after saddam seeking to 
secure iraqs border with iran as his international isolation 
increased made concessions to iraqs former foe in aug 15 
the accord freed most of 30 divisions guarding iraqs eastern 
frontier to bolster forces facing the multinational force in the 
gulf region

lt gov martha griffiths says gov james 
blanchard lost his job in part because he removed her as a running 
mate 
i dont know if i feel vindicated but i think it clearly 
shows that i won it for him the first two times griffiths said 
wednesday after republican john engler defeated blanchard by 504 
percent to 496 percent 
in announcing last summer he was dropping her from the ticket 
blanchard said he was concerned about the 78yearold griffiths 
ability to run the state in the event something happened to him 
i feel bad for him but he took some very bad advice she 
said 
i would have gotten out the detroit vote she said 
referring to the low turnout in detroit which analysts said hurt 
blanchard griffiths said voters also told her repeatedly they had 
planned to vote against blanchard because he took her off the 
ticket 
griffiths said blanchard officials never took her up on an offer 
to campaign for the twoterm governor

lawrence durrell the british novelist who conveyed 
his love for mediterranean life in the alexandria quartet and 
other lyrical works died at his home in southern france his 
family said thursday he was 78 
the cause of death wednesday was not disclosed durrell had been 
fatigued for about two weeks a family member said and the author 
said in a 1986 interview that he suffered from emphysema 
he was a very odd mixture of things said philip howard 
literary editor of the times of london in an interview with the 
british broadcasting corp 
the thing he will be remembered for is the great tetralogy of 
novels the alexandria quartet which were all the rage in the 
early 60s and were in many ways the most accessible thing in the 
modernist movement howard said he was a real mixture of 
modernist structure and extreme romanticism 
the alexandria quartet consists of four novels set in the 
egyptian coastal city where durrell served as press attache at the 
british embassy in world war ii the works written from 1957 to 
1960 are justine balthazar mountolive and clea 
they brought him the commercial success that had not accompanied 
his earlier literary acclaim 
the series written in a lush baroque prose style took as 
its theme love as a means of selfdiscovery it is a portrait of an 
english writers life amid the inhabitants of alexandria 
classicism means becoming a spokesman for the cosmology of 
your time and what the hell was the cosmology of our age if it 
wasnt einstein and freud durrell said in a 1982 interview with 
the associated press 
so i used the theory of relativity the four dimensions as a 
kind of point of departure to make a classical frame in four 
volumes 
durrell was born in 1912 in central india and spent his boyhood 
in darjeeling near indias border with tibet but it was the 
mediterranean that caught his passion and where he spent his public 
and private life 
at the age of 18 he left india for london where he dabbled in 
jazz and poetry without much success in 1935 he first encountered 
greece the inspiration for some of his works 
durrell moved to corfu an ionian island off the west coast of 
greece 
it was from there that he began a nearly 50year correspondence 
with american author henry miller 
letters between them were published in two volumes in 1963 and 
1988 durrell described the letters as full of of insight full 
of fun 
two years ago several love letters written by miller to 
hollywood actress brenda venus part of durrells personal papers 
were sold at a london auction 
durrell served in britains diplomatic corps in egypt greece 
and yugoslavia and as director of public relations for the british 
government in cyprus 
another acclaimed work bitter lemons published in 1957 was 
an account of his years in cyprus during the islands independence 
struggle 
i spent 25 years subsidizing myself by doing jobs i didnt 
particularly like but it was useful in the long run durrell 
said in 1982 i made notes i learned from stendahl and by the 
time i really wanted to write books i had quite a wellfurnished 
documentary library in my brain 
he wrote the alexandria quartet in nimes southeastern 
france and lived for the last 24 years in sommieres a nearby 
small town in the provence region near the mediterranean coast 
four years ago he emerged briefly from his selfimposed privacy 
to accept an award of commander of arts and letters bestowed by the 
local mayor 
press association britains domestic news agency said faber 
and faber will publish a new durrell book next week caesars 
vast ghost a portrait of provence matthew evans managing 
director of faber and faber said what he wanted to do was write 
a book which paid tribute to the part of france he lived in for so 
very many years 
he knew it was his last book and only recently saw the 
first copy 
durrell was married three times and hadtwo daughters according 
to press association one wife and one daughter have died it said 
no funeral plans were immediately announced 
his brother gerald malcolm durrell who survives is a 
zoologist and popular writer of nature books

q if i may are you saying its one time only 
a im just saying im going to hold the line on taxes and fight 
back all these plans that are coming at me that i think will 
maybe im getting paranoid about it when i hear them talk about 
lets go out and raise taxes again but i thought that was kind of 
the message coming out of the end of the budget debate and if 
thats the case were in for a whale of a fight and the proffered 
hand may miss the shake because were not going to compromise on 
that 
q sir can we go back out beyond the beltway again for a 
minute 
a lets do it michelle 
q a couple of years ago the texas republican party passed an 
englishonly amendment as part of its party platform and you spoke 
out against this you said that this was an alienating message to 
send to people you want to participate this year the north 
carolina republican party sent postcards to minority voters 
democrats suggesting that they had given false information to 
elections officials giving them false information is this an 
appropriate campaign tactic and why have you been silent about 
this 
a i have because i havent tried to get into the campaign 
tactics in 50 states and on the postcard i mean the englishonly 
i dont think its a good thing to have i mean i want every kid 
to speak english ive been for bilingual education all my life 
continue to support it but i think the goal of it should be that 
every kid in this country speak english but i just dont think the 
englishonly approach is the way to do it i think it could result 
in certain discrimination 
but im sorry i cant help you on the details of a race for the 
united states senate or a governors race or a congressional race 
i just have not gone into that 
q sir are you saying that you dont know anything about this 
 
a i read a lot of charges and countercharges and ive heard 
some people say its bad and ive heard others say its not and i 
do recall that some time any time somebody puts in what they call 
a voter security program some people raise hell about it and 
thats not right either so it ought to be it depends how its 
done and i just dont know enough about what youre trying to get 
me into to get into that 
yeah 
q yes mr president i wonder if youve had any reaction to 
the margins of victory of mario cuomo and bill bradley two 
democrats thought to be looking at challenging you in two years 
a im not thinking about 92 
q lets talk about races 
q what do you think happened 
a look i just told michelle i havent gone into the details 
of all these races i dont know i dont know 
a why havent you 
q i want to ask you about director bennett weve heard stories 
of threats against himself against his family and maybe thats 
why hes leaving what do you know about that 
a well id let him respond to that question but i maybe 
bill why dont you 
bennett i got one question come on let me take it 
so far ive read tat i am bored restive restless tired 
unhappy moping about lack of media attention sulking about not 
being in the cabinet in a snit with john sununu all sorts of 
things that ive read about and being stampeded out of town none 
of which are true i mean i there have been people who havent 
liked me since i have been in public service the yale english 
department they may be threatening i dont the national 
education association and you know and this latest crowd but i 
mean im not the stampededoutoftown type theres nothing 
there 
q how about threats 
bennett oh i mean there are threats there are always threats 
in this kind of theyve been there since the beginning of this 
job i mean thats always the case i think what people are 
picking up on is when i went up to alaska to talk about the 
recriminalization of marijuana which by the way occurred that 
took place that initiative passed there were some anonymous 
threats from some potheads that they were going to blow me up but 
they but the notice that went out from the one of the pothead 
societies said come confront bennett but the date they put on 
it was two days after the day i was there so if they did leave 
anything dangerous its probably going off up there on the icecaps 
somewhere without any 
q why are you leaving 
bennett to bush i dont want to tie you up should we go into 
this 
bush no no im going to just take two more and then im 
leaving 
bennett when the president and i talked 20 months ago we 
talked about things that needed to be done id had two jobs in 
government humanities chairman and secretary of education and we 
decided that what we needed to do was to get a good strategy which 
weve got to get bipartisan support for it which weve got 
broadly there are still some things democrats need to do like 
the crime bill third that we needed to get the right amount of 
resources for it which weve achieved and fourth to begin to see 
some progress some results and we said at that time i remember 
the president saying to me if you can get this thing started 
going in the right direction moving ill be very grateful and 
i think we got that and so im you know i took the job freely 
and now i leave freely 
more

<TEXT>
q why dont you want to see it through 
bennett well i seeing it through is going to i mean i think 
if this nation stays on course i think its probably we will 
probably beat the goals that we stated in the national drug control 
strategy of 10 years i think well be there in five years if the 
states do the things that theyre supposed to do and if others do 
what theyre supposed to do 
the federal commitment i think is clear unprecedented 
commitment unprecedented amount of money resources and so on 
thats five years thats you know ive had nine years in 
government i think thats enough for now i mean i do want to tell 
my critics i am not leaving public life and worse than that i may 
not even be leaving public service forever i may not you know i 
may be back one needs to be careful about this but i dont leave 
with any sense of remorse or apology im proud of what weve done 
and i think what weve done is a good thing and we really are 
making progress 
bush with your permission let me just take two jessica and 
ellen yes ellen 
q mr president you say that your reading of the election 
shows that people didnt and dont want their taxes raised upon 
reflection do you wish you had kept your campaign promise and not 
supported higher taxes 
a do i wish id been able to yes very much so in fact we 
tried we sent a budget up there and it kind of died for lack of a 
second and it had no taxes in it and thats i very i wish i 
had a congress that would do 
it just my way because i am still convinced we can get by 
without having raised anybodys taxes of any kind and so yes i 
have serious regrets about that 
q well can you make the promise now sir that you will not 
support new taxes in the future 
a can i make the promise i wont support them absolutely but 
im you know sometimes you run into some realities but im 
girding up my loins to go into battle to beat back the tax attempts 
that i think are coming because i think the american people are 
fed up with it and i think that was very clear 
i think in my case they probably know that there had to be some 
compromise at least from the way you look at does the american 
people support the deficit agreement or not but i want to be on 
theside of no tax increases and were going to go right to bat 
again in the congress at that we fight that battle all the time 
yes jessica 
q mr president there seemed to be not very much debate about 
the persian gulf during the election even though we have our young 
people there and their lives are on the line im wondering do you 
take this the fact that you werent seriously challenged by the 
opposition party on this matter do you take this as support for 
any decision that you might make with respect to having to go to 
war there without respect say to the houses adjournment 
resolution that said they should come back if you go to war 
a jessica look i said i didnt want to take any persian gulf 
questions i will reply to this and then ask and it is the 
last one anyway but i look we have had extensive consultations 
with congress we will continue to have extensive consultations 
with congress i think the people in the campaign for the most part 
recognized that i was trying very hard to separate support for the 
persian gulf policy from the pure headonhead confrontation of 
domestic politics 
and again i tried continually on the road to salute the 
democratic leadership and democratic members along with republican 
leadership and republican members for what i think has been 
extraordinarily solid support and i think that support has led to 
good support from the american people but we have a major foreign 
policy objective there i am determined to see the objective 
fulfilled i am determined to hold this coalition together but 
that must be done without partisan politics intervening and so 
that then leads me to say i will continue to consult 
i know the responsibilities i have to do that i know the 
importance of the support of the congress and i will continue to 
reach out to them and keep them informed and consult and they know 
my views so i dont think theres any i dont think that the 
campaign has driven any wedge between me and the leaders on capitol 
hill or the american people on this very important problem 
q so that does mean that you feel that there is widespread 
national support for whatever it is that you have to do that you 
decide to do 
a no question about it 
q well i like to feel the american people would support their 
president on whatever decision is made and i think one way to 
guarantee that is to be sure that you consult to be sure that you 
spell out your objectives as clearly as possible to be sure you 
keep this historic coalition together and the importance of the 
baker trip for example i think is obvious and so so far i 
think that the ingredients are there for full support and i view 
my responsibilities as such that i must be sure thats right ill 
go the extra mile here at home and abroad to see that we that 
our the common objectives as stated by the united nations are met 
ill turn it over to bill and let me just say ive read some 
silly speculation about bill bennetts leaving and he has my total 
confidence theres no internal politics thats caused him to make 
this decision if he feels like it he can tell you when he i 
dont want to violate confidences when he and i had our first and 
then subsequent talks about this he knows the affection that 
barbara and i have for him and his family 
i know that the kind of sacrifice that anyone serving this 
country goes through not just in the controversy of the job but in 
terms of financial aspirations for their families that need to be 
educated and so please discount some of this understandable 
speculation he has my confidence i think i have his and i know 
that he has the love and affection or his family from barbara and 
me and i think hes done an outstanding job for his country and 
even his severest critics i think will tell you that those that 
started off the most critical weve made progress in an area that 
is vital to every single family in this country and i will never 
get over being grateful to bill bennett for what hes done 
bennett thank you very much 
bush good luck

president bush reviving the nonewtax pledge 
he abandoned in a budget deal said thursday the only way democrats 
will be able to raise income tax rates will be over my dead 
veto 
it aint going to happen ill guarantee you bush told 
reporters at a news conference after saying he expects 
congressional democrats to come up with new tax proposals 
but he hedged his pledge somewhat when asked flatly if he would 
reject new taxes 
can i make the promise i wont support them absolutely 
bush said but sometimes you run into some realities but im 
girding up my loins to go into battle to beat back the tax attempts 
that i think are coming 
he said democrats had an insatiable desire to raise taxes 
and accused them of trying to stick me with being anticivil 
rights for vetoing a landmark bill banning job discrimination 
bush struck a sharply combative stance toward the democrats who 
increased their power in both the house and senate with election 
day victories 
i didnt do as well as id like the president said 
reflecting on tuesdays gop losses 
bush said the clear message from election day was that people 
feel theyre taxed too much 
six incumbent governors of both parties went down to defeat 
the losses generally reflected tax or economic woes 
bush in one of his gloomiest assessments said he was very 
concerned that the economy was faltering he said he would consult 
with economists in and out of the government on ways to soften the 
blow and stimulate growth 
were in some tough times right now the president said 
michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser told a business 
group thursday that he wouldnt rule out a possible negative 
quarter of economic growth either in the final three months of this 
year or early next year 
he didnt specifically forecast a recession but said there was 
no doubt economic growth was weak 
the economy at best is in a lull but we do expect that lull 
to be relatively brief and relatively minor boskin said 
even before the election republicans were heavily outnumbered 
in congress and their losses tuesday will make it harder for bush 
to win veto battles and push a legislative agenda 
but bush said the results wont tie my hands at all in 
dealing with lawmakers signaling that he would be less 
conciliatory in the next two years 
when you extend the hand of cooperation somebody else has 
to reach out and shake it bush said 
he said he would appeal for democratic support for his policies 
but warned 
im going to use the veto so as to stop a lot of bad things 
from happening to this country i am more determined than ever 
to use it 
bush abandoned his politically popular nonewtax pledge during 
negotiations with congress to reduce the massive budget deficits 
to the dismay of many republicans the deal bush approved for 
fiscal 1991 includes 140 billion in new taxes 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said wednesday theres 
support among democrats for a surtax on millionaires one of the 
provisions omitted from the budget deal 
bush said that if democrats want higher taxes were in for a 
whale of a fight and the proffered hand of conciliation may miss 
the shake because were not going to compromise on that 
what i think were going to see comng down the pike at me 
is a whole wide array of tax proposals out of the democrats 
and theyre going to do it over my dead veto or live veto or 
something like that because it aint going to happen ill 
guarantee you 
with his latest pledge of nonewtaxes and his bashing of 
democrats bush appeared to be testing themes for his own 
reelection race in 1992 although he insisted he hasnt decided 
whether to run 
im not thinking about 92 he said 
bush mugged an exaggerated grin when asked about the 
weakerthanexpected election showings tuesday of two potential 
democratic rivals new york gov mario cuomo and new jersey sen 
bill bradley 
he said he was heartened that gop losses in gubernatorial and 
congressional races were well below historical trends for a party 
that controls the white house 
im not talking about victory because i am very disappointed 
that way some of the races turned out bush said

in a strident address before 
parliament thursday president ghulam ishaq khan promised to end 
his countrys hatinhand relationship with the united states 
ishaq khan also warned the 12yearold war in neighboring 
afghanistan would not end until the soviet union halted its support 
for that countrys communist government 
the president made his remarks in a speech to a joint session of 
parliament 
as expected pakistans new prime minister nawaz sharif easily 
won a vote of confidence in the 217member national assembly the 
policymaking lower house that two days earlier elected him prime 
minister he received 153 votes 
it was unclear why the vote was called so soon because sharif 
has yet to form a government under pakistani law a vote of 
confidence must be held within three months 
we will no longer have our hands out for help we can no 
longer rely on others for our bread and butter otherwise we will 
never enter the 21st century with our heads held high ishaq khan 
said 
washington suspended 573 million in aid to pakistan last month 
after president bush refused to guarantee that islamabad did not 
possess the capability for making nuclear weapons there were 
claims however the aid cut was an attempt to bolster ms bhuttos 
election campaign 
it is believed that both pakistan and its often hostile neighbor 
to the east india have nuclear capability although both deny the 
charges 
former prime minister benazir bhutto whose 20monthold 
government was dismissed by ishaq khan aug 6 on charges of 
corruption and mismanagement did not attend the joint session 
it wasnt a boycott she just missed her plane a spokesman 
for ms bhutto said on condition of anonymity 
but none of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party members in 
parliament attended the session 
ms bhutto has accused the president of staging a constitutional 
coup against her government and engineering massive vote fraud in 
last months national elections 
the rightwing islamic democratic alliance swept to power in 
those elections the coalition of 18 diverse parties capitalized on 
the simmering antiamerican sentiment in pakistan 
while ms bhutto tried to portray herself as the symbol of 
democracy that generated much needed foreign aid for pakistan her 
opponents painted her as an american puppet 
to those who wish to extend their hand of friendship as equal 
partners we will take it but we shall not compromise on our 
basic rights ishaq khan said 
we hope that america will realize the importance of our 
friendship rather than reacting to allegations before the 
election us congressmen warned the president against 
disqualifying ms bhutto 
the former prime minister faces seven charges of misconduct 
before special onejudge tribunals conviction on any one of the 
charges could bar her from politics for seven years 
in his 30minute urdulanguage speech ishaq khan also warned 
moscow there would be no end to the civil war in neighboring 
afghanistan unless it abandons its support for the kabul 
government 
it must be clear to the soviet union that what they allowed to 
happen in eastern europe must also be applied to afghanistan 
otherwise we will never have peace in the region he said 
usbacked afghan insurgents have fought successive communist 
governments in kabul from their bases in pakistan 
when soviet soldiers left afghanistan in february 1989 after 
nine years and the moslem resistance failed in major battles 
attention shifted toward a political settlement something the 
fundamentalist guerrillas reject

a suspect in an ira bombing who has been 
on a hunger strike for 30 days appealed to the supreme court on 
thursday to block his extradition to britain 
the case is the first to come before the courts under the 1987 
extradition act which irish prime minister charles haughey has 
said will facilitate the extradition of terrorist suspects 
dessie ellis 38 is wanted in britain in connection with five 
bomb attacks in the early 1980s he says he cannot get a fair trial 
there and should not be extradited 
on wednesday he was hospitalized and he was not in court for 
the appeal 
i will die rather than be extradited to britain ellis said 
in an interview published recently in republican news a weekly 
newspaper that reflects the views of the outlawed irish republican 
army and its legal political wing sinn fein 
britains attorney general has issued warrants accusing ellis of 
conspiracy and possessing explosives 
ellis attorney patrick mcentee made three arguments against 
extradition that there are no corresponding offenses in irish law 
that the sixyear delay would make extradition unfair improper 
and constitutionally wrong and that ellis cannot receive a fair 
trial in britain 
chief justice thomas finlay one of five judges who heard the 
appeal reserved judgment there was no indication when the court 
would rule but irish justice minister ray burke had warned ellis 
on tuesday that he might be dead by the time the court rules if he 
persists in his hunger strike 
burke has refused appeals from ellis family that he intervene 
to block extradition 
his family said ellis has lost 30 pounds and suffers from 
fatigue dizziness and sore eyes 
the charges involve five incidents in 1981 in which three people 
were killed and a military officer lost part of a leg in previous 
hearings a detective from scotland yard said 13 fingerprints found 
in a cache of explosives link ellis to the crimes 
extradition has been a contentious issue between britain and 
ireland especially because of past cases in which suspects have 
successfully pleaded that their alleged offenses were 
political 
owen carron and james pius clarke who successfully appealed 
extradition earlier this year attended thursdays hearing so did 
patrick ryan a roman catholic priest sought in britain on 
terrorist charges who convinced the irish courts last year that he 
could not get a fair trial 
opponents of extradition point to recent cases in britain in 
which appeals courts reversed convictions of alleged ira members 
but only after some had been in prison 15 years 
ten prisoners belonging to the ira or the irish national 
liberation army died on hunger strikes in the maze prison in 
northern ireland in 1981 the best known was bobby sands who was 
elected to parliament during his 65day fast 
no one has died on a hunger strike in ireland since 1946

a judges ruling has cleared the way for a 
homosexual man to proceed with a discrimination lawsuit against the 
boy scouts of america and its national policy banning homosexuals 
as poor role models 
timothy curran 29 was asked to leave the scouts in 1980 when 
he took a young man to his senior prom he filed his lawsuit in 
1981 when his bid to return as an adult leader was rejected 
superior court judge sally disco ruled late tuesday that the 
mount diablo council in the san francisco bay area is subject to 
californias unruh civil rights act 
the act forbids businesses from discriminating on the basis of 
sexual orientation race religion or disability 
disco said the council is a business because it has considerable 
property holdings and makes money by selling products to the 
public 
the boy scouts had argued that it is a nonprofit organization 
free to promote its own moral philosophy 
curran a freelance television editor and former eagle scout 
said he wants to serve as a scout leader and is not seeking 
monetary damages 
im really pleased to see that after 10 years in the courts 
this case is developing some momentum and moving toward a 
conclusion curran said wednesday 
the two sides will meet nov 16 to discuss a date for the start 
of a jury trial 
george davidson an attorney for the boy scouts said he 
believes the lawsuit will be decided in the organizations favor

transportation secretary samuel k skinner 
called for a truce thursday in the escalating battle between the 
nations railroads and the trucking industry 
the struggle with each side threatening to take steps to hurt 
the competitive position of the other was prompted by the desire 
of truckers to increase productivity by introducing heavier and 
longer trucks to the nations highways 
that led to fears in the railroad industry that profits could be 
slashed as cargo shifted from freight trains to the larger trucks 
the fight is expected to move to congress next year as the house 
and senate consider federal policies on surface transportation a 
debate that could lead to authorization of larger trucks 
competition between the railroad and trucking industries is 
healthy and something that we expect and need skinner told the 
annual meeting of the railway progress institute 
however all of us recognize that a war of words can escalate 
into the kind of conflict in which both sides are damaged the 
transportation secretary said 
i am therefore beginning a very concerted effort to urge both 
industries to remember that while they may argue about the 
political and economic issues at one level reality requires that 
they cooperate at other levels he said 
too much is at stake from a global competition standpoint for 
the railroad and trucking industry to fight with each other 
skinner said 
he said he will deliver an identical message to the trucking 
industry 
the message applies equally he said i favor no mode over 
the other 
skinner said his job was to assure that everyone gets heard 
that no one gets bowled over that the end result is in the best 
interest of the public and americas position in the global 
economy

president bush said today he has ordered a new 
wave of us troops to the persian gulf area to give the 
multinational military force there an adequate offensive military 
option should that be necessary 
the presidents announcement at a white house news conference 
did not specify how many more american forces would be added to 
operation desert shield but pentagon sources said it could be more 
than 100000 
the sources said the extra troops would include armored 
divisions from us bases in germany and possibly from the united 
states 
bush said he did not need to get united nations approval to 
launch a military action against iraq but indicated the 
administration would first seek out that support 
yes we have the authority but weve been great believers in 
going to the united nations bush said in a question and answer 
session after his announcement 
bush said he still held out hope the confrontation over iraqs 
invasion and occupation of kuwait could be settled short of war 
but he also said he wanted to give the american ground commander in 
saudi arabia gen h norman schwarzkopf a credible offensive 
option 
i would love to see a peaceful resolution to this question and 
thats what i want the president said as defense secretary dick 
cheney stood nearby 
but bush added i have not ruled out use of force at all and 
thats whats evident by what weve done here today 
bush said 230000 us forces are in the gulf area now to ensure 
that iraqi president saddam hussein does not gain a chokehold on 
the worlds economic lifeline 
high pentagon officials have indicated for some time that 
additional forces were being considered for the operation desert 
shield force now totaling 230000 from the united states and 70000 
for allied countries 
iraq has deployed more than 400000 troops in the region 
in late october cheney said up to another 100000 men and women 
could be sent to the gulf area he said at the time the pentagon 
had set no upper limit on deployments and that he wanted enough 
force to deal with any contingency 
the source who disclosed the decision to send extra troops 
declined to say how many would go an armored division has nearly 
20000 troops but can require so many support units that it may 
account for as many as 40000 personnel 
meanwhile a marine official said wednesday many hundreds more 
combat troops from the marine corps reserve are likely to be 
ordered to active duty 
the marines on tuesday said 824 reservists including 633 combat 
specialists were being activated to become part of a 5th marine 
expeditionary brigade undergoing desert warfare training in 
california 
those were the first combat reserve forces to be put on active 
duty in the persian gulf crisis 
col russell appleton head of manpower policy and planning at 
marine corps headquarters said reserves will be used to help form 
expeditionary brigades to replace units scheduled to rotate out of 
the gulf area 
youre seeing the tip of that spear of reserve deployments 
he said adding that he could not comment on any reserve callups 
beyond those announced this week 
also on wednesday the bush administration denounced the 
procession of foreign dignitaries to baghdad to plead for the 
release of hostages 
it is a matter of great concern to us presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said he referred specifically to recent 
missions by former west german chancellor willy brandt former 
british prime minister edward heath and former japanese prime 
minster yasuhiro nakasone 
clearly these people are being used and we want to point 
that out in the strongest terms fitzwater said

arizona voters rejection of two ballot measures 
that would have established a martin luther king day already is 
taking a toll on the states pocketbook economic development and 
business leaders said 
david radcliffe president of phoenix amp valley of the sun 
convention and visitors bureau said he knows of at least four 
groups that have canceled reservations for conventions or stays at 
hotels since the propositions failed in tuesdays election 
he could not identify the groups thursday or say how many 
visitors they would have brought to arizona 
im not anxious to call people to see if they want to 
cancel radcliffe said ive never been as high as the day we 
booked the super bowl and ive never been so low as i feel now 
nfl commissioner paul tagliabue said wednesday he will recommend 
the 1993 super bowl be moved from the phoenix area because of the 
defeat of the king holiday gov rose mofford estimated that losing 
the super bowl would cost arizona 200 million in lost revenue 
robert hayward a tourism analyst for the pannell kerr forester 
accounting firm said losing the super bowl would not just mean 
losing money but also losing face 
the super bowl leaving could be even worse for our image than 
the king day rejection it could put us squarely in the national 
limelight hayward said 
since thengov evan mecham in 1987 rescinded a holiday declared 
by his predecessor about 40 convention groups have canceled their 
arizona plans and the state has lost about 30 million radcliffe 
said 
those figures are based only on what is documented he said 
adding that other groups may have ruled out the state and state 
officials would never even know of the loss 
robert rudder sales director for the sheraton hotel in downtown 
phoenix said two groups canceled reservations there since the 
election resulting in a 250000 loss of revenue he would not 
identify the groups 
the sheraton will honor the holiday and is mounting a drive to 
raise the 500000 it is estimated it would cost the state to give 
state employees a paid holiday rudder said the hotel is offering 
50000 he said 
rudder said the holiday was defeated tuesday because the two 
propositions on the ballot were conflicting and confusing 
one measure called for eliminating the states existing columbus 
day holiday and creating a king day the other called for having 
both as paid holidays the two propositions grew out of grassroots 
petition drives following legislative action 
the holiday issue may not be the deciding factor for businesses 
and visitors to come to the state but it may be used as an excuse 
said chuck shipley vice president for government affairs for the 
state chamber of commerce 
the king day issue also could tip the balance if it is a close 
choice between arizona and another state for a new industrial 
plant said lois yates deputy director of the arizona department 
of commerce 
bob mariano president and chief executive of chase bank of 
arizona said executives from the parent chase manhattan corp of 
new york expressed concern over the holiday defeat the executives 
would not say if the vote would affect their decision on where to 
relocate a proposed creditcard operation mariano said 
suburban tempe is one of two finalists for the 2000employee 
operation the other is salt lake city

chancellor helmut kohl 
announced thursday that poland and the newly united germany will 
sign a historic border treaty this month ending decades of concern 
over the common frontier 
kohl also said he wanted a wideranging friendship and 
cooperation treaty to be submitted to the german and polish 
legislatures for ratification by the end of february 
we are deeply convinced that real peace will be possible only 
if germans and poles march together along this road into a peaceful 
future kohl said of the treaties 
he made the comments following a day of talks with polish prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki the first foreign leader to visit 
united germany 
mazowiecki said he was satisfied with the important results 
of the talks in this german border town on the oder river across 
from poland 
mazowiecki also said the germanpolish border must not be a 
divider between east and west we want this border to bring us 
closer and not to divide europe between the developed rich and the 
poor he said 
the meeting came exactly one year after kohl became the first 
western leader to visit newly democratic poland a trip interrupted 
when the dramatic news reached warsaw that the berlin wall had 
fallen 
kohl pleased his polish guests on thursday by saying he hoped 
visa requirements for poles to visit germany would be lifted by 
christmas 
i think we made great progress for the future polish 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska told reporters 
adding the visit was a big success 
people from former east germany do not need visas to visit 
poland and many travel there to shop in the flourishing 
inexpensive polish markets 
while polish traders welcome the business other poles have 
expressed resentment over their need for visas 
after their talks kohl and mazowiecki crossed the wide bridge 
over the oder into the polish town of slubice where they were 
greeted by about 1000 cheering residents 
the border treaty would confirm the present border formed by the 
oder and neisse rivers and commit germany to relinquishing claims 
on former german territory forever 
the oderneisse border drawn by the victorious wartime allies 
in 1945 gave poland 45000 square miles of formerly german land 
an even larger part of poland was taken by the soviet union 
after the war 
the postwar explusion of millions of german refugees is still 
an emotional issue in germany 
during the news conference a man identifying himself as hermann 
schulz held up a german flag together with that of his homeland in 
east prussia now part of poland 
we should be allowed to be represented at these talks we want 
to return to our homeland he said 
many germans have questioned the border through the years 
dreaming of a possible return to the silesian pomeranian and east 
prussian land that make up about onethird of presentday poland 
travel between the two countries should become easier soon 
kohl said the twolane 372mile stretch of highway that links 
warsaw and the german capital berlin should be improved 
the friendship and cooperation treaty like a treaty to be 
signed between germany and the soviet union on friday will lay the 
foundation for future economic political and cultural cooperation 
kohl stressed germanys commitment to helping poland make the 
transformation from a socialist to a capitalist economy adding 
that he would help poland obtain associate member status in the 
european community 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher is to travel to warsaw 
later this month to sign the border treaty with his polish 
counterpart krzystof skubiszewski a precise date was not given

racism prompted city voters to reverse a 
4yearold decision that named a street in honor of slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr critics said 
harrisburg voters approved a referendum tuesday to change to 
name of rev dr ml king boulevard back to market street 
the rev jefferson wright who opposed the referendum said 
racism drove voters 
the street was there for four years until a bunch of racists 
came along to take it down as a reassurance in their minds of their 
power he said 
the city council voted in 1986 to name 24 blocks of the major 
thoroughfare after king 
residents opposed to the change won a nonbinding referendum in 
the spring of 1987 to return the streets name to market street 
but the city council ignored it 
enraged the residents hit the streets to gather enough 
signatures to put a binding referendum on tuesdays ballot 
james h high a supporter of the referendum denied the charges 
of racism he said people were angry that the council had ignored 
the wishes of a majority of voters 
i think this raised such a fervor because its always been 
market street and weve always had a market street most cities 
have a market street he said 
some residents of king boulevard also complained about the 
inconvenience of changing their addresses 
a spokesman for mayor stephen reed said the new street signs 
should be in place within the next 30 days 
the idea of them taking the signs down hurts so bad said 
referendum opponent dana olsen i have an image of them taking 
the signs down and throwing them in the back of some openpanel 
truck and dumping them somewhere that hurts

a national grassroots drive to oust incumbent 
politicians may have failed this election year but its founder 
said thursday he is already looking ahead to the 1992 elections 
were going to take a look at what we did wrong and how we can 
make it better then its back to business jack gargan said 
now we have the funding credibility and two years 
gargan said his group throw the hypocritical rascals out or 
thro intends to buy a fullpage advertisement in usa today to 
thank supporters nationwide then begin looking toward 1992 and 
races for president and congress 
were going to say thank you america and let folks know 
were going for bear in 92 he said 
gargan said a national taxpayer association representative told 
him thursday that tuesdays races involving incumbents were roughly 
12 percent closer than had been predicted 
when you can go from a dead stop in 132 days and make a 12 
percent impact with no staff no funding and no experience its 
heartwarming he said 
gargan 59 who is a financial planner formed the nonprofit 
thro in june and targeted members of congress as irresponsible 
spenders to be voted out he used 9000 in retirement money to buy 
a fullpage local newspaper advertisement headlined im mad as 
hell and im not going to take it anymore 
since then he said hes received about 600000 in 
contributions and letters from more than 70000 people as the 
money came in he bought ads in newspapers small and large urging 
people to vote against all incumbents in all races 
while he doesnt have final figures yet gargan said the 
campaign war chest should have 100000 to 200000 left 
we became sort of a threat and we forced them incumbents to 
spend much more of that pac political action committee money to 
boost themselves he said we also made people across this 
nation step back and look at whos running this country 
gary koops spokesman for the republican congressional campaign 
committee in washington said thro reflected the discontent of 
voters nationwide who were weary of business as usual in 
congress 
many incumbents wholl be going back to washington were scared 
for their political lives koops said 
others such as hollis friedman a spokeswoman for the 
democratic congressional campaign committee in washington said 
the antiincumbent sentiment was overblown 
the few incumbents that did lose lost because they werent 
addressing the peoples needs and interests properly and not 
because people just wanted to get rid of an incumbent friedman 
said 
robin krivanek hillsborough county supervisor of elections 
said the antiincumbent mood came through loud and clear locally 
what amazed us is that there were people out there taking a 
blanket approach to this campaign krivanek said we had people 
who had no idea of who these people were but wanted their names so 
they could vote them out

the federal communications commission moved 
thursday toward a possible crackdown on childrens tv programs 
based on toys but an official said the agency was twisting and 
turning to steer clear of shows such as sesame street 
critics contend that programs such as heman and gi 
joe are thinly disguised sales pitches and have urged the fcc to 
declare such shows to be 30minute commercials 
the commission however wasnt willing to go that far 
the mere fact that a story line is built around a toy 
being sold on the market would not make it a programlength 
commercial said regina harrison a lawyer in the fccs mass 
media bureau 
the commission she said was twisting and turning trying to 
reach a definition that wont cut out shows such as sesame 
street 
the commission under orders from congress to complete a 
3yearold investigation into socalled programlength commercials 
proposed defining such programs as any childrens show associated 
with a product in which commercials for that product are aired 
previously the commission defined programlength commercials as 
material so interwoven with and in essence auxiliary to the 
sponsors advertising that the entire program is in effect a 
commercial 
peggy charren president of the action for childrens 
television said manufacturers dont advertise their toys on shows 
based on their products for fear children wont notice the ads 
she said the fccs proposed definition would not solve the 
problem of shows being used to promote toys 
the commission invited public comment on what penalties if any 
should be imposed on programlength commercials harrison said 
violators could receive fines or have their licenses threatened at 
renewal or both 
the commission also said it would consider during license 
renewal whether a station had provided programs specifically 
designed to meet the educational and informational needs of 
children 
the commission in the same 50 vote thursday proposed 
implementing ad time limits that congress ordered as part of the 
childrens television act of 1990 
those limits are 105 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 
minutes per hour on weekdays on childrens shows including cable 
tv 
the rules are to take effect in april and violations could lead 
to fines from 25000 to 250000 
the commission lifted similar restrictions in 1984 but 
congressional testimony showed that advertising on some programs 
increased to 14 minutes per hour a federal appeals court in 1987 
ordered the fcc to reconsider its decision

a suspect in ira bombings who has been on 
a hunger strike for 30 days appealed thursday to the supreme court 
to block his extradition to britain 
the case is the first to come before the courts under the 1987 
extradition act which irish prime minister charles haughey has 
said will facilitate the extradition of terrorist suspects 
dessie ellis 38 is wanted in britain in connection with five 
bomb attacks in the early 1980s he says he cannot get a fair trial 
there and should not be extradited 
on wednesday he was hospitalized and he was not in court for 
the appeal 
i will die rather than be extradited to britain ellis said 
in an interview published recently in republican news a weekly 
newspaper that reflects the views of the outlawed irish republican 
army and its legal political wing sinn fein 
britains attorney general has issued warrants accusing ellis of 
conspiracy and possessing explosives 
ellis attorney patrick mcentee made three arguments against 
extradition that there are no corresponding offenses in irish law 
that the sixyear delay would make extradition unfair improper 
and constitutionally wrong and that ellis cannot receive a fair 
trial in britain 
chief justice thomas finlay one of five judges who heard the 
appeal reserved judgment there was no indication when the court 
would rule but irish justice minister ray burke had warned ellis 
on tuesday that he might be dead by the time the court rules if he 
persists in his hunger strike 
burke has refused appeals from ellis family that he intervene 
to block extradition 
his family said ellis has lost 30 pounds and suffers from 
fatigue dizziness and sore eyes 
the charges involve five incidents in 1981 in which three people 
were killed and a military officer lost part of a leg in previous 
hearings a detective from scotland yard said 13 fingerprints found 
in a cache of explosives link ellis to the crimes 
extradition has been a contentious issue between britain and 
ireland especially because of past cases in which suspects have 
successfully pleaded that their alleged offenses were 
political 
owen carron and james pius clarke who successfully appealed 
extradition earlier this year attended thursdays hearing so did 
patrick ryan a roman catholic priest sought in britain on 
terrorist charges who convinced the irish courts last year that he 
could not get a fair trial 
opponents of extradition point to recent cases in britain in 
which appeals courts reversed convictions of alleged ira members 
but only after some had been in prison 15 years 
ten prisoners belonging to the ira or the irish national 
liberation army died on hunger strikes in the maze prison in 
northern ireland in 1981 the best known was bobby sands who was 
elected to parliament during his 65day fast 
no one has died on a hunger strike in ireland since 1946

<TEXT>
president bush i have a brief statement and then id be glad to 
take a couple of questions and then turn to secretary cheney who 
will take some questions and then he will go over to the pentagon 
for an indepth more of an indepth briefing 
on august 6th in response to the unprovoked iraqi invasion of 
kuwait i ordered the deployment of us military forces to saudi 
arabia and the persian gulf to deter further iraqi aggression and 
to protect our interests in the region what weve done is right 
and im happy to say that most members of congress and the majority 
of americans agree 
before the invasion in august we had succeeded in the struggle 
for freedom in eastern europe and wed hopefully begun a new era 
that offered the promise of peace 
following the invasion i stated that if history had taught it 
any lesson it was that we must resist aggression or it would 
destroy our freedom just ask the people of kuwait and the foreign 
nationals in hiding there and the staffs of the remaining embassies 
who have experienced the horrors of iraqs illegal occupation its 
systematic dismantling of kuwait and its abuse of kuwaitis and 
other citizens 
the world community also must prevent an individual clearly bent 
on regional domination from establishing a choke hold on the 
worlds economic lifeline we are seeing global economic stability 
and growth already at risk as each day countries around the world 
pay dearly for saddam husseins aggression 
from the very beginning we and our coalition partners have 
shared common political goals the immediate complete and 
unconditional withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait restoration 
of kuwaits legitimate government protection of the lives of 
citizens held hostage by iraq both in kuwait and iraq and 
restoration of security and stability in the persian gulf region 
to achieve these goals we and our allies have forged a strong 
diplomatic economic and military strategy to force iraq to comply 
with these objectives the framework of this strategy is laid out 
in 10 united nations resolutions overwhelmingly supported by the 
united nations security council 
in three months the us troop contribution to the 
multinational force in saudi arabia has gone from 10000 to 230000 
as part of operation desert shield gen schwarzkopf reports that 
our forces in conjunction with other coalition forces now have the 
capability to defend successfully against any further iraqi 
aggression 
after consultation with king fahd and our other allies i have 
today directed the secretary of defense to increase the size of 
us forces committed to desert shield to ensure that the coalition 
has an adequate offensive military option should that be necessary 
to achieve our common goals toward this end we will continue to 
discuss the possibility of both additional allied force 
contributions and appropriate united nation actions 
iraqs brutality aggression and violations of international law 
cannot be allowed to succeed

when cnn continued its coverage of recorded 
telephone conversations of manuel noriega while appealing a federal 
judges order in the case thursday a former judge read the story 
catherine crier a former texas district court judge was one of 
several anchors telling viewers that cnn continued to broadcast its 
first report on the jailed panamanian dictator because us 
district judge william hoevelers ruling would amount to 
unconstitutional prior restraint 
hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in miami barring cnn from 
broadcasting parts of recordings of noriegas conversations with 
his lawyers that could infringe on attorneyclient privilege 
cnn used excerpts from the jailhouse tapes thursday morning 
repeated that during the day and said it planned to televise 
another installment thursday evening 
the atlantabased cable news operation said it would appeal 
hoevelers ruling 
ms crier the youngest woman elected to texas district court 
was among the anchors explaining that cnn continued to repeat the 
morning segment because it believes it has the right to do so 
under the first amendment 
cnn said ms crier had nothing to do with the decision to 
broadcast the story and was reading the same commentary as other 
anchors 
cnn declined to allow her to be interviewed about the storys 
judicial ramifications 
ms crier created a stir when she was hired at the 24hour news 
network in 1989 with no journalistic experience she has said she 
left the judgeship because courtroom competition may have 
surpassed the notion of serving clients of seeking justice

coupons will be distributed to muscovites 
beginning dec 1 to ensure that staples such as meat butter and 
flour are not stripped from the capitals shelves by nonresident 
shoppers a newspaper reported thursday 
the coupons to be sold for about 56 for a months supply will 
enable residents to purchase 33 pounds of meat nearly a 
halfpound of butter and 11 pounds of flour according to the 
moskovsky komsomolets newspaper 
the newspaper article indicated the coupons might buy other 
items but it did not list them it also did not provide any more 
details on the program except to say the measure was announced by 
moscow mayor gavriil popov 
the move appeared to represent the latest attempt by city 
officials to keep outoftowners from raiding the usually 
betterstocked store shelves in moscow 
in recent weeks there have been fears that moscow will be 
facing a hungry winter because of the nations worsening economy 
problems with supplies of food and a poor harvest of traditionally 
plentiful staples such as potatoes 
residents would not necessarily be limited to these stated 
amounts of meat flour and butter but could buy them at 
higherpriced private markets 
coupons already are issued for sugar and cigarettes limiting 
citizens to 44 pounds of sugar and seven packs of cigarettes per 
month per person other cities in the country have different 
limitations on these goods and others including vodka 
the coupons do not ensure that the products can be found 
however even with coupons some residents have a hard time finding 
sugar for sale at state stores 
in may state stores began requiring that shoppers in moscow 
show their internal passports to prove they live in the region the 
move stemmed from a wave of panicbuying that followed the 
announcement of plans to increase prices of certain goods plans 
that later were canceled 
the residence requirement angered shoppers who had to remember 
to carry their passports with them and slowed down long queues 
while sales clerks looked for the stamp that indicated moscow 
residency many clerks simply stopped checking for the residency 
stamp defeating the purpose of the regulations 
the moskovsky komsomolets newspaper sarcastically headlined the 
brief article on the introduction of the food coupons lets have 
a feast

reluctantly and for the first time the soviet 
union gave its qualified consent thursday to the use of military 
force to get iraqi invaders out of kuwait if peaceful pressure 
tactics fail 
but even as us secretary of state james a baker iii 
accomplished this goal it became apparent that an arms control 
treaty due for signing in paris in less than two weeks was still 
not finished 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said there were 
problems concluding the accord to reduce nato and warsaw pact 
tanks antiaircraft artillery and other nonnuclear weapons in 
europe 
us officials who demanded anonymity said the problems were 
more than technical in nature and that baker would leave behind 
arms control experts to keep working on them when he flies to 
london and paris on friday to continue his consultations on the 
persian gulf situation 
baker came to moscow on wednesday seeking at least soviet 
acquiescence to the bush administrations intention of having the 
un security council authorize the use of force as a last resort 
to liberate kuwait 
his visit came as president bush announced in washington that he 
has ordered a new wave of us troops to the persian gulf area to 
give the multinational military force there an adequate offensive 
military option should that be necessary 
baker has talked about the military option during his travels to 
bahrain saudi arabia egypt turkey and the soviet union 
on tuesday in cairo chinese foreign minister qian qichen told 
baker that china along with the soviet union the united states 
france and britain a permanent member of the un security council 
would not block a un resolution on the use of force 
shevardnadze made no mention of military action in a joint news 
conference with baker until he was pressed by reporters 
finally he said whether or not the use of force could be 
ruled out probably this could not be ruled out and a 
situation may emerge which effectively would require such a move 
baker who stood tensely at shevardnadzes side smiled at the 
assertion it was the first time the soviets had indicated publicly 
they would at least acquiesce if the united states which holds the 
presidency of the security council this month attempted to win 
passage of a resolution authorizing force against iraq 
shevardnadze stressed that any decision to use force against the 
iraqis should be taken by the united nations we should not doubt 
the ability of the security council to take wise and mature 
decisions he said 
i would advise against looking for some difference in the 
positions between the soviet union and the united states 
shevardnadze said 
shevardnadze was more evasive in a later session with soviet 
reporters 
asked if moscow would support the use of force under the un 
charter the soviet foreign minister responded with a laugh i 
wont say 
baker said the two governments had agreed on the principle that 
a peaceful settlement is preferable but the use of force could not 
be ruled out 
earlier shevardnadze had said the use of force would be 
undesirable and that the no 1 task of the international 
community is to see that the un resolutions are implemented 
baker met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for nearly 
two hours at his official country residence outside the city and 
held sessions with shevardnadze before and after that meeting the 
talks covered 13 hours after which baker called bush with a 
report 
meanwhile differences still stood in the way of the 
conventional forces in europe treaty the projected centerpiece for 
a 34nation summit meeting in paris nov 1921 
my guess is that we would be able to find a solution to all 
the problems shevardnadze said during a break in his talks with 
baker 
they then returned to the subject and margaret tutwiler the 
state department spokeswoman said they settled a number of 
technical issues 
bush has said he would not attend the summit unless the treaty 
was ready it is the most comprehensive arms control accord in 
history encompassing europe from the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union 
hanging in the balance also is another accord to cut us and 
soviet longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by 30 
percent shevardnadze said there were some difficult problems 
with that pact which bush had hoped to sign at another summit 
meeting this winter in moscow 
the outlook is clouded by disagreement over several issues 
including how much leeway the soviets would have to keep testing 
their ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles

one woman lost an eye and at least 12 other 
people are being treated for serious eye infections after using 
bacteriacontaminated drops made by a pharmacy here doctors said 
thursday 
surgeons at allegheny general hospital this week discovered the 
drops were tainted after the woman who lost her eye was referred to 
them said dr john kennerdell chairman of the hospitals 
ophthalmology department 
once this type of bacteria gains access to the inside of the 
eye it causes a very devastating infection kennerdell said 
thats why its so dangerous 
the majority of the 13 patients mostly women 55 to 78 years 
old took the drops after undergoing cataract surgery during the 
past month kennerdell said 
it isnt known how many people bought or used the contaminated 
drops however pharmacist joseph kilkeary who made the eye drops 
said 20 to 25 customers bought the drops in october they have been 
told to quit using the drug and return it to their doctor or the 
pharmacy 
thirteen people were hospitalized for treatment nine at 
allegheny general three at central medical center and one at eye amp 
ear institute all in pittsburgh doctors said one man who used 
the drops is being monitored by kennerdell but shows no sign of 
infection 
doctors removed the womans right eye last week after 
antibiotics failed the 12 other patients are receiving large doses 
of antibiotics two of the patients have impaired vision and could 
lose an eye kennerdell said 
doctors declined to disclose the patients names 
the drops were sold by hiebers drug store which has been in 
business for more than a century and is owned by kilkeary the 
pharmacist said he makes about 10 bottles at a time for five 
pittsburgh physicians who prescribe the medication 
the drops contain a liquid solution and indocin a nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drug taken in pillform for arthritis although 
the food and drug administration has approved use of indocin for 
arthritis some doctors prescribe it to reduce swelling of the 
retina following eye surgery kennerdell said 
kilkeary dissolves the pills in a liquid solution sterilizes 
the mixture and bottles it 
pharmacists commonly mix solutions not offered by drug companies 
when doctors prescribe them said harvey miller an fda spokesman 
in philadelphia he said the practice is legal as long as doctors 
prescribe the drugs 
the fda will investigate to determine whether any federal laws 
were violated he said 
gary bruell a spokesman for merck sharp amp dohme the maker of 
indocin said the drug is intended to be taken orally for 
arthritic conditions 
we really cant comment on what physicians or pharmacists may 
be doing with the product outside its current labeling he said 
the doctors who prescribed the drops also have been notified 
kennerdell said 
kilkeary said he didnt know how many bottles were contaminated 
lab tests on bottles in the store found no contamination he said 
i have no idea how many bottles were not sterile he said 
kilkeary a pharmacist for more than 40 years said he has sold 
the drops for years without any problems and cant imagine what 
might have gone wrong 
kennerdell said he suspects the pharmacys sterilizer used to 
purify the drops after the solution is mixed was faulty kilkeary 
said he had no reason to suspect the equipment which is new

in an interview in her home last month i dont fear the next

writing now i find all life thrilling so that i like to write i 
like to paint i like to play tennis i like to swim 
i dont like depressing stories about the inevitability of 
someone going down the drain getting old i think its unhealthy

theyre all going to fade away 
hepburn credits her survival in hollywood and life to her 
innate sturdiness 
im tough by nature tough direct she said my father

way if you do something that is unpopular but you believe in it 
i think thats what matters and if someone tries to dissuade you 
from that i would be very tough about it

americans took out a seasonally adjusted 3 
billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in september 
the government said thursday in a report some analysts saw as a 
further sign of a consumer spending slowdown 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a washington 
management consulting company said consumer credit this year will 
increase only 35 percent compared with growth of about 9 percent 
in both 1988 and 1989 
its another sign of slower spending by consumers who account 
for twothirds of the nations economic activity she said 
the federal reserve said consumer credit in september rose 49 
percent at an annual rate after an increase of 5 percent or 31 
billion in august 
while the august borrowing pace was stronger than the 34 
percent rate first reported last month it was slower than the 78 
percent increase posted in july 
ms shaber also said the amount of debt compared to disposable 
personal income has been dropping a sign she said of a lack of 
consumer confidence 
and its not likely to get any better she said 
various surveys have shown that consumer confidence has been 
fading recently particularly after the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 
august 
declines in confidence often mean a drop in spending and thus 
a slower economy even if consumers have the money 
nevertheless automobile loans rose in september for the first 
month since march they posted a 07 percent increase at an annual 
rate to a seasonally adjusted 163 million after a 63 percent or 
15 billion decline in august 
but ms shaber said that while consumer auto purchases picked up 
slightly in september well see much smaller increases if not 
some liquidation in auto loans in the current quarter 
revolving or credit card debt rose 107 percent or 19 
billion down from a 133 percent growth rate in august ms shaber 
said much revolving credit is for convenience buying and is repaid 
in 30 days 
its not really debt she said 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 66 
percent or 12 billion after jumping 117 percent a month 
earlier 
borrowing for mobile homes fell 114 percent or 219 million 
after a 95 percent or 180 million increase in august 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of 
september at 7354 billion

guatemalan voters squeezed by five years 
of rising inflation and crime are approaching this weeks 
presidential elections with chilly indifference 
guatemalas 3 million registered voters were urged to stay away 
from the polls in newspaper ads run thursday by the guatemalan 
national revolutionary unit an umbrella group representing the 
countrys guerrilla organizations 
although the ads did not threaten violence in sundays election 
the group resorted to blowing up bridges and downing trees across 
highways to keep the electorate away during the countrys last 
election in 1985 
president vinicio cerezo of the christian democrat party 
prevented by law from seeking a second term became the countrys 
first civilian president following a series of military or 
militarybacked regimes during his term unemployment inflation 
and crime have risen dramatically 
as many as 29 percent of voters questioned by one pollster said 
they planned to cast a blank ballot on sunday a traditional form 
of protest in this central american country twelve candidates are 
vying for president 
the poll released wednesday by guatemalas private sector 
identified the frontrunner as newspaper publisher jorge rafael 
carpio nicolle of the national center union party with 21 percent 
of the vote 
carpio nicolle who was narrowly defeated by cerezo in a runoff 
election in 1985 has been the frontrunner in polls since he 
announced his candidacy last year 
he was followed with 17 percent of the vote by alvaro enrique 
arzu irigoyen the former mayor of guatemala city who resigned this 
year to run on the advanced national party ticket margin of error 
for the poll was not available 
if no candidate gets a majority of the vote on sunday the two 
frontrunners will compete in a runoff vote on jan 6 with the 
winner taking office on jan 14 a runoff is considered a virtual 
certainty 
voters also will choose 116 members of congress and 300 mayors 
cerezos predecessor retired gen jose efrain rios montt was 
waging a vigorous campaign for sundays election until he was ruled 
constitutionally ineligible to hold office because he came to power 
during a 1982 military coup 
rios montt whose regime of law and order and swift justice is 
remembered fondly by many guatemalans but criticized by rights 
activists urged voters this week to cast blank presidential 
ballots but to vote in the other races 
a rios montt backer has filed a motion to block the elections 
because he was barred from running but legal specialists say it is 
unlikely to be granted 
about 300 foreign observers will attend the elections including 
joao baena soares heads of the organization of american states 
preliminary results from the nations 5630 polling places are 
expected sunday night

secretary baker has been consulting with our key partners in the 
coalition hes met with the emirs of bahrain and kuwait king 
fahd president mubarak as well as the chinese foreign minister 
president ozal foreign minister shevardnadze president gorbachev 
he also will be meeting with prime minister thatcher and president 
mitterrand 
i have been heartened by jims appraisal of the strong 
international solidarity and determination to ensure that iraqs 
aggression does not stand and is not rewarded 
but right now kuwait is struggling for survival and along with 
many other nations weve been called upon to help the 
consequences of our not doing so would be incalculable because 
iraqs aggression is not just a challenge to the security of kuwait 
and other gulf nations but to the better world that we all have 
hoped to build in the wake of the cold war 
and therefore we and our allies cannot and will not shirk our 
responsibilities the state of kuwait must be restored or no 
nation will be safe and the promising future we anticipate will 
indeed be jeopardized 
let me conclude with a word to the young american gis deployed 
in the gulf we are proud of each and every one of you i know you 
miss your loved ones and want to know when youll be coming home 
we wont leave you there any longer than necessary i want every 
single soldier out of there as soon as possible and we are all 
grateful for your continued sacrifice and your commitment 
now with no further ado id be glad to take a couple of 
questions and then refer to when i leave dick take some 
questions and then go over to the pentagon 
helen 
q mr president it sounds like youre going to war you have 
moved from a defensive position to an offensive position and you 
have not said how many more troops you are sending or really why 
president bush well i said why right now and i hope that its 
been very clear to the american people 
q well is there are there new reasons that have moved this 
posture 
president bush no im just continuing to do what we feel is 
necessary to complete our objectives to fulfill our objectives 
that have been clearly stated 
q well are you going to war 
president bush im not we i would love to see a peaceful 
resolution to this question and thats what i want 
q what made you change from defense to offense 
president bush i would like to see a peaceful solution to this 
question i think saddam hussein should fully without condition 
comply to the un resolutions and if this movement of force is 
what convinces him so much the better 
yeah 
q mr president you said that you said last week that the 
sanctions havent had the impact that you wanted some some 
members of the coalition are urging a goslow approach the 
president of egypt says youve got to wait two or three months 
before you judge whether the sanctions have worked are you willing 
to wait that long 
president bush wait for what 
q to see if the sanctions have worked

president bush said thursday he was 
immediately sending significant numbers of additional military 
forces to the persian gulf to build an adequate offensive 
option if needed to drive iraq from kuwait 
asked directly whether he was going to war bush said i would 
like to see a peaceful solution to this question i think saddam 
hussein should fully withdraw his troops from kuwait 
if this movement of force is what convinces him so much the 
better bush said he added later when he surveys the force 
thats there he will recognize that he is up against just a foe 
that he cant possible manage militarily 
the president would not say how big the buildup would be there 
are 230000 americans in the gulf region and secretary of defense 
dick cheney told reporters we will not put an upper limit on 
this deployment 
congressional and administration sources had said overnight that 
two armored divisions from europe would be moved to the gulf an 
armored division has nearly 20000 troops but can require so many 
support units that it may account for as many as 40000 personnel 
cheney said additional army navy and marine forces would be 
involved along with hundreds of battle tanks 
army national guard combat units will be activated for the first 
time though a decision wont be made until later on whether they 
will be shipped overseas or merely filled in behind regular army 
troops sent earlier the defense secretary said 
bush spoke as secretary of state james a baker iii was in 
moscow consulting senior soviet officials over persian gulf 
strategy 
soviet officials said they could not rule out the use of force 
bush called this statement very helpful and said were on 
the same wavelength with president mikhail s gorbachev on goals 
in the middle east 
bush said he hopes international economic sanctions force saddam 
to withdraw but his declaration concerning offensive forces 
dramatically altered his threemonth policy in the persian gulf 
which has been to be able to withstand further aggression by iraq 
it was bushs second news conference of the day earlier he 
discussed political and economic matters but brushed off questions 
about the gulf it was possible that this gave baker time for fresh 
meetings in moscow 
the president said he also had consulted with saudi king fahd 
whose nation has provided the main staging area for the us and 
multinational deployment 
the deployment began at 10000 troops shortly after the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and has grown to 230000 
the new buildup involves a considerable additional increment 
to us forces said cheney he said naval air and heavy ground 
forces from the united states and europe would be deployed 
bush said current forces were adequate as a defense against 
any further provocation by iraq 
to the troops half a world away he pledged we wont leave 
you there any longer than necessary 
cheney stood by the presidents side as he announced 
i have directed him to increase the size of us forces 
committed to desert shield to ensure that the coalition has 
adequate offensive military option should that be necessary 
bush committed american troops three months ago and since then 
has spearheaded the development of an international diplomatic 
response that has included massive forces and several united 
nations resolutions calling on iraq to withdraw its troops from 
kuwait 
asked what had changed that led him to decide to beef up the 
forces he replied that it was a guarantee of the safety of all 
and i think it sends a very strong signal to saddam 
said bush iraqs brutality aggression and violation of 
international law cannot be permitted to succeed 
i find it hard to believe that today nov 8 that he does not 
understand that hes up against a determined unprecedented 
alliance he said 
the president said he believed saddam felt he was going to 
have ust an easy time of it when he moved into kuwait theres 
where the miscalculation was he said bush said the united 
states and other countries decided to confront saddam to guard 
against some horrible world conflagration at a later date 
bush said there were no mixed signals from moscow 
earlier in the day foreign minister eduard shevardnadze had 
said whether or not the use of force could be ruled out 
probably this could not be ruled out and a situation may emerge 
which effectively would require such a move 
it was the first time the soviets had indicated publicly they 
would at least acquiesce if the united states which holds the 
presidency of the un security council this month attempted to 
win passage of a resolution authorizing force against iraq 
in the past shevardnadze had said the use of force would be 
undesirable 
besides shoring up us forces in saudi arabia the new buildup 
would make use of tanks and other equipment covered by upcoming 
limits on conventional forces that are part of a new arms agreement 
to be signed later this month in paris 
in addition cheney said the navy will be sending an estimated 
three additional aircraft carrier groups one additional battleship 
and an amphibious group 
he also said several marine corps units would be dispatched and 
additional army mechanized forces including hundreds of battle 
tanks 
iraq has more than 400000 troops in the region 
bush said at his morning news conference ive been very clear 
that we want to see the sanctions be so successful that we dont 
have to have anybody shooting over there and ive also said were 
not ruling any options out 
referring to the usled coalition that now confronts iraq 
bush said i am determined to hold this coalition together he 
promised to go the extra mile both in conferring with congress 
at home and with us gulf allies abroad to make sure that un 
resolutions calling for complete and unconditional iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait are bring results 
the importance of the baker trip is obvious he added and 
i think that the ingredients are there for full support baker 
has consulted with other allies including the chinese in the 
course of his current trip 
bush said he had good support from the american people and 
id like to feel the american people would support their 
president on whatever decision is made

a longawaited plan to save philadelphia 
from bankruptcy will be unveiled friday but some officials already 
are edgy about the role city pension funds might play 
bondrating agencies already have lowered the citys debt to 
junkbond status the lowest among major us cities 
state house speaker robert w odonnell said thursday he expects 
to announce the plan along with mayor w wilson goode and other 
political leaders 
the plan is expected to address a shortterm cash shortage that 
threatens to halt payments to city vendors and employees next 
month it also is expected to address longterm problems 
contributing to a projected 2064 million deficit this year in the 
citys 219 billion general fund budget 
the plans rough outline leaked in recent days reportedly 
includes a 1 percent local sales tax spending cuts sale of 
cityowned assets and a financial oversight mechanism outside city 
government 
pennsylvania has a 6 percent sales tax but the city does not 
have one of its own 
to avert the cash shortage the plan reportedly includes a 
shortterm borrowing of up to 350 million from the citys 15 
billion pension fund the state treasury and local banks 
several of the steps would require approval by city council and 
the state legislature officials also have sought higher state 
support for court costs and for programs that serve abused and 
neglected children 
odonnell refused to discuss details and said many of them could 
change once they reach lawmakers 
what weve done is go down into details far enough to get a 
sense that it can be done without specifying as part of the 
agreement that this is the way it will be done he said the 
sales tax for example could end up being another type of tax as 
long as it accomplishes the same goal he said 
the city was snubbed by wall street in september when it tried 
to float 375 million in temporary loan notes the money was needed 
to tide the city over until spring when payments from two of its 
three major taxes are due 
bondrating agencies have urged city and state leaders to 
cooperate to find permanent solutions 
failure to address philadelphias financial crisis with 
concerted action is likely to result in nonpayment of debt service 
and the elimination of basic services necessary for the protection 
of people and property standard amp poors corp warned in 
september 
current state law prohibits the city board of pensions and 
retirement from investing in junk bonds as the citys debt is now 
rated city councilman david cohen and 11 fellow democrats proposed 
an ordinance thursday that would allow the board to invest in 
philadelphia notes regardless of quality 
in my book the obligations of the city of philadelphia are 
extremely high quality we have never defaulted cohen said 
a public hearing on the bill is scheduled for next wednesday and 
it could become law as early as nov 21 cohen said 
at the urging of labor organizations the pension boards 
investment committee voted thursday to hire an outside attorney to 
determine if board members legally could approve an investment in

california emergency officials thursday 
issued the nations first detailed plan for warning the public of 
imminent earthquakes and valid quake predictions 
scientists still cant predict exactly when and where a quake 
will occur but the new plan reflects scientists growing ability 
to use historic patterns of seismic activity to identify times and 
places where odds of a damaging earthquake are greater than usual 
the 140page shortterm earthquake prediction response plan 
spells out how scientists and officials will warn the public of 
such situations as well as policies and procedures for responding 
to predictions the state office of emergency services said 
the plan was released during a meeting of 180 southern 
california government officials the conference was designed to 
help them learn how to protect public safety when the state 
endorses an earthquake prediction or issues a formal warning 
called an advisory that a dangerous quake may be imminent 
there is no other state or even the federal government 
that has such a formal plan to respond to earthquake predictions 
and forecasts said richard andrews the emergency agencys chief 
deputy director 
andrews said the plan sharply contrasts with the depiction of 
state emergency officials in nbcs miniseries the big one the 
great los angeles earthquake that will be broadcast nationwide 
sunday and monday nights in the movie a state official tries to 
suppress a quake prediction to protect real estate interests 
the very clear policy of the state of california is that 
scientific conclusions and validated earthquake predictions will be 
issued to the government and public in a systematic way andrews 
said 
research by the us geological survey shows that after any 
quake in california there is a 6 percent chance of a larger quake 
within a few days 
after several quakes in recent years state officials used that 
knowledge to issue advisories that there was an increased chance of 
a larger quake within three to five days 
the new plan contains specific procedures state emergency 
officials will use to consult with scientists and issue future 
quake advisories hopefully within two hours of a quake that may be 
a foreshock to a seismic disaster 
andrews said such warnings will allow county and city officials 
to activate emergency operations centers charge up emergency 
generators evacuate highrisk buildings close schools and urge 
people to stay home 
the plan also specifies how the office of emergency services and 
the california earthquake prediction evaluation council will 
evaluate and respond to quake predictions 
the response could range from declaring the prediction invalid 
to endorsing a prediction by issuing a formal warning or even 
urging the governor to declare a state of emergency to prepare for 
possible imminent disaster 
studies of public reaction to warnings of hurricanes and other 
disasters show residents will not panic in response to a quake 
warning but will take appropriate steps to prepare said denis 
mileti a colorado state university sociologist he is chairman of 
the national academy of sciences natural disasters committee 
california officials issued two earthquake advisories in 1988 
and 1989 after quakes over magnitude 5 on the richter scale 
ruptured the san andreas fault in northern californias santa cruz 
mountains 
those advisories expired without a larger quake but the same 
section of the fault finally gave way in the magnitude 71 loma 
prieta quake that killed more than five dozen people and caused at 
least 7 billion in damage in the san francisco bay area in october 
1989 
andrews and others credited the warnings for raising the level 
of preparedness in the region averting even greater destruction 
when the larger quake hit

president bush well were well i think from talking to jim 
baker and recently to president mubarak that we are in total sync 
with him but i hope that the sanctions will work within a 
twomonth period but i dont think weve got a difference with 
egypt on this at all terry 
q the question is how long are you willing to give 
president bush well i cant tell you how long im not going 
to if i if i knew i certainly wouldnt want to signal that to 
to saddam hussein 
yeah john 
q prime minister thatcher said yesterday that if indeed saddam 
doesnt withdraw from kuwait that you and the allies will use 
force i havent heard you say that before youve talked about 
wanting to retain the option of force but would you use force 
president bush well i i dont want to go to say what i 
will or will not do but certainly i noted what prime minister 
thatcher said one of the strongest members of this coalition and 
shes an eloquent spokesman for her views and speaks in a way that 
shows that were all together 
so i have not ruled out the use of force at all and i think 
thats evident by what were doing here today 
q sir can i just follow that up by by going back to a speech 
you gave at the pentagon back in august when you talked about oil 
affecting the middle east oil reserves you talked about american 
jobs in fact the american way of life being endangered 
yet when you went out on the campaign trail you seemed to shy 
away from oil you said demonstrators dont seem to understand that 
were not going to go to war for oil but that was one of the 
things you talked about and in fact isnt oil part of the 
american national interest isnt that a main reason were there 
president bush it is a part of it but it is not the main 
reason or id say a main reason a main reason were there is to 
set back aggression to see that aggression is unrewarded 
my argument with some of the protests is that they seem to 
focus to suggest that oil is the sole reason that we are involved 
in this enormous commitment and that is simply not correct 
theres a lot of other interests and the restoration of the 
security and stability in the persian gulf region clearly relates 
to the worlds economic interests im not denying that and im not 
backing away from the fact that all the western world has you 
know a real interest in that but that my argument with those 
people is that they are missing the point the point is it is the 
aggression against kuwait that has caused this coalition to come 
together as it has 
yeah ann 
q do you feel that you are free to take offensive action 
without any kind of un resolution authorizing it 
president bush yes we have the authority but weve weve 
been great believers in going to the united nations and i think 
one of the major successes has been the ability to have world 
opinion totally on our side because of un action the 
peacekeeping function of the united nations has indeed been 
rejuvenated by the actions of the security council 
way in the back because ive been accused by a distinguished 
senior reporter of not getting into the back of the room so id 
like to rectify that

farmers are closing in on a 1990 corn harvest 
estimated at a fouryear high of 793 billion bushels up 5 percent 
from last year but down slightly from prospects last month the 
agriculture department said thursday 
the latest outlook based on nov 1 indications was down 1 
percent from the departments october forecast the harvest was 
about 64 percent completed by oct 28 only slightly behind normal 
many growers continue to report yields lower than previously 
anticipated the departments agricultural statistics board said 
ears in lateplanted fields in indiana did not fill out corn 
borers also did considerable damage in illinois 
farmers harvested 753 billion bushels in 1989 and the 
department in its initial 1990 forecast aug 9 put this falls 
harvest at 785 billion bushels 
the forecast was raised on sept 12 to 812 billion bushels and 
then lowered to 802 billion on oct 11 
at 793 billion bushels this years harvest still would be the 
largest since farmers produced 823 billion bushels in 1986 
according to usda records 
based on the latest surveys the average corn yield nationally 
was estimated at 119 bushels per acre harvested compared with 
1162 last year and 1203 indicated last month the record was 
1194 bushels in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 19 billion bushels down 1 percent from last 
years harvest of 193 billion bushels but 4 percent more than the 
october forecast of 182 billion bushels 
cotton production was indicated at 149 million bales up 22 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales and 2 percent 
more than the october forecast 
no new estimates of 1990 production of wheat and other crops 
harvested earlier were included in the report 
the fall crop of potatoes was estimated for the first time this 
season at 342 million hundredweight up 5 percent from last year 
due to an increase in acreage average yields were forecast at 298 
hundredweight per acre down one hundredweight from 1989 
drought in north dakota and minnesota cut into production 
potential for the third straight year the report said maine 
farmers were hit by heavy october rains followed by hard freezes 
late in the month that virtually shut down harvest operations 
the potato outlook also was said to be hurt by extremely 
variable temperatures in idaho oregon and washington during the 
growing season 
in a related supplyanddemand report analysts said total corn 
use in the 199091 marketing year which began sept 1 is expected 
to be about 8045 billion bushels 
with use exceeding estimated production the us corn stockpile 
may decline to a projected 1236 billion bushels by sept 1 1991 
compared with 1344 billion this sept 1 
the report said corn prices at the farm may average 220 to 
260 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year down from 236 in 
198990 and unchanged from the october projection 
soybean prices were indicated to average 535 to 635 per 
bushel down from the october range of 570 to 7 per bushel 
this falls larger crop is putting pressure on prices and will 
mean a rise in soybean stockpiles in 199091 by next sept 1 the 
report said soybean inventories could be around 255 million 
bushels compared with 239 million bushels this sept 1 and last 
months projection of 175 million bushels next year 
the report also showed the soviet unions grain harvest at 235 
million metric tons this year unchanged from the october forecast 
however analysts said soviet grain imports in 199091 now are 
expected to be 28 million tons down from 30 million anticipated 
last month 
an allcrops production index was reported at 112 percent of the 
1977 average used for comparison up one percentage point from 
october and the highest reading since the index averaged 116 
percent in 1985 
other 1990 crop estimates based on nov 1 indications compared 
with 1989 output included 
sorghum 5598 million bushels and an average yield of 605 
bushels per acre compared with 6179 million and 554 in 1989

school health clinics should open their 
doors to infants toddlers and pregnant women as a way of helping 
children begin their education ready to learn an insurance 
official said thursday 
the pressing challenge to our corporations our schools and 
our partnerships in education is to give our poorest children a 
strong start for a productive life in a highly competitive world 
said f peter libassi senior vice president of the hartford 
connbased travelers cos 
millions of children he said enter kindergarten in poor health 
because they dont receive medical care during infancy poverty and 
poor health are major barriers to learning he said 
starting to reform education even at the kindergarten level is 
still not close enough to the heart of the problem libassi said 
at a national symposium on education initiatives sponsored by the 
national association of partners in education 
now the question is is it possible for our health 
clinics that are in our schools to be available not only to the 
schoolage child but to the preschoolage child in the 
neighborhood he said 
school clinics also could provide prenatal care he said 
libassi said the city of hartford may embark on a program to 
expand primary health care and preventive services in neighborhood 
health centers and schools 
a local hospital board is considering a proposal to create a new 
childrens fund to finance the program using 25 million of the 
hospitals endowment the hartford business community has pledged 
10 million he said 
a 1987 study found onefourth of all hartford kindergarten 
children were not ready or able to go on to first grade in one 
school that number was more than 40 percent 
the american academy of pediatrics said about 16 million 
children and adolescents through age 21 have no health insurance 
and that 26 percent of women in their childbearing years ages 
1544 have no insurance coverage for maternity care 
the national association of partners in education is an 
organization of 7000 schools businesses community groups

q mr president 
president bush yes sir no him 
q do you yet have the support you need in order to secure an 
additional resolution from the un security council to explicitly 
authorize the use of force do you now have the sufficient support 
on the security council 
president bush id i i would say that the baker mission is 
what it is about is consultation that subject will be discussed 
in some ways im sure that thats not why hes there were 
talking about a wide array of issues and so id say we have not 
tried to specifically poll the 15 members or the other 14 members 
of the security council along those lines so i cant answer 
whether we would or not 
q if i may follow has any country told you they would block 
such a resolution 
president bush not none some may have said such a thing but 
ive not ive not its not been brought to my attention at all 
and i again i think id know if that were the case but i dont 
think so 
yeah 
q mr president it would seem that the situation at the us 
embassy in kuwait is crucial to the future of the overall situation 
in the gulf what is the latest there what is the situation with 
their food and water supplies and do you plan have anything in 
the works now to resupply them 
president bush well i think its unconscionable to try to 
starve people out and to isolate them from food and supplies of all 
kinds and thats exactly whats going on in terms of how long 
they can survive im not sure i could give you a specific answer 
but i believe the answer would be a few weeks something of that 
nature 
q are there plans to resupply them when they run out or 
president bush well if there were given the hostile 
environment in which these people are living it would be 
unproductive to discuss it 
yes 
q mr president what has happened in the last two weeks that 
has led you to put now an offensive force into saudi arabia 
president bush well we have we have not only offensive but 
defensive forces there already and what leads me to do this is 
just because i believe upon the advice of our able secretary of 
defense and others that this is in the best security interests of 
our people that are there and of the coalition 
i think it is the best i think it is just a guarantee of the 
safety of all and i think it sends a very strong signal another 
strong signal to saddam hussein that we are very very serious 
about the success of the united to seeing the united nations 
resolutions complied to in their entirety without without any 
kind of watering down 
q sir would you say that were in a critical phase now between 
a peaceful solution and possible armed conflict 
president bush i wouldnt phrase it that way 
q mr president the longer that you wait or the longer that 
no action is taken in kuwait the less and less theres seems to be 
of kuwait 
whats the point of waiting if theres not going to be anything 
left of that country when you finally decide to go in 
president bush well ive told you that i want to i would 
like to feel that saddam hussein would come to his senses and 
comply under economic pressure with the sanctions that have been 
taken in the united nations and with the objectives 
i would like to think the sanctions economic sanctions would 
compel him to do that which he has been unwilling to do 
regrettably he keeps reiterating his view that this is this 
is not kuwait but province 19 and that is unacceptable to the 
united states and to our partners 
so its i think were giving these sanctions time to work 
were giving world opinion time to mobilize and impress on him 
that that were all serious and that but now were moving up 
our forces for the reasons ive given you

presidential palace to protest press laws carried over from the 
deposed regime of manuel antonio noriega 
president guillermo endara who this week sued a newspaper 
columnist met the journalists outside the palace and angrily 
defended a law under which slander is heavily penalized 
the president of the republic is a person and is going to 
demand reponsibility when there is an attempt to damage his 
honor endara said that is what i will do in each and every 
one of the cases and there is no persecution

overthrew noriega has filed a slander and damage complaint against 
dagoberto franco of the daily el siglo franco was detained for two 
days and released on 5000 bond 
franco had written a column entitled endara the great 
swindle 
at least 60 formal complaints have been filed against 
journalists this year mostly by officials the protesters said 
journalists are asking that slander be changed from a criminal 
to a civil violation the current penalty is two to five years in 
jail 
in their letter the journalists said we are here because 21 
years of castrated journalism has left us a bitter taste of exiles 
threats pressures and fears that we never want to repeat 
endara told the journalists im not a secondclass citizen i 
dont have more privileges than anyone else but i have equal 
rights with you 
the constitution provides for freedom of expression but says

q after you have consulted if i might follow up on this 
deployment and in fact on the military situation overall with the 
other countries involved in the multinational forces there have 
been complaints observations out of israel that were there to be 
offensive action there needs to be coordination or some sort of 
chain of command involving the israelis too for they may end up 
being involved 
to what extent are you communicating with the israelis and to 
what extent do you envision any role or possible role for the 
israelis should this come to war 
president bush well i think the whole world knows that the 
united states is has a very special relationship with israel a 
strong relationship i think were in close touch with the key 
players there in terms of our objectives and i think theyve 
conducted themselves in a regarding all of this very well 
indeed but im not going to discuss any more details than that 
but i i feel that were on a good wavelength there 
q mr president 
president bush we have some differences obviously really i got 
just one and one and then ive got to go 
yes 
q mr president to follow up 
president bush i recognize him on the aisle go ahead yes 
you and ellen and then 
q to follow up on wyatts question after foreign minister 
shevardnaze made his comments today president gorbachev seemed to 
say that it was too early to talk about the use of force 
are the soviets sending us mixed signals 
president bush no 
q is this an indication that like president mubarak made 
earlier in the week that some of our allies want more time to try 
to find a diplomatic solution before use of force 
president bush i dont i dont get the feeling were getting 
any mixed signals at all from the soviets particularly after ive 
talked to to jim baker i know there was some feeling there were 
mixed signals because of mr primakovs mission but as that has 
upon the completion of that i think people recognize that we are 
still very much in accord in agreement with the soviet on matters 
as it relates to the gulf 
so its good ann and its strong and i just cant worry about 
that point at all after talking to jim baker 
q does jim baker have an explanation for the difference between 
mr shevardnadzes remarks and mr gorbachevs remarks today 
president bush no he made the point that if we were together 
with them and that was not discussed any differences on the 
q mr president 
president bush on the aisle

president bush no last one on the aisle the lovely 
gentleman with the glasses

saddam hussein will not move until he is until the 11th hour or 
1159 when he is totally convinced that you are about to use 
military force why is he not convinced now do you think why 
how do you expect that you will be able to get to that 1159 in a

mount now under moslem control and to expand jewish neighborhoods 
in annexed east jerusalem 
he told members of his likud bloc in tel aviv these measures 
were needed to stop deterioration in the security situation a 
sharon spokesman said in a statement carried by the national itim 
news agency 
on oct 8 police shot and killed 20 palestinians during a riot 
on the mount revered by arabs as islams third holiest site and by 
jews as the site of their ancient temple 
there must be jewish rule on the temple mount the temple 
mount is the root of the problem sharon said

uprising must be deported naming prominent proplo activists 
faisal husseini and sari nusseibeh and gaza strip leaders fayez

a man charged in mail bombings that killed a 
federal judge and a lawyer refused thursday to enter a plea 
pending his attempt to bar any federal judge from hearing the case 
in a hearing before a federal magistrate lawyers for walter 
leroy moody jr said the fact that a federal judge was one of the 
victims damages the impartiality of all federal judges 
moodys attorneys requested in a court motion that the senate 
judiciary committee appoint an independent officer to hear the 
case 
us magistrate william harper referred the case to us 
district judge richard freeman for trial no hearing was scheduled 
on the motion an innocent plea was automatically entered for moody 
because of his refusal to enter a plea 
special assistant us attorney howard shapiro would not comment 
on the motion which said every federal judge in the country has 
altered working habits and lifestyles because of the mail bombings 
last year 
a federal indictment issued wednesday includes a murder charge 
against moody in the slaying of judge robert vance in alabama and 
explosives charges related to the death of georgia civil rights 
lawyer robert robinson 
alabama officials said moody 56 may also face state murder 
charges and the death penalty in the slaying of vance a member of 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
authorities in georgia said they have not seen enough of the 
evidence most of it developed by federal authorities to decide 
whether to press state charges against him in the death of robinson 
in savannah 
the murder charge in te 70count indictment carries a maximum 
penalty of life in prison and a 250000 fine no murder charge was 
included for robinsons death moody was charged with transporting 
explosive material with intent to kill in that death the charge 
also carries a maximum penalty of life and 250000 
moody also is charged with a variety of other offenses related 
to the bombings if convicted on all 70 counts he could face seven 
life terms plus 385 years in prison and fines of 169 million 
jimmy evans alabamas attorney generalelect and currently 
montgomery county district attorney said because moody is a 
federal prisoner there would be no petition to extradite him to 
alabama instead the state would borrow moody from federal 
authorities long enough to prosecute him evans said 
he favors pursuing the death penalty if feasible 
my thought is that the person responsible for the murder of 
the late robert vance should be tried capitally and put in the 
electric chair whoever is guilty for this should receive the 
maximum penalty and punishment evans said 
current alabama attorney general don siegelman said however 
that if moody is acquitted in the federal trial there would be 
little use in trying him in alabama 
in georgia chatham county district attorney spencer lawton jr 
said he has not seen enough evidence in the robinson death to 
determine whether to pursue a murder charge against moody 
lawton said that after the first few days following the savannah 
explosion federal authorities took over the investigation almost 
exclusively 
since then weve taken no substantial role in the 
investigation lawton said the net of all this is i am totally 
unaware of the factual basis for the federal indictment 
lawton said wednesday he was trying to contact federal 
authorities to gain access to evidence that would help him decide 
whether to seek local charges against moody 
roger brown assistant district attorney in jefferson county 
ala where vance was killed at his home said he too planned to 
review the federal evidence to determine if local prosecutors would 
get involved

president bush well im not sure i accept the 1159 analogy 
but if there has ever been any doubt in his mind about the 
seriousness of the west and of the other arab countries and of the 
coalition put it that way i think that those doubts are rapidly 
being dispelled 
you see i do believe that when he moved into kuwait i think he 
felt he was going to have just an easy time of it and that the 
world would not rise up in arms against the aggression i think he 
miscalculated there i believe he thought he could just take over 
kuwait and then thered be a lot of talk and discussion and he 
would be able to turn kuwait a sovereign nation a member of the 
arab league a member of the united nations into province 19 
and the united states along with other countries said no 
were not going to permit this aggression to stand because an 
unchecked aggression today could lead to some horrible world 
conflagration tomorrow 
and so i think theres where the miscalculation originally was 
i find it hard to believe that today november 8th he does not 
understand that hes up against a determined unprecedented 
alliance and so i hope that he is rethinking his position of 
unyielding of unyielding opposition to the will of the rest of 
the world 
and i would think that when he surveys the force thats there 
this force thats going what other countries are doing in this 
regard he will recognize that he is up against a just an a foe 
that he cant possibly manage militarily and margaret thatcher 
touched on that yesterday and i thought she did it very well 
indeed 
and so if nothing else happens im convinced that this move 
will show him how serious we are as a significant partner in this 
coalition and i think its a good thing it has will have strong 
support from others around the world and lets hope he comes to 
his senses and does tomorrow that which he should have done weeks 
ago because this aggression simply will not stand 
now dick its all yours 
secretary cheney as the president indicated weve got a 
briefing scheduled in the pentagon for general powell and myself in 
a few minutes to fill out the details of the decision the 
presidents made today but id be happy to respond to a couple of 
questions 
q how many troops are being sent and how many 
secretary cheney we have let me address the question of 
numbers we have consistently since the very beginning of this 
operation in august three months ago indicated that we were not 
going to put a number on the deployment as we have achieved a 
certain level of deployment weve reported that weve had 150000 
or 200000 today were at 230000plus we will not put an upper 
limit on this deployment 
we started the flow back in august and what the president has 
directed me to do today is to assign additional units to go to the 
gulf and it is a considerable additional increment of us force 
involves additional heavy divisions as well as naval and air 
forces 
and well announce 
q coming from where 
secretary cheney coming from both europe and the united states 
and we will announce those details in a few minutes 
michael 
q mr secretary in europe we waited 40 years for economic 
pressures to lead the soviet union to withdraw its forces from 
eastern europe despite a number of aggressions why shouldnt we 
wait a year or so for economic sanctions to take hold in iraq and 
lead the iraqis to leave kuwait 
and if were prepared to wait why should we send such a large 
force at this time since its harder to sustain a large force in 
the desert than a somewhat smaller force 
secretary cheney well the directions ive been given by the 
president are i think very clearcut that is to say that were 
to continue the policy thats currently in force that the military 
units that are in the gulf region are there to deter further 
aggression to defend should deterrence fail to enforce the 
sanctions 
we are also now obviously deploying as the president mentioned 
in his statement sufficient additional force to make certain that 
should circumstances warrant that we will have the capacity to 
undertake offensive military action as well the decision about how 
long we wait and how much time were willing to give sanctions to 
work is something thatll be made above my pay grade 
q mr secretary there are reports that saddam hussein fired 
his military chief of staff today what is going on is there 
dissension in the ranks and does that have something to do with 
the timing of these news conferences to try to keep international 
pressure on him 
secretary cheney i have seen the reports that hes changed out 
his chief of staff i dont have any special knowledge as to why 
that occurred and our announcements are totally unrelated to those 
developments 
in the back 
q mr secretary could you give us a range when does this 
deployment begin when do you expect it to end

a lawyer who favors liberalizing strict 
laws on birth control and abortion appeared in a strong position 
thursday to become irelands first woman president according to 
partial and unofficial returns 
mary robinson trailed former deputy prime minister brian lenihan 
in the preliminary count but preelection polls indicated the 
second round on friday would put her over the top 
it looks like president robinson now said justice minister 
ray burke who had supported lenihan a member of the dominant 
fianna fail party 
its looking good but its not by any manner or means decided 
yet said mrs robinson whose supporters staged early 
celebrations she was nominated by the labor and workers party 
although she has no party affiliation 
as president she would be expected to refrain from any 
political controversies the presidents main powers are the right 
to dissolve parliament when a government has lost support and to 
refer legislation to the supreme court 
on thursday night unofficial returns showed lenihan with 441 
percent of the vote mrs robinson with 389 percent and austin 
currie of fine gael with 17 percent according to press 
association the british news agency 
turnout was estimated at 63 percent of the 247 million eligible 
voters compared with 68 percent in parliamentary elections last 
year 
under the irish system voters mark a second preference on their 
ballots in the second round currie stands to be eliminated and 
his votes distributed among the two top finishers 
a poll published tuesday in the irish times indicated curries 
supporters preferred mrs robinson by 3to1 over lenihan currie 
had urged his supporters to make her their second choice 
former prime minister garret fitzgerald of fine gael said on 
irish radio that he expected mrs robinson to finish with 52 
percent of the vote 
mrs robinson 46 would be the first leftist candidate to be 
president of ireland and the first since 1945 who didnt come from 
fianna fail 
she is a lecturer in european community law at trinity college 
in dublin and has supported more liberal contraception laws

about abortion which is outlawed in ireland but available in 
britain 
lenihan 59 was first elected to parliament in the 1960s and 
has held several cabinet posts 
prime minister charles haughey was forced to dismiss lenihan as 
deputy prime mininster and defense minister last week to save his 
coalition government from collapse

to keep president patrick hillery from calling a national election

opinion polls 
currie 51 was a leader in the catholic civil rights campaign 
in northern ireland in the 1960s and a founder of the social 
democratic and labor party the main catholic party there he moved

secretary cheney i signed the deployment orders this morning 
some of the forces had previously been alerted to be ready to 
deploy so in effect the deployment actually begins today it will 
obviously given the size of the deployment be something that will 
run over a significant additional period of time i wouldnt want 
to be more precise than that weve always refrained from 
indicating when a particular unit would be deployed and 
combatready 
clear in the back 
q does this deployment involve a further callup of reserves 
and has there been consultation with congressional leaders today on 
this deployment 
secretary cheney the answer is it will involve an additional 
callup of reserves and there have been notifications to members 
of congress i personally talked with the leadership and the 
chairmen and ranking members of all of the key armed services and 
appropriations committees 
q as you increase your deployments will you be able to 
maintain the promise that i think was made by the joint the 
chairman of the joint chiefs that you would rotate people in and 
out every six months 
secretary cheney weve never made such a promise weve said 
that we were looking at a rotation policy but the forces that we 
are ordering into the area today are not going in there to replace 
those that have already been deployed they are in addition to 
those that are already in the area 
frank 
q mr secretary is it safe to say that the message that is 
being sent from this room today is that the united state is now 
prepared to fight a ground war to force iraq out of kuwait if 
necessary 
secretary cheney the message is as exactly as weve stated 
it and as the president stated it and that is that our policy is 
to see to it that saddam hussein complies with the resolutions 
voted by the un security council 
those are our goals and objectives that we are hopeful that we 
can achieve that peacefully were hopeful we can achieve that 
through the application of the economic sanctions now in force but 
we also have the military option available to us should the other 
course of action be unsuccesful 
one more question and then ive got to run 
q if i may follow up mr secretary 
secretary cheney yes 
q youve been reluctant wait just a mr secretary 
 
staff on whom did you call 
secretary cheney the young man with the hair on the front 
extensive laughter 
q mr secretary do you agree that the winter months are an 
optimal time to fight a war in the desert and is weather 
compelling a decision to use force before the sanctions have had 
secretary cheney i wouldnt want to speculate about future 
deadlines of when sanctions will be deemed to have failed or what 
pressures weather and climate considerations might bring to bear 
we are prepared to carry out the presidents instructions and 
those instructions are as ive already related 
one more question the gentleman i insulted in back and then 
ive got to go yes sir 
q mr secretary youve been reluctant here to use a number 
the number 100000 additional troops has been widely used and 
widely reported is that ballpark accurate 
secretary cheney i have never used the number 100000 weve 
never announced a number until we actually have those additional 
forces in theater well continue to pursue that policy i would 
expect theyll be all kinds of numbers rumored leaked speculated 
about 
but the fact is none of them has any official standing we have 
opened up the pipeline to send forces to the gulf and to saudi 
arabia in support of desert shield and we are today announcing 
that there are additional forces going as part of that overall 
effort 
thank you very much

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
plans to nominate his chief of staff virendra dayal of india as 
the next un high commissioner for refugees a un spokesman said 
thursday 
the nomination may be opposed norway has its own candidate 
former un ambassador tom vraalsen to replace the former 
commissioner who was norwegian 
thorvald stoltenberg resigned last week to become deputy prime 
minister in norways new government 
the high commissioner for refugees is responsible for about 15 
million refugees worldwide including about 5 million afghans now 
in pakistan and iran about 2 million refugees in southern africa 
and the horn of africa 
the genevabased agency has been demoralized by the resignation 
of two commissioners in a years time 
perez de cuellars spokesman francois giuliani said the un 
chief has been conferring with regional group leaders in the 
general assembly on dayal the only candidate he is discussing 
the secretarygeneral names the commissioner but the general 
assembly must approve the candidate 
dayal has been chief of staff since 1982 from 197982 he was 
director in the office of the undersecretarygeneral for special 
political affairs he was a senior official in the unhcr from 
196579 
his intended nomination aroused some opposition among nordic and 
other western nations which traditionally provide the unhcr 
nominee 
un sources speaking on condition of anonymity said perez de 
cuellar would probably formally announce dayal despite such 
opposition 
the western countries would be reluctant to vote against a 
candidate from india a major developing country they said 
stoltenberg served in the post about 11 months replacing 
jeanpierre hocke of switzerland who resigned under a cloud in 
october 1989 
hocke was accused of misusing a special education fund for 
refugees to upgrade his air travel to first class and was accused 
by his staff of financial mismanagement and favoritism 
hocke admitted using the fund to get better airline seats but 
denied misusing un funds 
the unhcrs budget has been stuck for years at a ceiling of 
about 550 million although the number of refugees has grown from 
7 million to 15 million in a decade

iraq obtained the technology to make 
cluster bombs through a pennsylvania company that did illegal 
business through a chilean arms dealer a newspaper reported 
thursday 
federal investigators told the intelligencer journal in 
lancaster that the technology for the bombs came from the 
international signal amp control corp which was started by former 
lancaster businessman james h guerin 
guerins business partner carlos cardoen of chile subsequently 
sold the technology to iraq in violation of a 1977 law barring 
chile from receiving us military technology the newspaper said 
cluster bombs release hundreds of smaller bombs on impact or 
above a target the smaller bombs can cover an area equivalent to 
10 football fields with shrapnel and incendiary fragments 
the smaller bombs can detonate at various times up to 72 hours 
after the main bomb has been dropped 
the newspaper reported previously that guerin who now lives in 
naples fla has agreed to plead guilty to fraud for inflating the 
value of his company prior to its merger with the british defense 
giant ferranti international plc 
court records also indicate guerin is under investigation for 
illegal arms sales to south africa and other countries barred from 
getting arms from the united states the newspaper said 
the cluster bomb technology reached iraq with help from the 
iraqiowned british precision tooling firm matrix churchill the 
newspaper reported citing federal sources it did not identify 
nasser beydoun cardoens former weapons salesman to iraq and 
libya told the intelligencer journal through his attorney that he 
was aware of the sale of cluster bomb technology to chile as early 
as 1983 and its subsequent shipment to iraq in 1987 
the newspaper said cardoen 48 used his santiago headquarters 
to ship the bombs to baghdad via iraqi airways or by ship from the 
port of iquique beydoun said 
much of the planning for the shipments was done from cardoens 
miami lakes subsidiary swissco management group beydoun told the 
newspaper 
cardoens attorney in miami abbey kaplan would not comment on 
beydouns claims 
the newspaper citing other sources it did not identify said 
cardoen began contract negotiations with iraq in 1983 for the sale 
of the international signaldesigned cluster bombs international 
signal is based in lancaster county 
a chilean source told the intelligencer journal that cardoen is 
believed to have sold iraq 20000 of one kind of cluster bomb for 
7100 each and 4000 of another kind of cluster bomb 
a spokesman for cardoen spokesman in santiago denied any 
association with isc beyond enlisting the help of two of its 
engineers to solve a technical problem with a radiodetonated 
explosive destined for the chilean air force 
sources told the intelligencer journal however that a 
threeman team from isc suppiled charts drawings and designs that 
cardoen used to build an iraq bombmaking plant in 198687 
cardoen displayed the technology at an arms and air show in 
chile in late march the newspaper said

legal and religious experts have 
ruled that a group of saudi women who defied tradition by driving 
15 cars through riyadh did not violate civil or moral laws 
informed sources said thursday night 
but the experts assembled by the governor of riyadh prince 
salman bin abdelaziz said they shouldnt do it again the sources 
said 
the protesters won at least a moral victory because the rulings 
mean there is no ban in islamic or civil law to women driving the 
sources predicted women will eventually be allowed to drive in this 
conservative arab country probably within six months to two years 
the veiled women most of them middleaged and married startled 
this desert kingdom tuesday by taking the steering wheels in the 
first open protest by women here fifteen of them drove the cars 
and 35 rode along in support 
police stopped the convoy and took the women to a police 
station saudi officials said they were released after signing a 
pledge that they would not repeat their protest elsewhere 
many of the women were concerned that if there is a war in saudi 
arabia with their husbands away they will be trapped at home 
said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
although there is no written law barring saudi women from 
driving they are prohibited from doing so under strict islamic 
tradition 
during tuesdays protest the saudi religious police known as 
the committee for commendation of virtue and prevention of vice 
insisted after rounding up the women that they be arrested for 
committing a moral offense 
but king fahd intervened and told the religious police that the 
incident was being investigated by the prominent religious scholars 
and legal experts assembled by the governor of riyadh the sources 
said they did not disclose the identities of the experts 
organizers of the demonstration said many of the women came from 
prominent families and had drivers licenses from europe and the 
united states the women insisted there was nothing political about 
their protest 
at least some members of the saudi royal family reportedly favor 
ending the ban on women driving but have not pushed for it because 
of opposition elsewhere in the country 
western women drive inside the huge saudi aramco compound for 
oil field workers in dhahran 
in addition uniformed american women soldiers drive military 
vehicles as part of their job the soldiers are in saudi arabia as 
part of the international force opposing iraq

the sandinista defense chief offered 
thursday to clear out contra rebels who have blocked access to much 
of eastern nicaragua in practically a coup against president 
violeta chamorros government 
gen humberto ortega said the army and police were awaiting mrs 
chamorros goahead to free the strategic rama road the sole 
overland connection between a large chunk of eastern nicaragua and 
the rest of the country 
for the past week rebels have blocked the eastwest road between 
juigalpa about 85 miles southeast of managua to rama another 90 
miles east a reporter who checked three of the 14 roadblocks on 
tuesday saw no one armed but ortega said he had reports of weapons 
trafficking on the road 
the rebels also control bluefields an atlantic coast town 35 
miles east of rama said ap photographer ruben farina who visited 
the city of about 35000 he said there was no fighting there 
mrs chamorro called for a meeting in managua with 14 mayors 
from southeastern nicaraguan who support the blockade the mayors 
are all members of the coalition that elected her last february 
ending the 10year sandinista government 
the mayors and the demobilized rebels claim mrs chamorro has 
not fulfilled promises of aid and has left the sandinistas with too 
much power they are demanding the firing of defense minister 
ortega antonio laayo the presidential chief of staff interior 
minister carlos hurtado and the chiefs of the sandinista police 
and sandinista peoples army 
the sandinistas still control security forces under an accord 
reached with mrs chamorro after the feb 25 elections although 
ortega officially resigned from the sandinista party as part of the 
agreements conservatives dislike lacayo because they claim he has 
negotiated away too much power to the sandinistas 
ortega urged the rebels to abandon their blockade and said he 
hoped force would not have to be used 
those who have been provoking the climate of boycotts 
chaos are not political parties or labor unions but mayors 
with demands of a change of government practically a coup 
detat he said at a news conference 
monsignor pablo antonio vega the conservative bishop of 
juigalpa and a supporter of the blockade said the 14 mayors were 
considering whether to heed the presidents call for talks 
southeastern nicaragua was an area of support for the contra 
rebels during their war against the leftist sandinista government 
the current blockade has isolated a rich agricultural region and 
is causing heavy losses for ranchers and farmers 
ortega also announced the retirement of 5000 officers from the 
armed forces by the first of the year he said that would shrink 
nicaraguas armed forces to 28000 members making it the fourth 
largest in central america it once was the largest in the region 
with about 100000 people under arms 
central american governments have agreed to reduce their armies 
which eat up scarce resources are frequently accused of committing 
rights abuses and tend to be unaccountable to the civilian 
governments they are supposed to defend

the food and drug administration urged 
consumers thursday to stop taking an illegally marketed and 
possibly dangerous drug used for strength training and body 
building

in that state to stop using the drug 
ghb is sold as powder or granules through mail order outlets 
health food stores bodybuilding gyms and fitness centers it is 
promoted for strength training body building weight loss and as a 
replacement for ltryptophan 
ltryptophan a food supplement used as a sleep aid and for 
depression and weight control was ordered off the market last 
march when it was linked to an outbreak of a rare blood disorder 
called eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome 
ghb is being evaluated in approved clinical trials as a 
treatment for narcolepsy a sleep disorder in europe ghb has been 
used as an adjunct to anesthesia the agency said 
it is not approved for any uses in the united states but the 
drug agency said ghb has been promoted as a legal psychedelic 
the agency advised anyone taking ghb outside of the clinical 
trials which are supervised by physicians to stop taking it 
immediately 
the agency also said that anyone taking ghb who is having 
seizures uncontrolled shaking headache unexplained drowsiness or 
other central nervous system disorders nausea vomiting or 
diarrhea should see a physician immediately 
physicians treating patients with these symptoms were asked to 
report the cases to their local poison control center

three states to learn more about the illnesses and so far there is 
strong evidence linking these to the drug

antiabortion laws on thursday warned germany against sacrificing 
western values during the reconstruction of their nation 
speaking at a ceremony to accept credentials of germanys new 
ambassador to the holy see the pope spoke of the challenge of 
emphasizing moral and social values following the unification of 
east and west germany 
the status of abortion has emerged as a major issue in 
reunification east germanys communist regime allowed abortion 
virtually on demand while west german legislation was more 
restrictive it required that a woman prove the pregnancy would 
harm her health or cause financial hardship 
german politicians have decided to let their next parliament 
which will be elected in december decide the issue 
the reconstruction in a part of germany and in central and 
eastern europe currently requires the concurrence of many forces 
the pope noted 
nonetheless that doesnt impede the continued vigilance of 
social structures and the resolute commitment to maintain 
fundamental values of society that belong to all the west the 
safeguarding of life both of the born and unborn is a great good 
that must not be sacrificed 
the comments marked the second time that the pope has expressed 
concern about abortion in a public speech aimed at germans in 
june he told romes germanspeaking community that abortion 
debases humanity

william j bennett bade farewell as 
drugpolicy director with characteristic bluster thursday boasting 
americans have turned against drugs and dismissing a congressional 
critic as a gasbag 
he allowed that his efforts to rid the nations capital of drugs 
didnt work but said it did not help that mayor marion barry who 
has been convicted of cocaine possession was part of the 
problem 
bennett at a white house sendoff with president bush denied 
reports that he had run out of gas or feared for his familys 
safety as the first director of drug policy 
im not the stampededoutoftown type said bennett who 
will actually relinquish his post at the end of the month bush 
said he has not yet settled on a successor 
the president showered bennett with praise saying he had done 
an outstanding job for his country and his hard work has paid 
off 
were on the road to victory said bush who promised to 
stay on the front lines until this scourge is stopped 
the brash bennett 47 predicted that the bush goal of cutting 
drug usage in half within 10 years now can be met in five years if 
states do their part 
your taking this issue on your saying in that inaugural 
address that this scourge will stop coincided with the great 
american change of minds about drugs bennett said to bush at a 
news conference 
this country is beginning to break its interest and habit on 
drugs he said 
the brooklynborn bennett took umbrage with a parting shot fired 
at him earlier by rep charles rangel dny chairman of the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
rangel called bennetts 19month tenure a colossal failure 
saying he used the job as a bull pulpit sic running around the 
country preaching that families should stay together that we 
shouldnt use drugs 
i never thought i would miss nancy reagan said rangel 
rejoined bennett mr rangel is a gas bag he has nothing to 
do with drug policy 
bennett said he purposely left mayor barry out of the planning 
when mapping an antidrug strategy for the district he had no hard 
evidence then that barry was using drugs said bennett but i 
suspected that his interest in the topic was different from mine 
barry issued a statement saying bennett has joined the parade 
of people who are using me as an excuse for our nations failure to 
deal adequately with the drug problem 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee praised bennett as an outstanding leader who proved 
a job which many thought undoable could be performed with 
impressive intellect and success 
bennett secretary of education in the reagan administration 
denied that his lack of cabinet status under bush impeded his 
effectiveness 
i spent more time with this president in 20 months than i 
spent with ronald reagan in three years three times as much 
he said 
bennett presided over dramatic growth in the federal antidrug 
budget from 63 billion in fiscal 1989 to 104 billion for 
fiscal 1991 
bennett plans to become a fellow at a conservative think tank 
the american enterprise institute and write books on both 
education and drugs 
he is also certain to resume the lucrative lecture circuit 
career that earned him 240000 in just 24 appearances during the 
four months between quitting reagans cabinet in 1988 and accepting 
bushs job offer 
he also received a 187000 advance on a contract for two books 
then 
ive had nine years in government i think thats enough for 
now said bennett who also served as chairman of the national 
endowment for the humanities in the early 1980s but to his 
critics he added i may be back 
bennett ruled out a return to academia in the past he has 
accused harvard and other universities of failing to impart moral 
values 
i am free of that world now he said does the soviet 
dissident wish to return as the head of the gulag

mayor david n dinkins announced 288 million in 
cutbacks thursday including a reduction of 5500 city jobs this 
fiscal year and perhaps 20000 next year through layoffs and 
attrition 
the cuts combined with the 100 million sale of a parking lot 
will make up a 388 million budget shortfall for the fiscal year 
that ends june 30 
today i have some bad news and some worse news dinkins 
told reporters 
the bad news he said requires painful sacrifices from every 
part of our administration including a 10 percent cut of mayoral 
staff 
the worse news was that on jan 15 hell be back with another 
proposal for the fiscal year beginning in july to close a budget 
gap that has grown to 16 billion 
already this year the mayor has closed a gap of 18 billion in 
the fiscal year that began in july through budget cuts ordered a 
hiring freeze and cut pay of top management by 5 percent including 
lopping 6500 off his own salary of 130000 
the city faces the cuts because of falling tax revenues the 
root of all these problems is the economy said budget director 
philip michael last month standard and poors a major bond 
rating service put the city on credit watch 
new york is not alone a plan to save philadelphia from 
bankruptcy is expected to be released friday 
under the proposal for this fiscal year new york citys board 
of education would be forced to cut 90 million health and human 
services agencies would be cut 519 million the uniformed 
services police and firefighters would be reduced by 606 
million and all others 855 million 
the city also increased its reserve fund for emergencies by 50 
million to 150 million this was done because of the possibility 
of possible economic worsening officials said 
the board of education faces 550 layoffs and 1000 people lost 
by attrition the board can make the cuts as it sees fit but the 
city suggested that teacher layoffs and attrition include 117 
teachers who teach teachers 357 noninstructional personnel and 
1072 positions that will not be filled as they become vacant 
notices to city workers wont go out until the spring 
the mayor said other cuts include wading pools in parks 
delaying recycling postponing hiring additional teachers and 
eliminating three fire companies and two fire salvage units 
hundreds of employees also will be lost from the citys housing 
rehabilitation program 
the city also must recoup anticipated losses seen in fiscal year 
1992 which begins in july the 20000 jobs that may be lost would 
come roughly half from attrition half from layoffs the budget 
director said 
these are projections that could have a great deal of range to 
them michael said quite frankly theres a lot of contingency 
that has to be played out 
as the mayor made his announcement about 800 members of local 
1180 of the communications workers of america demonstrated in city 
hall park then walked to wall street 
were getting more of the same crap job freezes layoffs 
wage freezes said local 1180s president arthur cheliotes who 
represents administrative personnel in the city 
leaders of municipal unions have broken off contract talks with 
the city because city has been unwilling to match a 55 percent pay 
raise teachers received oct 1 the city budgeted 15 percent 
increases for all unions and says that is all it is giving the 
teachers the rest comes from state aid and a rearrangement of the 
pension funding system

a security council committee on thursday 
approved un inspectors for jordans border with iraq to make sure 
trucks are not taking goods to iraq and occupied kuwait in 
violation of the un economic embargo 
suspicion that jordan is not enforcing the embargo focuses on 
highway traffic from jordans port of aqaba to baghdad iraqs 
capital 
deputy finnish ambassador marjatta rasi who presides over the 
security councils committee on sanctions against iraq said the 
committee asked un staff in jordan to begin spotchecking trucks 
at the border 
jordanian ambassador abdullah salah requested the observers last 
week to prove jordan is obeying the embargo 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
jordan became aware it will receive no special economic aid from 
the world community unless other countries are sure it is observing 
the embargo 
unless jordan completely obeys the embargo approved in 
resolution 661 on aug 6 it does not qualify for special relief 
aid the diplomats said 
jordan applied for help under the un charter which provides 
for countries burdened with special economic problems arising 
from the carrying out of sanctions or other security council 
actions 
ms rasi said she was sending a letter to secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar informing him of the committees decision 
a attiga resident coordinator of the un disaster relief 
organization based in amman will be in charge of the effort using 
his staff she said 
the sanctions committee decided not to send in outside observers 
to keep the cost down ms rasi said 
americans based in the us embassy in amman had been monitoring 
border traffic but were pulled back to the capital for their own 
safety us officials at the united nations said last week 
jean ripert the un chiefs special envoy said after 
returning from amman that jordans economy will collapse next year 
unless jordan gets help from other countries 
he said jordan will lose about 1 billion between aug 2 when 
iraq invaded kuwait and the end of this year because of the trade 
embargo on baghdad its major trading partner 
in terms of the proportion of jordans gross national product 
lost due to the embargo he said the picture is far worse 
for jordan in 1990 it is a figure around 30 percent for next 
year it could be something above 50 percent he said 
the question is will jordan be able to survive 
in other un developments thursday 
emerging democracies in eastern europe said they are ready to 
renounce a 15yearold resolution equating zionism with racism but 
israel and the united states dont want to press the point until 
they are sure of overwhelming support 
un envoys from czechoslovakia hungary poland and bulgaria 
among 72 un members who agreed in a nov 10 1975 vote that the 
founding ideology of israel was racist revealed a change of heart 
at a conference convened by american jewish leaders 
perez de cuellar reported to the security council that his 
latest efforts to end the cyprus stalement failed and a negative 
atmosphere has persisted but he said he would keep trying to 
bring greek and turkish cypriot sides together and appealed to them 
to cooperate to avoid aggravating the situation turkey invaded and 
occupied northern cyprus in 1974 to protect the turkish minority 
from what it called persecution and violence

a judge notified president francesco cossiga on 
thursday that he would be called to testify about a secret 
governmentorganized guerrilla group that was created in the 1950s 
it was the first time in italys postwar history that a 
president had been called as a witness in a case italian media 
reported 
italys no 2 party the opposition communists called for the 
resignation of premier giulio andreotti who has been under siege 
since admitting last month that the group existed 
politicians have speculated that the group ostensibly created 
to fight any soviet bloc invasion had trained its sights on 
domestic targets namely the communists there has been 
speculation the group was behind some rightwing terrorist attacks 
that plagued italy in the 1970s and 80s when the communists came 
to the brink of power 
andreotti told the senate that 622 italians belonged to the 
network codenamed operation gladio after the short doubleedged 
sword used by roman gladiators 
italians were recruited during the cold war on the basis of 
their patriotism and physical fitness he said members of the 
network were civilians apparently with military backgrounds 
the christian democratic premier said that the defense ministry 
knew about the group which was trained by the italian secret 
services 
no one can doubt that any distorted use of the structure would 
happen only outside the directives of the ministries he said 
thursday 
he added that a check by italian police had shown that none of 
the gladiators had had judicial records or other indications 
going against democratic security 
andreotti said that in 1959 france requested italy be allowed 
to join a special nato group that coordinated similar guerrilla 
groups in other member countries nato spokesmen have refused to 
comment on gladio 
the leader of the communist group in the senate ugo pecchioli 
demanded andreottis resignation 
this government has brought upon itself heavy responsibilities 
and it doesnt have the credit nor the capacity to deal with such a 
profound crisis pecchioli said 
his cry was not echoed by any of the five parties of the 
governing coalition who hold the majority in the senate they are 
andreottis christian democrats the socialists republicans 
liberals and social democrats 
we ask that this all be fully investigated so that there are 
no dark corners ambiguities uncertainties or unresolved 
mysteries said the socialist leader in the senate fabio fabbri 
the case has been taken up by venice investigating magistrate 
felice casson a specialist in terrorism casson discovered the 
existence of the gladio organization during a probe of a rightwing 
terrorist attack 
on thursday casson sent word to cossiga that he would be called 
to testify in the new case cossiga a former premier and interior 
minister recently revealed he had known of the gladio organization 
for years

a us campaign to gain support for un military action against 
iraq got a boost thursday with the soviet union offering its 
qualified approval president bush as expected ordered a new 
round of troop deployments adding up to 150000 soldiers to the 
multinational force facing off against iraq 
in another development iraqi strongman saddam hussein sacked 
his army chief suggesting dissension in the ranks over kuwait 
which his forces overran three months ago 
the deployment of as many as 150000 troops represents a 
substantial addition to the 230000 us military personnel in the 
region allies from 26 countries have sent 70000 soldiers to the 
multinational force assembled in the area 
if this movement of force is what convinces him saddam so 
much the better bush said in a nationwide broadcast from 
washington lets hope he comes to his senses 
defense secretary dick cheney giving details of the new 
buildup said it would include two armored divisions and small 
armored units from germany as well as the famed big red one 
first infantry division mechanized from fort riley kans 
pentagon officials in private conversations said full deployment 
of the units would total about 150000 troops 
said bush were talking about significant numbers of 
troops cheney who faced reporters after bush added we will 
not put an upper limit on this deployment 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
whether it will be adequate in the event of going to war with 
saddam husseins army im not going to speculate 
iraqs brutality aggression and violation of international 
law cannot be permitted to succeed bush said referring to the 
dismantling of kuwait by iraqs aug 2 invasion 
i find it hard to believe that today november 8 that he 
saddam does not understand that hes up against a determined 
unprecedented alliance 
when he surveys the force thats there he will recognize 
that he is up against just a foe that he cant possible manage 
militarily bush said 
former west german chancellor willy brandt meanwhile secured 
the release of 50 more westerners from iraq including germans 
italians dutch and britons the iraqi news agency reported it did 
not say when they would be freed iraq on wednesday promised to 
free more than 100 westerners 
hundreds of americans are among those still trapped some held 
at strategic sites to deter attack by the usled mutinational 
force in the region 
secretary of state james a baker iii met in moscow with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev baker wants moscow to agree to 
using force as a last resort to liberate kuwait 
later soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
military might should not be ruled out but cautioned it should be 
used only under un auspices 
a situation may emerge which effectively would require such a 
move shevardnadze said 
he played down any differences on iraq between the superpowers 
before baghdads invasion of kuwait moscow was baghdads principal 
ally and principal weapons supplier 
i would advise against looking for some difference in the 
positions between the soviet union and the united states 
shevardnadze told reporters 
bush said were on the same wavelength with gorbachev in 
terms of his policy goals in the middle east he said he felt there 
were no mixed signals from moscow 
the bush administration impatient that months of economic 
sanctions have failed to dislodge saddam from kuwait intends to 
ask the un security council to authorize force to liberate kuwait 
if iraq doesnt pull out 
baker is on a weeklong tour of middle eastern and european 
nations to gather support for such action he travels to paris and 
london before heading back to washington on saturday 
if such a measure were adopted it would be the first time the 
un authorized a joint military command during the korean war it 
authorized the united states to command the un forces repelling 
north koreas invasion 
the united states and its allies are facing about 430000 iraqi 
troops in kuwait and southern iraq 
there seemed to be indications thursday that cracks might be 
opening in iraqs stated determination to remain in kuwait 
iraqs army newspaper and us officials said saddam replaced 
his military chief of staff gen nizar alkhazraji with the head 
of his elite republican guards gen hussein rashid it did not say 
when or why khazraji was dismissed 
western analysts with knowledge of iraqs military machine said 
khazrajis surprise dismissal indicated growing opposition in some 
military quarters to saddams strategy on kuwait 
its very ominous said hansheino kopietz with control 
risks an international security firm in london 
its not wise to change horses in midstream at this point in 
time khazrajis dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to 
saddam within the military said kopietz just back from a middle 
east tour 
khazraji had been chief of staff since 1985 and was one of the 
top officers in saddams inner circle of military advisers 
he was sacked amid increasingly tough us and british warnings 
that they might use force to dislodge iraq from kuwait if 
necessary 
saddam regularly purges those he perceives as a threat it was 
the second replacement of a highlevel iraqi official in two weeks 
oil minister issam chalabi was fired oct 28 and replaced by brig 
gen hussein kamel saddams cousin and soninlaw 
some analysts said rashids appointment was in part designed to 
keep the republican guards on saddams side the guards are 
considered saddams best troops among his millionman forces 
in amman jordan 11 british women arrived thursday en route to 
baghdad to seek the release of their husbands and relatives held 
hostage after iraqs invasion of kuwait they were expected to 
leave friday for iraq 
and in warsaw poland 241 poles returned from iraq on thursday 
and one told polish tv at the airport that about 40 americans being 
held at a chemical plant were in tragic condition 
iraq offered to allow relatives of foreigners banned from 
leaving to spend christmas with loved ones the british and us 
governments discouraged relatives from accepting the invitation 
the women hope to negotiate directly with saddam and ask him to 
release the men on humanitarian grounds

texas education officials gave preliminary 
approval thursday to science textbooks that teach evolution but a 
longtime clash with creationists continued 
the state board of education asked its staff to look into 
whether a reference in some of the books which says human embryos 
have gill slits was accurate 
the board meeting as a committee tentatively approved the 
biology books striking a blow to religious fundamentalists who say 
the texts dont treat creationism as an equally valid idea 
a final vote was set for saturday 
texas is one of the nations largest textbook buying states and 
influences what publishers put in textbooks the textbooks under 
consideration are for grades 1 through 12 
this is a major victory said mike hudson general counsel 
for the people for the american way a civil rights group that has 
lobbied for expanded coverage of evolution in science textbooks 
this is probably the most important thing that has happened in 
science education in the past five years hudson said of the 
boards preliminary vote 
mel gabler who with his wife norma has fought against 
evolution for about 30 years said the proposed texts were a form 
of censorship gabler argued they treat evolution as a fact without 
including debate of the theory 
why are evolutionists so afraid of giving students weaknesses 
as well as strengths of evolution gabler asked censorship 
nullifies critical thinking of students this is indoctrination 
not education he said 
the theory of evolution holds that all species of plants and 
animals developed from earlier forms through hereditary 
transmission of slight variations in successive generations 
creationism ascribes the origin of species to acts of god as 
described in the bible 
education board member will davis of austin said the books 
separate religious theory from scientific theory 
in public school textbooks we are not to engage in religious 
theory thats for churches thats for your own soulsearching in 
public schools we deal with science not religion he said 
davis said the current science textbooks give a cursory review 
of evolution while the new books are much more in depth 
each side presented its own scientists to testify 
claud bramblett a university of texas scientist said the 
textbooks were wellwritten and would probably interest more 
students in science 
we need to grow future scientists not import them he said 
walter bradley a texas aampm university scientist said the books 
contained errors and were written in a way that students would just 
accept the teachings as fact 
education board chairman monte hasie of lubbock said the books 
werent perfect but better than the current ones 
i think were making progress and thats what education is all 
about he said

one of the nations most successful 
personalinjury attorneys and two other lawyers reaped millions of 
dollars by manufacturing evidence bribing witnesses and creating 
phony cases a prosecutor said thursday 
these defendants decided that winning personalinjury lawsuits 
was the most important thing the only thing and they were willing 
to do whatever it took to win assistant us attorney jerome c 
roth told jurors opening a complicated trial that is expected to 
last several months 
morris j eisen two of his top lawyers and several aides and 
investigators at eisens manhattan law firm are accused of a 
wideranging scheme of racketeering mail fraud falsification of 
evidence and bribery of witnesses law enforcers and court workers 
dating back nearly a decade 
james la rossa eisens lawyer argued his client was the object 
of a vendetta orchestrated by insurance companies and city and 
state governments who have had to pay millions of dollars in awards 
to injured people represented by eisens firm 
youre going to hear a lot of things that are going to 
disappoint you as americans la rossa told the jury 
he defended eisen and other personalinjury lawyers who work on 
a contingency fee basis and are paid only when they win or settle 
lawsuits la rossa said such lawyers are defenders of poor and 
disadvantaged people who would not be able to otherwise afford 
attorneys 
eisen and the other two lawyers joseph p napoli and harold m 
fishman are on trial before us district judge charles p sifton 
also on trial are several private investigators and the firms 
former office manager 
the defendants are accused of violating the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico and other 
crimes if convicted they face up to 20 years in prison and fines 
of as much as double the proceeds of their alleged criminal 
activity prosecutors said 
an investigation involving 19 personalinjury lawsuits seven 
of them against the city began in 1985 awards in those lawsuits 
amounted to as much as 9 million and the firms contingency fees 
were about onethird of that amount prosecutors said 
the victims of the alleged frauds which date to at least 1981 
included city and state governments the transit authority private 
corporations individuals and insurance companies roth said 
he said the defendants manufactured evidence such as digging 
potholes where there were none paid people to falsely say they had 
witnessed accidents paid eyewitnesses to lie or not to testify and 
fabricated accidents when none occurred 
the defendants were limited only by their own imagination 
roth said 
la rossa told jurors the real wrongdoers were the liars and con 
artists the government had granted immunity and would present as 
credible witnesses 
those witnesses made a deal to testify for the prosecution he 
said

a man was convicted thursday of sexually 
assaulting a woman who doctors say has 46 personalities after he 
testified she consented to sex and he learned only later she was 
mentally ill 
i still dont think she is mentally ill the defendant mark 
a peterson said after the verdict was announced whats there 
to be sorry about why should i be sorry for her 
peterson was convicted of seconddegree sexual assault and could 
be sentenced to 10 years in prison he remained free on 5000 
bond sentencing was scheduled for dec 10 and he said he will 
appeal 
jurors heard psychiatrists disagree over the 27yearold womans 
contention that she was unaware one of her personalities 
described as a funloving 20yearold woman was having sex she 
said she learned of it from another personality a girl the age of 
6 
earlier thursday peterson contradicted testimony by the woman 
and others that he was warned she suffered from multiple 
personality disorder 
he said when he later learned the woman was ill he telephoned 
to apologize but she hung up after warning im going to 
prosecute you you bastard 
the woman testified wednesday that peterson 29 manipulated the 
personality that was prevalent at the time to force her to have 
intercourse 
she blinked her eyes and bowed her head as she summoned six 
different personalities to the witness stand four of them were 
sworn in individually 
darold treffert a psychiatrist who testified for the defense 
said he feels she comprehended her conduct treffert said the 
womans various characters were encouraged by her therapists who 
believe in multiple personality disorder which he called the ufo 
of psychiatry 
peterson testified she excited me she was pretty i 
asked her if i could love her she said yes 
under wisconsin law it is a crime to have sex with people known 
to suffer from a mental illness that makes them incapable of 
understanding their conduct 
district attorney joe paulus argued that the woman is mentally 
ill and peterson knew it when he had sex with her in the front seat 
of his car june 11 at an oshkosh park 
the defendant wanted to keep one of the womans personalities 
jennifer as his mistress the prosecutor said during closing 
arguments 
peterson whos married treated the victim like a piece of 
meat at his disposal to play games with paulus said jennifer 
is his little secret she is the person he can call on to have sex 
she is the mental illness he can manipulate 
defense lawyer ed salzsieder argued that the evidence showed 
peterson a former grocery store bagger was guilty of nothing more 
than bad judgment and promiscuity but he did not manipulate a 
mentally ill woman 
peterson is no rocket scientist salzsieder said 
the jury was asked to decide three issues whether the woman was 
mentally ill whether the illness made her incapable of appraising 
her conduct and whether peterson knew of the illness 
psychiatrists diagnosed the woman who earned an associate 
degree from college as having multiple personality disorder last 
february a diagnosis that has only been recognized within the last 
decade 
the disorder is often triggered by childhood abuse that forces 
the victim to create separate personalities to avoid confronting 
reality about 7000 americans suffer from the illness 
peterson testified he asked the woman out for coffee eventually 
drove her to a park and had sex with her 
the woman told him about people she called john jamie and 
jennifer but peterson said he thought she was referring to 
brothers and sisters at first he became suspicious that the woman 
might have a mental illness when they returned to her home after 
leaving the park he said 
peterson said he first heard the term multiple personality 
disorder mentioned when he returned to the womans home and 
witnessed the woman switch personalities for the first time 
i was very surprised yes i never seen that before never 
heard of it happening before he told the court 
peterson said a statement he gave police indicating he was aware 
of the womans different personalities before he had sex was wrong 
he signed the statement because he was tired he said 
jury foreman david ward said the statement was a key to the 
conviction

prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservatives finished third in a special parliamentary election 
thursday in this northern town in a sound thrashing for her 
troubled government 
in another vote in the northwest england dockland town of 
bootle the opposition labor party got 22052 votes compared with 
2587 for the conservatives and 2216 for the liberal democrats 
in bradford north tory candidate joy atkin came in third with 
only 6048 votes or 16 percent a 23 percent decline for the 
conservatives since the last general election in 1987 labor 
candidate terry rooney won 18619 votes or 52 percent liberal 
democrat david ward took 9105 votes for 25 percent the rest went 
to fringe parties 
bootle has long been a solid area for labor but the 
conservatives were viewed as having a chance to win in north 
bradford their poor showing reflected the crisis in the 
conservative party since mrs thatchers deputy sir geoffrey howe 
quit last week 
clearly a disappointing result conservative party chairman 
kenneth baker said of the results in the 67340voter district of 
bradford north i think out there were not very popular at the 
moment 
the elections were caused by the deaths of the previous 
legislators in the two districts 
the poor tory showing in bradford north prompted renewed 
speculation that an attempt will be made to oust mrs thatcher as 
conservative leader and prime minister at the partys annual 
leadership election this month 
the pressures and feeling there should be a leadership contest 
will build up said rankandfile legislator tony marlow i 
think there will be a new prime minister before christmas she 
became prime minister in 1979 
britains fledgling islamic party finished a poor fourth in its 
first run for office in bradford north getting 800 votes the 
former textile town has 7000 moslem voters reflecting the large 
numbers of pakistani immigrants who came to work in mills in the 
1950s and 60s 
in both bradford north and bootle the voter turnout was low 53 
percent in bradford north and 39 percent in bootle 
in resigning howe complained about mrs thatchers combative 
style but said thursday he had also resigned over issues of 
substance he was frustrated over mrs thatchers resistance to 
a closer union of the european community 
controversy over a new local government tax imposed last spring 
dominated the bradford campaign but the sight of mrs thatcher in 
trouble nationally added to the tories difficulties 
in national opinion polls the conservatives are trailing 
between 12 and 20 points behind labor 
the results scarcely dented dent mrs thatchers huge majority 
down from 100 to 98 in the 650member house of commons 
the conservatives have 373 seats labor 227 and the liberal 
democrats 20 two seats are vacant and the remainder are held by 
minority regional parties

eleven british women arrived thursday en 
route to baghdad to seek the release of their husbands and 
relatives held hostage after iraqs invasion of kuwait they were 
expected to leave friday for iraq 
in warsaw poland 241 poles returned from iraq on thursday and 
one told polish tv at the airport that the conditions in which 
about 40 americans were being held at a chemical plant were 
tragic 
the group of women who flew into amman on thursday includes 
wives girlfriends one fincee and the mothers of two hostages 
the british foreign office advised the women against going and 
called the trip risky but they ignored the advice and paid 
for the trip themselves 
our main objective is to seek the freedom of our husbands 
said dorothy goodwin 55 whose husband peter was a pilot with 
kuwaiti airways 
sunni jennings said my husband encouraged me to come now 
rather than christmas because the sooner i come the better 
she said she hoped to return home before christmas with her 
husband michael who worked as an engineer for a kuwaiti company 
before the aug 2 invasion 
iraq offered to allow relatives of foreigners banned from 
leaving to spend christmas with loved ones the british and us 
governments discouraged relatives from accepting the invitation 
the women hope to negotiate directly with iraqi president saddam 
hussein and ask him to release the men on humanitarian grounds 
iraqi authorities granted them onemonth visas and promised to 
assist them but no meetings with saddam were promised 
before leaving london carol cox 31 said this is not a 
joyous occasion but we are certainly going out there as a 
solid group with the same aim to get our husbands and relatives 
home 
her husband john was a sales manager for a shipping company in 
kuwait and is now believed held at a strategic site in iraq 
at least 600 foreigners mainly americans britons germans and 
japanese are held as human shields at potential military targets 
in iraq and kuwait thousands of others are banned from leaving 
but have not been relocated 
speaking to reporters at londons heathrow airport the women 
urged britain the united states and the allies to exercise 
restraint in dealing with iraq 
we are not politicians or diplomats we are just ordinary 
people mrs goodwin said we are hoping for a peaceful 
solution to the crisis rather than a military one 
the returning pole in warsaw not identified said that at the 
iraqi chemical plant where he was working i suspect it produces 
military gas were 40 american citizens shut up in the 
production hall 
it is tragic to be frank 
he said poles were being treated in a friendly way but a 
companion said many were having trouble getting the exit permits 
needed to leave iraq 
reports on how many of poles remained ranged from about 200 to 
more than 700 
in london british foreign secretary douglas hurd personally 
appealed to tony benn of the opposition labor party on thursday to 
call off a trip to baghad benn says he will see saddam in hopes of 
preventing war 
hurd told the house of commons if he goes he is joining in a 
game where the aggressor dictates the rules and selected human 
beings are the pawns 
benn is a former energy secretary and a leftist often in 
conflict with moderates in his own party 
labors foreign affairs spokesman gerald kaufman said benn 
represents himself and not his party

hoping to keep cigarettes from children the 
city council voted thursday to ban vending machines that offer the 
smokes in most public places 
taverns would be exempt from the ban which needs the signature 
of mayor david dinkins a former twopackaday smoker to become 
law 
the ban would eliminate cigarette machines from virtually all 
places they are typically found like restaurants theaters and 
bowling alleys 
councilman sal albanese said the move makes new york the first 
major city in the country to ban cigarette vending machines salt 
lake city and minneapolis have enacted similar bans 
the primary purpose of the ban is to prevent the children from 
easy access to cigarettes said councilman joseph lisa chairman 
of the councils health committee and a leading sponsor of the 
measure 
last month the music cigarette amp amusement association inc 
representing over 150 small businesses in the vending machine 
industry told the council the ban would cost 2000 unskilled and 
semiskilled workers their jobs 
brennan dawson a spokeswoman for the washingtonbased tobacco 
institute said the ban would only punish and inconvenience adults 
who are looking to purchase a legal product 
the tobacco industry agrees with the goal of keeping 
cigarettes out of the hands of kids but it is a misguided notion 
to think that by banning cigarette vending machines thats what 
youre going to accomplish she said 
the council voted 331 for the ban the lone dissenter was 
councilman jerome odonovan who said common sense should prevail 
since youngsters know smoking is dangerous and warned the ban 
would be hard to enforce 
taverns and bars in hotels or motels would be able to keep 
cigarette vending machines as long as they are placed where 
employees can prevent underage buyers from using them state law 
bans the sale of cigarettes to those under age 18 
violations of the ban which would take effect jan 31 1992 
would result in maximum fines ranging from 300 for the first 
offense to 1000 for the third a third or subsequent violation 
also would result in suspension of a violators cigarette licenses 
for up to one year 
les zuke a spokesman for cigarette manufacturer philip morris 
inc called the ban unnecessary and an overreaction 
vending machines account for only 3 percent of national 
cigarette sales so the ban would have little effect on cigarette 
makers he said adding it would only hurt the vendingmachine 
industry 
councilman stephen dibrienza said people should realize 
cigarettes are no different from bullets they kill

a montana mans rape conviction and 90year 
prison sentence were reversed thursday by an appeals court that 
ruled spectators wearing large women against rape buttons hurt 
his chances for a fair trial 
the buttons worn by three women during the trial of robert lee 
norris conveyed an implied message encouraging the jury to find 
norris guilty said a threejudge panel of the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals 
the buttons posed a serious and imminent threat to norris 
right to a fair trial the court said 
assistant attorney general paul johnson said thursday the state 
has not decided whether to appeal 
norris who remains in prison acted as his own lawyer in 
appealing the conviction he was convicted of the january 1983 
kidnapping and rape of a 15yearold girl he allegedly lured to his 
billings home with a false advertisement for a babysitter 
about 15 members of the billings rape task force and the 
national organization for women appeared at johnsons arraignment 
wearing 2inchwide women against rape buttons that had been 
designed for the case and three women wore them at the trial the 
court said 
judge charles luedke had denied a defense request to prohibit 
the buttons during the trial saying the women were exercising

a university of utah scientist who claims 
to have discovered a cold fusion energy process said thursday he 
sterile furor over his whereabouts last month was unfortunate 
and unnecessary 
b stanley pons ducked reporters wednesday his first appearance 
in utah in weeks he issued a statement to reporters the next day 
when he met with an advisory council evaluating his work and 
related research 
pons and colleague martin fleischmann caused a stir when they 
missed a council meeting two weeks ago and left utah apparently 
without making their destinations known to officials of the 
university or the universitys national cold fusion institute 
fleischmann returned to his home in tisbury england for 
medical treatment and did not return for the review said fritz 
will director of the statefunded institute 
obviously the fact that we did not publish our itinerary 
seems to have caused considerable distress to some people which is 
regrettable pons said in a news release 
pons called the commotion over his disappearance a sterile 
furor and said he spent the time traveling 
he met with the fusion energy advisory council council chairman 
raymond hixson said pons has made research advances that are the 
basis of a ninth patent application on cold fusion 
the episode cast yet another shadow over the research that was 
unveiled on march 23 1989 when the two announced at a news 
conference they had achieved a sustained nuclear fusion reaction in 
a simple tabletop experiment that produced more energy in the form 
of heat that was used to run it 
fusion long has been sought as a potential source of cheap and 
virtually inexhaustible energy 
but few scientists have been able to duplicate their work and 
many remain skeptical 
researchers around the world have spent billions of dollars 
trying to reach that same energy surplus from hot fusion the 
process that powers the sun and stars by combining or fusing two 
hydrogen atoms into a heavier helium atom 
attorneys for the state which appropriated 5 million for the 
research last year have filed for eight patents relating to cold 
fusion which the scientists believe may someday be used as an 
energy source the council oversees the funding 
pons and fleischmann contend they were not told to attend an 
advisory council meeting they were criticized for missing two weeks 
ago 
pons would not answer reporters questions thursday 
people who want to contact us do not seem to have any 
problem he said in the statement contradicting university 
officials and others who said he was unreachable except through 
his attorney 
in the news release pons said he and fleischmann had applied 
for a new patent on very important research 
we have also written two new papers describing this work 
which we expect to submit as soon as their release does not negate 
granting of patent protection pons said

california smog squads will begin 
random roadside testing next spring of diesel smoke from heavy 
trucks and buses under a program adopted thursday by the state air 
resources board 
the program approved 71 will apply to all such vehicles in 
the state regardless of where they are registered 
it asks truck and bus operators to do more than what owners of 
gasolinepowered cars have done since 1984 through the smog check 
program said the boards executive officer jim boyd 
the program requires the testing and repairing if necessary 
of gasolinepowered passenger cars every two years 
the state already has two programs to control diesel emissions 
but originated the new one because of new medical findings 
the board said the research on sootlike particles in diesel 
smoke shows that some of them are small enough to get through the 
bodys natural filtering system and cause tissue damage deep in the 
lung the particles also can carry potentially cancercausing 
compounds including dioxin and benzene 
moreover diesel emissions are the single largest source of 
public complaints that the board receives about pollution boyd 
said 
he said 10000 complaints a month are received under a southern 
california program in which the california highway patrol seeks to 
issue tickets to smoking trucks reported by the public 
california trucking association spokesman gregory degiere said 
we generally support the program and we believe it can be made to 
work and we hope that during the oneyear test period it will be 
made to work 
he said his association represents 2500 owners of the trucks 
that carry about 80 percent of all trucked cargo in california 
an opacity test is to be made while the engine is revving at 
full throttle as in rapid acceleration vehicles with peak smoke 
density above 55 percent nearly equal to their emissions when new 
will be cited owners will have 45 days to lower the emissions 
firsttime violators will be subject to a 300 fee for a second 
violation within a year the fines are as high as 1800 
the roving smog squads 12 in all will consist of air resources 
board and california highway patrol employees they will 
concentrate on weigh stations and other places where the vehicles 
are standing still anyway they expect to test about 38000 
vehicles a year 
while they concentrate on the estimated 250000 diesel trucks 
and buses driven in california they will also be looking for 
chances to inspect the estimated 200000 large gasolinepowered 
vehicles like motor homes and delivery trucks to prevent 
tampering with antismog systems 
the boards research shows that the greatest causes of diesel 
soot are tampering to increase acceleration and neglecting 
maintenance 
a pilot program showed that the average repair cost to lower 
emissions was 500 
californias new program is only the sixth of its kind in the 
nation 
state officials said it will target the dirtiest onethird of 
the trucks and buses that produce up to 70 percent of the 85 tons a 
day of particulates emitted in the state overall emissions from 
the entire fleet should drop by 17 percent and as much as 
twothirds from individual vehicles

norwegian scientists are exploring the 
possibility of a yearround route through the frozen ocean north of 
siberia that could change the way the world does business 
unlike their viking ancestors who braved unknown seas in wooden 
ships these modern adventurers search from laboratories with 
computers and calculators 
oslos fridtjof nansen institute named for the norwegian 
explorer was enlisted by the soviet merchant marine ministry to 
explore the feasibility of opening the northeast passage all year 
the soviets envision huge icebreakers leading merchant ships 
through the polar icepack like outsize ducklings trailing their 
mother 
willy oestreng director of the institute said the 4000mile 
passage north of the soviet union is the shortest route between 
europe and the far east about half the distance through the suez 
or panama canals 
it could revolutionize world shipping he said the study 
began formally at the end of october after two years of 
discussion 
adolf erik nordenskiold a finnishswedish explorer and 
scientist first negotiated the icecongested passage between 
northern norway and alaska in a daring twoyear steamship voyage 
that ended in 1879 
a combination of ice ridges 42 feet thick bitter cold 
fourmonth winter nights and soviet strategic concerns have 
prevented the shortcut often called the northern sea route from 
becoming an important factor in world trade 
oestreng said changes in the soviet union and the raw power of 
modern icebreakers had helped overcome the obstacles 
he said the soviets believe their icebreakers which now clear 
the passage from july to october for the soviet coastal trade 
might be able to open it all year 
soviet officials hope the route will generate hard currency from 
fees paid to use the passage and hire soviet ships and stimulate 
the economy of isolated siberia and the arctic coast oestreng 
said 
norwegian and outside experts will study the technological 
challenges costs legal and political questions and the 
environmental impact of keeping the passage open oestreng said he 
added that the eightmonth pilot project would define the state 
of the art of arctic navigation 
the main questions are commerciality and the environment he 
said and further research will be required if the pilot project is 
encouraging but if everything fell into place it could be open 
in a decade 
his institute which has specialists in polar research raised 
200000 for the study from various norwegian sources 
the soviets had nothing to pay with and norway as a 
traditional shipping nation has to get in on this oestreng 
explained 
scientists and environmentalists are concerned about the threat 
of oil spills or nuclear accidents 
we would be opposed to using nuclear icebreakers to keep the 
passage open said steve shallhorn a greenpeace activist from 
canada who toured a soviet icebreaker base in the arctic on sept 
24 
shuttle traffic of nuclear icebreakers or oilladen tankers 
could threaten the arctics fragile ecology shallhorn said 
environmental concerns arising from the exxon valdez oil spill 
in alaska may make the northeast passage commercially viable 111 
years after it was discovered 
some oil tankers are being ordered with double hulls a feature 
intended to prevent oil spills and that would go far toward the 
requirements of arctic conditions said arnfinn jorgensendahl of 
the nansen institute 
he said the thickhulled ships needed to endure the ice of the 
northeast passage once were deemed too expensive but now 
concern for the environment may be about to even out prices between 
vessels built for arctic and nonarctic waters 
oestreng emphasized that the arctic is a harsh place and 
cautioned the overly optimistic wed better not sell the skin 
before the bears been shot

poverty and violence are much more 
pressing issues in latin america than the environment but 16 years 
of quiet steady work to save wetlands is showing results 
ducks unlimited a nonprofit group associated with similar 
groups in the united states canada and new zealand is dedicated 
to preserving the natural habitat of more than 50 species of 
migratory waterfowl 
it is particularly active in mexico which ranks third among the 
worlds nations in the diversity of bird and animal life 
conservation is a luxury in a country like ours but at the 
same time it is very much a necessity said eric gustafson vice 
president of ducks unlimited which is based in monterrey the 
lowly swamps that in the past have been drained have proven to be 
the seedbed of all life 
for the poor wildlife is a source of food but this wildlife 
must be cared for because many species endemic to mexico are being 
threatened with extinction we need to teach them to consume the 
ones that are abundant and conserve others 
his organization has completed 90 projects in mexico and two in 
honduras and has trained national park employees from argentina 
chile colombia costa rica equador el salvador guatemala 
panama uruguay peru and venezuela 
it has investigation centers in nuevo leon and coahuila states 
in northern mexico and in the southern state of yucatan 
gustafson said mexico is ripe for environmental activism because 
of its varied topography ranging from tropical rain forests and 
deserts to mountains and thousands of miles of beaches 
he added that there is lots of land still untouched by man 
ducks unlimited has focused on reforestation rehabilitation of 
wetlands and adding shoreline by building dams pools lagoons and 
islands with nesting boxes and vegetation gustafson said it had 
developed more than 860000 acres of wetlands 
other animals like deer jaguar and doves also benefit 
because they drink the water he said 
habitat for ducks geese and cranes is disappearing and several 
species are threatened because of pollution expanded oil 
exploration and agriculture he said and described the goal of his 
group to an interviewer 
you can conserve a species in a zoo what we want to do is 
conserve them in the habitat where wildlife lives and breeds in its 
natural state that includes providing water food cover and 
space 
ducks unlimited works with landowners operators of staterun 
farms educational institutions and the government to help spread 
community awareness 
he said farmers are asked to leave rows of natural vegetation 
when they clear land so wildlife has somewhere to feed the 
organization also tries to persuade hunters not to exceed daily 
limits 
water contamination has become a major problem because of 
industrial pollution pesticides herbicides and fertilizers 
gustafson said his group is working with government agencies on 
legislation to fight water pollution especially in the 
droughtprone north 
techniques developed by the national aeronautics and space 
administration in the united states make it possible to grow plants 
that cleanse polluted water by feeding on contaminants and 
expelling chlorophyll 
we dont pretend to make it potable gustafson said but 
wildlife can certainly live off it 
waterfowl from north dakota south dakota minnesota montana 
and alaska and the western canadian provinces of manitoba alberta 
and saskatchewan winter in mexico he said 
in september october and november the birds head south along 
the pacific central mississippi and atlantic flyways 
mexico has 1051 native species of birds 447 species of 
mammals 685 of reptiles and 284 of amphibians making it third in 
biological diversity after brazil and colombia of the total 342 
are considered endangered gustafson said 
ducks unlimited has 12000 members and a staff of 35 its annual 
budget of 15 million is raised through donations art auctions 
banquets and membership drives 
the organization now is appealing for new members to help with 
project 2000 a 10year plan to rehabilitate 28 wetland areas where 
about 83 percent of mexicos waterfowl live 
wildlife and habitat are intimately related to man 
gustafson said 
they are a food source and oxygen source without habitat 
there would be no wildlife i dont see how human life would 
survive

what ho jeeves and wooster a sublime 
droll understated british comedy of manners adapted from the 
classic tales of pg wodehouse opens on sunday for a fiveweek 
run on pbs masterpiece theater 
jeeves the ingenious and unflappable manservant and bertie 
wooster his adorable vacuous upperclass twit of a master were 
introduced to readers in a 1915 saturday evening post story titled 
extricating young gussie 
by 1975 when wodehouse pronounced woodhouse died at his home 
on long island jeeves and bertie had figured in 15 novels and 
scads of stories set in the mythical london and great british 
country houses of the 20s and 30s 
it was there that bertie amid grinding affluence and elegant 
furnishings art deco is a trifle too modern for our wooster 
divided his time between his club the drones and loafing about 
mayfair getting into scrapes 
berties a frightfully decent chap and fancies himself a master 
schemer and solver of lifes small problems but his machinations 
always go awry requiring the intervention of jeeves indeed 
sir to get him out of trouble 
broken engagements pranks gone wrong and the loss of a 
treasured cook are as dire as wodehouse gets its berties aunts 
screaming to each other like mastodons across a great primeval 
swamp that mar his existence 
it is his dreadnought aunt agatha who figures prominently in the 
opening episode of clive extons knowing adaptation 
bertie somewhat the worse for drink at break of day stumbles 
into his stylish yet disheveled bachelor flat and collapses onto 
his bed a persistent ringing at the door bertie stumbles to open 
it 
a tallish chap in black morning coat and striped trousers is 
outside he utters the immortal words i was sent by the agency 
sir i was given to understand you need a valet my name is 
jeeves 
within moments jeeves has set the flat to rights and revived 
the flagging wooster with a healing draught jeevess remarkable 
restorative within him bertie instantly engages jeeves services 
ah but like a specter of doom or lingering hangover aunt 
agatha mary wimbush summons the doomed innocent to luncheon and 
the dreadful news that it is time that bertie marry and that the 
statuesque honoria glossop is the girl 
bertie filled with dread shuttles down to sir roderick and 
lady glossops country home to consummate a done deal there he 
meets his old chum bingo little michael siberry who 
announces an undying love for the fair honoria 
bertie sees a way out and confects an implausible scheme which 
goes hilariously wrong jeeves extracts him from the dire 
consequences of his lamebrained scheme that essentially is the 
pattern of their adventures 
slight stuff you say perhaps but where else but in wodehouse 
could we meet such characters as tuppy glossop oofy prosser 
gussie finknottle hildegard wattwatson and the rev beefy 
bellinger 
and where else could would we fine wodehouses remarkable 
dialogue it is irreproducible here but exton director robert

this may be a very different recession from 
those in the past according to reports from around the country 
past recessions often began when overly eager producers turned 
out more goods than the economy could absorb leading to inventory 
buildups and then to slower production and layoffs in order to 
shrink those inventories 
this one says albert sindlinger an economic researcher began 
with the consumers pocketbook rather than production inventories 
people all over the country are telling him my expenses are 
rising that he said is the universal complaint people are 
saying their medical costs insurance costs their taxes are too 
much 
at the same time he said their assets probably are falling in 
value some housing prices have shrunk stock values too and as 
their assets decline ad costs rise their incomes arent 
adequate he said 
atop these problems is the loss of jobs government figures show 
580000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing since january 1989 
initial claims for jobless insurance rose to 454000 in the week 
ended oct 20 the highest level since the last recession while 
costs rise ability to pay falls 
the voting results confirm the taxpayers predicament and their 
outrage said sindlinger who has been analyzing consumer attitudes 
for half a century the latest 30 years of that time in a formal 
scientific manner 
based in wallingford pa the staff of sindlinger amp co has 
detailed talks with more than 800 heads of households every week 
52 weeks a year asking them probing questions relating to their 
financial condition 
those results are then processed at the companys computer 
facility and analyzed by the octogenarian himself and then sent by 
highspeed mail or facsimile to corporate governmental and 
academic clients 
looking at last weeks results he commented that the economy 
keeps getting worse by his calculations there are 38 states in 
recession and the rest are borderline the recession is already in 
its 10th month he says 
the commerce department disagrees its latest quarterly report 
for the third quarter of the year showed economic activity growing 
at an unexpectedly strong 18 percent annual rate 
sindlinger scoffs at the estimate and so do many academic and 
business economists some such as sindlinger believe the figures 
are manipulated some believe government methodology is faulty 
some say almostcertain revisions will lower the expansion rate 
based on discussions with household heads sindlinger believes 
the latest tax increase enraged the american public atop all 
their problems it was the very thing they didnt need and he 
said they perceive it as unjust 
he said president bush is receiving much of the blame 
on sept 17 the presidents positive rating as sindlinger 
measured it was 826 percent which he says translates into 
approval by 129 million americans by oct 29 it was down to 481 
percent or 753 million 
blame it on the tax increase said sindlinger while you cant 
pin the entire blame for recession on taxes he said you can say 
the tax increase will make the recession much deeper than it would 
have been 
it was suicidal he said politically and economically

sir norbert smith is perhaps the most illustrious british actor 
who never existed fans of british comedy at its nuttiest will love 
the tribute sir norbert smith a life broadcast friday on 
public televisions great performances 
its an affectionate sendup says 29yearold harry 
enfield who dons a flowing white beard and genially bled 
manner to play the distinguished octogenarian 
the script by enfield and geoffrey perkins traces sir norberts 
life from childhood his father was a man his mother a woman 
we are told through excerpts from films such as the gentle 
rover returns home and the angry carry on banging about 
nuclear disarmament 
no movie genre escapes unscathed from the dopiest of film 
biographies to britains grim workingclass films of the 1960s 
will americans find it funny 
it depends on how many british films theyve seen enfield 
said in an interview 
sir norbert is seen being questioned by melvyn bragg the 
television personality who conducted a celebrated interview with 
laurence olivier in 1985 
but enfield said sir norbert is meant less as a specific olivier 
parody than as a synthesis of british greats aficionados will spot 
references to sir john gielgud peter otoole and donald sinden 
among many others 
the actors not sent up in the sir norbert character get their 
comeuppance from fictitious colleagues such as will silly and sir 
donald stuffy 
i put in every british actor that ive ever met said 
enfield who worked six years off and on on the script and 
found periodic unemployment a great help 
i used to watch a lot of afternoon tv he said i started 
imitating the movies then 
sir norbert smith a life marked a change of pace for the 
performer who studied politics at york university before making 
his theater debut at the edinburgh festival fringe in scotland in 
1982 
it was the first time id had to do comedy acting rather than 
overacting he said of sir norbert its part of the difference 
between robin williams on stage and robin williams in dead poets 
society 
in 1986 his career was launched playing loadsamoney an 
avaricious workingclass yuppie on friday night live a weekly 
comedy series 
the character touched such a nerve with the british that the 
word was later cited in parliamentary debates about prime minister 
margaret thatchers loadsamoney economy 
enfield later created the character of stavros a greek kebab 
salesman with opinions on everything 
in contrast to loadsamoney described by enfield as a loud 
git sir norbert demanded a more subdued concentrated style of 
acting with a chameleonic ability to switch from the aging 
thespian to his younger cinematic selves 
a new series harry enfields television program began this 
month on the bbc enfield takes on 15 roles ranging from a 
13yearold with a speech problem to a pair of married slobs wayne 
and waynetta 
the son of a local government officer from east sussex south of 
london enfield seems moderately surprised by the direction his 
life has taken but he views it with a loadsamoney kind of 
pragmatism 
its something i fell into he said ill stop doing it 
when they stop paying me

andras hegedues was 32 a peasants son 
and committed communist when he went to warsaw as premier of 
hungary in may 1955 to help found an alliance he believed could 
ensure peace in europe 
thirtyfive years later after much reflection and a personal 
rebellion that got him expelled from the communist party hegedues 
has very different ideas about peace and the warsaw pacts ability 
to guarantee it 
the sovietled military alliance created on may 14 1955 is 
fading into history helped by a vigorous push from his own 
country hegedues is the only living signer of the treaty 
hungary revolted in 1956 and soviet tanks rushed in hegedues 
and other communist faithful were evacuated to moscow during the 
bloody fighting that followed and he began to reconsider his 
beliefs 
he criticized the next use of warsaw pact tanks against a 
member when a sovietled invasion crushed the prague spring of 
1968 
hegedues eventually was expelled from the communist party and 
forced to retire into writing and study in 1979 he helped found 
the european nuclear disarament group 
these days he worries about how to keep history from repeating 
itself 
the warsaw pact is now actually a piece of fiction he said 
in an interview the military command no longer has an army at 
its disposal its a group of generals without soldiers 
on nov 3 officials of the six warsaw pact members met in 
budapest to divide up what conventional weapons they may keep under 
an eastwest agreement to be signed monday in paris 
it may be their last major decision hungary and czechoslovakia 
want the alliance to finish its military business in 1991 and 
other members appear to agree 
in the last year communist regimes have fallen throughout the 
former soviet bloc east germany has ceased to exist and the 
united germany so feared in moscow and other eastern capitals is a 
fact once again 
as a communist in world war ii hegedues lived through the nazi 
occupation in a hungarian jail run by the ss 
the warsaw pact signed a few days after west germany joined the 
nato alliance in 1955 seemed to him a way of protecting hungary 
from germany 
eastwest ideological confrontation was at its peak there were 
fears of a third world war and hegedues accepted josef stalins 
image of the west 
it was a totally irrational image of a nonexistent enemy but 
it played a strong role he said 
hegedues believes stalin wanted war but that nikita s 
khrushchev who had succeeded the dictator by 1955 was more 
interested in expanding communism through economic strength 
at the warsaw pact signing the soviets went out of their way to 
emphasize civilian control even to the clothing worn by soviet 
premier nikolai bulganin hegedues and leaders of albania poland 
czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and east germany albania left 
the pact in 1968 after breaking with moscow 
the atmosphere in warsaw was informal and the generals were kept 
in the background 
i took a dressy suit but i never wore it once hegedues 
recalled the word came down from the soviets what bulganin was 
going to wear and everybody else dressed accordingly 
in 1990 still involved in research and investigating the roots 
of europes postwar division hegedues rejects the rationale for 
the warsaw pact 
he believes the western allies decision to invade italy in 1943 
rather than drive toward germany from the balkans was partially 
intended to cause the soviet union more casualties and weaken it 
after the war instead the west gave away eastern europe 
hegedues feels disarmament neutrality and renunciation of any 
effort to redraw borders can keep central europe from becoming a 
battleground once more 
german reunification accomplished in october was inevitable 
and a neutral germany would have been ideal but was unrealistic 
he said united germany is a member of nato 
political and economic alliances of neutral nations are needed 
to counter a strong germany hegedues said he believes hungary 
should seek its future with peoples of the former austrohungarian 
empire such as the slovenes and croats in yugoslavia plus the 
traditionally neutral swiss 
such an alliance offers the austrians and swiss an organized 
market if the european community is hesitant to expand in 
hegedues view he said poland should have similar goals with the 
neutral scandinavian countries and the baltic republics seeking 
independence from moscow 
any such system would require the nations of central and eastern 
europe to give up the territorial claims that caused two world 
wars hegedues said he concluded 
cooperation is the only possible way and the implementation 
of human rights

back in the relatively good times of the late 
1970s millions of city people dreamed about moving to the country 
a good many did 
for a time agriculture department demographers and many other 
experts thought a turnaround had come and that rural america would 
start gaining population again 
but the dream ended when things got tougher in the 1980s and 
the countryside resumed its old trend of losing people to the 
bright lights of cities 
there is some evidence that a modest recovery occurred in the 
late 1980s as economic conditions improved according to usda 
analysts but its spotty and not necessarily the start of another 
stampede to the bucolic life 
also according to one report the rural birth rate has slowed 
and has even lost its traditional edge over city birth rates 
demographer calvin beale of the agriculture departments 
economic research service and rural sociologist glenn fugitt of the 
university of wisconsinmadison say there are many reasons for 
thinking the decade of the 80s ended on an optimistic note 
part of their study was directed at population changes among the 
nations 1565 nonmetro counties nearly twothirds of the 
total that had a net movement of people out of those counties 
from 1980 to 1988 
the socalled outmigration meant a net loss of 1965000 people 
from these counties during the period but nearly offsetting these 
losses was the movement of 194300 people into 817 nonmetro 
counties 
these two classes of counties tend to be located in different 
parts of the country the report said 
for example the outmigration from nonmetro counties was 
widespread in the corn belt mississippi delta many parts of the 
great plains and idahos snake river valley 
similar losses occurred in southern coal fields and many 
nonmetro industrial counties of the northeast and eastern midwest 
the report said newly depressed mining areas in the west also 
suffered including many in wyoming utah and new mexico 
the gainers were more concentrated several counties in florida 
and california grew by more than 40000 from migration alone 
compared to a loss of no more than 12000 people by any one of 
those counties 
other areas that showed increases in county populations included 
new england along the south atlantic coast ozarks texas hill 
country northcentral california hawaii and the pacific 
northwest 
a metropolitan area by government definition one that includes a 
city of at least 50000 or is part of a defined urbanized area 
nonmetro areas are places that dont have close economic contact 
with cities 
strictly speaking according to demographers the terms 
rural and urban are designations that relate to places 
rather than population density for example said one usda expert 
nonmetro areas arent close to cities but a metropolitan area 
could include farms and other rural land 
the net loss of only 22000 people by the nonmetro counties 
may seem trivial and unbelievably small in light of the serious 
consequences for the rural economy in the early and mid1980s 
the report said 
but when the overall number is broken down into components to 
show where losses and increases occurred in those years the 
statistics are significant 
the decline in nonmetro population during most of the 1980s 
until the upturn late in the decade also can be attributed to 
an actual drop in birth rates among nonmetro women of 
childbearing age the report said 
although women living in nonmetro areas have traditionally 
had larger families than those in metro areas there is no longer 
any apparent differences in the childbearing expectations of the 
two groups it added 
according to the census bureaus 1988 survey of expected 
lifetime fertility women 18 to 34 years old in both groups 
expected to average 207 lifetime births per 100 women 
this is a number that is marginally below that needed for 
replacement of the childbearing generation when mortality of 
children is taken into account the report said 
moreover it was the first time in the 16year history of the 
fertility survey that nonmetro women did not expect to average 
more births than metro women 
unless the birth rate rises the nonmetro population will 
ultimately become totally dependent on incoming migration for 
further overall growth or retention of current levels the report 
said in a number of nonmetro counties that is already 
happening 
researchers did not foresee in the 1980s that the decade would 
see a reduction in nonmetro birth rates 
the notion that rural and smalltown families have more 
children than do city families is one of the oldest and hitherto 
most valid premises in demography the report said 
as to the future there is uncertainty 
there is room for still further lowering of the nonmetro 
birth rate especially as more of the smaller postbaby boom birth 
groups come of age the report said the same reasoning could 
be applied to the metro population

when world events send oil prices soaring many 
consumers start thinking of giant oil companies as a bunch of 
villainous pricegougers 
its probably impossible to make most of them think otherwise 
but that doesnt stop big oils chief spokesman from trying 
american petroleum institute president charles j dibona even 
says that putting forth the industrys public relations defensive 
during the latest oil crisis has been easier than in earlier oil 
shocks for one thing the criticism has been milder 
its less intense for one reason people arent in lines 
dibona said in an interview as he prepared for yet another round of 
pitching the industrys views to new york financial writers as the 
head of the leading oil trade group the bespectacled 58yearold 
dibona has to do so before congress in news conferences and on 
television shows 
dibona said oils defense against the inevitable charges of 
pricegouging and profiteering was made easier by going on the 
offense 
when iraq invaded kuwait in early august it didnt take a 
genius to figure out which way oil prices would be heading api 
immediately geared up its public relations machinery to offer 
explanations for the higher prices 
about 1600 reporters phone calls poured in during the first 
week of the crisis an estimated 5000 media phone calls came in 
during the first three months 
we made a major effort to get out early present the facts 
early dibona said this was started on aug 2 on aug 9 i 
gave a presentation with charts to kind of spell out what was 
happening 
dibonas latest charts show that wholesale gasoline prices have 
not risen as quickly as crude oil prices which he calls evidence 
that no gouging is taking place at one point during a media 
briefing dibona was asked why sharp drops in crude oil prices 
arent followed by immediate falls in the price of gasoline at the 
pump even though higher crude often leads to quick rises at the 
pump 
thats a good question the eventempered dibona replied 
he went on to explain that major oil companies cant control 
prices at the pump so any gouging that might occur is happening 
only on a local level he also said that as oil was rising 
refiners and service stations realized they had to replace their 
stocks with more expensive petroleum so they might raise the 
price but when it goes down companies are reluctant to sell their 
current highpriced stocks at a loss 
dibonas smooth presentation of big oils line may also be 
explained by his stature as an old hand when it comes to fending 
off charges of gouging 
a rhodes scholar and former navy man dibona was a special 
consultant to president richard m nixon and deputy director of the 
white houses energy policy office in 1973 
dibona joined washingtonbased api in 1974 as executive vice 
president and chief operating officer he became president and 
chief executive in 1979 just in time to steer the trade group 
through the oil shocks brought on by the iranian revolution 
dibona sees one striking similarity in all oil crises the 
emergence of a member of congress as oils no 1 enemy in dibonas 
mind it used to be sen howard metzenbaum dohio but he has been 
replaced by sen joseph i lieberman dconn 
lieberman has held hearings into oil pricing and proposed a law 
against pricegouging during national emergencies he even talks of 
bringing back the windfall profits tax on domestic oil production 
fighting words to those in the oil business 
theres usually one leading demagogue dibona said that 
used to be metzenbaum right now its lieberman a person who 
makes unfounded charges and who holds hearings and who makes the 
charges very early on during a period of crisis and then takes no 
trouble at all to give publicity to the information that comes up 
later to demonstrate those charges are unfounded 
asked about dibonas comment lieberman said i cant remember 
when i was last called a demagogue if ever normally i would take 
offense at it but since im being called a demagogue by the 
leading spokesman of the oil industry i take it as a compliment a 
badge of honor 
dibona an economist shows little patience for the industrys 
more vocal critics whom he says generally come from the ranks of 
lawyers who have a dim understanding of economics 
if they were all in hungary or poland you would hold out no 
hope for their economies ever becoming efficient dibona said 
the oil companies claim they are unfairly attacked by 
politicians who complain loudly about pricegouging then say 
nothing when subsequent investigations give the industry a clean 
bill of health 
when heating oil prices shot up last december the industry was 
investigated by about 15 state attorneys general the justice 
department and the energy department the api says all of the 
probes found that heating oil prices had gone up because of an 
unexpected cold snap but the politicians held no news conferences 
to announce those findings it says 
none of them showed any evidence of collusive behavior or 
gouging dibona said all of thats totally ignored 
dibona realizes it would be impossible to make the public love 
big oil so he says hes happy just to get the industrys point of 
view into the debate 
critics however accuse the oil industry of attempting to 
control the debate by trotting out a mountain of statistics that 
can be used to support any kind of explanation the companies want 
the publics disgust of the industry dibona believes dates 
from the turn of the century when the us supreme court broke up 
the standard oil trust in 1911 he says big oils evil image has 
been perpetuated by the fictional characterization of the 
swaggering texas oil man like jr ewing of tvs dallas 
the texans i know in the oil business are not like that at 
all he said

tom holland has spent his directing career 
scaring people but never more effectively than in the cbs movie 
the stranger within 
the movie which airs tuesday and stars rick schroder kate 
jackson and chris sarandon has no slashers no chain saws no 
gore no special effects the story is simple straightforward and 
very sinister jacksons young son is kidnapped and 16 years later 
schroder knocks on her door and says he is her longlost child 
rick was cast when i got the job holland said everyone i 
knew thought of rick as everyones favorite grandson i thought it 
would be interesting to help rick find a new side and a perverse 
thrill to see him shock people that cant be ricky schroder it 
looks like ricky schroder my god it is ricky schroder and hes 
got a hammer in his hands 
schroder is probably bestknown as the child star of the movie 
remake of the champ and from the silver spoons tv series 
he later was seen as the young cowboy in the miniseries lonesome 
dove he became rick instead of ricky when he began playing older 
roles 
the stranger within unlike most scary films relies on 
people and relationships bit by bit the tension mounts until it 
becomes truly terrifying and satisfying in a way the slasher 
movies can never be 
its the first television movie ive directed said holland 
a writer and director whose films include fright night 
childs play and fatal beauty 
ive been offered a lot of things but i never read anything i 
liked until this it is in fact the best script ive ever gotten 
its written by john pielmeier a playwright who wrote agnes of 
god and hes sensational it has great acting roles it has great 
words great emotional subtext 
holland said he was pleased when kate jackson bestknown for 
the series charlies angels and scarecrow and mrs king 
agreed to appear in the movie 
kate can really act he said shes more than a light 
comedienne she has some life experiences that she brings to her 
work 
jackson plays a widow living in minnesota whose 3yearold son 
is abducted while shes grocery shopping sixteen years later she 
has put her life back together and has a boyfriend played by 
sarandon who has appeared in two other holland pictures childs 
play and fright night 
when schroder arrives and says hes her son its a shock then 
a joy slowly it becomes a murderous nightmare 
holland took time away from his latest writing assignment a 
remake of village of the damned to talk about the stranger 
within he sat on the patio of his home overlooking the san 
fernando valley area of los angeles cooper a german shepherd he 
picked up as a puppy while shooting the movie on location in 
minnesota romped nearby 
hes scheduled to direct the village of the damned remake 
sometime next year and also is planning to direct a movie by 
miami vice creator anthony yerkovich about motorcycle street 
racing 
his last writing assignment was a movie script called crystal 
tower that currently is on hold 
that took a year out of my life holland said its a 
fantasy and not really a star vehicle as a child king arthur is 
bewitched by morgana and merlin throws excalibur into the future 
to seek his heir the heir who comes back from the future is an 
18yearold high school student from america we all have projects 
that we like a lot that dont go 
holland estimates hes written 10 scripts that never were 
produced and eight that have been made he considers that a good 
average 
he started as an actor in new york working in such soap operas 
as love of life time for us and general hospital 
i moved to los angeles and did a lot of episodic work he 
said i had a role in the movie walk in the spring rain which 
starred ingrid bergman and anthony quinn then i started writing 
novels unsuccessfully next i tried writing episodic television 
again unsuccessfully finally i started writing spec scripts and 
from that got assignments for lowbudget exploitation and horror 
movies 
the first time i got paid for writing was 1975 i still have a 
copy of the check it was an option for an original screenplay that 
never got made despite the preponderance of horror films 
holland said hes never had a great interest in them 
its the jobs i could get he said it took me eight years 
to make it id like to get away from it but im going right back 
into that seething cauldron working with special effects is very 
slow and tedious it takes a lot of planning as a director its 
more mechanical than creative in childs play we had nine 
puppeteers working at a time

the communist army starved 150000 civilians to 
death with the siege of changchun during chinas civil war 
according to a startling book since banned that was published by 
the chinese military 
it also says a peoples liberation army division led by wang 
zhen now vice president smuggled opium during the war that 
brought the communists to power more than 40 years ago 
in a break with communist party doctrine the book questions 
whether the battle to wrest the country from chiang kaisheks 
nationalists was worth the cost and implies the revolution has not 
produced a better life 
chinese people killed hundreds of thousands of chinese 
people the book says for what for socialism for the 
communist party was it worth it 
white snow red blood was written by zhang zhenglu a 
43yearold lieutenant colonel who based it on numerous communist 
party documents some classified and interviews with surviving 
communist officers 
unlike previous chinese war histories zhangs work strives to 
be objective and rejects the official line that history books 
should justify communist rule he dispenses praise and criticism in 
roughly equal measure 
the 618page treatise published in august 1989 by the peoples 
liberation army publishing house was suppressed this spring after 
an army magazine quoted president yang shangkun as saying it 
insulted the communist party by then however more than 
100000 copies had been sold 
an army order banning the book is believed to have been issued 
in march but as is normal in china was not made public the book 
was criticized in the staterun press and copies disappeared from 
bookstores 
a chinese source in hong kong said lt col zhang was being 
investigated a copy of his book was obtained from chinese sources 
by the associated press in hong kong 
it focuses on a critical military campaign of chinas civil war 
the battle for manchuria in 194548 won by the communists 
after japans defeat in world war ii china was thrown into 
chaos the antijapanese alliance between mao tsetungs communists 
and chiangs nationalists collapsed and the two parties became 
locked in civil war for control of the middle kingdom 
one of zhangs most startling claims is that 150000 civilians 
starved to death between may and october 1948 during a battle for 
changchun a key industrial center in the northeast 
communist party doctrine holds that the battle was a bloodless 
affair resulting in the surrender of 100000 nationalist troops 
after a fivemonth siege by communist forces 
zhang said the communist armys decision to surround the city in 
may 1948 was accompanied by an order prohibiting civilians from 
leaving in order to put maximum pressure on the nationalists 
grain reserves 
he cited a report from a peoples liberation army officer filed 
sept 9 1948 saying communist troops were shooting and beating 
fleeing residents who at times were seen throwing their babies 
behind them in order to escape the city 
not allowing the starving city residents to leave and sending 
other starving citizens back into the city has become difficult to 
explain to the troops the officers report says 
the author quoted cables from other officers asking that the 
army be allowed to save starving people the requests were denied 
he wrote 
at one point thousands of residents were caught between the two 
forces all food in the city had been requisitioned by the 
nationalists and the communists refused to let the civilians pass 
so they died there slowly the book says 
changchun was like hiroshima zhang wrote the casualties 
were about the same hiroshima took nine seconds changchun took 
five months 
his book says communist troops smuggled large quantities of 
opium during the civil war the point is particularly interesting 
because the communists took a strong antidug stand in the war 
years calling opium a symbol of chinas weakness 
britain forced territorial concessions from china during two 
opium wars in the 19th century millions of chinese both elite and 
laborers were addicted 
part of the communist success against chiang was their ability 
to portray themselves as opponents of a drug that made the nation 
weak 
zhang identifies one drugdealing army division as no 28 based 
at the communists base camp yenan in central china 
official party history identifies chinas current vice 
president wang zhen as the divisions commander zhang does not 
mention wangs name 
when division no 28 came to the northeast in 1946 to aid in the 
manchurian campaign he wrote it was already quite rich having 
made its money dealing opium and silver 
some old cadres said every time that division moved their 
vehicles were piled high with goods zhang said they looked 
like a baggage train 
drug trafficking was widespread among communist party officials 
the book says including some former generals who died as 
revolutionary heroes 
the phenomenon of getting rich was pretty common among 
individuals and groups especially among frontline military 
units zhang wrote they did it moving yellow gold white 
silver and black opium 
white snow red blood breaks with communist party doctrine 
by blaming the late chairman mao tsetung for major military 
defeats and praising the traitor lin biao as a genius until 
zhangs book mao had been criticized only for mistakes made 
after the victory in 1949 
lin once maos heir fell from grace after sept 13 1971 when 
he is believed to have died in an attempt to flee china after an 
aborted coup detat he commanded the communist forces in 
manchuria and western scholars have credited him with leading the 
communist army to victory 
official party histories reject lins influence because any 
praise would be interpreted as indirect approval of his later 
attempts to seize power 
analyzing internal party documents zhang credits lin with 
avoiding a disastrous military defeat in the spring of 1946 by 
withdrawing from the northeast town of siping which mao had 
ordered held at all costs 
in zhangs view lins decision saved the manchurian campaign 
when it came to acumen in peace and war he wrote lin was 
wiser and deeper than mao 
other recent books published by chinas military also have 
probed the past of the peoples liberation army 
one called black snow argues that china should not have 
entered the korean war because the soviet union had a treaty with 
north korea and therefore the responsibility to protect it 
communist doctrine says chinas decision to cross the yalu river 
was a glorious one 
these books are similar to the historical revisionism currently 
under way in the soviet union 
between the time the chinese books were written in the late 
1980s and the time they were published however chinas limited 
political reforms became a casualty of the 1989 crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement 
nonetheless their very appearance when hardliners were 
supposed to be cementing their control indicates that divisions 
within the military 
although such highranking military officers as gen yang 
baibing criticized the books they did not stop their own 
publishing houses from putting them out 
the main struggle in the military is between conservatives like 
gen yang who want to use the army to ensure the communist partys 
continuance in power and officers who want to remove the army from 
politics and modernize it 
those in the latter category generally opposed the crackdown in 
tiananmen square they include writers like zhang zhenglu 
welleducated men who have little in common with the peasant 
revolutionaries of 41 years ago

on the revised political form charts 
president bushs 1992 vulnerability rating has soared and democrats 
are surging toward a potent bid for the white house appraisals 
that will stand until the next revision 
and it wont be long in coming the only certainty about the new 
look at bushs reelection prospects is that it will be outdated by 
events issues and personalities before the real campaigning 
begins 
the outcome in tuesdays elections wont have much to do with 
it for all the efforts of political cheerleaders and seers to 
project the next campaign based on the last one 
not that bush lacks for political problems those were 
displayed but not created by the offyear campaign and elections 
chief among them he had to surrender a major issue by agreeing to 
increased taxes as part of the budget deal now hes trying to 
revive his notax pledge with a nomore pledge 
taxes and budgets are going to be a political headache for 
democrats too 
theyve all got to overn in a slumping economy thats going to 
afflict state and federal budgets next year democrats said all 
along that bush would be hard to beat for a second term if the 
economy is in good shape in 1992 and vulnerable to their challenge 
if it isnt nothing has happened to change that appraisal 
nor can there be meaningful guesses about the next election 
without an answer to the biggest question a president faces war or 
peace with american troops on the front lines against iraq the 
outcome in the persian gulf crisis could become the overwhelming 
issue of 1992 
furthermore offyear elections seldom have been a barometer of 
the presidential contests that followed even when they delivered 
the kind of clear partisan verdict that was lacking this time 
midterm election campaigns can set the candidate lineup for the 
presidential year but that doesnt necessarily work either it 
didnt work for sen edmund s muskie of maine the democrats 
chosen spokesman in a nationally televised address on the eve of 
the 1970 elections a loser when he sought the 1972 presidential 
nomination 
bush acknowledges his disappointment in the setbacks some 
republicans suffered on tuesday but dismisses this kind of coy 
dance in which the offyear is weighed as sign of the campaign to 
come 
the minute the election is over everybody shifts gear and 
starts pointing at 92 he said its understandable he 
turned aside questions about his plans to seek a second term 
saying he isnt thinking about the next election 
thats standard positioning for a president who doesnt have to 
worry about campaign fundraising or about gaining his partys 
nomination those advantages go with the job 
a challenger has to start sooner which means about now january 
at the latest democratic prospects already have waited longer than 
usual to start stirring when bush was riding highest in the 
approval polls there were complaints that nobody seemed to want to 
take him on 
sen edward m kennedy no longer ranked a presidential prospect 
in the early polls and speculation complained months ago at what 
he called a kind of unnatural quiet coming from our party 
he said last spring that democrats were almost conceding a 
second term to president bush or hoping against hope that he 
stumbles somewhere along the way 
now that its happened largely on the tax reversal and economic 
unease democratic leaders say bush can be beaten i think george 
bush is incredibly vulnerable in 1992 said ronald h brown the 
democratic party chairman republicans of course insist thats 
not so and claim he could have won this time 
thats hypothetical some of the problem points are not 
bush needs a clear consistent theme without the variations of 
the past campaign he campaigned against democrats and taxes then 
against washington in general then against saddam hussein 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater said shifts in the message were 
a phony issue because all the elements were there in every 
speech thats so but the emphasis shifted drastically 
white house political aides and advisors reportedly differed on 
tactics and topics for the offyear campaign strains like that can 
do serious damage in a presidential campaign and the bush 
reelection committee expected to open up next fall will need 
strong management 
conservative republicans are restive especially on taxes and 
there is talk of a challenge from the right in the republican 
primaries in 1992 that may be chronic bush never has been a 
favorite of the gop right

a lowcost drug kenya trumpeted as a 
breakthrough aids treatment has become mired in licensing squabbles 
and corruption charges delaying its availability and casting doubt 
on promising initial findings 
patients and doctors who have used the drug known as kemron 
say it does seem to alleviate symptoms and people are coming from 
europe the united states and elsewhere to try it 
the optimistic reports await confirmation in clinical trials 
under way in several countries doubtful claims of proprietorship 
by kenyan researchers and suggestions they may have overstated 
their findings have cast doubt on the reports 
there also are accusations that one kenyan doctor has sold test 
samples of kemron including worthless placebos for exorbitant 
prices 
somebodys been corrupted if theyre selling placebos to dying 
aids patients said joseph cummins an american veterinarian who 
supplied the interferon that comprises the treatment 
interferons which long have been studied for antiviral 
properties occur naturally in the body and help shield the immune 
system the us food and drug administration has approved the use 
of interferons in treating kaposis sarcoma a cancer common among 
people with aids 
cummins devised a method of administering low doses of 
interferon that is being used by doctors at the kenya medical 
research institute which is known as kemri 
the drug generally has not been tested in pill form because of 
the belief it would be destroyed by stomach acid in cummins use 
a tablet containing the drug is dissolved on the tongue allowing 
small doses to be absorbed through the mouth 
kenyan researchers who used cummins method announced startling 
findings in february they said that after two to four weeks of 
treatment with kemron aids symptoms were alleviated in most of 101 
patients tested they claimed the virus that causes aids could no 
longer be detected in the blood of about 10 percent of the 
patients the researchers reported no negative side effects 
no other scientists have duplicated kenyas findings which 
resulted from uncontrolled trials no group received placebos for 
comparison 
but the world health organization largely due to the kenyan 
results has recommended worldwide trials while cautioning that 
patients sometimes respond well to new treatments simply because of 
the greater attention they receive 
in announcing the unverified results kemris director dr 
davey koech claimed to have been largely responsible for 
developing the treatment a contention dismissed by cummins 
koech said in february that kemri produced a form of 
interferon not so far described in medical literature 
as collaborators he cited cummins whose amarillo cell culture 
institute has four patents on the lowdose use of oral interferon 
and hayashibara biochemical laboratories of akayama japan 
hayashibara is one of the few companies in the world that 
manufactures interferons and produces the drug used in kenyas 
program under a licensing agreement with cummins company 
soon after the february presentation cummins wrote koech 
accusing him of lies and misrepresentations and threatening to sue 
over koechs attempts to patent the technique in kenya 
from texas cummins said he developed the treatment after years 
of experimenting with interferon on animal diseases including cat 
leukemia cat leukemia like aids suppresses the immune system he 
described one early experiment in a 1987 article in the british 
medical journal lancet 
despite their disagreement cummins described koech as quite 
bold and courageous he said koechs main contribution was to put 
the treatment into people we never could have tested due to 
restrictive us laws 
however cummins said the legacy of the kenyan tests was an 
awful lot of drama and not much data 
koech declined repeated requests for an interview 
neither cummins nor koech claims kemron is a cure for aids 
however critics say false hopes were raised among many in kenya by 
koechs claims that almost 10 percent of those he tested 
seroconverted meaning traces of the disease were erased from 
their blood as well as by kenyas announcement in july that the 
drug would be widely available by midaugust 
saying seroconversion is just another way of saying they have 
got a cure said joe muriuki 32 who has been on kemron since 
december 
he said that within two weeks of taking kemron he felt better 
and began gaining weight his mouth sores swollen glands 
diarrhea fevers itchy skin and sweating disappeared 
however muriuki who has been an adviser at a clinic for 
sexually transmitted diseases since learning he had aids three 
years ago said publicity about kemron led people to believe it 
would prevent and cure aids and that has led to a relapse into 
unsafe sexual behavior he said 
he also cited frustration over the drugs continued 
inavailability 
although 200000 tablets were imported for the july 
announcement most of them remain with the local marketing agent 
due to a licensing dispute 
the governments chief pharmacist says the agent innovative 
therapeutics ltd cannot sell the drug unless 51 percent gh syrup she 
called a friend from alcoholics 
anonymous for help but she heard nothing of what her friend said 
all i could think was there were two more bottles of 
robitussin in the cupboard she said 
rose told her friend she was all right and hung up rose drank 
the remaining bottles another friend took her to the hospital 
the doctors said she was depressed they suggested 30day 
outpatient treatment they gave her pills the pills didnt work 
rose said 
a week later i got into a fight with my husband and cut my 
wrists she said 
the doctors gave her more antidepressants i took all of them 
and i felt relief for the first time and went to bed to die 
rose said 
her friend from aa found her and called 911 she was unconscious 
and in convulsions she was in intensive care for four days 
rose a pseudonym she chose to protect her identity is a 
34yearold executive whose third suicide attempt in as many months 
nearly succeeded 
she came from the hospital to springbrook institute in newberg 
after 16 days in residential treatment her outlook changed 
i truly felt that god intervened for me said rose now 
living as an outpatient in a nearby apartment 
i have my spark back i have hope i have healthy fear which 
will keep me motivated i care about other people and myself ive 
made a good start 
this is her second attempt at recovery her failure the first 
time took her selfesteem to new lows 
coming here was real scary she said i felt defeated i 
couldnt even die 
rose said she started drinking when she was 12 but didnt admit 
she had a problem until she was in her mid20s she had a good job 
a house a nice car she had a supportive boss and good friends 
those last two years i didnt have a crisis and i was 
miserable she said she had some blackouts and began to 
recognize a pattern 
we would go out for happy hour and have a few drinks she 
said i dont know what they would do but i would get a bottle 
and go home 
she knew she needed something 
i went back to church i contacted family she said i

if your best driving performance is in the 
golf cart you may be playing the game wrong two researchers say 
you could do your circulatory system more good if you make the trip 
on foot 
walking a course regularly helps lower cholesterol levels and 
therefore may decrease the risk of heart disease the experts 
concluded 
we need to reassess the value of this sport said the report 
in the journal the physician and sportsmedicine 
researchers edward a palank and ernest h hargreaves jr of the 
new hampshire heart institute in manchester looked at 28 average 
but enthusiastic male golfers ages 48 to 80 they had not exercised 
the previous four months 
in the study the golfers walked about 14 miles a week by 
playing an 18hole course an average of three times a week from 
midmay to midseptember of 1989 with a pullcart or carrying a 
light bag 
the golfers lowered their total cholesterol by an average of 17 
milligrams per deciliter of blood the study said the lowdensity 
lipoprotein fraction of their cholesterol the socalled bad 
cholesterol associated with higher risk of heart disease fell by 
an average of 132 milligrams it said 
both are very significant decreases the report said 
however the level of highdensity lipoprotein socalled 
good cholesterol associated with a lower risk of heart 
disease did not change significantly the report said 
thats because a golfers stops to hit the ball get in the way 
of his workout said palank a cardiologist it takes a sustained 
aerobic workout to improve hdl he said in an interview 
just the same the study demonstrates the sport has health 
value 
if you play golf and you walk and you take advantage of a 
sport you like you can improve your heart disease risk ratio 
he said the thing thats discouraging is that theyve taken a 
very enjoyable sport that was designed to walk and taken out some 
of the enjoyment and taken away some of the positive medical 
benefit 
palank blamed economics saying courses make more money by 
shuttling more golfers through on carts 
thirtythree percent of membersonly courses 29 percent of 
daily fee courses and 11 percent of public courses require carts 
some or all of the time according to the national golf foundation 
in florida the majority of courses require no carts and may not 
even have them said andrew m snook a research associate with the 
nonprofit organization 
in a separate survey done in 1988 golfers said they used a 
cart about a third of the time they played snook said 
however walking may strengthen a golfers game by reducing the 
effects of fatigue said rob mottram a physical therapist with 
centinela hospital inglewood calif mottram staffs a fitness 
center including weight machines treadmlls and ultrasound 
therapeutic equipment which travels with professional golf tours

drinking a sugary drink before lunch may not be as bad for 
children as parents assume a researcher says 
in a recent study children ate less food for lunch if they 
drank a sugared drink but selected fewer cookies and soft drinks 
and more cold cuts bread and other foods than children who did not 
have sugar beforehand 
the study shows theres not an unlimited appetite for sugar 
the body becomes satisfied said harvey anderson chairman of the 
nutrition department at the university of toronto school of 
medicine 
the more calories the children ate before lunch the less 
calories they ate at lunch even though they were allowed to eat 
as much as they wanted said anderson who presented the study at a 
symposium on nutrition research last month in toronto the research 
has yet to be published 
it is more important to consider what a child eats over the 
course of a whole day than for one meal said dr ronald kleinman 
of massachusetts general hospital who is chairman of the committee 
on nutrition for the american academy of pediatrics 
theres not very much information about whether having a snack 
during the day an hour or two before a meal really makes a 
difference in what somebody eats in their meal said kleinman 
who said he was not familiar with andersons study 
there is a need however for research into childrens eating 
patterns he said 
some studies have shown benefits of afternoon snacks for 
children who play sports several also have been conducted on the 
effects of breakfast on performance in schools with contradictory 
results kleinman said 
anderson and his colleagues studied normalweight children 10 
boys and 10 girls ages 9 and 10 at 1130 am the children were 
given either 8 ounces of unsweetened koolaid or the drink 
sweetened with 15 ounces or 3 ounces of sugar 
each child was his or her own control in the research depending 
on which drink was given on a particular day 
we then sent the kids to heaven at 12 noon by giving them a 
choice of all the cookies they could eat all the pop cake we 
also gave them bread cold cuts fruit and milk the range of 
foods but all in excess anderson said 
children who had the sugared drink ate almost no sweets at 
lunch he said those who had the drink without sugar chose a 
quarter of their lunch calories from cookies and soft drinks 
anderson said 
the children ate about 900 calories including any calories in 
the soft drink anderson said 
the researchers wanted to know whether children respond to 
calories in sugar a simple carbohydrate anderson said there is no 
published research on whether the same results would be achieved by 
a complex carbohydrate such as a banana 
anderson hopes to look at whether children who have a tendency 
toward obesity also reach a satiation point with sugar are they 
responding in the same way physiologically in terms of sugar 
load 
anderson said he is not recommending that parents give children 
sugar before meals though it is encouraging for parents that a 
little sugar will do no harm to normal children 
in addition to eating and drinking the children in andersons 
study played during the research they were not told what was being 
studied 
anderson said the children did not react against drinking 
unsweetened koolaid theyd just drink it down quickly they 
wanted to get on and play he said

another battle of britain is raging but its not 
about warplane dominance over the skies this fight concerns 
jetliner space on the ground 
united airlines bid to fly into heathrow announced last month 
is expected to intensify the struggle for landing spots at one of 
the worlds busiest airports 
the competition over which airlines can fly to heathrow is 
likely to be raised between the us and british governments which 
are currently reviewing their air services agreement the british 
department of transport said 
when united announced oct 23 it had purchased most of pan 
american world airways british air routes for 400 million the 
buyer asserted pan ams slot at heathrow was part of the deal 
but since 1977 the british government has barred any new 
airline from entering crowded heathrow and might force united to 
fly into gatwick and other british airports 
american airlines was told to go to gatwick when it bought trans 
world airlines chicagoheathrow route in a 195 million deal last 
year 
we certainly dont think they united have the right to 
operate out of heathrow said lizann peppard an american 
airlines spokeswoman in london 
american has indicated an interest in buying the pan am routes 
at a higher price than united is paying but pan am and united say 
their deal is sealed 
many international and domestic airlines want slots at heathrow 
which is 20 miles west of london and served by the london subway 
system gatwick 27 miles south of london links up with the 
british rail train network 
heathrow has more shops restaurants and other amenities and 
offers far more connecting flights than gatwick primarily a center 
for charter flights 
british midland airways britains second largest airline after 
british airways wants more heathrow slots and is lobbying for a 
heathrow expansion virgin atlantic airways which operates out of 
gatwick also wants to get into heathrow 
we certainly have ambitions ourselves to get into heathrow and 
it would obviously be unacceptable for us carrier flying into 
heathrow and ourselves not said ed hullah virgins director for 
commercial operations 
but lawrence nagin senior vice president for united airlines 
said usbritish air services agreement allows successors to the 
two specified american carriers operating out of heathrow pan am 
and twa to assume their rights 
united has filed with the us department of transportation 
asking for approval of transfer of rights it has asked for an 
expedited review and a decision by dec 31 
were optimistic that the united states government will be 
successful to get the uk government to approve united airlines 
operations in heathrow nagin said in a telephone interview from 
chicago 
united wants to start operating the pan am routes in the spring 
they are from new york washington san francisco los angeles and 
seattle 
pan am is retaining london routes from miami and detroit but is 
moving those flights to gatwick 
as a result of the united controversy britains department of 
transportation has asked the civil aviation authority to accelerate 
an existing review of the traffic distribution rules governing 
the allocation of landing slots at heathrow and gatwick and to 
report to the department early in the new year rather than in 
march 
the rules separate from the usbritish air treaty are 
intended to relieve heathrow congestion and spur growth at gatwick 
the department must wait to hear from the aviation authority 
before we can decide how to deal with the united application 
said a department official interviewed on condition of anonymity 
us and british government officials already had agreed to meet 
sometime this month for a second round of air services 
liberalization talks the official said and it seemed likely the 
united issue would be raised 
talks began more than a year ago on a new britishus air 
services agreement to replace the existing treaty reahed in the 
mid1970s 
about 42 million passengers 82 percent of them international 
passed through heathrow last year making it one of the worlds 
busiest air terminals gatwick handled 212 million heathrow is 
served by 70 airlines although british airways dominates

its key london routes will increase service in miami with more 
flights to latin america 
chairman thomas g plaskett said wednesday an increased number 
of departures out of miami and into latin america by pan american 
world airways and pan am express is part of an overall strategy for 
the airline and fits in with plans unveiled in october to sell 
important uslondon routes to ual corp for 400 million 
pan am agreed to sell those coveted london routes to ual which 
will join pan am in a marketing strategy intended to bolster pan 
ams latin american routes the two airlines will coordinate some 
flights in an effort to feed each other passengers 
pan am said wednesday it would be increasing daily flights out 
of miami during the winter season by 70 percent from 63 last year 
to 107 this year 
included in the expansion will be more nonstops from miami to 
sao paulo brazil and new flights between miami and recife 
brazil 
pan am also will operate new services from miami to managua 
nicaragua san salvador el salvador belize city belize and san 
pedro sula honduras 
service to other destinations in latin america and the united 
states will become more frequent 
the broadbased cooperative agreement that we have signed with 
united airlines will allow us to focus even more of our attention 
on our florida and latin american services plaskett said in a 
statement 
analysts viewed the deal with ual as a desperate cashraising 
attempt by pan am which has lost money for years and like other 
airlines has been hit hard by rising fuel costs 
amr corp parent of american airlines called the 400 million 
price too low and said it would pay in excess of 500 million for 
the london routes plaskett has dismissed that offer saying the

would wall streets powerful investment banks 
have the same clout if the address on their stationery were jersey 
city nj or stamford conn 
municipal political and business forces are circling their 
wagons to head off major departures from the city where stocks 
first were traded nearly 200 years ago 
the bureaucrats won a battle tuesday when four commodity 
exchanges decided to stay in lower manhattan rather than cross the 
hudson river to new jersey swayed by a 145 million incentives 
package that includes free space 
now officials are turning their sights to morgan stanley amp co 
a topline investment bank with more than 4000 employees which is 
considering moving about an hour north to stamford when the firms 
leases expire in 1998 
do they want to be all alone in a glass jungle in stamford 
said harold holzer a spokesman for vincent tese the states 
director of economic development who helped negotiate the deal to 
keep the commodity exchanges 
were going to tell them its going to hurt their competitive 
position holzer said wednesday its ot the world business 
center 
other firms have relocated tradingrelated support facilities to 
cheaper space off manhattan island but morgan would be the first 
investment house to move its headquarters outside the city in 
fact executives couldnt name a major new york law firm brokerage 
house or consulting firm that has fled the nations financial hub 
but during a prolonged securities industry recession in a city 
facing a 2 billion budget deficit with layoffs rising theres a 
whiff of panic in the air over a possible domino effect of 
departures 
the new york city partnership a group of business and civic 
leaders sponsored a breakfast for morgan on tuesday stamford was 
bashed and pressure was applied by luminaries such as new york sen 
daniel patrick moynihan cardinal john oconnor and former 
secretary of state cyrus vance 
what great ideas of civilization were ever spawned in the 
suburbs prominent attorney arthur liman asked said moynihan 
we live in a brutal capitalist system and if you leave new york 
you die 
stamford is undertaking its own campaign the city of 105000 
paid for a 16page advertising insert in the wall street journal on 
monday touting its virtues easy access to new york suburban 
living good schools 3 million square feet of empty office space 
no wage taxes yacht marinas 
we dont want to see new york fail but that said you cant 
have it all said david e anderson president of the stamford 
partnership we can balance and contrast and have certain 
strengths that new york can never have 
to be sure not all wall street firms are considering abandoning 
new york but staying can be costly shearson lehman brothers inc 
and merrill lynch amp co for example moved into extravagant 
offices during the roaring mid1980s but have been forced to lay 
off thousands as business has declined 
several major firms have moved or plan to move backoffice 
operations outside manhattan including merrill painewebber inc 
and donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc all to new jersey 
first boston inc has hired a major real estate firm to 
investigate its options when leases expire at the end of 1993 
prudentialbache securities inc recently hired an executive who 
engineered painewebbers new jersey move its backoffice leases 
expire in 1994 
cost is the top consideration firms also cite negative quality 
of life issues in manhattan such as education crime smelly 
subways and homelessness 
people will give you a list of a lot of items but the main 
thing thats driving them out of the city is economics said john 
powers senior managing director of edward s gordon co a major 
real estate firm 
real estate taxes in a firstclass manhattan building can hit 9 
per square foot compared with about 150 in the suburbs on top 
of that commercial tenants pay a 6 percent occupancy tax based on 
gross rent 
operating costs are 1 to 150 per square foot higher in new 
york than in the outer lands real estate executives said while 
construction costs range from 15 percent to 30 percent higher 
if it were just money new york city would lose every time 
said lee silberstein vice president of the new york city public 
development corp but there is a certain cache to doing business 
in new york and there is a premium price that firms will pay to 
stay here 
grim times have eaten revenue for the city and state since the 
1987 stock market crash but officials say they wont negotiate out 
of desperation despite the lucrative incentives for the commodity 
exchanges the city retains a growing industry of 11700 workers 
that generates 13 billion a year

aetna life amp casualty co is dropping 
personal auto and homeowners insurance in new mexico and idaho 
saying the business is unprofitable with little hope for much 
improvement 
aetna stopped selling new auto and homeowners policies in new 
mexico and idaho nov 2 starting in february the company will not 
renew policies in new mexico in march it will not renew them in 
idaho 
the decision is the latest move by aetna to improve dreary 
financial results in personal insurance lines nationwide the 
hartfordbased insurance giant had already dedicated itself to 
writing less personal auto insurance 
aetna is not a major player in personal lines in either state 
the companys decision will affect 10265 existing policies in new 
mexico 5603 auto and 4662 homeowners which is about 15 
percent of the market said aetna spokesman sal foti 
in idaho it said 4140 policies will be affected 1802 auto 
and 2338 homeowners idaho law will require aetna to keep insuring 
customers who cannot find coverage elsewhere foti said 
withdrawing from the business will allow us to devote our 
resources to other states where the opportunity for profitable 
results is better foti said 
aetna has also stopped writing new personal auto policies in 
rhode island and is challenging laws in massachusetts that make it 
very expensive for the company to withdraw from auto insurance 
there

a 14nation bloc of farm exporting 
countries said thursday that world trade talks may collapse unless 
the european community changes its proposal on cutting agriculture 
subsidies 
a negotiation which showed no movement away from the current 
european community offer would be totally unacceptable said neal 
blewett chairman of the cairns group which includes such large 
farm exporters as australia argentina and canada 
blewett australias foreign trade minister called the ec 
proposal for a 30 percent cut in agricultural subsidies over 10 
years very disappointing he said it has thrown talks to bring 
down trade barriers worldwide into deep trouble 
but said his group was delaying a possible bid to postpone the 
final round of the world trade talks due to be held here next 
month 
the united states has also criticized the ecs proposed 30 
percent cut in farm subsidies calling it nadequate 
if they the ec come to the table with the attitude that this 
is our final offer take it or leave it then that is not 
acceptable assistant us trade representative myles frechette 
said wednesday in washington 
cairns group officials met thursday with top ec trade officials 
to discuss their concerns about the ec farm proposal and the 
imperiled state of the uruguay round of trade talks 
they said they welcomed assurances from the top ec trade 
official frans andriessen that the community proposal was an 
opening position not a final offer but they said they worried 
that did not allow negotiators much room to offer deeper cuts 
on tuesday the ec became the last major participant in the 
uruguay round of trade talks to submit a proposal on agriculture 
the ec proposed a 30 percent cut in subsidies for farmers over 
10 years beginning in 1986 some cuts have already been made the 
ec proposal does not extend to export subsidies 
the cairns group and the united states want to cut subsidies to 
farmers by as much as 75 percent along with a virtual elimination 
of exporters subsidies 
the gap between the ec and its main trade partners threatens to 
combine with other stumbling blocs in the talks to torpedo the 
uruguay round a fouryear effort of more than 100 nations to bring 
down global trade barriers 
unless there is willingness by the ec to move from that 
position then there is no prospect of success in the agriculture 
negotiations blewett told reporters 
agriculture is one of 15 trade sectors under discussion in the 
uruguay round which also includes clothing telecommunications and 
services such as banking 
but cairns group and us officials maintain agriculture is the 
key to a settlement in other areas 
cairns group officials said they will wait two weeks before 
deciding whether to advocate delaying a final set of uruguay round 
meetings scheduled for early next month 
members of the cairns group named for the australian city where 
it held its first meeting in 1986 are argentina australia 
brazil canada chile colombia fiji hungary indonesia 
malaysia new zealand the philippines thailand and uruguay

hughes danbury optical systems inc citing 
federal budget cuts says it will eliminate about 90 jobs early 
next month trimming its 920person work force by about 10 percent 
the layoffs of salaried workers likely will account for most of 
the cutback but some jobs will be cut through attrition company 
spokesman tom arconti said wednesday 
arconti said the company will attempt to transfer some of those 
dismissed to jobs in other business units of its parent company 
the los angelesbased hughes aircraft division of general motors 
corp those units are in california and elsewhere around the 
nation he said 
hughes danbury optical systems formerly was part of perkin elmer 
corp it is best known as the prime contractor to the national 
aeronautics and space administration on the problemplagued hubble 
space telescope 
arconti said the layoffs planned for early december are 
unrelated to the telescopes problems which were traced to 
measuring instruments used to create its mirrors 
instead he said the move stemmed from leaner nasa and 
department of defense budgets which provide much of the funding 
for the companys programs were finding a lot of our programs 
being stretched out and facing reduced funding arconti said

no comment wednesday on the suit 
microsoft owns one of the most popular personal computer 
operating systems msdos

british steel announced thursday it would close a 
scottish steelworks early next year resulting in the loss of 1200 
jobs in an area already hardhit by the planned closure of another 
large british steel plant 
british steel said it had decided reluctantly it could no longer 
support the losses at clydesdale which makes seamless steel tubes 
for the oil and gas industry 
a company spokesman said an oversupply of seamless tubes had 
caused significant losses for the past six years at the two 
tube mills in the strathclyde area 
the mills built in 1948 and 1956 had become obsolete 
together they produce about a quarter of a million tons of 
seamless pipes every year mainly used in bore holes 
earlier this year british steel announced plans to cut 800 jobs 
next spring at the ravenscraig plant also in strathclyde 
ravenscraig is a hot strip mill the company said thursday the 
closures were unrelated 
the company said it recognized the impact the closure decision 
would have on the community and promised to offer counselling 
services to retrain workers 
british steel added that the clydesdale workers had known for 
some time that processes at the plant were obsolete and faced 
strong international competition 
but roy evans general secretary of the iron and steel trades 
confederation said the decision shocked workers 
evans said he had been told clydesdale was losing about 34 
million a year and the mills were in bad shape 
there has been a failure to invest in clydesdale over the 
years because of the huge overcapacity of the seamless tube 
product evans said we knew there were problems but the 
announcement of a complete closure has come as a shock 
strathclyde in western scotland is the traditional commercial 
and industrial heartland of the country containing nearly 
onequarter of the total population

the outlook for the christmas shopping season worsened today as 
the nations biggest retailers reported dismal sales results for 
the month of october 
several companies including jc penney co inc may 
department stores co and limited inc reported their sales 
dropped from yearearlier levels 
the results coming on the heels of poor showings in august and 
september reflected a recessionary psychology among consumers 
said jeffrey feiner a retail industry analyst with merrill lynch amp 
co 
we expect the weakness will continue he said 
jeffrey edelman an analyst with barclays de zoete wedd inc 
was equally downbeat predicting were undoubtedly going to see 
a continued winding down of the consumer into the christmas 
season 
consumers have put spending for discretionary items clothing 
furniture and other extras on hold the past few months because of 
uncertainty over the economy and the fear of war in the middle 
east they also have less money to spend because they are paying 
more money for gasoline and heating oil 
analysts said consumers will be buying fewer and cheaper gifts 
this year shopping carefully and looking for bargains with 
merchandise not moving out of the stores the last few months the 
bargains are already there as retailers take markdowns in hopes of 
reducing inventories 
a poor christmas is bad news for the economy since twothirds 
of the gross national product is generated from consumer spending 
a bad season could also be devastating for retailers who depend on 
holiday shopping for about half their annual sales and profits 
one of the hardest hit last month was penney which said its 
sales at stores open at least a year fell 63 percent from october 
1989 while overall sales dropped 49 percent 
analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year also 
known as samestore or comparable store sales provide a more 
accurate assessment of a retailers performance than overall sales 
do new stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can 
skew a retailers results 
limited the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
reported its comparable store sales dropped 1 percent as overall 
sales rose 13 percent apparel stores were also affected by 
continuing warm weather in some parts of the country 
may the parent of big department store chains including lord amp 
taylor hechts filenes and foleys said comparable store sales 
dropped 44 percent while overall sales edged up 11 percent 
sears roebuck and co the countrys largest retailer said 
comparable store sales fell 04 percent last month while overall 
sales dropped 12 percent 
but walmart stores inc continued to outperform the rest of the 
retail industry reporting comparable store sales rose 10 percent 
while overall sales rose 25 percent 
dayton hudson corp said comparable store sales rose 41 
percent while overall sales picked up 167 percent 
the results announced today differ from the monthly retail sales 
report from the government the commerce department includes sales 
from supermarkets restaurants and car dealerships in its figures

some of the investment advisers who earn a 
living touting their picks on stocks and futures deals are now 
trying their luck at handicapping the date war might break out in 
the persian gulf 
for example anytime after midnight between nov 12 and nov 22 
is the best time for an attack to occur say peter beutel and 
thomas blakeslee oil analysts with pegasus econometric group inc 
in hoboken nj 
they say their theories are rooted in military analyses coupled 
with the lunar cycle 
during the window for war picked by beutel and blakeslee 
the kuwaiti tide will be high after midnight which they say would 
help commandos get closer to a potential beachhead and the moon 
phase will keep the sky dark making it easier to storm the desert 
after weeks in which financial markets were rocked by news and 
rumors from the gulf standoff feelings that war was inevitable 
perhaps inevitably led some experts to making picks on the startup 
date 
the picks have been gushing through the investing community 
with varying amounts of credibility 
the pegasus analysts who offer advice on oil trading at the new 
york mercantile exchange have gone so far as to put their 
predictions in writing they call nov 1222 a time to play any 
short positions extremely closely if there is any military action 
expect the us to lead with its strong aerial suit 
they emphasize theyre not predicting war and dont want to 
convey the impression that theres a surefire profiteering 
opportunity they are merely saying when and how they think war 
would be most likely 
other wartime picks are not being made as boldly and some 
analysts say all of the guesswork is crazy but they are cropping 
up by the hundreds many analysts picked the days after the 
elections on tuesday with some taking coming holidays into 
account 
another theory one hears about is the weather factor said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc who emphasizes she is neither making nor touting any 
picks for a likely day that the war can begin 
theres a cloudy season that starts up an overcast season in 
february that would make it difficult to stage an air strike 
hittle said 
one stock market analyst has heard numerous wall streeters 
picking precise days for the attack say this coming sunday 
if i talk to 47 people i get 47 opinions said sara cerato 
of nomura securities international inc each of these opinions 
seems to be an excuse not to get into the stock market right now 
in the past in a bull market it paid to buy the market dips now 
it doesnt seem to be working the war seems to be the latest 
excuse to stay out 
early in the week some oil traders were picking invasion days 
between wednesday which came and went with no war and friday 
a las vegas oddsmaker said it would be possible to handicap the 
outset of war just as people handicap anything else from football 
games to movies that might win an oscar but dont count on any 
vegas sports books getting involved in war speculation 
its only legal for them to set odds on sporting events other 
oddsmaking is done only for promotional and entertainment purposes 
we put out odds on whether george steinbrenner would be banned 
from baseball said oddsmaker art manteris of the las vegas 
hilton we put out odds on whether pete rose would be admitted to 
the baseball hall of fame 
manteris said handicapping war would be a business matter not 
an entertainment matter

developer donald trump already under heavy 
pressure from his creditors must prove he can cover the monthly 
costs of his trump palace condominium before any more units are 
sold the state attorney generals office said thursday 
trump must produce evidence he can cover the common charges 
real estate taxes and other obligations on the 57story building at 
69th street and third avenue said richard barr a spokesman for 
attorney general robert abrams 
weve requested that information and were waiting to receive 
it barr said 
abrams took the action after investors complained that trump has 
withheld information about his troubled finances since they 
contracted to buy condominiums state law requires condo developers 
to reveal material changes in their finances which could 
adversely affect people in the building 
if abrams finds trump broke the law the contracts could be 
invalidated sales contracts have been signed on 77 of the 
buildings 283 condominiums 
trump in an interview with the new york times said the 
depressed manhattan real estate market has buyers looking for any 
method to break signed contracts 
this is happening at virtually every new development trump 
said and if the attorney general allows it there will never be 
another dime invested by developers or banks in new york real 
estate

itt hartford insurance group and aetna 
life amp casualty co said they plan to withdraw from various 
insurance markets in three states 
aetna is dropping personal auto and homeowners insurance in new 
mexico and idaho saying the business is unprofitable with little 
hope for much improvement 
the hartford meanwhile said it plans to withdraw from most of 
its personal auto insurance business in michigan after settling 
disputes with regulators and insurance agents in that state 
the hartford which writes only 02 percent of michigans 
personal auto insurance wants to withdraw because of financial 
losses and regulatory restraints 
eight insurance agencies sued the company saying the hartford 
would be violating their contracts by telling customers they could 
apply for insurance from another subsidiary that sells directly 
not through agents 
the agencies dropped the suit after the company agreed to make 
certain payments to agents said john c colpean an attorney 
assisting on the agents suit 
the hartford plans to withdraw five of its companies the ones 
that sell through independent agents from personal auto insurance 
and umbrella liability in michigan individuals buy umbrellas 
to protect themselves from the costs of lawsuits 
however the company plans to continue selling auto insurance 
through its hartford insurance company of the midwest which 
insures many members of the american association of retired persons 
without going through agents 
under an agreement with regulators the hartford will notify 
customers that if they cannot find insurance elsewhere they can 
apply to the hartford of the midwest 
the hartford will stop renewing auto policies expiring in 
december 
aetna which stopped selling new auto and homeowners policies 
in new mexico and idaho nov 2 said it will not renew policies in 
new mexico starting next february and in idaho in march 
the decision is the latest by aetna to improve dreary financial 
results in personal insurance lines nationwide the company had 
already dedicated itself to writing less personal auto insurance 
aetna is not a major player in personal lines in either state 
the pullout will affect 10265 existing policies in new mexico 
only 15 percent of the market said aetna spokesman sal foti 
in idaho 4140 policies will be affected idaho law will 
require aetna to keep insuring customers who cannot find coverage 
elsewhere foti said 
withdrawing from the business will allow us to devote our 
resources to other states where the opportunity for profitable 
results is better foti said 
aetna has stopped writing new personal auto policies in rhode 
island and is challenging laws in massachusetts that make it 
expensive for the company to withdraw from auto insurance there

president bush soon will sign a farm bill that 
will help put decisions on what to produce in the hands of farmers 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said thursday 
weve just gotten a pretty good farm bill that gives farmers 
more flexibility to choose which crops theyre going to plant so 
they can take advantage of opportunities as they see them not as 
someone in washington dc sees them he said 
yeutters remarks were prepared for delivery to an annual 
convention of the future farmers of america in kansas city mo 
copies of his talk were released here 
the united states also is working in the uruguay round of talks 
under the general agreement on tariffs and trade to open up world 
markets for americas farmers he said the ongoing negotiations 
are in geneva switzerland and are scheduled to conclude dec 31 
if were successful in doing so were counting on you to beat 
the pants off the competition and all america is confident you 
will yeutter told the ffa delegates 
yeutter also said young people hold the hope and the future of 
our country by deciding what to do with their lives 
decisions about education drugs voting and other activities 
will determine not only your future but the course of things to 
come for america and perhaps for the world he said 
yeutter later told the national association of farm broadcasters 
that bush believes as i do that its a solid farm bill one 
which will support the most efficient productive farmers in the 
world ours moreover its a far better bill than most american 
farmers believe 
the socalled triple base feature of the farm bill gives farmers 
the option of planting what they choose on 15 percent of their base 
crop acreage thus giving growers more leeway in making production 
and marketing decisions he said 
yeutter said the gatt talks which are aimed at liberalizing 
world trade including agricultural products are important to 
farmers for the same reason that the farm bill is important to 
them income 
in fact it means a lot more than the farm bill does he 
said 
yeutter said the farm bill is aimed at keeping us commodities 
competitive in world markets the gatt talks are directed at 
reducing export subsidies and other tradedistorting policies 
in the end he said american farmers would have greater access 
to foreign markets 
if we fail to gain access to these markets or fail to be 
competitive in them our agricultural sector will suffer 
tremendously yeutter said 
for example he added in the 1980s the european community went 
from being a net grain importer to a net grain exporter in 1976 
the community imported 30 million metric tons of wheat in 1989 
the bloc exported more than 20 million tons 
in the process the united states lost a tremendous european 
market yeutter said worse this glut of european wheat 
flooded the world market driving wheat prices and american farm 
income way way down 
yeutter added why because of marketdistorting agriculture 
supports and subsidies within the european community thats why 
were pushing so hard to get meaningful agricultural reform from 
the other major trading nations such as japan and the european 
community

the company admitted the volvo in the ad had been reinforced 
now the us hot rod association says it will conduct its own 
independent objective test friday using bearfoot the truck used 
in the ads 
the association said the test would show if a volvo can truly 
withstand the grizzly power of bearfoots 1000pound tires 
bob austin spokesman for volvo cars of north america said the 
hot rod association had excellent publicists who are spotting an 
opportunity to ride on the crest of a wave i guess volvos 
response is well see how they stand up

corrective newspaper ads and pay texas 316250 in investigative

officer said the combined operations and the close working 
relations that have already been established between the two 
companies represent an excellent platform for growth in our 
international business in the future

would make it easier for his company to establish a europeanbased 
communications group stc has been in talks with various companies 
since july about establishing a european operation

didnt merge in the six months ended july 1 stc reported a 32

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade ahead of an eagerly 
awaited government crop report amid signs that foreign demand for 
us grains is picking up 
the corn and wheat markets posted the strongest gains on 
indications that spain bought 780000 metric tons of us corn and 
on reports that the agriculture department targeted brazil for 
sales of 300000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices 
the soybean market was supported by unconfirmed rumors that the 
soviet union bought 200000 metric tons of us soybean meal 
analysts said 
export demand for us crops especially soybeans has been weak 
lately but foreign sales typically rise at this time of year after 
the corn and soybean harvest ends 
analysts said the rally also reflected booksquaring by traders 
ahead of the usdas monthly crop report 
in the report which was released after the close the usda 
raised it soybean harvest projection to 19 billion bushels from 
182 billion and lowered its corn production estimate to 794 
billion bushels from 802 billion 
analysts had expected the usda to raise the soybean number to 
about 184 billion bushels and to lower the corn estimate to about 
798 billion bushels 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 3 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 269 a bushel corn 
was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with december at 233 a bushel oats 
were cent to cent higher with december at 121 a bushel 
soybeans were cent lower to 1 cent higher with november at 583

construction workers topped the canary wharf tower 
on thursday but the developers face a tall order in filling the 
loftiest structure in britain 
the reichmanns an extremely wealthy family of landowners based 
in canada still are seeking tenants for nearly half the space in 
the flagship project of the vast and troubled docklands development 
in east london hampered by a slow economy and inconvenient 
transportation 
it is europes largest office complex and the biggest project 
ever undertaken by the reichmanns who own a vast array of 
commercial properties in north america including swathes of prime 
manhattan real estate 
i hope this marks the beginning of public acceptance for 
canary wharf said charles young executive director of the 
reichmanns olympia and york company 
construction workers hoisted a steel pyramid cap signed by 
officials and festooned with flags to the top of the skyscraper 
greenwich residents across the thames river have complained 
about the glasstipped steel obelisk designed by architect cesar 
pelli prince charles a frequent critic of postwar british 
architecture has said about canary wharf i would go mad if i 
had to work there 
at thursdays ceremony sir nigel broackes chairman of 
trafalgar house plc which fabricated the towers 27500 metric 
tons of steel said i think if christopher wren and inigo jones 
were here today they would rejoice at this achievement 
wren was the architect of st pauls cathedral the dome that 
once dominated the east london skyline jones designer of the 
queens house in greenwich introduced the palladian style to 
britain 
the 800foot 50story canary wharf tower surpassed the 600foot 
national westminster bank building located near the bank of 
england in the city of london or financial district 
the topping off shows what you can do with a little 
organization a little will and a lot of effort said michael 
dennis managing director of olympia and york canary wharf ltd 
dennis said the achievement should dispel skepticism which has 
plagued the project in the past three years 
canary wharfs final price is expected to cost 4 billion pounds 
or 78 billion 
peter marano senior vice president for leasing at olympia and 
york canary wharf said it will be about 10 months before tenants 
start moving in and we expect to be 75 to 80 percent leased by 
next may or june 
but real estate experts say the 71acre project is risky because 
of its huge size and its hardtoreach location 
in the 10year view it will be a profitable investment said 
nan rogers a real estate analyst with the london investment firm 
james capel amp co in the meantime theyre having a lot of trouble 
getting tenants in because of the transportation 
it will be years before the areas docklands light railway 
which can carry 4000 people an hour will be upgraded enough to 
handle the flow of people who will work at canary wharf she said 
a collapse of london real estate market because of high interest 
rates now running at 14 percent and a slowing economy have 
hampered the docklands development 
questions were raised about canary wharf when the reichmanns 
announced in september that they planned to sell 20 percent of 
their extensive us properties but olympia and york officials 
said the sale had nothing to do with the project and expressed 
satisfaction with the progress on tenants and on longterm 
financing

american telephone amp telegraph co and ncr corp 
are discussing combining their computer businesses according to a 
report published thursday both companies said they had no comment 
the wall street journal quoted individuals familiar with the 
talks as saying they are uncertain what form the combination could 
take and cautioned that nothing may come of the discussions the 
journal did not identify its sources 
the report said the companies have been holding discussions for 
more than a month and have explored several scenarios 
one would have atampt acquire ncr outright the story said while 
another could involve a spinoff of atampts computer business to ncr 
with atampt taking an equity stake in the combined operation 
the journal said the first scenario seems more likely because 
atampt has long coveted ncr while a spinoff may be seen as a defeat 
for the telecommunications powerhouse 
atampt spokeman walter murphy said the company never comments on 
such speculation spokeswoman connie olasz at ncrs heradquarters 
in dayton ohio said her company also had no comment 
charles nichols an independent industry analyst who follows 
atampt said there have been reports for several years that the phone 
company was interested in acquiring a computer company ncr and 
unisys corp have been among the names mentioned he said 
an ncratampt computer venture would make sense because it would 
combine atampts strengths in networked computers and 
telecommunications with ncrs strong customer base in the retail 
industry where such skills are needed nichols said 
he said he believed the least likely scenario would be for atampt 
to buy ncr outright a more likely arrangement would be for the two 
companies to enter into a joint computer venture or for atampt to 
buy a stake in ncr 
atampt has cooperative ventures with several computer companies 
including sun microsystems inc atampt owns about 20 percent of suns 
stock 
atampts computer business is small compared with industry 
leaders but it has achieved success in the past few years in 
selling computers to the federal government it also recently 
landed several major commercial contracts including one with 
american airlines nichols said 
ncr the nations fifth largest computer company launched a 
major revamping of its computer line this fall under which it will 
base all its machines on industry standards and intel corp 
microprocessors getting rid of its proprietary computer lines 
ncr also is a major maker of automated teller machines and cash 
registers 
atampt generates 36 billion in revenue annually overall while 
ncr had revenue of about 6 billion last year

groupe bull frances stateowned computer maker 
with extensive us operations said thursday it would eliminate 
more than 10 percent of its work force due to a crisis facing 
the world computer industry 
bull said it would slash 5000 jobs including up to 1000 in 
massachusetts where it has extensive operations and its us 
headquarters and 250 in phoenix 
bull also projected it would lose 288 billion francs or about 
511 million this year 
the steps are part of a longawaited reorganization that also 
will include unspecified plant closings bull said the plan is 
aimed at helping the company turn a profit by 1992 
bull said in a statement it was trying to refocus its resources 
to confront the worldwide crisis facing the information systems 
industry 
growth in the industry has slowed in recent years from its 
previous clip of 30 percent or more a year 
bull which employs about 47000 people worldwide already laid 
off 2000 workers during 1989 and 3000 more so far this year 
bulls us operations include the former honeywell computer 
units as well as zenith data systems corp a maker of personal 
computers 
under a new corporate structure bull hn the companys 
usbased subsidiary will take control of all groupe bull 
operations in the far east the company also plans to consolidate 
its european operations outside of france 
analysts said bull has been hurt by shifts in the marketplace 
customers increasingly are demanding open computer systems that 
allow machines from different companies to work together 
bull has moved into this market with computers based on the 
popular unix operating system but profit margins for these 
machines are smaller than on traditional proprietary models 
as a result bull spokesman edward russell said administrative 
and sales costs have had to be cut 
the company said it would implement an early retirement plan for 
its us workers but it said the job reductions would include 
layoffs 
bull plans to eliminate at least 20 percent of the 2050 jobs at 
its us headquarters in billerica north of boston the company 
also said it will cut its payroll at three other massachusetts 
facilities 
aside from the cuts in massachusetts and phoenix the company 
plans to eliminate 350 other jobs at field locations in the united 
states 
in addition bull plans to cut about 170 jobs at zenith data 
systems which is based outside chicago and up to 100 jobs in 
canada 
the company stressed that it also was investing in longterm 
research to develop new products 
this year other computer companies including digital equipment 
corp unisys corp data general corp and wang laboratories inc 
have reduced their payrolls either through layoffs or voluntary 
measures 
in france labor leaders said they would protest the cutbacks 
jeanfrancois bolzinger an administrator of the leftist general 
confederation of labor said 1100 of the jobs targeted for 
elimination were in france bolzinger contended that bull 
overestimated its losses to create psychological shock among 
the work force 
on oct 25 europes largest electronics and computer company 
nv philips of the netherlands announced plans to cut 45000 jobs 
from its worldwide payroll of 285000

chrysler corp workers on a threeyear contract with the united 
auto workers union 
the voting period opened wednesday and results must be reported 
to the uaws headquarters in detroit by nov 18 the union said it 
would not issue partial results 
balloting at one of chryslers most profitable factories a 
minivan assembly plant in st louis wont be held until nov 17 
however a union official said thursday 
a special part of the uawchrysler contract deals just with the 
minivan plant and officials said more time was needed to give 
details to the workers under the special provision workers would 
change from two production shifts to three 
officials expect chrysler workers nationwide to ratify the pact 
and close the final chapter of this years uawbig three 
negotiations 
uaw contracts with general motors corp and ford motor co were 
ratified by ratios of better than 4to1 terms of the chrysleruaw 
contract are essentially the same as the contracts the union signed 
last month with gm and ford 
in all more than 450000 active auto workers are covered by 
uawnegotiated agreements with the big three 
the st louis factory is one of two chrysler plants making one 
of its most profitable vehicles the other is in windsor ontario 
chrysler which as recently as the mid1980s sold more minivans 
than all other automakers combined needs the extra supply to fight

officials in new york and massachusetts took 
legal action thursday to bar the sale of two junkbond mutual funds 
that allegedly duped 270000 investors many of very modest 
means with tricky sales pitches 
first investors a large mutual fund company targeted in the 
suit denied the charges which included scripted and misleading 
sales pitches by aggressive representatives seeking to sign up 
investors in their own living rooms 
the company said in a statement it will vigorously defend 
itself and is confident it will prevail 
the action capped a 15month undercover investigation by the two 
states into what new york attorney general robert abrams called 
fraudulent selling techniques employed by two of the largest junk 
funds in the mutualfund industry 
abrams filed suit in state supreme court massachusetts 
secretary of state michael connolly filed an administrative 
complaint and will conduct a hearing into the alleged fraud which 
dates back to 1985 several other states are considering legal 
action 
the two manhattanbased funds are first investors fund for 
income inc with assets of 971 million as of june 30 and first 
investors high yield fund inc which had assets of 640 million at 
that time 
an estimated 90 percent of those assets were in junk bonds the 
risky ious peddled by hundreds of companies for takeovers or 
expansion during the 1980s but over the past year the junkbond 
market has collapsed making these investments worth much less 
named in the suit are first investors consolidated corp and its 
subsidiaries first investors corp and first investors management 
co along with a number of executives 
abrams said in a press release that first investors offered 
false assurances that the funds were safe and that the bonds were 
guaranteed at a high rate of return investors were unaware he 
contended that they were going into the riskiest sector of the 
bond market 
abrams said the funds were sold primarily in peoples homes by 
aggressive salespeople using a prepared script which greatly 
misrepresented the risks involved 
they preyed upon investors who were unsophisticated many 
victims were of very modest means and could ill afford their 
losses he said 
the funds offered an installment plan for as little as 50 a 
month in an effort to entice investors with little or no 
savings 
the undercover operation included investigators posing as 
potential investors abrams said audiotape evidence of the sales 
pitch and evidence of such salespersonclient interactions 
would be introduced in court 
first investors said in its statement that it has conducted 
business according to the rules and guidelines set forth by 
regulatory bodies the company noted that the lawsuits are 
limited to the sales of two of its 25 mutual funds 
first investors performed in the bottom 10 percent of junkbond 
funds in rate of total return abrams said in the last 16 months 
the funds net asset value has plummeted 35 percent 
this lawsuit seeks to end the deceptive practices we uncovered 
and to gain restitution for those defrauded abrams said 
the suit also named david grayson and glenn o head president 
and chairman of the corporations as well as howard froman and 
alvin blumenfeld senior vice president of first investors corp 
new york and massachusetts residents comprise more than 30 
percent of the investors in both funds

the stock market made little progress today in a 
bid to rally after wednesdays broad loss 
interest rates held steady in the government bond market through 
the completion today of a threeday quarterly auction of treasury 
securities 
analysts said investors remained hopeful that the federal 
reserve would take further steps before long to relax its credit 
policy 
one assumed precondition for a more stimulative fed policy is a 
reduction in inflationary pressures especially in oil prices 
a bit of encouragement on that score is expected friday when the

mampmmars has introduced a peanut butter mampm 
to cash in on what analysts say is a booming demand for the 
palateclinging product 
the newest version of the familiar mampm consists of a creamy 
peanut butter center covered by a layer of milk chocolate and 
wrapped in the famous candycoated outer shell 
it can be bought only on the west coast because of limited 
production capacity said bill deeter a spokesman for mampmmars a 
division of mars inc he declined to predict when it would be 
widely available 
were rolling it out as we have the capacity to supply 
deeter said in a telephone interview from his office in 
hackettstown 35 miles west of newark 
deeter denied that the popularity of reeses pieces hershey 
foods peanut butter candy had fueled mampmmars marketing 
strategy 
mars makes up its mind based on where it sees its 
opportunities and consumer appetites deeter said this was the 
logical next step for the product 
industry analysts said the new product which was rolled out in 
september underscores an insatiable appetite in the united states 
for peanut butter 
earlier this year mampmmars added peanut butter to its popular 
snickers candy bar and also rolled out pb max another peanut 
butter confection that the industry sees as a competitor to reeses 
peanut butter cups 
peanut butter sales are increasing in america said 
marketing consultant phil lempert of montclair he noted the 
addition of chocolate chip and cinnamon raisin peanut butters on 
the supermarket shelf next to creamy and crunchy styles 
this is just one of a number of products that mars has 
introduced with peanut butter aimed at slowing down reeses and 
gaining a foothold in this growing category said john mcmillin 
a food industry analyst with prudential bache in new york 
hershey foods reeses cups are the second most popular candy in 
the united states after mampmmars snickers bars analysts said 
mcmillin noted that the reeses product line was boosted after 
reeses pieces were used to lure a shy alien in the movie et 
the extraterrestrial 
the sales gap between the top two candies however has been 
narrowed considerably in the past few years with snickers bringing 
in revenues of 129 million in 1989 compared with 105 million for 
reeses cups mcmillin said 
snickers used to be way out in front he said and mars 
wants to maintain its lead 
hershey based in hershey pa controls about 44 percent of the 
5 billion chocolate candy market compared with mars 38 percent 
mcmillin said 
the peanut butterenhanced mampm which marks the first new mampm 
flavor since the peanut variety was introduced in 1954 will boost 
an already successful product line 
peanut mampms are the third bestselling candy in the united 
states with 102 million in sales followed by mampms plain with 83 
million in revenue analysts said 
ironically mcmillin noted mampmmars chose to launch its new 
peanut butterheavy product line in the midst of a severe peanut 
drought in georgia that has driven up the price of peanuts 
deeter said the peanut drought would have little effect because 
commodity buying is done years in advance

the outlook for the christmas shopping season went from bad to 
worse thursday as the nations biggest retailers reported dismal 
sales results for the month of october 
several companies including sears roebuck amp co and jc penney 
co inc said sales dropped from levels of a year earlier as 
consumers with one eye on the economy and the other on the middle 
east avoided buying anything they didnt need 
with christmas less than seven weeks away neither the retailers 
nor the industry analysts who track their performance expect 
consumers to suddenly shift gears and go on mammoth giftbuying 
sprees 
the 1990 holiday season will be a much more frugal 
christmas predicted thomas tashjian an analyst with seidler 
amdec securities inc in los angeles 
theyll probaby be going in and buying the same number of 
items but theyre not going to pay as much tashjian said 
theyre not going to buy 100 electronic toys for their kids not 
this year 
the poor october sales coming in the aftermath of disappointing 
showings in august and september reflected a recessionary 
psychology among consumers said jeffrey feiner an analyst with 
merrill lynch amp co 
consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait raised the specter of war inflating 
prices of gasoline andhome heating oil 
the first items crossed off shopping lists were socalled 
discretionary items clothing furniture and other extras that are 
the bread and butter of many big stores 
if retailers have a difficult christmas it could contribute to 
a further deterioration of the economy since twothirds of the 
nations economic growth is generated consumer spending 
unsold goods on store shelves could also affect manufacturing 
if stores dont place new orders factories dont need to provide 
as many products and could lay off workers 
a poor christmas season could be devastating for the retailers 
themselves as they depend on holiday shopping for about half their 
annual sales and profits christmas 1989 was a disappointment for 
many storeowners after they were forced to slash prices to attract 
customers 
sears the countrys largest retailer said results from stores 
open at least one year fell 04 percent last month from october 
1989 while overall sales dropped 12 percent 
analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year also 
known as samestore or comparable store sales provide a more 
accurate assessment of a retailers performance than overall sales 
do new stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can 
skew a retailers results 
one of the hardest hit last month was penney which said 
comparable store sales fell 63 percent from october 1989 while 
overall sales dropped 49 percent 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
reported comparable store sales dropped 1 percent as overall sales 
rose 13 percent apparel stores were also affected by continuing 
warm weather in some parts of the country 
may department stores co parent of big department store chains 
including lord amp taylor hechts filenes and foleys said 
comparable store sales dropped 44 percent while overall sales 
edged up 11 percent 
but walmart stores inc one of the biggest discount retailers 
continued to outperform the rest of the retail industry reporting 
comparable store sales rose 10 percent while overall sales rose 25 
percent 
analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores 
especially those going into the christmas season with high 
inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales these retailers are 
expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise and see 
their profits evaporate 
markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers having seen 
one round of price reductions wait for more merchandise to be 
marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts when 
one retailer lowers prices it pressures others to follow 
feiner the merrill lynch analyst noting that christmas 1989 
sales were hurt by markdowns issued this warning about another 
disappointing season the end result could be further 
bankruptcies andor consolidations in the industry 
several retailers notably federated department stores inc and 
allied stores corp filed for bankruptcy court protection during 
this past year 
among other reports from retailers thursday 
dayton hudson corp said comparable store sales rose 41 
percent while overall sales picked up 167 percent 
kmart corp reported a 13 percent sales gain at comparable 
stores and an 112 percent rise overall 
woolworth corp said comparable store sales increased 1 
percent while overall sales rose 42 percent 
the results announced thursday differ from the monthly retail 
sales report from the government the commerce departments figures 
includes sales from supermarkets restaurants and car dealers

attractive to europeans because it would make us imports more 
expensive for consumers overseas

also helped the dollar recover to its session highs said john 
mccarthy chief dealer at amsterdam rotterdam bank in new york the 
dollar is considered a safe haven in times of global turmoil 
the dollars biggest advance came against the japanese yen 
which has been pushed lower because of overall disappointment with 
the decline in the japanese stock market and an uncertain political

fired 50 operations personnel

oil prices rallied in a wild session in the 
petroleum market thursday dropping early then surging on a correct 
hunch by traders that president bush would increase military 
pressure on iraqs saddam hussein 
after the market closed however traders said they may have 
overestimated the gravity of bushs move 
crude oil dropped about 1 per barrel in early trading but 
finished the day with a 22 cent gain closing at 3553 per barrel 
for december delivery contracts on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
bush told washington reporters he was building up the us 
military force in the persian gulf to provide for an adequate 
offensive option that could drive iraq from kuwait 
administration officials had previously indicated they would 
send more troops some traders said thursday evening they had 
perhaps overreacted to their nervousness over what bush would say 
i didnt hear anything new said brian tagler a broker with 
shearson lehman brothers inc i think that the market definitely 
pushed itself higher than it would have on what we know now 
analysts said the market got scared in the afternoon when 
traders learned a white house news conference on foreign policy 
originally scheduled to take place during the trading session had 
been delayed until after the exchange would be closed tension 
built as traders learned the news conference was again delayed 
until after the stock markets closing bell 
oil prices probably would have stayed lower for the day if bush 
had made his statements while trading was still going on analysts 
said 
the sharp rally had been driven in part by a rumor said to have 
floated in from the bond market that bush had been prepared to 
announce plans to airlift supplies into the us embassy in kuwait 
where diplomats have been surviving for weeks on scanty provisions 
traders believed such a scenario could provide the confrontation 
that would trigger war in the persian gulf 
others put no faith in the rumor saying it had cropped up 
before 
this is the second time ive heard it in a week said trader 
ed kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc its like the saddam 
has been shot rumors 
some tense traders also believed bush would give iraq a deadline 
for getting out of kuwait which bush did not do 
oil prices also strengthened partly on news that the soviet 
union was refusing to rule out the use of force against iraq which 
has for years had close ties to moscow 
other energy futures moved higher as traders waited on bush but 
for the day they finished mixed 
home heating oil prices moved higher with december delivery 
contracts rising 159 cents to 9430 cents a gallon and all later 
contract months closing higher unleaded gasoline fell 68 cent to 
9051 on december delivery contracts but later contract months 
were all higher 
natural gas prices were either down or unchanged for the day 
december delivery contracts dropped 15 cents to 2435 per 1000 
cubic feet

publishing and broadcasting powerhouse hearst 
corp has purchased the 20 percent stake that rjr nabisco inc held 
for seven years in the sports cable television service espn inc 
it was announced thursday 
terms were not disclosed but people familiar with the deal said 
the price was less than 180 million 
the deal forges another link between hearst and capital 
citiesabc inc which owns 80 percent of espn and is hearsts 
partner in two other cable channels its a happy situation for 
both of them said media analyst john reidy of smith barney 
harris upham inc 
rjr nabisco the food and tobacco giant taken private last year 
in the biggest debtfinanced takeover on record hired an 
investment banker 15 months ago to help it decide whether to sell 
the espn stake 
capital citiesabc had the right to match any offer for rjrs 
interest in espn but had little to gain from buying the minority 
interest itself 
speculation quickly centered on hearst as a potential buyer of 
the espn stake hearst and capital citiesabc have a long 
association they each have equity stakes in the lifetime and arts 
amp entertainmnet cable channels five of hearsts six tv stations 
are abc network affiliates 
in addition capital citiesabc was responsible for running the 
operation under a shareholder agreement that left little to do for 
the minority shareholder 
it it were any other company than capital citiesabc hearst 
would not be nearly as interested said raymond e joslin head 
of the hearst entertainment and syndication group 
he said hearst hopes to benefit however from the maturation of 
the cable television business and the prospect that cable tv 
networks will soon be able to charge nearly as much for advertising 
as broadcast networks 
espn is is the largest cable tv programming service in the 
united states with more than 57 million cable tv subscribers or 
about 60 percent of us homes with television 
it offers coverage of professional and amateur sports events as 
well as sports news and lifestyle programs 
industry insiders said espn had operating income of about 135 
million on revenues of 390 million in 1989 it is expected that 
operating income will fall this year because of losses estimated at 
about 30 million on the cable networks first year under a 
fouryear contract to cover major league baseball 
while declining to comment on the financial figures joslin said 
hearst expects that espn will make a small profit over the life of 
the baseball contract the contract permits espn to carry 175 
regular season games a year 
rjr nabisco swallowed up in a 245 billion buyout by the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in early 1989 sold 
assets to trim its debt 
jason wright a spokesman for rjr said the sale of the espn 
stake was not required under any of the companys debt covenants 
but he said the company felt it should sell the stake because it 
was outside its core business areas 
he said no decision has been made yet on what will be done with 
the proceeds of the sale he said rjrs debt is expected to fall to 
20 billion by the end of the year down from 28 billion at the 
time of the buyout 
he said there were numerous expressions of interest in the 
espn stake but declined to say how many companies made bids 
the deal expands the cable television interests at hearst a 
privately held company with major operations in magazines 
newsapapers and book publishing 
earlier this month hearst announced formation of new england 
cable newschannel an allnews cable network for the new england 
region its partner in that deal is continental cablevision inc 
hearst is also a partner with the french paytv network canal 
plus in ellipse programme a french production company specializing 
in game shows madefortv movies animated programs and 
documentaries

consumers can be misled by some green 
marketing according to 10 state attorneys general who called 
thursday for national guidelines for environmental marketing 
claims 
consumers who want to purchase products that are good for the 
environment should not become innocent victims of greencollar 
fraud new york attorney general robert abrams said 
manufacturers should not be allowed to cash in on the publics 
concern for the environment by making false and unsubstantiated 
claims 
uniform definitions for such words as recycled 
compostable and degradable would give businesses parameters 
and make sure consumers get what they pay for according to the 
attorneys general task force set up last november to review 
environmental advertising 
in a report released thursday the group urged the federal trade 
commission and the environmental protection agency to work with 
states businesses and consumer groups to set the standards 
the report also recommended testing procedures and standards 
for determining whether a product meets a particular definition 
the task force said environmental claims should be as specific 
as possible and avoid overly broad or vague terms like 
environmentally friendly or safe for the environment 
generalized environmental claims may create an unwrranted 
impression that a product is good for the environment in all 
respects the report said 
and because the word recycled does not provide consumers 
with enough information to compare products meaningfully the 
attorneys general suggested the percentage of recycled material 
used in the product be listed 
the 40page report also said claims that a product is degradable 
or recyclable should not be made unless that particular disposal 
option is available in the area where the product is sold 
some businesses were particularly upset with that suggestion 
saying it would not be feasible for national marketers 
pressure from consumer groups and state agencies has recently 
resulted in advertising changes for several products 
first brands and mobil chemical corp agreed in june to drop a 
claim that its glad and hefty trash bags were degradable after the 
texas attorney general filed a lawsuit 
last month american enviro products inc of placentia calif 
agreed to stop promoting its bunnies disposal diapers as 
biodegradable after attorney generals in 10 states threatened to 
sue 
the attorneys general urged other companies to modify their 
environmental marketing claims in light of the above 
recommendations 
those involved in the task force include the attorney generals 
from california florida massachusetts minnesota missouri new 
york texas utah washington and wisconsin 
state and federal officials will hold public hearings on the 
recommendations in san diego dec 10 and 11

keawaula hawaii at a cost of 199 million the seven applicants 
will contribute an estimated 1565 million to the project which 
should be ready for service by early 1993 the fcc said it will 
have twice the capacity of the existing undersea cable 
the pacrimeast cable will connect takapuna new zealand and 
keawaula hawaii it will cost 2796 million with the seven

the government on thursday 
returned to private ownership the telephone company it nationalized 
42 years ago 
european and us investors agreed to pay about 134 billion 
for 60 percent of the empresa nacional de telecomunicaciones or 
entel the privatization is one of the largest in latin american 
history 
the contracts were signed thursday night by president carlos 
menem who wants to privatize public companies to reduce the role 
of the state in argentinas economy 
another privatization the sale of aerolineas argentinas may be 
completed within a month the spanish carrier iberia has offered to 
buy it 
a group of investors led by spains phone company telefonica and 
usbased citibank won the bid for entels southern operations 
the consortium agreed to pay 114 million in cash and 202 million 
in notes and to retire 27 billion in argentinas foreign debt 
in return for a sevenyear lease 
italian and french phone companies along with usbased jp 
morgan bank were awarded entels northern operations that group 
agreed to pay 100 million in cash and 178 million in notes and 
to retire 23 billion in argentinas foreign debt 
with the sale the government rids itself of a company that lost 
about 250 million last year the government has no money to 
upgrade entels infrastructure and services that are in 
collapse said director maria julia alsogaray 
investors hope that by increasing the number of lines by 
onethird within six years and lowering costs by trimming staff 
and modernizing equipment the two regional companies will be 
profitable 
consumers view the sale with hope and dread service seems bound 
to improve but rates may be unaffordably high 
the current rate of about 5 us cents per pulse is one of the 
highest in the world analysts say a pulse is a unit of time that 
varies according to the distance of the call and the time of day it 
is made 
however for many argentines the sale of entel may be the only 
way to get phone service at any price 
as many as one of every seven lines may be out of service at any 
moment and repairs can take months some argentines wait years for 
a line or pay several thousand dollars for one

the british pharmaceutical maker smithkline 
beecham on thursday reported its pretax earnings rose 30 percent 
in the third quarter paced largely by us sales of its antiacne 
and antacid products 
smithkline reported pretax earnings of 218 million pounds 
compared with earnings of 168 million pounds in the same period a 
year earlier the earnings were worth 408 million when the quarter 
ended on sept 30 but the percentage increase in dollars would 
likely have varied because of fluctuating exchange rates 
sales from continuing operations were 108 billion pounds a 3 
percent decrease from 111 billion pounds in the 1989 period 
the company attributed the decrease to exchange rate 
fluctuations especially the weakening us dollar 
the main rise in profits came in the consumer brands sector 
which reported a 53 percent increase from the same period of 1989 
sales of overthecounter drugs were led in the united states by 
its oxy antiacne products which increased 15 percent and tums 
antacid which increased 30 percent 
for the first nine months the company had pretax profits of 
634 million pounds 8 percent higher than the 588 million pounds 
earned a for the period a year earlier

standard amp poors corp filed a lawsuit charging 
the chicago board options exchange with violating a 1983 licensing 
agreement for use of two widely known measures of stock market 
activity 
the lawsuit filed wednesday in manhattan federal court claims 
the cboe wrongly asserted an exclusive right to use the sampp 100 
index and sampp 500 index on financial products other than options 
contracts traded on the exchange 
the cboe on thursday denied it had breached the agreement 
in a statement cboe general counsel nancy r crossman said the 
exchange believes the licensing agreement gives it the exclusive 
right to use the indexes in connection with the trading of 
securities options 
the cboe has always met all of its obligations under the 
license agreement and has never breached the agreement since its 
inception the statement said 
the sampp 100 index and sampp 500 index measure stock performance 
and are traded in units on the nations major options exchanges 
options give an investor the right to buy or sell a security at a 
specified time for a specific price 
sampp said its license limits the cboe to options contracts on the 
two indexes that are traded on a securities exchange and settled 
through an established clearing house by payment of cash or the 
underlying security 
sampp said the cboes rights do not apply to other financial 
instruments that offer a return based in whole or part on the two 
indexes those include notes certificates of deposit and other 
debt instruments products that trade over the counter and 
financial instruments issued by institutions other than an 
exchange 
the lawsuit asked the court to terminate the license with the 
cboe on dec 7 or to rule that the agreement does not extend to 
financial instruments other than exchangetraded stock options as 
defined in the agreement 
sampp a subsidiary of mcgrawhill inc said the withdrawal of a 
note offering for denmark because of the dispute has caused the 
firm severe harm to its reputation and impairment of its 
licensing business 
sampp a financial information and credit rating agency for 
several years has licensed the rights to use its indexes in 
connection with financial products sold off of exchanges

rupert murdoch said thursday he was horrified by 
the rising violence in new york which the media baron blamed 
partly on what he called the shortcomings of the citys 
unioncontrolled newspapers 
murdoch chief executive of the worldwide media empire news 
corp also called the citys newspaper unions currently on strike 
against the daily news the worlds worst since the demise of the 
british newspaper unions which his company broke in a bitter labor 
struggle in the mid 1980s 
the truth is ladies and gentlemen that the crime problem in 
new york is quite simply horrible in fact it seems to be 
unprecedented in american history murdoch said in a speech at 
new york university its certainly worse than the wild west 
in that lawless era he said gunfighters generally shot each 
other crimes like murder almost never affected innocent people 
and crimes like robbery and rape were far more infrequent than 
today 
he said the citys press was to some extent responsible because 
the medias inibitions about reporting the crime wave resulted in 
a sort of false consciousness among the public 
murdoch one of the worlds wealthiest men maintains several 
homes including a penthouse overlooking manhattans central park 
his company owns several newspapers magazines and television 
operations around the world mainly in the united states britain 
and australia 
in addition news corp is parent of the fox broadcasting co a 
national programming service for independent tv stations and has 
extensive interests in book publishing activities 
murdoch owned the new york post from 1976 to 1988 his company 
still owns wnyw a local new york fox tv channel 
when murdoch ran the post he was regularly denounced for what 
critics called overly sensational coverage of brutal crimes that 
appealed to the publics base passion 
i dont agree that i took it too far downmarket murdoch 
told his audience thursday i think i didnt take it downmarket 
far enough 
regarding the citys powerful newspaper unions which have been 
striking the posts rival tabloid the news since last month 
murdoch called them one of the obstacles to better newspaper 
operations and journalism in the city 
as you will know in 1986 i took on the printing unions in 
britain the worlds worst and broke them he said the result 
has been a silver age for british journalism newly prosperous 
papers and wholly new papers 
with the demise of those unions he said the new york city 
unions have succeeded to the distinction of being the worlds 
worst 
murdoch was the guest speaker at the ninth chet huntley memorial 
lecture named after the late television journalist

the dollar rose against the yen friday morning 
following president bushs announcement that he is sending more 
troops to the middle east stock prices fell continuing a slide 
that began tuesday 
the dollar was changing hands at 13038 yen at late morning it 
opened at 13045 yen up 095 yen from thursdays close and ranged 
between 13030 yen and 131 yen during early trading 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 34623 points or 151 
percent ending the morning session at 2262358 the index lost 
53044 points thursday 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bond fell to 8394 points from thursdays 
8426point finish its yield was higher at 7950 percent from 
7875 percent 
stock traders said the nikkei fell quickly with the majority of 
investors avoiding buying shares because of increasing tensions in 
the middle east 
the declining yen and the government bond prices resulting from 
investors fears about the gulf also accelerated the nikkeis 
plunge a trader with nomura securities co said on condition of 
anonymity 
nobody was interested in buying japanese institutional 
investors as well as foreign investors are all sitting on the 
sidelines he said 
the nomura trader said political uncertainties resulting from 
the governments lack of leadership in deciding japans role in the 
gulf made investors reluctant to trade 
amid worries over the increasing tensions in the middle east 
japanese currency investors bought the dollar up to the 131yen 
level on short covering before the start of a threeday weekend in 
tokyo dealers said japanese financial markets will be closed on 
monday for a national holiday commemorating the emperor akihitos 
enthronement 
war in the middle east would likely drive the price of oil 
sharply higher the dollar normally rises with oil prices because 
crude is bought and sold in dollars also the currency 
traditionally has been viewed as a safe haven in times of 
international turmoil 
as long as the middle east crisis continues the dollars 
plunge will be prevented said katsumi oshima a researcher at 
sanyo securities co 
but oshima said the dollars recent upswing is the result of 
adjustments by investors who had overbought the yen 
overall market conditions still favor a stronger yen because 
the us economy is definitely headed toward a recession he 
said
