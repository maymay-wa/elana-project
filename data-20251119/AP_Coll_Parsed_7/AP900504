a federal jury decided friday that a 
businessman wasnt lying when he said reaganbush campaign 
officials asked iranians not to free american hostages until after 
the 1980 presidential election 
the jury acquitted richard j brenneke of five counts of false 
declaration to a federal judge in denver when he made statements 
describing an alleged 1980 meeting in paris at which he said the 
request about the hostages was made 
one of the counts involved brennekes general description of the 
meeting he also was found innocent of making false declarations 
when he said the meeting was attended by the late cia director 
william casey and by donald gregg now us ambassador to south 
korea and that he and fellow businessman heinrich rupp both worked 
for the cia 
brenneke was not charged in connection with his statement to the 
judge that rupp flew george bush to paris in 1980 brenneke 
testified thursday that bush who was elected vice president later 
that year was not at the meeting he attended and he did not see 
him in paris 
the unanimous verdict was announced at 510 pm after five 
hours of deliberation brenneke was embraced by his attorney 
michael scott and the two men clasped hands 
outside the courtroom a smiling brenneke said we told the 
truth we told the truth all along and by god it was believed 
brenneke was indicted on the false declaration charges after he 
appeared in 1988 as a character witness for rupp who was being 
sentenced for bank fraud in denver 
in his statements to the judge brenneke portrayed rupp as a 
friend with whom he worked in southeast asia for the cia 
proprietary air america he told the judge that he and rupp had 
helped arrange the clandestine paris trip 
brenneke said there were three meetings about the hostages on 
oct 19 and 20 at the hotel florida and hotel crillion in paris 
brenneke told the denver judge he attended one meeting at the hotel 
florida 
under federal law false declaration to a judge is a stronger 
charge than perjury which can involve lies to either a judge or 
jury 
the trial was originally to have been held in denver but was 
moved to portland near brennekes home in west linn after he had 
open heart surgery 
in his closing arguments friday assistant us attorney thomas 
m orourke dismissed as a fabrication brennekes description of 
the secret meeting and its purpose to sabotage president carters 
reelection campaign by delaying the hostage release 
orourke also said brenneke had lied when he said he worked for 
the cia and when he said those present at the paris meeting 
included casey who was reagans campaign manager and gregg who 
was also a cia official assigned to president carters national 
security council staff 
iran released the hostages it seized on nov 4 1979 on the day 
bush and reagan were sworn into office jan 20 1981 
brennekes defense had been built around the contention that the 
government would lie to cover its tracks in covert operations and 
that brenneke worked for the cia and the agency wants to keep that 
secret

pope john paul ii is making another trip to 
latin america where the roman catholic church has changed 
dramatically in the 11 years since he first outlined his vision of 
its role 
the nineday visit to mexico starting sunday will underline 
the changes since 1979 when john paul set the tone of his papacy 
toward church activism in the overwhelmingly roman catholic region 
maintain your commitment to the poor the pope told his bishops 
in puebla mexico but do not become partisan politicians 
in the ensuing years the church has assumed a greater role in 
social and economic affairs and gained broader prestige in latin 
america but divisions have emerged between liberal and 
conservative clergy 
from without the church is increasingly threatened by the 
aggressive proselytizing of evangelical protestant churches 
it is challenged by the dramatic growth of poverty in a region 
of vital concern to the vatican this is john pauls 10th trip to 
latin america and he also plans to visit cuba perhaps in december 
latin americans make up nearly half the worlds 850 million 
catholics the latin church has influenced catholicism worldwide 
with its bold efforts to adapt the gospel to third world societies 
liberation theology which links spiritual freedom to liberation 
from economic and social oppression was born in latin ameria john 
paul has sought to blunt the philosophys effect 
certainly what i feel in the last few years is what we feel a 
little in the universal church it is a moment of what some call 
conservatism said the rev irineu wilges a brazilian who is the 
franciscan orders counselor for latin america 
despite that conservatism the latin american church leadership 
has transformed itself 
cardinals and bishops once close to the ruling minority began 
condemning political repression in the 1970s when brutal 
dictatorships were common frequently the church was the only 
institution strong enough to stand up to the government 
catholic officials who specialize in latin america say the 
church leadership has extended its political role in three ways 
encouraging the establishment of democracy particularly in 
brazil and chile 
serving as a mediator between the government and guerrillas 
as in nicaragua and el salvador 
speaking out on problems facing new fragile democracies such 
as land reform foreign debt and the rights of native indians 
those actions reflect the churchs widespread credibility in 
latin america and its effort to grow closer to the poor 
the people have much more faith in the church than they did 10 
years ago said the rev jose luis castaneda a peruvian who is 
the jesuit orders regional assistant for south america i dont 
know if its the merit of the church or the disasters of the 
politicians 
john paul has supported the latin churchs option for the 
poor declared at a 1968 conference of bishops in medellin 
colombia 
on trips to the region the pope has assailed dictatorship 
highlighted the foreign debt problem and defended labor unions he 
also has condemned liberation theology that uses marxist analysis 
and warned clerics to stay out of politics 
action has accompanied his words particuarly in brazil whose 
bishops have encouraged liberation theology brazil has about 
100000 ecclesiastical base communities churchsponsored 
groups that press for political and social change 
the vatican promoted conservatives in brazil which has moved 
the bishops conference to a more centrist position 
in 1985 it ordered the rev leonardo boff brazils most 
prominent progressive theologian to maintain obedient silence 
for a year 
last year the vatican divided the paolo archdiocese of another 
progressive cardinal paulo evaristo arns into five smaller 
dioceses seriously diminishing his influence 
it isnt that some people are for helping the poor and some 
are against wilges said the church is divided over how to do 
it 
divisions between liberals and progressives have deepened 
because of the actions in brazil and similar ones in other 
countries 
last year the vatican ignored the choice of the organizations 
own leadership in choosing a new secretarygeneral of the latin 
american confederation of religious prompting an outcry from 
priests and nuns 
religious orders account for about 80 percent of the priests and 
nuns in latin america their members tend to be more liberal than 
diocesan clergy and bishops 
the vatican acted after the confederation introduced a 
biblestudy program for members that the congregation for the 
doctrine of the faith condemned as too ideological 
whatever the internal problems many church officials say latin 
american catholicisms greatest challenge is from conservative 
evangelical churches on the outside 
noncatholics in the region now number more than 30 million the 
latin american bishops conference says 
in mexico the number of protestants grew more than 500 percent 
in 19501980 to 22 million according to church figures in some 
mexican states up to 20 percent of the people are believed to be 
noncatholic 
some catholic officials contend the churchs approach to faith 
has been too political or intellectual others claim the 
evangelical churches receive money from the us government or 
businesses hoping to hinder church efforts for social change 
officials say greater poverty and evergrowing urban slums 
create serious problems for the church in spreading its message 
activism on behalf of the poor continues to exact a price as shown 
by the murder of six jesuits by salvadoran soldiers in november 
the standard of living is lamentably regressive bishop 
dario castrillon hoyos president of the bishops conference said 
in a recent report 
we must therefore ask ourselves what have been the results of 
the churchs effort to raise peoples consciences and of the 
political commitment of catholics

they may prefer shuffleboard to 
sixpacks and naps to rap but senior citizens could become the 
life of the party in this former college spring break mecca 
a hotel operator organizing the first senior spring 
festival which begins friday hopes grayhaired sunseekers will 
flock each year to this seaside city that is attempting to shake 
off its bawdy image 
these arent what i would call party animals said philip 
goldfarb who put together the weekend activities were trying 
to attract an older crowd with events that we think theyll enjoy 
the estimated 5000 seniors will boogie on the beach to the 
tunes of the four tops and mingle on board a cruise ship but 
theres also an opportunity to pick up some tidbits at seminars on 
such sobering topics as finance and health 
the festivities are scheduled to conclude sunday with a brunch 
for grandparents and their grandchildren 
dont think of this as something trying to replace the college 
kids its obviously different said goldfarb were not 
talking about bikinis and beer were showing that theres options 
for the elderly to be active and social 
jogging along the beach in a spandex bodysuit 65yearold ellen 
witt smiled at the idea of her peers in a party mood 
why should the kids have all the fun youd be surprised what 
we can think up she said 
since a police crackdown drove off college spring breakers in 
the mid1980s city officials have been preoccupied with trying to 
recast fort lauderdale as a resort for families and international 
tourists 
but the transformation has been slowed by bureaucracic tangles 
and resistance from some business owners 
a proposal to redesign the seedy beach strip into upscale 
boutiques and hotels attracted only one bid from a developer whose 
multimilliondollar plan was rejected last week as unfeasible 
a ban on alcohol sale at nude dance clubs was passed by the city 
commission but business at the establishments remains brisk 
meanwhile the central florida theme parks and attractions 
continue to draw tourists from south florida beaches 
for 1989 the greater fort lauderdale convention amp visitors 
bureau estimated the area received 45 million tourists including 
a boost from the january 1989 super bowl but early figures for 
this year indicate a drop in tourist spending 
at the same time the number of college students visiting this 
spring fell below 20000 down from a record 350000 in 1985 
most of the students have adopted daytona beach as the new 
spring break capital but key west and the florida panhandle are 
also gaining popularity 
spring break is part of fort lauderdales past said 
goldfarb were looking at a different environment 
goldfarb says next years senior festival scheduled to 
coincide with a gerontology conference will be expanded to a week 
and promoted nationally he predicts up to 10000 oldsters could 
attend 
and some veterans of the college spring onslaught are wondering 
what to expect 
hey ill bring the surfboard and they can bring the beer 
said alan frank 24 sunning on a seawall with his girlfriend at 
least they dont have to worry about ids 
warren dipaulo 17 thought the concept was sweet 
why not he said party on dudes

after centuries of racial 
conflict south africa is facing whirlwind change as the government 
and its opponents negotiate to end white domination and try to find 
a new way to live together 
but even as the country witnesses scenes unthinkable a year or 
two ago there are enormous divisions and problems to overcome for 
all the rapid political change now under way much remains the same 
the government wednesday began its first formal talks with the 
recently legalized african national congress since the black 
nationalist group was formed 78 years ago with the goal of ending 
whiteminority domination 
but these talks are only to clear the way for fullscale 
negotiations on a new constitution that would share political power 
with the countrys black majority 
for south africans the meeting created scenes symbolizing the 
historic change facing the country 
president fw de klerk and his cabinet smiled and chatted with 
anc leaders on the sprawling grounds of an old colonial mansion 
that represented centuries of white wealth and privilege 
nelson mandela released less than three months ago after 27 
years in jail complimented de klerk on what he was trying to do 
for south africa 
law and order minister adriaan vlok and top security officials 
posed for pictures with walter sisulu and other anc leaders 
imprisoned for decades 
both sides talked of ending injustice and oppression and spoke 
of their hopes for a new democratic nation mandela in a 
reference to 350 years of white domination said the two sides were 
finally ending a terrible tradition of master and servant 
the two sides stressed the need for rapid progress and warned 
that peace hopes depend on swiftly finding a solution 
but the government and the anc face enormous obstacles in 
solving the countrys divisions both sides remain fundamentally 
divided on key issues 
de klerk says he is committed to ending discrimination but 
major apartheid laws including measures providing for segregated 
neighborhoods and schools remain in force the 28 million blacks 
have no political rights and the 5 million whites monopolize the 
countrys wealth 
de klerk has repeatedly rejected a simple oneperson onevote 
democratic system he says this would replace white domination with 
black control and there would be no guarantee for white rights 
government objectives for a new constitution according to 
senior officials include some form of white legislative veto 
power a bill of rights and the protection of private property 
guarantees for free enterprise and some form of white and black 
transitional government with white control of the security forces 
the officials also say that along with english one of the 
official languages should continue to be afrikaans the tongue of 
the dutchdescended afrikaners who account for most of the white 
population and control the government 
the anc has very different goals it insists on a full democracy 
with no special rights for any ethnic or racial group it is also 
committed to redistributing wealth to aid the millions of 
impoverished blacks 
many political observers say the countrys economic and social 
divisions may be harder to solve than its political problems 
black political leadership is faced with the fact that the 
constituency it intends to represent is relatively very poor 
for them politics has to be about economics and wealth 
distribution said jan steyn head of the urban foundation a 
private group that focuses on improving black living conditions 
white leaders are equally insistent on safeguarding private 
control of business 
their critics say it would take generations to meet even the 
most basic needs of the black majority such as better housing and 
education if the economy is not restructured 
leaders on both sides believe the government and the anc will 
find some solution because they have no other choice both sides 
have staked much of their credibility on securing an agreement and 
they are under pressure from black and white extremists who oppose 
any powersharing settlement 
government sources who requested anonymity say that without an 
agreement on a transitional government and a new constitution the 
influence of rightwing whites is likely to grow 
the proapartheid conservative party won 31 percent of the vote 
in parliamentary elections for whites last september white 
extremists have called for de klerks ouster 
the anc faces similar opposition from radical black groups that 
talk of armed struggle as the only way to end all white control and 
influence anc leaders say many young blacks do not want a peaceful 
settlement with the government 
one should understand the very serious predicament of the anc 
in regard to the deep suspicion in the minds of millions of young 
militant blacks who simply do not believe in the sincerity of the 
government said beyers naude a white afrikaner cleric on the 
anc negotiating team

outgoing president oscar arias said 
central america should be demilitarized because the regions 
limited resources should be spent on tractors instead of tanks 
in an interview with the associated press arias on wednesday 
also criticized what he called us efforts to hinder fulfillment 
of a regional peace plan he drafted in 1987 with the help of other 
central american leaders 
arias who hands power tuesday to rafael calderon was awarded 
the 1987 nobel peace prize for authoring the 1987 peace accord it 
was seen as crucial to ending nicaraguas civil war and promoting 
elections in february in nicaragua the usbacked opposition won 
the vote 
the decade of the 90s must be the decade of disarmament if we 
want greater development said arias a social democrat whose 
country is the only latin american nation with no armed forces 
there is no other way he said while being driven to a 
ceremony at a cattle breeding center outside san jose the gap 
between the rich northern nations and the poor southern ones 
continues to widen rich countries commitments to poor countries 
are not increasing so we must depend more on internal savings we 
must dedicate our resources to the satisfaction of our peoples 
needs and not to buying arms 
costa rica is the best example costa rica buys tractors while 
the rest of central america buys tanks the tractors produce food 
the tanks do not he praised the plan of the new panamanian 
government to abolish the army in favor of a civiliancontrolled 
police force 
im pushing that he said 
arias said he had planned to teach at harvard university for a 
couple years upon returning to private life but was persuaded by 
friends including former president jimmy carter to continue 
promoting peace 
he said he will dedicate himself to working for the arias 
foundation for peace and human progress 
there is no greater satisfaction for a human being than being 
able to contribute to ending war arias said 
my experience my condition as nobel laureate as author of 
the central american peace plan will perhaps permit me to help to 
contribute my grain of sand 
of us resistance to his peace plan arias said every time i 
spoke with a us functionary it was for that person to tell me 
look this isnt working this is bad pull back why dont you 
the author declare that the peace plan is washed up 
so that they could continue their little central american 
war 
he continued the relationship between the war and drug 
trafficking did not matter to anyone here a horrible cynicism was 
put into play there was a double standard in everything on one 
hand they were saying drugs were the biggest threat to central 
america and that anybody who got involved in drugs must be punished 
but they closed their eyes when those who were helping the 
contras fomenting war dealt drugs and they were on the payroll 
arias provided no hard evidence to support the allegation 
previously made from other quarters that us officials supporting 
the antisandinista rebels dealt in or condoned dealing drugs 
history will take it upon itself to reveal that this was 
indeed the case and that each one receives his just punishment 
arias said 
the president who met monday with a delegation of salvadoran 
guerrilla commanders predicted the civil war in el salvador will 
end this year 
asked what he considered his legacy to central america arias 
said to have achieved that for the first time in many many 
years the people of central america today all live under 
democratic systems 
also to have appealed to the sensibility of our people to 
silence the weapons

ten years after his death communist 
yugoslavias founder josip broz tito faces a second demise the 
almost total negation of his oncevaunted accomplishments 
the tito myth which described him as a giant who achieved 
only great creations is now dead in yugoslavia the state news 
agency tanjug said in a commentary for the anniversary of titos 
death today 
formerly revered titos policies are now denounced official 
actions are under way throughout the nation to erase the traces of 
a personality cult that held sway for almost 40 years 
increasingly tito is under attack for his authoritarian style 
of rule the everfiercer feuds that have pitted serbs against 
nonserbs and liberals against orthodox communists are 
threatening to tear apart the very country tito built 
tito earned international recognition in 1948 for taking 
yugoslavia out of the soviet orbit and later making it a nonaligned 
nation 
since titos death at age 87 on may 4 1980 however yugoslavs 
increasingly have felt that most of their countrys current 
troubles took root during his 35 years of undisputed rule 
tito left yugoslavia with grave economic and ethnic problems and 
an impractical highly decentralized system of collective 
leadership with diluted responsibilities 
the lack of a strong central authority embodied by tito 
himself during his lifetime has now created two systems within 
one country threatening to pull yugoslavia apart 
the two most economically developed of yugoslavias six 
republics slovenia and croatia have held free elections their 
next step may be secession 
the largest republic serbia still advocates communism in the 
past two years however it has encouraged nationalism and 
veneration of its leader slobodan milosevic over reverence for 
tito 
the federal government has ordered traffic to stand still as 
sirens and horns wail friday at 305 pm the hour of titos death 
10 years ago 
but even such official respect is waning the federal parliament 
is expected soon to abolish a controversial law that makes public 
attacks on tito or his policies a crime punishable by up to three 
years in jail 
serbia formally opened parliamentary discussion of the highly 
unpopular law stating that titos policies should be evaluated on 
historical merit and not protected by the absurd law which 
only maintains his personality cult 
serbias communist officials and its media have led the attacks 
on tito a croat they claim his policies gave slovenia and croatia 
an economic edge at the expense of serbia 
newly founded parties in serbia also make attacks on tito a 
central part of their platform 
in an illustration of the deep antitito sentiments in serbia 
several tito portraits that the law says must hang in government 
and public offices have been covered up with calendars and photos 
of milosevic 
criticism of tito in other republics began by centering on his 
lavish lifestyle the former leader maintained more than 60 
residences and a fleet of luxurious cars and yachts 
increasingly however tito is under fire for punishing 
opponents former inmates of one of modern europes most brutal 
prison camps on goli otok bare island off the central adriatic 
coast now appear on television openly accusing tito of creating 
the camp 
new publications say up to 5000 prosoviet communists who 
opposed titos break with moscow died in the camp between 1948 and 
the mid1950s 
even in his native croatia tito is attacked by men he purged as 
alleged croatian nationalists in 1971 several have now returned to 
politics doing well in free elections 
official initiatives are under way in slovenia and montenegro to 
return the original names to cities and streets named after tito 
following world war ii 
plans to erect monuments to tito in yugoslavias main cities 
have been scrapped allegedly for economic reasons 
the prominent croatian monthly start ironically proposed an 
alternative project a titoland amusement park in titos 
native croatian town of kumrovec 
in another dig at tito recent articles and books reveal alleged 
details of the leaders private life with his wife jovanka 
mrs broz who is fighting a court battle with the state over 
what she claims are her and her late husbands personal belongings 
is kept under virtual house arrest in belgrade unable to give 
interviews or appear in public 
in a letter printed in the belgrade politika daily mrs broz 
protested publications about her life with tito saying they are 
all a part of a long campaign against my husband and myself

alaska is becoming a transit point for 
asian heroin and south american cocaine being smuggled into the 
united states and europe authorities say 
possibly the couriers feel this is a lesstraveled route 
says fred thomas chief agent of the drug enforcement 
administration office in anchorage once they clear customs in 
alaska thats it everything going to the lower 48 is domestic 
the amount of heroin seized here lately would indicate to me 
its a transshipment point he said 
customs agents have intercepted several drug shipments at 
anchorage international airport in recent months but believe they 
have staunched just a fraction of the incoming flow of narcotics 
the airport which handles about 250000 flights a year is a 
strategic refueling stop for transpolar flights between europe and 
asia 
ninetyeight percent of all air cargo going eastward between the 
two continents stops at anchorage and 70 percent of cargo sent 
from the lower 48 states to asia passes through alaska says gina 
marie lindsey executive director of the alaska international 
airport system 
intelligence reports also indicate that marijuana from thailand 
opium from pakistan and cocaine from south america are being 
smuggled in increasing quantities into the united states from asian 
mother ships that transfer their drug cargoes to smaller 
vessels along alaskas jagged remote shoreline state and federal 
agents say 
in october two nigerians were arrested at the airport for 
allegedly attempting to smuggle in one kilogram of nearly pure 
heroin max kitchens head of customs enforcement in alaska said 
that seizure is just one indication to us theyre using alaska as 
a transit point 
last month anchorage police found 45 balloons filled with 9 
ounces of heroin inside a toilet at a local jail and suspect it was 
left there by a nigerian detained temporarily at the airport by the 
immigration and naturalization service 
apart from passengers who conceal drugs on their bodies or in 
luggage cargo shipments are a prime method for smugglers 
officials say most cargo aircraft passing through anchorage are 
foreign carriers and many are bound for europe 
last week 12 pounds of opium from thailand were found in a 
federal express shipment passing through the airport kitchens 
said it was addressed to a church in sacramento calif and 
discovered during a routine cargo check he says 
the last major offshore drug seizure was in 1984 when 
authorities found 125 tons of marijuana aboard the mv allison a 
seismological survey ship 
we keep getting intelligence that the same thing is going 
on kitchens says reports indicate that freighters have been 
bringing cocaine into the united states via alaska he said 
federal and state officials say they cannot possibly keep guard 
on a coastline dotted with thousands of inlets and islands and 
stretching from the western aleutians islands to south of 
ketchikan that gives smugglers an advantage kitchens said

the bush administration has been making 
friendly noises lately toward some countries more accustomed to 
scorn than sweet talk 
old rivals iran and syria are being praised for their role in 
helping win the release of american hostages there even is 
evidence of a thaw with two marxist countries that washington has 
long ignored albania and south yemen 
this week the administration is entertaining the deputy prime 
minister of mongolia daskiin byambasuren the highest ranking 
official from that country to visit washington since it entered the 
soviet orbit in 1921 
three years ago the united states and mongolia were not on 
speaking terms now they are talking about a trade agreement 
but theres one old foe where the us attitude has been far 
less accommodating vietnam it was 15 years ago this week that the 
communist conquest of vietnam was completed with the collapse of 
the saigon government and the humiliating us departure from that 
country 
vietnam seems ready for the woundhealing process but the 
united states has put up a host of imposing barriers 
washington is demanding that vietnam find a solution to the 
decadelong conflict in cambodia and that hanoi withdraw all its 
forces from that country permanently the united states also wants 
a maximum accounting for more than 2300 us troops still listed 
as missing in action in vietnam 
by making normalization subject to onerous conditions the 
administration is leaving the impression that it is psychologically 
difficult for it to make gestures toward the country responsible 
for americas greatest military defeat 
time magazine chided the administration this week for its tough 
stance asserting that washington continues to act as if hanoi 
had sent its troops to invade virginia instead of down the ho chi 
minh trail 
if the administration really were interested in a normal 
relationship it could rationalize it easily a spokesman could 
explain it this way 
we are prepared to look to the future instead of the past in 
our relations with vietnam it is logical for the united states to 
want diplomatic access to the third largest communist country in 
the world we believe a diplomatic presence in hanoi would enhance 
the possibility of achieving our objectives in that region 
a timecnn poll indicates the administration may be out of step 
with public opinion on the vietnam question three out of five 
respondents favor an exchange of ambassadors with hanoi 
but the wall street journal believes administration policy is 
right on the mark 
vietnam remains a bastion of repression and a threat to its 
neighbors the journal editorialized it is important to insist 
that it first become a civilized nation before offering it friendly 
gestures in asia there has been no crackup of communist 
dictatorships neither has there been any significant reduction in 
the pacific military might of vietnams big brother the soviet 
union 
but the state of us relations with vietnam is not all 
negative hanoi has been far more accommodating lately in providing 
an accounting of missing servicemen and in allowing former 
detainees held on political charges to emigrate to the united 
states the offspring of american servicemen also are being given 
permission to emigrate in larger numbers 
and there has been a significant expansion in us private 
humanitarian assistance to vietnam since 1987 the us government 
has been actively encouraging private groups to send aid to 
vietnamese war victims and to children 
us officials said that as a result there has easily been a 
fourfold increase in the number of us groups involved in these 
tasks and in the value of the assistance provided 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach wishes the goodwill 
shown by private americans would extend to us officials 
when i meet people from the state department their faces 
never smile he said it is a pity

students townspeople and outsiders flocked 
onto the kent state university campus thursday to view a new 
memorial near the site where ohio national guardsmen fatally shot 
four students 20 years ago 
more than 2000 people staged a candlelight march on the eve of 
the memorials dedication 
the marchers walked silently from the rainsoaked commons the 
site of the antiwar protest broken up by national guard gunfire on 
may 4 1970 
earlier about a dozen men some wearing jackets bearing messages 
of im proud to be a vet filed past the abstract memorial of 
four granite slabs flanked by a walkway and guarded by a student 
security officer 
others stopped to admire 58175 daffodils one representing 
each american killed during the vietnam war 
the university planned ceremonies friday to dedicate the 
100000 memorial to four students who were killed along with nine 
wounded by guardsmen during the protests against the vietnam war 
kent state police chief john peach said he expected protests at 
the ceremonies but did not think they would be disruptive the 
protesters contend that students and victims were left out of the 
planning for the scaleddown memorial to jeffrey miller sandy 
scheuer william schroeder and allison krause 
peach said there were no plans to seek outside assistance for 
the university security force of 32 officers i dont anticipate 
much of a presence of police officers in blue uniforms we will be 
using plainclothes officers he said 
speakers scheduled for the memorial dedication included former 
us sen george mcgovern florence schroeder whose son was slain 
and dean kahler an athens county commissioner who was wounded in 
the protest 
the dedication is to be followed by an annual presentation by 
the studentrun may 4th task force 
kurt myers a sophomore from newark ohio and a member of the 
task force said thursday that the student protest planners dont 
want to disrupt the ceremonies 
it will be a silent protest we will be there with signs and 
banners but there are a lot of us who will want to hear what the 
speakers at the dedication have to say myers said 
a majority of students feel its important to remember may 
4th but a lot especially this year seem fed up with so many 
people coming in and i think a lot will decide to leave campus 
early for a long weekend he said

historys first continuous culture of human 
brain cells may eventually be used to replace the tissue lost in 
the brains of people with alzheimers disease stroke or head 
injury said a study published today 
dr solomon snyder of johns hopkins school of medicine in 
baltimore said his research team used tissue removed from a child 
during brain surgery to develop a colony of human brain cells that 
divide and grow in laboratory dishes 
never before snyder said have scientists been able to coax 
human brain cells into growing and reproducing in a laboratory but 
the new cell line can now be expanded at will through thousands 
upon thousands of generations he said 
asked why the brain cells taken from the child were able to 
divide and grow in the laboratory when so many similar earlier 
efforts had failed snyder had no answer 
they clearly had a intrinsic potential to divide more than 
conventional neurons he said in a telephone interview just 
why we simply dont know 
other researchers called the discovery one of tremendous 
significance that may cause an explosion of new research and 
treatment in brain diseases 
although brain cell transplantation is the eventual goal snyder 
said it will take years of laboratory studies before the brain 
cells can be used on human patients 
a report on the research is published in todays edition of the 
journal science 
scientists have long been hampered in their study of the brain 
because human brain cells wont reproduce except for very limited 
exceptions in isolated areas of the brain humans at birth have all 
the brain cells they will ever have 
if a substantial number of brain cells are damaged by disease 
injury or stroke functions controlled by those cells are lost 
forever 
snyder said the cultured cells underwent 3 years of vigorous 
testing to assure they arent an abnormal growth such as cancer 
but are in fact normal brain cells 
we have every confidence that they will function that way when 
transplanted he said if they were placed into the environment 
of the brain we would expect them to be functional 
brains damaged by degenerative diseases such as alzheimers or 
by stroke or trauma may one day be repaired by transplanting cells 
grown from the brain cells cultured in the hopkins lab snyder said 
thats what were working on he said that is our full 
intent 
the cells that founded the culture were taken from the brain of 
an 18monthold girl who underwent surgery in 1986 
the young patient was suffering from seizures and doctors 
determined that one side of her brain had grown more than the 
other surgeons removed excess brain tissue to correct the 
condition 
snyder said one of his students immediately placed about a gram 
of brain tissue into a culture medium 
two small clusters of cells in the specimen survived after 21 
days researchers treated those cells with hormones to force them 
to mature and develop into normal neurons 
as far as can be determined snyder said the brain cells are 
normal neurons except they can divide and multiply 
if you put them into a hole in the head they would grow until 
they fill the head and then just stop he said 
barbara bregman a brain researcher at georgetown university 
here said it was premature to suggest that the cell line could 
eventually be used for brain tissue transplants but she said the 
fact that a living culture of human brain cells has been developed 
is very valuable and exciting and will enable scientists to 
conduct brain experiments not possible before 
dr john sladek chairman of neurobiology at the university of 
rochester school of medicine said the hopkins research is of 
tremendous significance 
if further study confirms that the cells are normal neurons he 
said there is a real possibility of one day using the culture 
for brain cell transplants in humans 
sladek said that in parkinsons disease research using animals 
we already know we can insert new nerve cells into a damaged 
brain and that those new cells can grow rather vigorously in 
the case of monkeys this will reverse the signs of parkinsons 
working with snyder on the study were gabriele v ronnett lynda 
d hester jeffrey s nye and karen connors all of johns hopkins 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

dead chris didnt think he would fall asleep 
the bird which cota said had a great personality was 
buried near universal studios cota said 
im upset and chris is pretty upset with himself said cota 
who sent the tonight show a videotape of axl in action to get 
the prized booking for thursdays program i was pretty excited 
not too many people make the show 
charlie barrett a spokesman for the show said obviously 
the show feels very bad about it johnny carson presented cota 
with a replacement bird during thursday nights telecast 
the programs talent coordinator stephanie ross visited cota 
and axl wednesday afternoon the bird did great cota said 
stephanie couldnt believe it 
the 1year old bird named after the lead singer in the rock 
band guns n roses performed a variety of stunts cota said axl

the united states is giving up deploying new 
landbased nuclear missiles in europe but many other 
lesspublicized nuclear arms already are in the pipeline 
private analysts said thursday the littleknown new weapons 
such as a shortrange missile fired from submarines would more 
than offset the loss of firepower from president bushs decision 
not to modernize the landbased lance missile 
its like trading two handguns for an assault rifle said 
daniel plesch director of the british american security 
information council a private arms group 
bush on thursday also announced cancellation of a modernized 
155mm nucleartipped artillery shell although he did not say that 
existing shells in europe would be withdrawn 
the decisions had been widely anticipated even though bush 
strenuously argued in favor of these weapons last year west 
germany and other nato allies oppose the weapons 
bush made no mention of the other nuclear weapons already 
planned for european deployment private experts said nato will be 
getting more than its giving up 
already in the american nuclear arsenal in europe are an 
estimated 1400 freefall bombs carried by the f111 and other 
europeanbased aircraft about 1200 artillery shells 200 depth 
bombs to kill submarines and 700 aging lance missiles 
the most important new weapon earmarked for european deployment 
is an airtosurface nuclear missile that could be carried on the 
american f16 fighters based in europe and the new f15e nuclear 
strike aircraft now in production 
the leading candidate for an airtosurface missile is the 
shortrange attack missiletactical which the air force is 
reported to be developing with a range of about 250 miles 
william arkin an arms expert with the environmental group 
greenpeace usa said the air force wants to start deploying the 
airtosurface missile in europe by 1995 with a total purchase for 
european use of about 300 missiles 
the advantage of an airtosurface missile is that it would give 
the air forces of the north atlantic treaty organization a 
capability in the event of a nuclear war to stand off from 
the battlefront and still hit soviet territory 
the united states now has no airtosurface nuclear missiles in 
europe britain and france reportedly are cooperating to develop 
their own missiles of this type 
the nowcanceled lance missile which was to replace the 
existing lance arsenal would not have been capable of reaching 
soviet territory 
bush did not say he would withdraw any of the existing lances 
and plesch said it was possible that nato could agree to refurbish 
them to extend their useful lives the pentagon has said the lances 
are due to become obsolete by the mid1990s 
among other weapons in the pipeline are more us shorterrange 
nuclear missiles for deployment on attack submarines based in the 
north atlantic and the mediterranean arkin said about 350 of 
these called the tomahawk land attack missile already have been 
deployed bushs 1991 budget calls for buying 75 more 
the pentagon also is developing new versions of its nuclear 
gravity bombs and antisubmarine depth bombs 
the soviet union also has a large shortrange nuclear 
capability although it is unclear how their deployments may be 
affected by the demise of the warsaw pact as a cohesive military 
force 
the soviets have urged immediate negotiations to eliminate all 
shorterrange nuclear weapons in europe but the bush 
administration has refused nato leaders decided last year they 
would put off any such negotiations until after an eastwest treaty 
is signed to reduce nonnuclear weapons in europe 
arkin said the soviets have more than 1400 launchers for 
shortrange nuclear systems based on land including about 660 frog 
missiles built in the 1960s 300 ss21 missiles that are equivalent 
to the us lance missiles and about 500 scudb missiles

teacher milton evertz leaned down and spoke 
inches from his pupil marias ear listen to me say it just as 
im saying it west west west west 
wet wet wet she replied finding the letter s a 
challenge for her hispanic tongue 
you mean like mojado asked evertz laughing heartily 
and drawing a smile from maria as he spoke the spanish word for 
wet 
so it goes two evenings each week for the 14 formerly illegal 
aliens in evertzs amnesty class at hostos community college in 
the south bronx one of several campuses of the city university of 
new york offering such courses 
for the more than half a million immigrants nationwide who have 
so far completed these classes 100000 in new york alone its a 
first chance to emerge from the shadows of american life to 
replace daily fear with the refreshing breath of knowledge often 
laced with a joke or two 
most have been in this country at least five years all that 
time theyve been in the shadows for a lot of them this is a big 
opportunity to learn english without being turned in said jim 
roth who trains amnesty teachers at cuny 
by day evertzs students are factory workers truck drivers 
seamstresses they came here from the dominican republic mexico 
colombia peru central america at 6 pm they gather in a 
spartan classroom in a converted trailer surrounded by coiled razor 
wire to learn english and american civics 
such amnesty classes have been offered nationwide for the last 
two years at hundreds of community colleges public schools 
churches charitable organizations and proprietary schools 
they exist for the 17 million formerly illegal aliens who came 
forward during the federal amnesty program that lasted for a year 
beginning may 4 1987 
those who revealed themselves gained temporary residence status 
and had 30 months to fulfill requirements for permanent status 
most amnesty classes will shut down around november the deadline 
for most to fulfill their requirements for permanent status 
the requirements include either demonstrated competence in 
english and civics or attendance at least 40 hours of amnesty 
classes 
critics have cited the nearimpossibility of teaching english in 
40 hours but officials of the immigration and naturalization 
service which administers the program and teachers and pupils 
think such criticism misses the point 
forty hours is not enough to learn english we can all agree 
on that said janet charney deputy assistant commissioner of the 
legalization division of the ins in washington but the purpose 
was to get people indoctrinated into the culture and help them 
gain some survival skills we have found that many have gone on 
to further study 
the amnesty classes are an aperitif to show these people that 
they can learn agreed adolfo calovini a teacher at hostos who 
speaks six languages and helped develop that schools amnesty 
curriculum 
the classes could hardly be described as rigorous and the ins 
allows schools wide latitude in what should be taught 
virtually everyone attending the necessary 40 hours will get a 
certificate of satisfactory pursuit required to go from 
temporary to permanent residence status 
the first weeks of the course are spent teaching students 
english phrases needed for everyday life my name is i 
live at and survival skills like handling telephone 
conversations 
after about twenty hours the course tackles civics at hostos 
teachers talk about the history and significance of national 
holidays like july 4th columbus day and martin luther kings 
birthday 
eventually the classes will study the basics of the 
constitution the bill of rights and features of government 
roberto flores a beer truck driver with a wife and son who 
crossed the mexican border illegally in 1981 said he is no longer 
afraid about his immigrant status 
its a very good class in my job i must speak english and 
this helps me he said 
but as relaxed as evertz tries to make his class fear lingers 
among immigrants still unaccustomed to dealing with official 
institutions 
several in evertzs class looked worried one evening as a 
reporter scribbled notes and a photographer clicked off shots 
dont worry theyre not agents theyre from the tv show 
lives of the rich amp famous said evertz as his studnts laughed 
again

the biggest pearl in the world weighs 14 
pounds is the size and shape of a human brain and must have been 
a pain in the neck of the clam that bore it say its owners who 
expect 25 million for its sale 
variously known as the pearl of allah and the pearl of laotzu 
the natural pearl went on display thursday and later will be shown 
to prospective buyers 
the guinness book of records says it is the largest of its kind 
in the world part owner peter hoffman a jewelry dealer said he 
had been told the pearl was worth from 25 million to 50 million 
the pearls stock is boosted by the romantic legend that says it 
grew 2500 years ago when chinese philosopherspiritualist laotzu 
had a small amulet placed in a clam 
people who gaze upon the stone are said to see the images of 
buddha confucius and laotzu the filipino tribal chief who once 
owned it declared it a gift from god a diver is said to have 
drowned prying it from a clam 
jewelry dealer peter hoffman said he and coowner victor barbish 
might sell the pearl to a museum it they can assure it will be 
properly insured safeguarded and displayed 
i think its that kind of an item that can do nothing but good 
if it was on public display hoffman said since i first saw it 
i think i have become a more spiritual person 
hoffman and barbish bought the pearl for 200000 from the 
estate of american archaeologist wilburn d cobb in 1980 cobb 
received it from a moslem tribal chief in the philippines whose son 
cobb had treated for malaria 
barbish became entangled in a legal dispute with two other 
people he sold an interest to and a court ordered the pearl sold 
as part of the settlement 
according to the legend the pearl grew to its present size as 
it was handed down for centuries to laotzus descendants the 
descendants would periodically replant the gem in bigger clams 
allowing it to continue to grow 
the pearl and the giant clam that was holding it were lost in a 
typhoon that hit the philippines sometime during the ming dynasty 
which ruled china from 1368 to 1644 
it was recovered in 1934 by a filipino diver who reportedly 
drowned trying to take it away from the clam 
eventually brought to the surface it became the property of a 
moslem tribal chief who said it resembled the turbanwrapped head 
of mohammed thus it acquired the name pearl of allah

sen dave durenberger says the senate ethics 
committee is pushing him to settle allegations that he broke senate 
rules and federal law in his financial dealings 
the minnesota republican said thursday that his attorney had 
been talking informally with the committees special counsel but 
he declined to give details 
the committee voted thursday to begin two weeks of public 
hearings on the allegations on june 12 
its a matter of wanting to bring this to a head said 
durenberger who agreed to an interview about the investigation for 
the first time since january whether the hearing is going to be 
necessary well have to wait until early june to make a decision 
the ethics panel found in february that there was substantial 
credible evidence of violations involving a 100000 book 
promotion deal and free limousine service that durenberger accepted 
the committee decided to continue its investigation into senate 
reimbursement that durenberger received for a condominium he partly 
owned said wilson abney the panels chief of staff 
durenberger said he expected the committee to add the 
condominium deal to the list of possible violations it would pursue 
at the june hearings 
the proceedings would be canceled if durenberger negotiated an 
agreement with the committee to settle the case 
the committee can recommend any of several different penalties 
including censure expulsion or loss of seniority or 
responsibility the panel also could refer the case to the justice 
department for a criminal investigation 
durenberger admits to lapses in judgment but denies any willful 
wrongdoing 
the committee has said it is investigating 113 paid appearances 
by durenberger in 1985 and 1986 where the senator arranged to 
charge fees for speeches and split the proceeds with piranha press 
of minneapolis the publisher of two books he wrote 
the deal may have broken federal law as well as senate rules 
the committee said 
some of the organizations that invited durenberger to speak said 
they considered the appearances standard paid speeches and that his 
books were never mentioned paid speeches count toward the outside 
earnings limits for members of congress 
the committee also said durenberger may have broken limits on 
receipts of gifts by accepting nearly 5000 worth of limousine 
trips for personal travel in the boston area in 1985 and 1986 
the committee has been investigating the condominium deal since 
december when a newspaper disclosed that he charged the senate 
rent when he stayed in his minneapolis condominium from 1983 to 
1989 
durenberger repaid the senate 11005 in january after the rules 
committee decided he was not entitled to expenses when he stayed at 
the condo during congressional recesses

for a man whos not running for president the 
rev jesse jackson sure has been busy down south 
he was at a conference on blacks and the environment in atlanta 
last month and came back for earth day festivities then he trekked 
across four southern states pitching organized labor among textile 
and factory workers 
the revitalized georgia chapter of his national rainbow 
coalition has been registering voters on behalf of democratic 
gubernatorial hopeful andrew young who was booed by jackson 
delegates at the 1984 national democratic convention 
this week jackson is back in atlanta again at a conference with 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown and virginia gov 
douglas wilder the keynote speaker at a saturday banquet 
jackson who ducked a chance to run for mayor of washington 
dc denies his appearances are a prelude to a presidential bid in 
1992 but thats what it looks like to political science professor 
merle black of emory university 
everything he is doing is consistent with becoming an active 
candidate again said black who said 1992 is too far away for 
jacksons activities to make an impact 
this is just a way of keeping himself active and visible he 
said 
its not a campaign agenda its a freedom agenda jackson 
said in an interview where we once marched and took the steps 
necessary to end racial inequality by law we must now end economic 
inequality by law there must be a new appraisal of the south 
brown sought thursday to dispel criticism of jacksons role in 
democratic politics saying it pains him to hear talk of jackson 
as if he were some kind of impediment to the partys success in 
presidential politics 
in fact hes one of the greatest assets to our party we want 
to tell the truth about that brown said he was not the reason 
we do not have a democrat in the white house 
joe beasley interim state coordinator of the rainbow coalition

a promised 24billionayear shift of federal 
tax burden to corporations is not materializing and individuals are 
making up the difference the government says 
but the news is not as bad as it might sound for individual 
taxpayers their share of the federal burden is dropping and they 
are paying about 24 billion a year more than forecast only because 
their incomes are rising faster than predicted 
witnesses told the senate finance committee on thursday that the 
inability to make precise estimates is chiefly to blame for the 
fact that corporations are paying less taxes than were anticipated 
when congress wrote the landmark 1986 tax overhaul 
approximately 58 percent of the shortfall in corporate income 
tax receipts over the 198789 period is attributable to 
lowerthanexpected projected profits robert d reischauer 
director of the congressional budget office told the committee 
corporate profits are volatile and therefore notoriously 
difficult to forecast reischauer said 
the primary reason is that pretax corporate profits came 
in below expectations harvey s rosen deputy assistant 
secretary of the treasury agreed 
one reason that corporate earnings were lower than expected is 
that individual incomes rose faster than projected witnesses 
testified those wage increases gave individuals larger taxable 
incomes and because wages are a deductible expense gave 
corporations less taxable income 
robert mcintyre director of the laborfunded citizens for tax 
justice blamed the tax shortfall on a tendency for corporations to 
borrow rather than issue stock to finance expansion this 
borrowing wave was highlighted in the late 1980s by corporate 
takeovers financed by leveraged buyouts 
corporations are sending their profits to bondholders rather 
than paying dividends to shareholders and taxes to the treasury 
mcintyre said 
rosen the treasury official said available evidence suggests 
little connection between buyout borrowing and the tax shortage 
a major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul was to shift about 24 
billion a year of tax burden from individuals to corporations in 
the 198789 period corporate taxes fell 63 billion short of 
congressional budget office forecasts and 65 billion below the 
administration estimate 
when the new law was approved the government estimated that 
individual income taxes would average 391 billion a year in 
198789 collections actually averaged 413 billion a year 
the corporate share of income taxes rose from 15 percent in 1986 
to 19 percent in 1989 rosen said while the individual share 
dropped from 85 percent to 81 percent 
even so reischauer said corporate taxes have failed to keep 
pace with economic growth corporate taxes measured 4 percent of 
gross national product in 1960 by 1986 the amount had declined to 
15 percent he said

a former kingpin of the medellin drug cartel 
said colombian drug lords donated about 20 million to the 
usbacked contras in nicaragua 
carlos lehder rivas 40 made his remarks in a broadcast 
thursday night of abcs primetime live which interviewed him in 
the federal prison in marion ill where lehder is serving a life 
sentence plus 135 years 
we did give a great deal of money to the contra cause i 
gave we put up the first time about 10 million to the contras 
said lehder whose hands were shackled during the interview in 
all around 20 million in cash went to help the contras 
adolfo calero a former director of the nicaraguan resistance 
an umbrella group for the contras denied lehders allegations 
we never had one cent from them calero said in a telephone 
interview from his miami home we know where all our 
contributions came from 
lehder was convicted in may 1988 after a 7month trial in 
jacksonville fla on charges of cocaine smuggling and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise he and others were accused of 
smuggling some 33 tons of cocaine into the united states from 
colombia from 1978 to 1980 
lehder also accused john hull an american who directed supplies 
for the contras from costa rica of cocaine trafficking hull who 
now lives in the united states denied the allegations the news 
program reported 
i do know the situation for a fact that john hull in costa 
rica he was talking about 30 tons of cocaine into the united 
states a year lehder said now this is a kingpin 
hull 70 faces charges in costa rica ranging from aiding the 
nicaraguan contra rebels to involvement in a terrorist bombing 
costa rican officials have said they plan to seek his extradition 
from the united states 
a costa rican government commission that investigated contra 
activity there accused hull of involvement in a network that 
allowed colombian and panamanian drug traffickers to transport 
drugs to the united states in exchange for arms for the contras 
in march friends of hull held a news conference in washington 
and read a statement from him denying the charges and contending 
they were based on perjured statements hull now lives in indiana 
lehder also discussed ousted panamanian dictator manuel 
noriega who is awaiting trial in miami on charges he took money 
from the medellin drug cartel to make panama a safe haven for 
cocaine smuggling 
noriega was always on the payroll of american intelligence 
but he was always also on the payroll of the soviet intelligence 
the cuban intelligence and the israeli intelligence he said 
at the same time he was on the payroll of some colombian 
traffickers he was working every side of the corner

about 359000 children were kidnapped in 1988 
and the overwhelming majority were abducted by family members not 
by strangers a new study says 
the size of the family abduction problem really did surprise 
us said david finkelhor of the university of new hampshire one 
of the researchers who produced the study for the justice 
department we had expected 25000 to 100000 that was the going 
estimate 
the researchers estimated that in 1988 354100 children were 
abducted by relatives as many as 4600 children were kidnapped by 
strangers 14 percent of the total number of abductions 
according to the study released thursday 
however only 200 to 300 of those cases conformed with a common 
public perception of how kidnappings occur a forcible abduction 
by a stranger who keeps the child for a long period of time and 
possibly kills the victim 
such cases include the highly publicized disappearance of 
5yearold melissa brannen from a christmas party in virginia and 
the kidnapping by a masked gunman of 11yearold jacob wetterling 
in minnesota 
many brief encounters were included among the approximately 
4600 abductions by strangers estimated in the study based on 
police records 
the thousands of rapes of children that occur each year 
include abduction finkelhor said in an interview 
at any rate the number could not compare with the 354100 
children abducted by family members 
its clear that we havent paid enough attention to the family 
abduction problem said finkelhor who conducted the study with 
gerald hotaling of the university of lowell in massachusetts and 
andrea sedlak of westat inc 
finkelhor said such abductions are a reflection of how rampant 
divorce is how bitter custody fights are 
most of the perpetrators were men and most of the victims were 
ages 2 to 11 few infants or older teens were abducted by family 
members 
children abducted by parents usually are not harmed physically 
but finkelhor said this is very stressful for kids it does 
leave scars 
the fact that only 14 percent of all abductions of children are 
committed by strangers should not completely reduce parents fears 
of strangers said ernie allen president of the national center 
for missing and exploited children 
if there are 300 melissa brannens a year thats 10 elementary 
school classrooms full allen said thats a tremendous 
concern 
the study required by the 1984 missing children act also shows 
that 450700 children ran away in 1988 127100 were thrown 
away abandoned or forced out of their homes by their parents 
and 438200 were lost injured or otherwise missing many for short 
periods of time 
in addition 114600 children were subjected to possible 
attempted kidnapping the study said

congressional democrats are variously 
expressing enthusiasm indifference and distress over talks that 
president bush says may help prevent a political stalemate over the 
federal budget 
bush announced thursday that he has invited congressional 
leaders to a white house meeting sunday focusing on where we go 
now in the slowmoving budget process 
weve got to move forward and ive got to find a way to do 
that he said 
the president proposed the meeting in a week in which the senate 
budget committee and the house have adopted separate 
democraticwritten budgets for next year each one strips nearly 
10 billion from bushs own military spending proposal for fiscal 
1991 which begins oct 1 
congress is supposed to finish its budget blueprint by april 15 
but rarely meets that deadline 
the document sets nonbinding guidelines for the governments 
fiscal plans and does not require the presidents approval 
programs are financed and taxes are raised or lowered in later 
separate bills that require his signature 
administration officials and republican lawmakers have been 
pressing all year for budget negotiations they have said that they 
and congressional democrats must solve their differences over 
defense spending taxes and other areas before serious deficit 
reduction can be accomplished 
democrats have been split over the idea of talks some believe 
that cooperation with bush is needed while others argue that 
congress majority party needs to define its own budget priorities 
the two democratic leaders who will be attending the talks 
showed little enthusiasm for sundays session and volunteered 
nothing about what they expected to accomplish 
we have to be prepared to discuss whatever the president 
wants said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said simply 
i have said many times that i would meet with the president at 
his request at anytime about any subject yesterday when the 
president asked me to come to the white house to discuss the 
budget i accepted 
others showed more zeal for the prospects of negotiations 
great idea said rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the taxwriting house ways and means committee i think they 
could give us more direction about what the president wants to do 
about the deficit 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said he saw the session as an important first step 
toward what could evolve into a fullfledged budget summit later in 
the year 
but you cant have a successful summit without everything on 
the table including the tax increases bush has opposed in the 
past panetta added 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said that for the session to be successful bush would 
have to convince mitchell that the administration is ready to move 
decisively to reduce the deficit 
ive seen no evidence the administration is seriously 
interested in reducing this deficit he said 
others expressed disdain for the idea of a summit many members 
of congress resented the budget negotiations of the past few years 
arguing that they end up freezing most lawmakers out of the fiscal 
process 
it eliminates many of the cumbersome clumsy aspects of 
democracy and replaces them with the efficiency of an edict said 
rep richard durbin dill a member of the house budget 
committee king george iii would have loved it 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority 
leader robert michel rill are also scheduled to attend the 
meeting

a house subcommittee is considering whether 
improper political pressure led the us army corps of engineers to 
reverse itself on an alaska construction permit sought by the oil 
industry 
the issue involves federal permits for the construction of 
massive gravel causeways that would connect points along alaskas 
north slope to offshore drilling sites 
two such causeways have been built and requests for additional 
permits are under consideration or are expected 
the oil industry says the causeways up to several miles long 
are essential to developing oil in the arctic national wildlife 
refuge environmentalists say they harm the regions ecology and 
fish and violate federal clean water laws 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the house interior 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources sought 
to show at a hearing thursday that political pressure was put on 
the corps over the past 18 months on specific causeway permit cases 
miller said information in internal documents starts to 
suggest a political decision was made rather extraordinary 
means were taken to see if the decisions could be neutralized 
the corps district engineer for alaska col william kakel 
decided in october 1988 that the 6600foot long niakuk causeway on 
the north slope should not be built because of potential harm to 
fish and water quality in violation of the federal clean water act 
the us fish and wildlife service had said the causeway 
threatened aquatic habitat 
as part of his decision kakel suggested that british petroleum 
find alternatives to the gravel causeway he also issued new 
guidelines on causeway permits that suggested oil companies first 
look at other ways to work out their problems such as directional 
drilling or underwater pipes 
but four months later kakels guidelines were rescinded and he 
was told to reopen the niakuk case 
kakel denied in testimony thursday that he was pressured by 
superiors for purely political reasons and said the niakuk permit 
case was still active and may be decided soon 
his superior maj gen patrick kelly director of civil works 
at the corps maintained that kakels decision was rescinded only 
because of procedural problems and not from political pressure or 
industry lobbying he said the colonel had no authority to issue 
general policy guidelines 
but robert oja chief of the regulatory branch of the corps 
alaska district said pressure from the oil company which lobbied 
vigorously in washington after kakel made his decision prompted 
the reversal 
oja testified as a government whistleblower which provides 
him with additional protection against possible retaliation 
he said the events surrounding the decision convey a strong 
message about how an industry has systematically and successfully 
lobbied its selfinterests at the expense of the publics trust 
at the very least this information suggests incidents of 
abuse of authority waste and improper command influence he 
continued adding that a wellentrenched system has grossly 
twisted the regulatory and scientific processes 
the fish and wildlife service in a draft recommendation urged 
against building the causeway citing concern about the impact on 
fish flows testified paul gertler a former field officer in 
alaska and now fish and wildlifes coordinator for the exxon valdez 
oil spill 
but he said under the direction of senior interior department 
officials the draft was changed resulting in a letter that 
omitted all of the services technical information on fish and 
wildlife resources and the potential impacts of the causeway as 
well as the services recommendation that the kiakuk permit 
be denied

barbara bushs selection as wellesley 
colleges commencement speaker has divided the campus and alumnae 
some of whom question why the college picked a woman known for her 
husbands achievements 
the feminist controversy at the private allwomens college 
drew comment thursday from president bush who told reporters his 
wifes work as a mother and as an advocate of literacy could teach 
students a lot 
several graduates of wellesley agreed but others said she was 
not the best choice for speaker at the june 1 commencement on the 
tranquil campus nestled in a corner of this posh boston suburb 
mrs bush dropped out of smith college wellesleys sister 
school in 1944 to marry bush then a navy pilot she said earlier 
in the week that about 125 wellesley students who signed a petition 
against her coming were very reasonable but would not prompt 
her to stay away 
mrs bush was the second choice of the schools seniors they 
first picked feminist writer alice walker who declined 
anne bernays who graduated from wellesley in 1952 and has 
written eight books said she was very angry about the 
selection of mrs bush but she said she was angry with the senior 
class and not the first lady 
i didnt understand at first that it was the senior class 
who picked her which is even worse she said barbara bush is 
wonderful but she was invited to speak at wellesley because she is 
married to the president 
the university named mrs bush as commencement speaker on the 
2200student campus in midmarch a protest petition appeared in 
april 
to honor barbara bush as commencement speaker is to honor a 
woman who has gained recognition through the achievements of her 
husband which contradicts what we have been taught over our years 
at wellesley the petition said 
susana cardenas a leader of the protesting students has 
received threatening phone calls and letters college officials 
told the new york times 
in washington the president said he and his wife were not 
bothered by the controversy 
i think that these young women can have a lot to learn from 
barbara bush and from her unselfishness and from her advocacy of 
literacy and of being a good mother and a lot of other things he 
said 
bush was asked if there was any merit to the argument that his 
wifes accomplishments are related in large part to her marriage to 
him i cant make an argument with that he said 
mrs bush defended her life choices to reporters at a wednesday 
luncheon 
i dont think they understand where im coming from she 
said i chose to live the life ive lived and i think its been a 
fabulously exciting interesting involved life 
i have enormous respect for barbara bush said susan 
estrich who graduated from wellesley in 1974 and managed michael 
dukakis failed bid to defeat bush for the presidency in 1988 
i dont think feminism should limit its definition of 
accomplishment to women who have secured careers entirely on their 
own i think there should be tremendous value attached to women who 
are wives and mothers she said 
nan keohane president of wellesley said the debate itself 
serves a purpose to publicize disagreements over what feminism is 
feminism is very hard to pin down but it is certainly not 
antifamily she said what we try to teach is that nobody of 
either sex should be defining their lives just in terms of making 
money 
nina budd scott who graduated from wellesley in 1959 said she 
was angered when she first heard of the selection of mrs bush but 
became less so when she learned that the first lady was a second 
choice after ms walker 
im still not happy with it i think that there are other 
people who have really achieved a lot scott said i dont 
feel hostile about mrs bush but i just dont feel shes the right 
person

the bush administration is playing down the 
lack of progress in strengthening the shaky japanese yen as 
economic chiefs from the worlds major industrial powers prepare 
for a weekend gathering 
only a month ago the socalled group of seven promised to work 
against the weak yens undesirable consequences for the world 
economy and us trade deficit nevertheless the yens value 
remains near a threeyear low against the dollar 
a weak yen tends to hurt the trade deficit by making american 
goods more expensive in japan and japanese goods more affordable in 
the united states 
a senior treasury department official briefing reporters 
thursday on condition of anonymity sought to minimize rate 
problems by noting the stability of currency markets since the 
group of sevens april 7 meeting in paris 
coordinated yen buying by major central banks around the world 
has helped prevent the japanese currency from falling further 
however the official conceded that us officials continue to 
be concerned about the general level of the yen which by april 
had fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar since the start 
of the year 
the official said exchange rates will be among the topics 
covered sunday when finance ministers and central bank chiefs from 
the united states japan west germany great britain france 
canada and italy confer in advance of the spring meetings of the 
152nation international monetary fund and the world bank 
finance officials also will be wrestling with the politically 
touchy problem of increasing the resources of the imf reviewing 
progress in easing the crushing 13 trillion debt burden on third 
world countries and evaluating west germanys plans to forge a 
monetary union with east germany 
some private economists accuse the group of seven of minimizing 
exchange rate problems because they cannot agree on how to fix them 
c fred bergsten a former treasury official who now heads the 
washington think tank the institute for international economics 
warned that the us trade gap which has fallen for the past two 
years could soon start growing again 
i think theres a strange sense of complacency among the g7 
members except for the japanese when officials cant come up with 
solutions they tend to deny problems so they dont look 
ineffective in solving them bergsten said 
however in a speech to the us information agency conference 
earlier this week treasury secretary nicholas f brady said the 
yens decline has been helpful in preventing financial market 
turmoil in tokyo from spilling into other stock exchanges around 
the world 
the truth of the matter is the system has worked very well 
the change in investors feelings about the japanese market have 
translated into a decline of the yen against other currencies but 
that has to be brady said 
rather than exchange rates group of seven officials will be 
spending much of their time wrestling with the increase in imf 
resources known as quotas 
the senior treasury official said imf members could settle the 
matter next week and appear to have a consensus for an approximate 
50 percent quota increase from 120 billion to 180 billion 
the us share of the added 60 billion would amount to about 
12 billion the contribution is a commitment and does not count 
against the budget deficit 
imf officials warn that 50 percent may not be enough for the 
fund to meet its growing responsibility in eastern europe and 
continue supporting third world debtors 
but the treasury official countered theres no shortage of 
resources at the moment 
on the issue of third world debt the bush administration is 
painting the brady plan named after the treasury secretary as a 
success introduced in march 1989 it emphasizes debt reduction 
as opposed to new lending more strongly than past us strategies 
so far mexico and the philippines have concluded final debt 
reduction agreements with creditor banks venezuela costa rica 
chile and morocco have agreements in principle

nato has launched its drive to ensure 
the western military alliance does not become a rusted relic but 
instead functions as a key component in new european security 
structures 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner told a news conference 
thursday that the group is taking advantage of the historic 
opportunity to move beyond confrontation to cooperation 
he was speaking at the end of a special meeting of foreign 
ministers of the 16 nations of the north atlantic treaty 
organization with reduced eastwest tensions nato is under 
pressure to reduce its military role and increase its political one 
the officials also insisted that a united germany remain in the 
western alliance but woerner said nato does not intend to expand 
its forces into the current territory of east germany 
thursdays meeting was the first of a series of highlevel 
discussions that will be capped by a summit of president bush and 
other alliance leaders in london in late june or early july 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said bush wants the 
summit to launch an indepth alliance review of its political 
role the need for conventional and nuclear forces and the place 
of a broader 35nation forum in europes future 
this will be a very decisive moment in the history of our 
alliance clearly turning toward the future and clearly 
adjusting political tasks and military strategy to changed 
circumstances woerner told a news conference 
the allies are trying to deflect calls for nato and the 
sovietled warsaw pact to be scrapped and replaced by the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe which draws in 
all the nations of europe except albania plus the united states 
and canada 
baker and other ministers insisted that nato should remain in a 
new europe 
we all agreed of course that the alliance will play an 
essential role in europes future said woerner 
he said the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
cannot replace nato but he said it has an important 
complementary role to play 
the 35 nations met in 1975 in helsinki finland to set a course 
for lessening eastwest tensions by promoting human rights and 
reducing military friction 
since then soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has pressed to 
expand the role of the organization known by its initials as csce 
and hold a summit this year 
the western nations have agreed to attend a summit in paris but 
only if negotiators for nato and the warsaw pact strike a deal to 
slash troops tanks and other nonnuclear forces in europe they 
are trying to get an accord by the fall 
to prepare for the csce summit baker offered to host a meeting 
of all 35 foreign ministers in new york during the opening session 
of the un general assembly in late september 
woerner said the nato allies want preparations for the csce 
summit to begin in vienna in july 
natos defense ministers will meet next week outside calgary 
canada to discuss their nuclear strategy they will gather again 
in late may in brussels for further talks about military operations 
in early june the foreign ministers hold a twiceyearly meeting

lawmakers are pushing for faster action on a 
bill to combat job discrimination but are making clear the measure 
wont apply to what one congressman calls the last plantation 
capitol hill itself 
the house education and labor committee voted 219 on thursday 
against applying provisions of the civil rights bill to 
congressional staffers who have long been exempted from the fair 
hiring measures enacted by their bosses 
some say the last plantation is here on capitol hill said 
rep charles hayes dill who nevertheless voted with the 
majority against extending the bill to cover house employees 
the bill would overturn six supreme court decisions last year 
that brought strong protests from civil rights forces 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to fair hiring measures that make it easier for 
plaintiffs to win discrimination lawsuits against employers 
rep steve bartlett rtexas offered the amendment to extend 
the measure to house employees supporters were mainly republicans 
who are critical of the overall bill while democrats who support 
the bill opposed bartletts plan 
bartlett offered his measure as hayes and other lawmakers called 
for faster action on the bill chairman augustus hawkins dcalif 
is hoping for final action by the education and labor panel on 
tuesday the bill then goes to the house judiciary committee 
members of congress long have been jealous guardians of their 
own patronage powers and efforts to establish job protection for 
capitol hill aides generally have been scrapped with little delay 
weakening this traditional system could make the bill less 
palatable to some lawmakers and rep william clay dmo 
suggested that since bartlett is an outspoken foe of the measure he 
might have offered his plan for mischievous reasons 
i think its a question of motivation clay said i doubt 
its the gentlemans intention to modify the bill to the point 
where he will cast a vote for it if he were sincere he would 
include the senate in this as well 
rep william f goodling rpa the panels ranking republican 
immediately called on clay to have his words stricken from the 
record saying questioning another lawmakers motives violated a 
house rule 
i dont think i want to sit in a situation where we are 
questioning each others motives he said clay initially refused 
to back down but within a few minutes he asked to have his words 
stricken 
rep craig washington dtexas praised the idea of 
antidiscrimination safeguards for house employees but he said it 
would be wiser to do so with separate legislation that would be 
free of the frailties of current law 
on the roll call both washington and goodling responded 
present 
rep harris fawell rill told the lawmakers however that 
the same tough penalties in current law that affect employers 
should also apply to congressmen who discriminate we ought to be 
subjected individually to multimilliondollar lawsuits too 
fawell declared

german unity wont be the only thing 
on the minds of the four world war ii victors when they sit down 
saturday for reunification talks 
as in potsdam in 1945 and paris in 1919 the european balance of 
power will be very much at issue as in those two watershed years 
developments in germany once again are the reason 
foreign ministers of the soviet union the united states france 
and britain will sit with counterparts from both germanys in a 
first attempt to iron out the complex strategic problems posed by 
ending germanys 41yearold division 
saturdays round at the west german foreign ministry will likely 
be the first of many 
german unification is the ostensible theme of talks dubbed 
twoplusfour because of the two germanys and four allies 
however the stakes involve all of europe 
nato insists it still has an important role in europe and wants 
a united germany as a member 
but the soviets are worried about the implications of losing 
east germany as their most important military ally especially 
since their influence across eastern europe is rapidly waning 
james a baker iii the us secretary of state said this week 
the soviets should not have a say in whether a united germany 
belongs to the western military alliance but baker said he will 
listen to the views of soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze when the two meet in bonn for the twoplusfour talks 
there will be indeed a very full and complete discussion of 
that issue because that is one of the foremost issues right now 
that separate the alliance from the position of the soviet union 
baker said 
the united states and west germany have offered a solution a 
united germany would belong to nato but soviet troops would remain 
temporarily on east german soil while nato troops keep out of that 
territory 
moscow has rejected that idea suggesting a compromise that the 
west rebuffed making a united germany a member of both the 
sovietled warsaw pact and nato until alternative security 
structures can be set up within europe 
western diplomats worry the soviets will try to widen the agenda 
of the twoplusfour talks to include disarmament matters and to 
embrace moscows hopes of setting up brandnew security structures 
within europe 
broadening the agenda could slow the unification process 
both west germany and the united states have tried to allay 
soviet worries about unification 
washington said thursday it had scrapped plans to modernize 
shortrange nuclear missiles based in west germany 
west germany has said the soviet unions security interests will 
be guaranteed it seems to be offering the soviets economic 
incentives to make up for the loss of east germany as their biggest 
trading partner 
conference participants hope to defuse widespread concerns in 
europe that a stronger germany could again pose a threat to 
countries overrun during the two world wars 
the six nations have already agreed to invite poland to the 
talks when its western border is discussed 
west german chancellor helmut kohl earlier this year caused a 
furor by refusing to guarantee a united germany would not try to 
reclaim land ceded to poland after world war ii 
kohl has since reversed himself but poland will still be taking 
part in the talks at some point to press home its concerns 
after both world wars germany was at the center of 
international talks that helped shape the future of europe 
in july 1945 the leaders of the united states britain and the 
soviet union met in potsdam now in east germany and carved up 
vanquished germany 
in january 1919 27 nations gathered in paris to try to make 
sure germany would never again threaten europe after the carnage of 
world war i 
the result was the treaty of versailles which exacted huge 
reparations from germany and aggravated german bitterness that 
helped adolf hitler rise to power 
the west germans want speedy results from the new talks 
especially now that the two germanys have agreed to merge their two 
economies by july 2 they say they would to finish the talks by 
fall to make way for allgerman elections and full unification next 
year

the senate sponsor of a law to curb hate 
crimes against minority groups is calling on the justice 
department to expand a newly established hotline to include all 
victims of unlawful acts of bigotry 
i firmly believe that the hotline should be open to all those 
victimized by hate and prejudice sen paul simon dill said 
thursday in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
he sent his letter as a spokesman for the justice departments 
community relations service which operates the hotline confirmed 
that it does not record information concerning crimes involving the 
victims sexual orientation 
spokesman daryl borgquist said however that the hotline has 
not turned away calls from victims of crimes linked to their 
religious affiliation 
i have heard that people who have been victimized because of 
their sexual orientation or religion have already been told that 
the hotline cannot assist them simon told thornburgh 
he said he was troubled by the report and urged thornburgh to 
extend the hotline to handle all of the types of cases that would 
be covered under the hate crimes measure signed into law by 
president bush on april 23 
the hotline was not part of the legislation establishing it was 
an administration initiative 
under the law the government must compile statistics on crimes 
of bigotry and publish them along with the annual uniform crime 
reports 
borgquist said the hotline would not accept information from 
homosexuals who were victims of hate crimes because the 1964 civil 
rights act that created the community relations service set its 
target as problems related to race color or national origin 
sexual preference was not included in the mandate and thus 
the service could not act in the case of hate crimes against them 
he said recommending that victimized homosexuals notify the fbi 
an operator who answered the hotline number when it was called 
by the associated press on thursday said it did not accept 
information about hate crimes based on either sexual preference or 
religious affiliation 
asked if the hotline would accept information about crimes that 
represented clear acts of antisemitism she said that such matters 
would not fall within the limits 
it may be that the operator who told you that didnt have as 
much training as somebody else borgquist said he said the 
hotline was being operated on thursday by employees of the 
services immigration and refugee office and that they had received 
less training than those who answered the phones on other days 
a spokesman for the national gay and lesbian task force which 
notified news organizations of the practice criticized the justice 
department for the decision its an outrage robert bray said 
it amounts to the revictimization of gay people 
bray said his organization had also contacted the offices of 
reps gerry studds and barney frank dmass two openly homosexual 
members of congress to obtain help in changing the policy

mayor marion barry invoked his fifth amendment 
right against selfincrimination when asked whether he had used 
drugs in the previous five years according to court papers 
barry facing a june 4 trial on cocaine possession and perjury 
charges invoked his constitutional right in a letter a year ago to 
the us attorneys office 
the letter followed two appearances by barry before a federal 
grand jury on jan 19 and jan 24 1989 
i have been advised by my attorney of your desire to pose 
a further question to me on whether i have used within the past 
five years any illegal drug said barrys jan 25 1989 letter 
on advice of counsel i elect to assert my fifth amendment 
privilege against selfincrimination said the mayor 
the government released barrys letter thursday in opposing the 
mayors motion to suppress barrys earlier grand jury testimony 
that testimony led to three felony perjury charges and the mayor 
also is accused of five misdemeanor counts of possessing cocaine 
in his grand jury testimony barry asserted that he wasnt aware 
of drug use by an associate charles lewis and that the mayor and 
lewis hadnt given each other cocaine 
lewis now is the governments chief witness against barry 
a conviction on any of the perjury charges would bar barry from 
holding office or seeking reelection 
neither barry nor his spokeswoman lurma rackley were 
immediately available to comment on the documents 
meanwhile the district of columbia democratic party defeated a 
resolution thursday night that would have asked barry not to seek 
reelection 
the proposal voted down 2923 declared barrys leadership in 
question and requested that he announce that he will not seek 
renomination in 1990 
barry has not publicly disclosed his future political plans 
however he has made numerous campaignstyle appearance since his 
return to the city from seven weeks of treatment for substance 
abuse sources close to the mayor said barry intends to run for a 
fourth fouryear term 
in a letter to williams barry called the resolution 
undemocratic because it undermines the right of the voter to 
decide 
barry also said the partys action would have little influence 
on my decision about my political future

senate democrats and republicans are laying 
out sharply contrasting proposals to change the way their campaigns 
are financed with each party seeking to protect the current 
advantages it enjoys 
democrats on thursday unveiled a package to slash in half the 
amount of money candidates now raise and spend on campaigns by 
imposing ceilings with a lure that the government would pick up 
part of the remaining tab 
republicans claiming it is the source of money rather than the 
amount spent that is corrupting politics had announced a proposal 
tuesday to outlaw political action committees and effectively 
prohibit unions from underwriting campaigns 
both parties embrace proposals to encourage candidates to rely 
more on small contributions of less than 100 250 or 1000 from 
instate donors 
however critics said the plans leave large loopholes for 
raising socalled special interest money through national and state 
party organizations 
the democratic plan for example would outlaw pac contributions 
to individual candidates but still allow the two national parties 
to raise up to 5 million from such sources and their house and 
senate campaign committees even more 
and state party organizations under both plans could still raise 
large amounts via directmail drives and from wealthy individuals 
in case of the gop and for democrats through those sources plus 
unions and pacs 
does it need to be improved of course it does said joan 
claybrook president of public citizen a group that advocates 
total federal financing of campaigns but to me its a giant 
step 
under the democratic plan about 70 percent of a federal 
candidates general election campaign expenses but none of the 
costs for primary races would be paid by the government from 
money raised through a proposed 3 checkoff on income tax returns 
through the checkoff taxpayers could voluntarily designate 3 
of the refunds they are due or add 3 to the taxes they owe for a 
special government account to finance congressional races 
since the middle 1970s tax returns have included a checkoff 
that allows taxpayers to designate 1 of their owed taxes to a fund 
for financing presidential campaigns 
the new ceilings that democrats are proposing on senate 
campaigns are about 20 percent higher than in a previous democratic 
package reported out of the senate rules committee two months ago 
covering both primary and general elections the new limits 
would range from 19 million in small states to slightly more than 
10 million in the most populous california 
were not going to get hung up on the percentages or the 
specific amounts said sen david boren dokla the chief 
author of the package everything is negotiable from our point of 
view except that we have to have some limit on overall spending 
republicans reacted with disdain to the proposal sen mitch 
mcconnell of kentucky the partys point man on the issue said the 
combination of public financing and campaign ceilings would sharply 
curtail the gops ability to regain control of congress 
including house races taxpayers would pick up a 400 million 
tab each election cycle for an incumbents protection bill 
mcconnell said unless youre a sitting governor or a movie star 
no challenger is ever again going to win a political race 
sen joseph biden ddel said democrats embraced a bigger role 
for public financing after rejecting it earlier out of a sense of 
vulnerability in the wake of recent campaign financing scandals 
the biggest of those is the keating five senators under 
investigation by an ethics panel for interceding with savings and 
loan regulators on behalf of phoenix financier charles h keating 
jr after accepting 13 million in campaign gifts from him 
what were all willing to trade off is the vulnerability of 
having a wellfunded legitimate opponent because with public 
financing thats a guarantee versus the vulnerability of having 
our reputations ruined and not being able to defend ourselves 
biden said

the state department calls totally false 
cubas claim that the united states is planning a largescale 
military attack against the caribbean nation 
a dispatch from the cuban government news agency prensa latina 
from havana monitored in mexico city on thursday said cuba had 
mounted largescale defense measures to repel any us intrusion 
into cuban territory from the us naval base at guantanamo on 
cubas southeastern coast 
an effort called operation shield comprising a squad of 
armored cars a squadron of sovietmade t54 tanks artillery units 
and an antiaircraft unit composed of women had been deployed in 
an energetic movement of defense forces the report said 
reports reaching washington said cuba also called up military 
reserves cancelled leaves and launched mig29 jet fighters in 
response to the opening of us military exercises off the eastern 
end of the island near guantanamo 
the state department acknowledged that military exercises are 
under way but described them as routine 
cuban claims about the possibility of a us attack on cuba are 
totally false and appear designed to muster antiamerican 
sentiment among the cuban people and to draw attention away from 
cubas very real internal difficulties said state press officer 
adam shub 
shub said the exercises being carried out are called ocean 
venture global shield and defex 
ocean venture is a combined exercise involving the army navy 
marines and coast guard and is a routine readiness drill he said 
global shield is another readiness training exercise coordinated 
through sac 
defex is a routine defense reinforcementevacuation exercise 
no additional details were available but cuban accounts have 
said that defex involves the evacuation of civilian personnel from 
the guantanamo base 
prensa latina quoted the cuban army as saying there were 18 us 
ships at guantanamo instead of the usual six including two 
tanklanding transports 
the dispatch said reporters watching through the base fence 
could see c130 transports unloading equipment 
pentagon sources speaking on condition of anonymity said some 
exercises began last week and would last two weeks involving seven 
warships marines air force and army units elements of the 82nd 
airborne division from fort bragg nc and support elements from 
guantanamo 
the us navy has operated from that base for several decades 
despite objections from the cuban government that the american 
presence is illegal every ship in the atlantic fleet is required 
to undergo refresher training at the base every three years or 
after a major overhaul 
cuban officials have been expressing concern for the past 
several days about the exercises

president alfredo cristiani 
said the government and leftist rebels communicating through a 
un mediator will likely hold direct talks in the coming days 
cristiani said thursday that alvaro de soto special envoy of 
un secretary general javier perez del cuellar was working with 
the two sides to draft an agenda 
the salvadoran president was to meet again today with de soto 
who is acting under an agreement the two sides reached in geneva in 
april in efforts to end a 10yearold civil war that has killed an 
estimated 72000 people 
we believe that we can advance rapidly he told reporters at 
the presidential offices once the direct talks are begun this 
will become more dynamic 
he predicted that facetoface meetings could begin in a week 
and a half 
de soto who arrived wednesday met with cristiani and political 
leaders to discuss their positions 
in a proposal the mediator gave cristiani on wednesday the 
farabundo marti national liberation front guerrillas offered to lay 
down their weapons and take part in upcoming legislative and 
municipal elections if the military gets rid of some of its far 
right officers and undertakes political reforms 
cristiani warned that if the united states cuts military aid to 
el salvador he could be forced to seek assistance elsewhere to 
make up for the deficit but he did not say where 
he said another alternative in the event of an aid cut would be 
a reduction in spending for social programs which would hurt the 
poor he did not give any details 
a new aid package for el salvador is being considered on capitol 
hill the bush administration wants 375 million for el salvador 
next year including 90 million in military aid 
however the united states has indicated that continued aid will 
be linked to el salvadors response to the slaying of six jesuit 
priests at central american university in november 
a colonel three lieutenants and five soldiers were charged in 
the killings cristiani admits the killings were carried out by the 
miltary but critics complain the investigation should reach higher 
the state department has said secretary of state james a baker 
iii would send a congressional report criticizing the salvadoran 
probe of the killings to cristiani and make it clear that the 
resolution of this case will be one important element in 
determining the nature of future us assistance 
el salvador said tuesday it hopes the case will go to trial 
within 90 days 
in addition to pressuring the salvadoran government to make 
progress in investigating the jesuit deaths the united states has 
called for goodfaith negotiation with the rebels

elders have chosen the patriarch of the ukraine to 
head the russian orthodox church until a permanent replacement is 
decided for the late patriarch pimen the official soviet news 
agency tass reported today 
the churchs holy synod early today chose as pimens acting 
successor metropolitan filaret of the ukraine 
radio moscow reported today that a permanent patriarch will be 
selected within six months by the local council made up of all 
metropolitans archbishops and bishops as well as representatives 
of the clergy and laity 
pimen a pious monk who presided over the church during years of 
repression and a recent reawakening died thursday at the age of 79 
after a long illness 
pimen had served as patriarch of the church since 1971 leading 
tens of millions of believers under a government that has been 
officially atheist since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 
critics said pimen was too much under control of the kremlin 
but his supporters said that he preserved the spiritual integrity 
of the church in hard times 
the new patriarch will face the challenge of rebuilding the 
church under relaxed political controls 
the soviet parliament sent a telegram signed by vice president 
anatoly lukyanov expressing condolences to the church over the 
loss of pimen who over the years had actively backed kremlin 
peace initiatives and arms control proposals 
radio moscow said a funeral was planned sunday at the monastery 
of the trinity and st sergius in zagorsk 45 miles from moscow 
pimen is likely to be remembered as a pious monk who complied 
with the will of soviet authorities before relious tolerance 
increased under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev who took power 
in 1985 
pimen appeared to be a devout clergyman who could change with 
the times becoming a cleric during a period of harsh repression 
under josef stalin and rising through the church during the 
anticlerical campaigns of nikita s khrushchev and the less 
oppressive rule of leonid i brezhnev 
he followed the khrushchev line on closing churches and never 
contradicted any party orders said alexander ogorodnikov a 
religious dissident released from prison under gorbachev 
but at the same time he was trying all the time to keep 
russian church from declining to heresy said ogorodnikov

british carnivores and vegetarians are chewing 
over the scriptures in an argument about whose diet enjoys divine 
sanction 
britains agriculture minister john selwyn gummer started the 
flap by declaring that the bible tells us that we are masters of 
the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field and we very 
properly eat them 
if the almighty had wanted us to have three stomachs like 
cattle i am sure he could have arranged it but he chose to make 
us omnivores instead gummer told cheering members of the 
international meat trade association who were gathered tuesday at 
butchers hall in london 
gummer a member of the church of englands governing general 
synod declared himself fed up with deeply undemocratic food 
faddists who make a religion of their diets 
the ministers comment provoked a gristly reaction in many 
quarters starting with his grasp of biology 
for many years i have understood that cattle have four 
stomachs edward bullen of st albans said in a letter in 
fridays editions of the times 
joyce dsilva an official for compassion in world farming said 
thursday that gummer had ignored genesis 129 in which that same 
almighty tells man to eat every herbbearing seed and every 
tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it 
shall be for meat 
gummer was selectively using the bible i thought if he could 
do it then we could do it she said 
her organization advocates humane slaughter of animals and the 
abolition of intensive factory farming 
bernard wetherill the speaker of the house of commons jumped 
into the fray thursday by taking issue with gummer he cited romans 
141921 that says for meat destroy not the work of god 
for its part the vegetarian society found inspiring reading in 
isaiah and none more vivid than the third verse of chapter 66 
he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth 
a lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck he that offereth an 
oblation as if he offered swines blood 
linda farmer assistant to the societys manager also pointed 
approvingly to the first chapter of daniel in which the prophet 
purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the 
portion of the kings meat 
after 10 days it was recorded daniel and his companions 
appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which 
did eat the portion of the kings meat 
a recent poll by the realeat co makers of the vegeburger 
indicated that 10 percent of those surveyed said they were avoiding 
red meat or eating no meat at all 
i want to see more articles about the sensible 90 percent who 
are still eating meat gummer said 
tony gordon executive director of the international meat trade 
association had no bible verses to offer he said gummers speech 
was all fairly lighthearted 
but of course the vegetarians some of them have reacted with 
horror perhaps with less sense of humor than most meat eaters 
would have gordon said thursday 
the meat industry is especially unhappy with the humberside 
local council in northeastern england which has banned beef from 
school lunches because of concern about mad cow disease 
the disease which attacks the brain has resulted in the 
destruction of more than 11000 cattle but the government says 
there is no significant danger to humans 
jane brophy a research officer at the vegetarian society 
offered several biblical citations in support of her diet 
however matthew 34 which tells of john the baptist eating 
locusts and wild honey was not among them 
no she said with a laugh were not recommending that

more than 1000 police firing tear gas raided a 
detention camp for vietnamese refugees today and hauled away about 
200 boat people after a week of escape attempts at the overcrowded 
compound 
several hundred detainees put up barricades of iron rods and 
bedding to block police authorities in riot gear fired more than 
100 canisters of tear gas after some boat people attempted to 
attack with homemade weapons said police spokesman eman kwong 
two police were the only people injured he said 
the crackdown came a day after the top un refugee relief 
official in hong kong said that whitehead camp has turned into an 
outofcontrol monster 
the official robert van leeuwen said overcrowding combined 
with the despair of many detainees who fear they may never 
resettle had helped create the problem 
about 1200 police backed by armored vehicles moved in about 5 
am today the helmeted police joined about 300 other security 
officers in a search for homemade weapons which typically consist 
of spears knives and axes made of iron bars 
they took away the estimated 200 vietnamese as suspected 
troublemakers those refugees were transferred to other detention 
centers in this british colony for investigation by security 
officials authorities said 
in addition 10 vietnamese were arrested as police searched 
whitehead dormitories for the homemade weapons 
the main purpose is to restore law and order in the camp and 
boost morale kwong said he said it took about an hour to secure 
the camp and searched continued throughout the day 
the search uncovered about 2500 weapons kwong said 
the camp has been housing more than 22000 boat people 
early thursday police fired tear gas into whitehead to stop an 
escape attempt by about 50 vietnamese 
on sunday about 100 boat people cut through fences and escaped 
from the camp 
about 55000 vietnamese boat people are in hong kong camps 
awaiting resettlement overseas or repatriation to vietnam 
under a policy adopted in 1988 to stem the tide of arriving 
vietnamese refugees do not qualify for resettlement if they fled 
their homeland for economic reasons the vast majority of detainees 
affected by the new law are expected to face forced repatriation to 
their communist homeland

a former city prosecutor won a record 34 
million libel suit against the philadelphia inquirer in a case that 
stemmed from newspaper stories written 17 years ago 
a common pleas court jury on thursday awarded 25 million in 
compensatory damages and 315 million in punitive damages to 
lawyer richard a sprague a former first assistant district 
attorney 
the decision was the largest award ever against the news media 
surpassing the 28 million won last month by a heart surgeon 
against a san antonio television station 
the judgment was more than seven times the 45 million verdict 
that the inquirer had successfully appealed from the first trial in 
the case 
sprague sued in 1983 over articles dating to 1973 that 
questioned his actions and decisions as a prosecutor 
his attorney james e beasley said the jurys verdict sent a 
message to investigative reporters not to destroy somebodys 
reputation 
inquirer executive editor and president eugene l roberts jr 
said the newspaper would appeal the decision 
the award amounts to about onethird of the newspapers net 
worth said the inquirers attorney samuel e klein roberts said 
the newspaper would be able to stay in business if the judgment 
stands but we would be crippled 
the inquirer has won 17 pulitzer prizes in the last 16 years 
many of them stemming from investigative stories 
a libel case observer said thursday the huge award stood little 
chance of surviving an appeals challenge 
based on the trends one would have to assume that this award 
cannot stand up on appeal said henry kaufman general counsel of 
the libel defense resource center in new york 
kaufman said only two libel judgments of more than 1 million 
have been affirmed on appeal 
i am a very strong advocate of first amendment rights said 
beasley what i dont tolerate and i dont think society should 
tolerate is the use of investigative reporters or the power of the 
press for a personal vendetta and that is what developed here 
he said greg walter one of the reporters involved in the 
stories had threatened to get and destroy sprague who had 
prosecuted walter in 1972 for taping a conversation without the 
other persons knowledge 
walter has since died 
roberts the newspapers president complained that the judge 
eliminated 13 witnesses who would have helped the papers case and 
rejected an investigative report by a former state attorney general 
that supported the inquirer story 
i am confident that however long it takes the inquirer will 
prevail said roberts most of our case never got to the jury 
judge charles p mirarchi jr mirarchi said sprague required a 
preponderance of evidence to prove statements defamed him and 
had to meet the tougher standard of clear and convincing 
evidence to prove falsity actual malice and damages 
sprague sued over articles that he said implied he was involved 
in an illegal wiretapping incident an allegation he denied and 
questioned his role in a homicide case involving a son of a friend 
former state police commissioner rocco urella 
an eightweek trial resulted in the verdict for sprague in 1983 
the state supreme court in june 1988 ordered a new trial 
declaring reporters have an absolute right to invoke the state 
shield law in refusing to identify confidential sources during 
legal proceedings 
in the original trial judge charles a lord ruled the law did 
not apply in the case and excluded all testimony about information 
from unidentified sources

eight years ago this village of 250 
families in the foothills of the berkshires had its own baby boom 
when 29 women gave birth two to twins and three others adopted 
children 
now the youngsters are in school and townsfolk are struggling to 
come up with the money to educate them 
it was the first time in the history of the town that goes 
back over 200 years that there had been so many babies said 
karen barshefski the towns parent teacher organization president 
who was one of the new mothers in 1982 yankee magazine even came 
out and took our picture 
we have a tax limit override vote on saturday and i cant 
even think about what we will do if that doesnt pass said 
selectwoman julia sharron who doubles as town librarian 
school costs up more than 130000 over last year make up 
nearly onethird of the towns 17 million proposed budget she 
said and the state has cut back on its help to schools and towns 
as its own money problems have worsened 
mrs barshefski has spent the past several saturdays with other 
mothers campaigning for the override but shes pessimistic about 
the outcome 
we rely a lot on volunteer help like most small towns and we 
have cut back as much as we can even when it comes to keeping up 
the roads mrs sharron said but the kids have to get an 
education the most important thing anyone can give a child is 
education 
the baby boom has overwhelmed the communitys fiveroom school 
with 92 students in kindergarten through fourth grade last year 
residents remodeled the basement and moved the kindergarten and the 
library there to make room for a second firstgrade class 
and as worthingtons enrollment zoomed by nearly onethird in 
the last five years it was also called on to finance a larger 
share of the regional school districts budget that encompasses 
seven towns said duane wynan assistant superintendent the 
regional school systems costs are split among the towns based on 
the number of schoolchildren who attend from each town 
worthingtons baby boom came just about the same time the 
states voters approved proposition 2 which limits communities to 
raising tax levies 25 percent annually until they reach 25 
percent of assessed valuation and like many small towns with small 
budgets worthington soon felt the pinch 
over the past several years its 1200 residents have approved 
three overrides of the tax limit saturdays vote would add 1250 
to the 8960 bill of a homeowner with a house assessed at 100000

the church doesnt like it but never mind 
street vendors are everywhere in the capital hawking tshirts and 
medallions comic books and posters for the upcoming visit of pope 
john paul ii 
he arrives sunday for an eightday visit 
the roman catholic church had asked that mexicans not 
commercialize the popes second visit to this country but the 
papal image is showing up on key rings and beachwear anyway 
salesmen blare recordings of hastilywritten pope songs over 
portable tape players to advertise their wares 
vendors around the capitals guadalupe basilica mexicos 
holiest shrine where the pope will visit are to be moved out 
today officials said 
on mexico citys reforma one of two main streets bisecting the 
capital a tshirt vendor displays an item welcoming the pope 
between two others proclaiming in large type i got drunk in 
mexico 
cardinal ernesto corripio ahumada the head of the church in 
mexico says people are selling bogus tickets that supposedly admit 
the bearer to religious events where the pope will be 
not only the vatican but the episcopal conference of mexico 
has insisted that this visit not be commercialized corripio said 
newspaper ads offer gold and silver coins with the popes image 
which also can be found on porcelain plates plastic bottles and 
candy 
nearly a million street vendors and a similar number of 
establishments and commercial centers have transformed in recent 
weeks faith into fanaticism said the government newspaper el 
nacional 
the pope trade also is brisk in the provinces he will visit

tyler texas prosecutors said they would seek life prison 
terms for three white former guards convicted of beating a black 
prisoner to death on christmas day 1987 
an allwhite jury was to begin hearing testimony today to decide 
sentencing for former hemphill police chief thomas ladner and 
former sabine county sheriffs deputies billy ray horton and james 
m hyden 
the same jury found the men guilty thursday of murdering loyal 
garner jr on dec 27 1987 
the three men face terms of 5 to 99 years in texas the 
sentencing phase of a trial can take days 
theres no question that justice was done in this case for 
loyal garner jr and for his family smith county district 
attorney jack skeen said 
garner a 34yearold father of six from florien la died of 
severe head injuries after his arrest on drunken driving charges 
two days earlier 
garners widow corrinne garner cried quietly as the verdict 
was announced his mother sarah garner said im glad i hope 
its over 
the verdict caught many by surprise the three were acquitted in 
july 1988 of having violated garners civil rights while that case 
was pending the men were indicted on murder charges 
defense attorneys tried to stop the murder trial contending the 
charges constituted double jeopardy 
a federal judge last month ordered the trial to proceed 
defense attorneys promised an appeal 
its double jeopardy they tried them exactly twice for 
exactly the same crime said john seale ladners attorney 
former us attorney john hannah who was special prosecutor in 
the civil rights trial said he was not surprised by the verdict 
i thought with a fair judge and an impartial jury and a 
competent prosecutor that it was a foregone conclusion he said 
there wasnt a day come that i didnt look up to heaven and 
talk to god about it garners mother said

china today marked the 71st anniversary of its 
first democracy movement criticizing last mays proreform rallies 
and appealing to young people to devote themselves to communism 
the communist youth league and other official groups organized 
functions to commemorate the may 4th movement but there were 
no reports of unauthorized student activities 
last year on the 70th anniversary of the movement about 
100000 students and supporters surged into tiananmen square for a 
peaceful rally seeking greater freedom an end to official 
corruption and a free press 
the demonstration was one of the high points of the sevenweek 
democracy movement that ended on june 4 when the military stormed 
beijing and seized tiananmen from the students who had occupied it 
the government has since suppressed any further student unrest 
through a harsh campaign of ideological education and intimidation 
the partys official peoples daily in a frontpage editorial 
today said the message to be learned from the may 4th movement 
is that the spirit of patriotism is to be devoted to the cause of 
socialism and the socialist modernization of the motherland 
in an indirect reference to last years student demands for 
rapid democratic reform it noted that in a greenhouse you 
cannot grow trees which reach to the sky 
communist party chief jiang zemin in a speech to about 3000 
invited youths thursday also stressed that last years student 
movement was different from that of may 4 1919 
in 1919 several thousand college students gathered at tiananmen 
gate to demand democracy and modernization their protest sparked 
an intellectual movement that included the creation and expansion 
of the communist party 
jiang said the 1919 campaign was a great antiimperialism and 
antifeudalism movement whereas student activists in 1989 bound 
themselves with foreign hostile forces and conducted activities 
harmful to the motherland 
officially organized events today included the start of a youth 
festival and communist youth leaguesponsored entertainment at a 
park adjacent to the forbidden city 
invited youths watched fashion shows hair styling singing and 
band performances there were booths selling clothing and food and 
a hall for dancing 
tiananmen square was open to the public but large numbers of 
police patrolled the square and its environs 
what became known as the may 4th movement began as a protest of 
the versailles treaty that ended world war i chinas warlord 
government agreed to treaty clauses that endorsed japans seizure 
of parts of china during the war 
although the treaty was the immediate spark that caused the 
protest the main slogans of the students were democracy and 
science by which they meant modernization the government now is 
choosing to eliminate the democracy angle and stress the 
antiimperialism and science aspects of the movement

was restored in 1974 after a military dictatorship 
caramanlis 83 a sixtime prime minister and former president 
won 153 votes of the 299 cast 
he needed a simple majority in the 300member parliament to be 
elected to a fiveyear term in the largely ceremonial post of 
president in the first round of voting monday he fell short of 
the required 180 votes 
caramanlis returns to the post which he established and held 
from 1980 to 1985 he was backed chiefly by the governing 
conservative partys 150 deputies 
the socialists and the communistled coalition of the left and 
progress did not support caramanlis who founded the governing new 
democracy party in 1974 
prime minister constantine mitstotakis expressed satisfaction 
with caramanliss election 
with the great respect he enjoys both at home and abroad 
caramanlis will help the country at this time of crisis said 
mitsotakis after the voting 
the conservative government recently announced a series of 
economic austerity measures in a bid to cope with high inflation 
and rising deficits 
caramanlis was greeces first prime minister after a 196774 
military dictatorship overseeing the return to democracy and 
establishing the presidency after holding a referendum that 
abolished the monarchy 
he became the republics third president in 1980 resigning in 
1985 shortly after the socialist government at the time reneged on 
a promise to support his bid for reelection

the lawrence county council is going to 
jail but only for a visit 
the three commissioners plan to try out a new 5 million county 
jail may 29 the jail is nearing completion in downtown bedford 
since the council represents the voters of lawrence county and 
is spending that kind of money i think we should make sure we are 
receiving ultimate value for that 5 million said council 
president jack cummings 
the 80cell jail also includes the sheriffs new offices and new 
county court facilities 
sheriff jerry ross said his wife charlotte who is the jail 
chief matron will get a chance to try out kitchen equipment when 
she prepares breakfast for the council 
i think its a good idea the sheriff said it will give 
the elected officials an idea of what it takes to operate that jail 
and maybe they will get an idea on how much help its going to take 
and maybe we can find some of the bugs before we put the inmates in 
it

soccer fans in a central asian city rioted when a 
game was canceled looting and setting fire to scores of buildings 
official media said today at least 44 people were reported injured 
the independent news service post factum claimed an intoxicated 
mob killed the director of the soccer stadium and burned the 
structure down in the violence wednesday but the other reports did 
not confirm that 
however the reports said the fans many intoxicated looted and 
set fires across andizhan a city in the fergana valley of eastern 
uzbekistan 
the reports could not be independently confirmed because 
communications with andizhan were cut 
the area is plagued with severe unemployment with 80000 
jobless among the andizhan regions population of 16 million 
last summer more than 100 people were killed in ethnic clashes 
between uzbeks and another turkish ethnic group the meskhetians 
in the nearby city of fergana 
the soccer rioters attacked the andizhan regional communist 
party headquarters and the city prosecutors office as well as 125 
other buildings 79 stores and 36 homes the official tass news 
agency reported 
they set fire to 13 stores 46 workshops and dozens of homes 
they also destroyed 18 institutions including libraries reported 
pravda the newspaper of the communist party 
interior ministry troops restored order the reports said 
the violence began when 10000 fans waiting in midafternoon 
heat were told a visiting team from the uzbekistan republics 
capital of tashkent had failed to show up for a game pravda said 
when officials announced the game was canceled the crowd began 
to throw rocks and beat the chairman of the soccer club the 
newspaper said fans set fire to two police cars and an automobile 
that was to be a door prize pravda said 
the injured included 13 interior ministry troops 10 policemen 
and 11 civilians tass said 
in its report post factum said the crowd armed with automatic 
weapons rampaged through neighborhoods of russians armenians and 
jews leaving the armenian quarter smoldering 
the news service also quoted an unidentified member of the 
visiting team as saying the game was canceled not because the team 
failed to appear but because the attacks were planned

at a gathering of garbagemen models in cocktail 
dresses circled spiffy white garbage trucks while tiedyed 
salespeople hawked jewelry for sanitation workers 
last months earth day has americans excited about a mundane 
task throwing out the trash and it was easy to see at waste expo 
90 that garbage is not only chic but good business 
the annual convention of the national solid wastes management 
association drew more than 10000 people this week to the georgia 
world congress center they attended seminars like women in 
waste and backyard basics how composting can improve your 
bottom line 
they looked over the latest geegaws for their industry from 
the cramalot compactor sentry system to computer software to 
recyclerfriendly garbage trucks 
amid all the glitz and glamour you never associated with 
garbage there was a common theme recycling is a good idea and a 
good business 
if we have another earth day everybodys going to be doing 
this said jerry andregg as he stood next to a fancy white 
garbage truck with four compartments for four separate kinds of 
garbage and a plastic masher in the middle 
its helped our business out he said it being earth 
day and its raised peoples awareness how important it is to 
start recycling 
you know those big buckets that schoolcafeteria mayonnaise come 
in well with colorcoding a hole for rainwater to drain out of 
and a snazzy logo on the front a company called plastican makes 
them into bins for household recyclables 
everyone wants to do it said plasticans doug mcgee it 
being recycling but everyones trying to figure out how to do 
it 
thats what thomas higgins figures he brought with him plenty 
of clear rather than colored plastic garbage bags 
the most effective way to run a curbside recycling program is 
to pick up the material in a clear bag said higgins manager of 
hefty recycling opportunities for the mobil chemical cos consumer 
products division 
the idea he said is that homeowners dont want 17 recycling 
bins cluttering up the garage and cities dont want to pay the 
garbageman to dawdle at the curb putting the brown beer bottles in 
one place the clear juice bottles in another place and the 
newspapers in a third place 
the answer clear garbage bags 
over at the dempster display john l thomas vice president for 
sales showed off a gleaming white garbage truck with a 
sideloading windowbox gizmo that dumps different kinds of garbage 
in the correct place in the truck 
earth day has really brought it into focus thomas said 
this recycling is the answer to our disposables problem 
so many of our landfills are filling up were running out of 
landfill space one way to extend landfill life is to put less in 
them he said 
were the only company with 14karat jewelry for sanitation 
from 115 to 5000 in stock said jimmy brett whos hawking 
stuff while his brother saul was back in new york minding the 
store 
saul brett inc makes goldcolored garbagecan tie tacks and 
goldanddiamond garbagetruck pins for the valued sanitation 
employee or the supportive sanitation spouse 
no one brett says does it like we do

from 1988 to 1989 and its treatment will require more expensive 
drugs federal researchers say 
a survey of 21 clinics that treat sexually transmitted disease 
found penicillinresistant gonorrhea increased 131 percent in the 
oneyear period the national centers for disease control said 
thursday 
tetracyclineresistant gonorrhea increased by 23 percent in the 
same period the survey found 
during the study period the national gonorrhea rate of 
infection remained basically unchanged with three cases reported 
in every 1000 americans 
the traditional and admittedly inexpensive therapies for 
gonorrhea penicillin and tetracycline really in many situations 
are not going to be the appropriate drugs for treating gonorrhea in 
1990 said william whittington a cdc specialist in sexually 
transmitted diseases 
the cdc survey found gonorrhea strains susceptible to two 
typically more expensive drugs ceftriaxone and spectinomycin 
ceftriaxone or similar treatment remains an integral component 
of the strategy for gonorrhea control the cdc said 
in the survey 20 male gonorrhea patients were tested each month 
for drug resistance 
resistance to penicillin which occurred in 32 percent of the 
study cases in 1988 increased to 74 percent in 1989 the cdc said 
resistance to tetracycline which occurred in 4 percent of the 
study cases in 1988 increased to 49 percent in 1989 the cdc said 
significant increases in penicillin resistance were reported 
at seven clinics atlanta birmingham ala boston long beach 
calif philadelphia san antonio and san diego 
penicillinresistant cases made up 32 percent of the cases in the 
long beach clinic last year 
significant increases in tetracycline resistance were reported 
in birmingham denver st louis and west palm beach fla while 
decreases were observed in atlanta and baltimore the highest rate 
of tetracycline resistance last year 20 percent was in 
philadelphia 
nationwide 738160 cases of gonorrhea were reported last year 
so far this year 215011 cases have been reported down slightly 
from 216088 at the same point in 1989

five driftnet fishing boats spotted in 
unauthorized areas are marked with north korean flags which would 
signal a new player in an international fray over use of such nets 
and high seas salmon fishing authorities said 
north korea has no diplomatic ties or fisheries treaties with 
the united states 
were trying to establish whether they are in fact north 
korean and if they are north korean why they have suddenly 
appeared out there this year said coast guard capt david a 
wirth in juneau 
we have never seen them before he said we dont know why 
theyre there 
the coast guard is tracking the ships with aircraft wirth said 
the ships were spotted tuesday by a coast guard plane officials 
said thursday they were fishing about 400 miles southwest of kiska 
island near the end of the aleutian chain in waters where 
driftnets likely would intercept salmon from north america 
while most driftnets ostensibly are set for squid critics say 
they illegally snag millions of dollars worth of us and canadian 
salmon the critics liken the floating nets stretching as long as 
30 miles to stripmining of the sea 
the ships flew north korean flags and had north korean markings 
on their smokestacks and bows coast guard officials said thursday 
four similar ships were spotted in the same area april 22 and 
24 the coast guard said 
its possible the north korean insignia is a disguise by vessels 
from other nations that could be pirating salmon in violation of 
agreements with the united states wirth said or the ships may be 
north korean on contract with other nations he said 
the united states has negotiated treaties with south korea 
japan and taiwan prohibiting the taking of north american salmon by 
driftnets it has a tentative agreement with the soviet union to 
cooperate to stop illegal salmon fishing in the north pacific us 
officials have asked the soviet union for help in investigating the 
ships 
our government called in the soviet fisheries attache 
wednesday and requested assistance said bill woolf fisheries 
aide to us sen frank h murkowski ralaska 
we hope the soviets will do their best to dissuade the north 
koreans if indeed these ships are theirs from high seas salmon 
fishing at best and at the very least to assist us in gathering 
information on the extent and duration of this fishery and if they 
have information on where the product is going woolf said 
coast guard photographs show the five ships appear to be new 
and are very well kept up with gobs and gobs of sophisticated 
electronics woolf said 
theyre not typical of the usual japanese and taiwanese 
driftnet fishing vessels which see some pretty rough usage he 
said 
photographs also show fish on the ships decks 
the ships may be violating the 1976 magnuson act which in part 
protects fish spawned in us rivers said henry mitchell 
executive director of the bering sea fishermens association in 
anchorage 
us law says our fish spawned in us rivers are under our 
protection when they are out at sea mitchell said

a killer who described himself and his 
girlfriend as a modernday bonnie and clyde was executed in 
floridas electric chair today for shooting two officers 14 years 
ago 
jessie joseph tafero was electrocuted at 713 am at florida 
state prison eight hours after the us supreme court denied a 
stay of execution exhausting his last appeal the governors 
office announced 
tafero 43 was the 22nd person put to death in florida since 
1979 and the 124th to die in the united states since the supreme 
court restored states rights to execute prisoners in 1976 it was 
a year to the day since floridas previous execution 
in a final statement tafero complained that lastminute motions 
filed on his behalf this morning with a federal judge and a state 
circuit court judge apparently were ignored 
id like to say that the death penalty as applied by the 
states is very arbitrary and capricious he said 
the executioner interrupted the standard twominute 2000volt 
electrical cycle because of the smoke and flames when a wet sponge 
on taferos head caught fire said state corrections department 
spokesman bob macmaster 
but he said the prisons chief medical officer dr frank kilgo 
believed tafero died quickly 
fewer than a dozen death penalty opponents demonstrated in 
silence with a candlelight vigil in a pasture outside the rural 
prison their posters said kinder gentler and 
civilizations finest hour 
four supporters of the death penalty peered through heavy fog 
watching the prison for a signal from departing reporters that 
tafero was dead 
taferos day began with a mass at 1 am celebrated by a roman 
catholic priest from the cathedral of st augustine he also was 
visited during the night by five attorneys and his mother kathleen 
tafero said macmaster 
he described tafero as quiet a little concerned about the 
event of course 
the killings occurred feb 20 1976 when a state trooper and a 
visiting canadian constable checked on a car parked on the highway 
where tafero his girlfriend sonja jacobs her two children and 
traveling companion walter rhodes jr were sleeping 
trooper phillip black died from gunshot wounds to the head and 
neck while constable donald irwin of kitchener ontario received 
fatal wounds to his right eye and shoulder both men were 39 
tafero ms jacobs and rhodes were convicted on murder charges 
rhodes got three concurrent life terms while tafero and ms jacobs 
were sentenced to death ms jacobs sentence was commuted to life 
in prison in 1981 
a letter in taferos file describes the reaction of blacks 
young son christian when he learned at school that his father had 
been killed 
his grief was so strong so unresolved and so overwhelming for 
this little boy that none of us knew how to help him wrote 
elementary school teacher claudia r jacobowitz 
an only child tafero was born in jersey city nj and moved 
to dade county at the age of 10 his father was a comedian and car 
salesman and his mother was a housewife 
court records show a considerable juvenile record beginning at 
age 13 he quit school at age 16 after the ninth grade in 1967 he 
was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape breaking and 
entering and robbery he spent six years in prison 
in a 1984 interview tafero said his arrest and sentencing with 
ms jacobs made them feel like modern day bonnie and clyde 
the couple had an infant daughter cristina tafero at the time 
of the shootings she lives in new york with guardians and recently 
visited tafero in prison 
the supreme court voted 72 not to stay the execution justices 
william brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose the death 
penalty dissented 
earlier thursday the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta turned down taferos request for a stay after us 
district judge lenore nesbitt in miami refused to issue a writ of 
habeas corpus in the case 
executions have been a hot political issue in this gubernatorial 
reelection year gov bob martinezs political advertisements 
stress that he has signed 122 death warrants since taking office 
and 26 this year

west germany should not give its currency to 
relatively rich east germans without investigating whether their 
wealth came from crooked dealings by the old communist regime a 
west german politician said today 
otto graf lambsdorff said higher bank accounts should be 
investigated before the east german marks are automatically 
exchanged for west german marks as part of an economic merger 
that is to go into effect on july 2 
lambsdorff leader of the free democrat party that is the junior 
governing partner in the government of west german chancellor 
helmut kohl made his comments to reporters in west berlin 
teams of experts from both countries resumed talks in east 
berlin today on the logistics of merging their economies 
particularly with finding a way to convert east germanys 
stateowned land and enterprises to the private sector 
under an agreement reached earlier between the nations most 
east german savings accounts of up to 4000 marks will be traded at 
a 11 rate for west german marks most accounts higher than that 
will be traded at a 21 rate 
lambsdorff said a ceiling which he did not specify should be 
set for larger accounts he said these should be investigated to 
make sure they were honestly acquired and not amassed illegally 
by for example members of the nowdisbanded secret police 
members of the feared secret police and officials of the former 
regime of ousted hardline communist leader erich honecker are 
believed to have large holdings in east german currency 
lambsdorff also repeated comments made by several west german 
officials on thursday that east germany must quickly convert its 
public property to the private sector 
virtually all enterprises and land are owned by the state under 
the socialist system now being phased out after four decades in 
power 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said thursday 
that private ownership of property and industry was crucial to 
creating a market economy that would spawn the jobs and income 
necessary to offset the loss of huge social subsidies 
he said many details have to be worked out but that private 
ownership is needed to cope with the widespread joblessness 
expected in east germany as the country is forced to compete in the 
free market 
from july onwards every company thats active in west germany 
can also become active in east germany haussmann said in bonn 
the west german capital 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere said he wanted an 
appropriate legal basis established for the purchase of land 
enterprises and governmentrun media by foreign concerns 
he said thursday he would block the uncontrolled acquisition 
of such governmentowned assets by west germans and foreigners 
the latest unification talks follow the agreement on conversion 
rates for changing east german marks to west german marks 
social democrats in the government of de maiziere who leads the 
conservative christian democrats sharply criticized the plan 
east german finance minister walter romberg said the agreement 
still does not give adequate protection to people earning low 
incomes and fails to include a mechanism to protect people when 
rents and livings costs rise in the free market 
east germans now are dependent on subsidized food housing and 
jobs 
a law that adjusts for social shortcomings in east germany 
is of essential significance romberg said in bonn where he 
met with west german finance minister theo waigel 
some east germans want guarantees that prices and rents will not 
rise at a vastly sharper rate than their wages kohls government 
says the influx of new western businesses will raise living 
standards in east germany 
the agreement would convert east german wages pensions and 
small savings accounts at a 11 exchange to the west german mark 
it also would convert debts owned by east german factories 
estimated at 200 billion east german marks at a 21 rate those 
debts now will be worth 100 billion west german marks or 60 
billion but with western interest rates 
some economists have said that the debts should be forgiven 
entirely to allow the factories to get a fresh start in the free 
market

the government has decided to allow people and 
captive dolphins swim together for at least another year 
permits for three swimwiththedolphis programs in florida and 
one in hawaii have been extended through the end of 1991 the 
national marine fisheries service announced the permits had been 
scheduled to expire april 30 
however for the time being no new permits will be issued and no 
new dolphins may be captured for use in these programs the agency 
said 
permits for the programs were first issued in 1985 the marine 
fisheries service reports that it has received hundreds of letters 
from environmentalists concerned about the health and safety of the 
dolphins involved 
the extension of the permits will require that the operators 
give the dolphins additional rest periods increased security and a 
means of escape from the swimming public 
the service said it has found no evidence that dolphins in these 
programs suffer any more health problems than dolphins on public 
display in aquariums however officials plan to monitor these 
programs during the coming year to determine if they should be 
allowed to continue and if other permits should be issued 
the fisheries service is a part of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration

skies were clear early today in northern texas and 
a dry spell forecast for the next few days was likely to alleviate 
the worst flooding in the region in more than half a century 
there was no rain early today but areas that were heavily 
flooded in the region could still experience problems forecasters 
warned they said that may is the regions wettest month any more 
heavy rain in the next couple of weeks is likely to cause 
substantial flooding said meteorologist skip ely 
for the first time in 33 years water gushed over the spillway 
at lake texoma dam into the red river which forms the 
texasoklahoma state line at least 100 people were evacuated from 
homes east and west of the lake in southern oklahoma 
the flooding extended downstream to arkansas where authorities 
were giving out sandbags and preparing emergency shelters today 
heavy rains damaged hundreds of homes and left at least three 
dead in the fort worth area on wednesday 
there is still water moving out there and moving water is 
dangerous said alton bostick emergency management coordinator 
for fort worth and tarrant county people should not drive into 
it they dont know the depth and if there are no barricades 
around they should be very cautious 
in dallas the trinity river crested thursday night at 47 feet 
17 feet above flood level its deepest level since 1949 
as much as 7 inches of rain fell from late wednesday to early 
thursday in some areas 
vice president dan quayle said while touring south of dallas on 
thursday that if gov bill clements applies for federal aid for 
other areas he will find a very cooperative president 
president bush signed a disaster declaration thursday for four 
counties hardhit in flooding last week country officials in 
dallas and fort worth were expected to begin applying for federal 
relief funds today 
boats cars and even dump trucks were used to evacuate people 
stranded on doorsteps and rooftops many roads were flooded

the california supreme court has ruled 
reporters can be required to testify in a criminal case if their 
testimony would help the defense 
the decision thursday involved a los angeles times reporter and 
photographer who had refused to testify in a weapons possession 
case citing the states shield law the law protects reporters 
from being held in contempt of court or jailed for refusing to 
disclose news sources or unpublished information 
the court unanimously concluded that the 1980 law protects 
observations made during news gathering in addition to 
undisclosed confidential notes or tapes 
but the court also ruled the law cannot be used to violate a 
criminal defendants constitutional right to a fair trial and that 
testimony can be compelled if there is a reasonable possibility 
the information will materially assist the defense 
applying those standards the court said reporter roxana 
kopetman and photographer roberto santiago bertero must testify 
about whether they saw or heard a man agree to a search of his 
jacket when he was arrested by long beach police in 1987 officers 
said they found illegal brass knuckles in the jacket but the 
evidence will be excluded if the search was without consent 
rex heinke lawyer for ms kopetman and bertero said a us 
supreme court appeal would be considered 
the court did not resolve one important question whether a 
prosecutor has a similar ability to compel a reporters testimony 
but justice david eagleson who wrote the opinion said the court 
did not have to decide that issue in this case 
heinke said the logical implications of the decision were 
that the media could not be compelled by the prosecutor in a 
criminal case or by either side in a civil suit not directly 
involving the press 
if those are the implications then its a substantial victory 
for the press although not in this particular case he said 
albert menaster the los angeles public defender who sought the 
testimony said the ruling was a victory for his client but i do 
not consider it a loss for the press he said the court had set 
reasonable standards for balancing the rights of reporters and 
defendants 
ms kopetman and bertero were riding with long beach police in 
september 1987 when they saw officers question and search sean 
patrick delaney 21 
the newspapers article four days later mentioned the incident 
but did not say whether delaney consented to the search of his 
jacket pocket the crucial issue for a stillpending charge of 
possessing brass knuckles 
ms kopetman and bertero refused to testify citing the shield 
law they were held in contempt of court and that decision was 
upheld by the 2nd district court of appeal which said the law did 
not apply to observations of public events 
the supreme court disagreed with that conclusion saying 
unpublished information protected by the law included 
nonconfidential observations but the court said the reporters 
shield was overcome in this case by the defendants need for the 
testimony 
delaneys personal liberty is at stake eagleson wrote 
the reporteres are not being asked to breach a confidence or to 
disclose sensitive information that would in any way even remotely 
restrict their newsgathering ability 
all that is being required of them is to accept the civic 
responsibility imposed on all persons who witness alleged criminal 
conduct

an imprisoned former housing and urban 
development official testified today that former secretary samuel 
r pierce jr directed federal grants to friends including a 
down and out former campaign manager 
dubois l gilliam said pierce ordered one 350000 grant because 
his friend and former political manager sam singletary needed 
help 
the grant was arranged despite the lack of a request from a city 
that was to benefit from the project and a lack of experience by 
singletary and his partner who applied for the grant as a 
nonprofit private group gilliam said 
the grants along with others gilliam described were from the 
departments technical assistance program with money coming from 
the secretarys discretionary program 
gilliam testified that virtually all the money from that program 
was distributed based on political connections and that he and 
pierce both expressed surprise when they discovered that one 
applicant for a grant on their approved list had no political 
connections 
the committee chairman rep tom lantos dcalif said the 
program was administered politically as a cross between a slush 
fund and a political action committee 
the whole scheme is so incredible so unreal lantos said 
gilliam said he traveled to camden nj to meet with the mayor 
to persuade him that hud intended to provide the 350000 grant to 
singletarys group if he would go along with the project which was 
intended to help the city with community development projects 
he said pierce indicated he wanted to help mr singletary get 
some funds he was down and out and i did so he told me to 
fund the project 
gilliam also told congressional investigators that he directed a 
grant to another group because of its connection to a brother of 
pierce he did not identify the brother but committee staff 
director stuart weisberg identified him before the meeting as 
burton pierce 
gilliam said pierce called him about the 257000 project and 
told me he wanted to get the project funded 
a republican pierce was appointed a new york state judge in 
1959 and lost an election bid for a full term as judge in 1960 
said weisberg staff director of lantos house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
gilliam was appearing for a third day before the panel which 
has spent more than a year investigating fraud influencepeddling 
and political favoritism at hud reagan administration 
gilliam a former deputy assistant secretary of hud pleaded 
guilty to abusing hud programs and accepting illegal gratuities he 
is serving an 18month sentence at the federal prison in lompoc 
calif and has been testifying under a grant of immunity from 
further prosecution 
in two previous days of testimony gilliam has said that he 
pierce and others manipulated programs to direct federal grants and 
lucrative subsidies to friends sometimes before any formal 
applications were made 
the determining factor in awarding technical assistance grants 
was on the particular people behind each project rather than on 
the quality of the project lantos said 
while the secretary had discretion to direct grants under the 
technical assistance programs weisberg said basing decisions on 
politics could be considered an abuse of the program and against 
the intent of congress 
gilliams testimony has contradicted pierces sworn statement to 
the subcommittee a year ago that he was not directly involved in 
deciding who got hud grants weisberg said 
the technical assistance program is probably the one program 
that pierce was most involved in the one that was most 
political he said 
paul l perito a lawyer for pierce attacked gilliams 
credibility calling him an admitted cheat and liar 
mr pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing and improper 
conduct perito said 
after testifying once in may 1989 pierce invoked his 
constitutional rights against selfincrimination and refused 
further testimony 
special prosecutor arlin adams appointed by a federal court to 
investigate pierce said he would have no comment on gilliams 
testimony

the opposition labor party has trounced prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservatives in local elections 
making its best showing since she came to power 11 years ago 
tallies showed today 
but the conservatives averted the rout forecast by opinion 
polls and mrs thatcher maintained that despite a big 11 percent 
swing against the government she had the basis for winning a 
fourth term in 1991 or 1992 
weve lost some we hoped to hold but we have a very good 
basis on which to go forward and win the next general election 
she was speaking a day after the poll at a news conference at 
waddesdon manor northwest of london with visiting french 
president francois mitterrand 
neil kinnock leader of the labor party said the results showed 
broad support for his party throughout england 
that is the spread of support that we need which makes me 
forecast that we are certain to win the next election kinnock 
said 
for the first time since james callaghans labor government lost 
power to mrs thatcher in 1979 the socialist party made 
significant gains in the tory heartlands of the prosperous south 
the conservatives in deep trouble over the economy and the 
socalled poll tax that prompted nationwide protests lost control 
in a clutch of previously safe southern english towns including 
portsmouth torbay and gillingham 
but the conservatives performed strongly in london they held 
two key boroughs wandsworth and westminster which have set the 
lowest poll tax rates in the country and are lauded by mrs 
thatcher 
one sore loss for labor was its loss of control to the 
conservatives in the london borough of ealing where kinnock makes 
his home 
the governing party failed to gain ground in north england and 
remained virtually shut out in scotland 
after 196 of 201 councils were declared a tally by the british 
domestic news agency press association showed the tories lost 355 
seats and gained 143 while labor notched up 431 gains and 120 
losses the centrists and minor parties except the scottish 
nationalists all had net losses 
with incomplete results in labor had made 10 gains to control 
89 councils the conservatives who had controlled 60 councils 
lost 12 and gained four 
the thirdrunning centrist social and liberal democratic party 
lost three and gained two no party had overall control in the rest 
a computer analysis by the british broadcasting corp showed an 
11 percent swing in popular voting against the government since 
1987 when mrs thatcher began her third term that margin would be 
enough to give labor a comfortable win in a general election 
the latest gallup poll published today in londons 
proconservative newspaper the daily telegraph showed just 23 
percent of voters satisfied with her performance it was the worst 
rating for any british leader since opinion polling began about 50 
years ago 
but some commentators predicted the local election results would 
lessen speculation mrs thatcher will retire or be ousted as party 
leader before the next election in 1991 or 1992 
in a key result the conservatives retained control with a 
hugely increased majority of the south london borough of 
wandsworth it set the lowest percapita tax in the country 243 
per person compared with an average of 580 
wandsworths labor leader fiona mctaggart called the low tax a 
bribe thats worked for them 
the tax which replaced a local property tax april 1 is 
officially known as a community charge but is dubbed a poll tax 
it is widely viewed as unfair because everyone in the same 
district pays the same regardless of income instead of just 17 
million homeowners being liable all 38 million adults must pay 
with rebates for the 95 million poorest 
mrs thatcher says it is fairer for everyone to pay and she 
expected labor councils would be blamed for high bills however 
most households are paying more and blaming her 
the poll tax raises about onefourth of the 377 billion needed 
for local services including education police subsidized housing 
and garbage collection

indian leaders on both 
sides of a gambling dispute were furious at being excluded from a 
meeting where us and canadian officials discussed setting up a 
new mohawk government 
during a 3hour meeting thursday in montreal about 30 us and 
canadian officials discussed creating one mohawk government to 
replace three fractious councils now governing the reserve 
straddling the uscanadian border 
this meeting today was designed to work out all the options to 
stop the fighting said harry swain canadas deputy minister of 
indian affairs everything that was said occurred with the 
knowledge and blessing of the mohawk people on the reserve and we 
will take our findings back to them immediately 
new york state troopers today continued to occupy the 
reservation stopping residents for identification as they walked 
or drove through the territory at least three state police cars 
were stationed at most intersections and the reservation was quiet 
except for traditional morning chants 
but indian leaders on the reservation were angry 
if in fact they want to do this with the proper recognition 
of the sovereignty of the people then they must do it in a 
coordinated communitywide fashion said harold tarbell an 
antigambling spokesman in the canadian town of cornwall 
thats the problem the people are not consulted about 
decisions made for their benefit said francis boots a spokesman 
for the warrior society a progambling group 
a ninemonth conflict over the operation of lucrative gambling 
casinos on the 28000acre reservation culminated this week in two 
shooting deaths the victims were one gambling supporter and one 
gambling opponent 
after the shootings tuesday canadian and us security forces 
moved into the reservation 
the warrior society a selfproclaimed security force that 
patrols the american side of the reservation describes the police 
as foreign armies and wants them to leave many of the other 
mohawks approve of the operation if it results in peace 
the three mohawk governments are the mohawk indian nation which 
includes mohawks on both sides of the border the mohawk tribal 
council on the american side and the band council on the canadian 
side 
swain said canadian and us police will remain on the 
reservation until they are sure no more shooting will erupt 
but some reinforcements from the canadian army started pulling 
away thursday night said maj gerald baril of the canadian 
national defense headquarters in ottawa he said two military 
helicopters will remain on standby until at least the end of the 
week 
residents went about their business thursday under the eye of 
the security forces more than 1000 people remained camped out in 
dormitory rooms of a government training college in cornwall other 
refugees were taken in at national guard facilities on the new york 
side 
but some were determined not to leave their homes 
most of us here in the neighborhood have stayed said bonnie 
bradley who lives with her parents two children and two nephews 
i dont feel terrorized by this im not part of either side so 
i have no reason to watch my back but i wish it were over i do 
wish it were over

a federal judge levied a 1155 million 
penalty against officers of the collapsed champion insurance co 
but warned state officials that they may have difficulty collecting 
the money 
alabama officials said they would work with their counterparts 
from louisiana to try to get the money from what was once alabamas 
fourth largest auto insurance company 
champion went into liquidation in june 1989 leaving behind 
pending auto insurance claims from 10000 customers champion 
officers have been indicted on charges of siphoning off 37 million 
from policies 
at thursdays court hearing montgomery attorney charles crook 
representing the state government said the large penalty in a 
civil case against champion would be a deterrent and show other 
insurance companies that these matters are policed 
that is if you ever collect us district judge robert 
varner told the attorney 
the penalty imposed by varner was the highest judgment allowed 
by the civil court provisions of federal racketeering laws the 
judgment is triple the state governments anticipated loss from 
champions demise 385 million 
the eicher family that ran the insurance company based in baton 
rouge la has had its assets frozen 
well be working with the louisiana liquidators in taking 
appropriate actions to locate assets and enforce the judgment 
crook said after the hearing i realize some practical difficulty 
with whether assets of that amount are available 
alabama attorney general don siegelman said the judgment does 
not mean alabama will immediately receive the money but he said 
payment of claims is the responsibility of champion and i intend 
to do everything within my power to make sure that responsibility 
is honored 
gov guy hunt said the ruling should be a message to any 
company that is should be fair and straightforward with the people 
of alabama 
the 1155 million is in addition to separate criminal theft 
charges against 64yearold john eicher and six other family 
members and former officers of champion they were indicted by a 
montgomery county grand jury in march

blood bank agencies say they will start 
routinely screening blood donations for hepatitis c the most 
common serious infection spread by blood transfusion 
the american association of blood banks the american red cross 
and the council of community blood centers announced in a joint 
statement thursday that blood will be screened using a new test 
licensed tuesday by the food and drug administration 
by some estimates about 7500 to 20000 of the 4 million 
americans receiving blood transfusions annually develop acute 
hepatitis c officials said the new test could halve that number 
jon macpherson executive director of the council of community 
blood centers said the groups also suggest that patients who have 
received blood transfusions within the last 20 years consider being 
tested for hepatitis c 
hepatitis c formerly called hepatitis nona nonb is thought 
to be caused by a virus called hcv it infects from 150000 to 
200000 americans annually only 5 to 10 percent of these cases are 
attributed to blood transfusions other sources are thought to be 
shared drug needles and some studies suggest sexual relations 
the source of at least half of the hepatitis c infections however 
is unknown 
symptoms for most patients are mild and the disease usually is 
not diagnosed there is no generally available treatment 
for 10 to 20 percent of the patients hepatitis c can be 
serious leading to lifethreatening liver disease or cirrhosis

the senate has disregarded a threatened veto 
by president bush and moved toward allowing the nations 3 million 
federal civil service and postal workers to participate more in 
party politics 
on a 6730 vote democrats on thursday defeated an amendment by 
senate republicans aimed at derailing a bill to remove most 
restrictions on political activities by federal employees imposed 
by the 1939 hatch act 
the democratic bill would revise the law to lift prohibitions 
that bar federal civil service employees from holding office in 
political parties working in campaigns or soliciting campaign 
dollars from fellow workers 
however it would continue prohibitions on federal workers 
running for public office soliciting campaign funds from the 
general public or engaging in political activities while on the job 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
current restrictions illogical and unnecessary 
the republican amendment by sen william roth rdel would 
have substituted the proposed changes with an order directing the 
office of personnel management to simplify and clarify what 
roth acknowledged are confusing regulations under the law

crime from the evidence 
everything the state gave them they swallowed

prosecutors contended dowaliby and his wife cynthia murdered 
the girl in her bedroom in september 1988 dumped the body and 
faked evidence to convince police that jaclyn had been abducted by 
a home invader the defense contended that the intruder came in 
through a basement window while the family slept

the government and the african 
national congress announced today they had made an important 
breakthrough by agreeing to work together to end political 
violence in south africa 
president fw de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela looking 
relaxed after three days of historic talks told a news conference 
they had made major progress toward creating a normal political 
climate that would clear the way for bringing blacks into the 
national government 
i regard what is contained in this document as an important 
breakthrough in the peace process de klerk said 
the two sides issued a joint communique outlining steps to end 
political violence and remove remaining obstacles to fullscale 
constitutional negotiations 
the government and the anc agree on a common commitment 
towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and 
intimidation from whatever quarter as well as a commitment to 
stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations the joint 
statement said 
the communique said a working group would report by may 21 on 
ways to overcome remaining obstacles to constitutional 
negotiations but de klerk told reporters no date had been set for 
further talks between the two sides 
the two leaders said the three days of talks the first ever 
between the anc and the government had been an important step 
forward they praised each others sincerity and determination to 
find a peaceful solution to south africas racial divisions 
i look to the future with confidence de klerk said 
mandela was equally positive saying the most striking feature 
of the negotiations had been there cordiality 
we have had discussions on sensitive matters in a spirit of 
conciliation and understanding mandela said 
the joint statement outlined five steps to be taken to try to 
settle remaining anc demands for fullscale negotiations 
the steps include establishment of the working group to actually 
handle practical matters the granting of temporary immunity from 
prosecution for political offenses for selected top anc officials 
a government review of existing security legislation and the 
establishment of channels of communication between the two sides to 
halt violence 
the declaration said the government committed itself to work 
towards the lifting of the state of emergency a key anc demand 
in this context the anc will exert itself to fulfill the 
objective contained in the preamble the communique stated 
the state of emergency has been in effect since june 1986 the 
anc says the emergency is used by police to suppress political 
activity and peaceful dissent 
the government says it wants to lift the emergency but that it 
remains necessary to combat black factional fighting that has 
claimed more than 600 lives this year 
the anc is seeking amnesty for its estimated 15000 exiles and 
the release of all prisoners convicted of politically motivated 
crimes 
so far de klerk has released some political activists convicted 
of acts that did not involve violence and offered temporary 
immunity to anc officials involved in the talks legislation that 
could provide amnesty to exiles and prisoners is under 
consideration in parliament 
the government is demanding the anc renounce its largely 
ineffective guerrilla campaign de klerk also wants the anc to 
assist the government in ending the political violence in the 
southeastern province of natal and elsewhere 
de klerk has been reluctant to grant outright pardons to anc 
guerrillas accused or convicted of violent attacks for fear of a 
white backlash many whites are unhappy with the governments rapid 
reforms and still regard the anc as a terrorist group 
if the two sides reach agreement on holding constitutional 
negotiations white and black leaders warn such discussions will be 
difficult and prolonged with major differences to be resolved 
the government insists that any new constitution extending 
political rights to the countrys 28 million blacks must include 
guarantees to safeguard the interests of the 5 million whites and 
other minorities

involvement

reported that us forces helped plan the assault and three or four 
us military personnel helped operate the two helicopters that 
carried it out 
rodriguez gacha his son and several bodyguards were killed by 
gunfire from one of the helicopters as they tried to flee one of 
the helicopters was fired on first and newsday reported that the 
commanding officer identified by one source as an american gave 
the order to fire back 
rodriguez gacha 42 was one of the most powerful of the 
colombian cocaine bosses 
at a news conference thursday bush repeated administration 
denials of us military involvement us troops in colombia 
no thats the answer newsday said the head of the colombian 
federal police gen miguel maza marquez denied us involvement 
in an interview in bogota last week 
newsday said it had information from more than six sources about 
a us role in the mission including an army special forces staff 
member three other defense sources a house aide and a senate aide 
who said he was briefed by pentagon officials 
the senate aide said he was told that a handful of us 
special operations troops participated with a much larger 
contingent of colombians and that the us role was preeminent

characterized as window dressing 
officially we say they did it but in fact we did it a 
congressional source said according to newsday

intelligence committees were notified of the operation through a 
presidential finding that declared the mission was in the

the mayor has provoked a debate over 
academic freedom by refusing to give a new building to a university 
because one of its teachers questioned the existence of nazi gas 
chambers 
the professor bernard notin was suspended from teaching law 
courses in march but continues to teach economics at statefunded 
jean moulin university named for the lyonbased leader of the 
french resistance 
notins suspension came after an antiracism organization filed 
a complaint regarding an article he wrote that challenged widely 
accepted accounts of the holocaust 
mayor michel noir told reporters thursday his refusal to 
transfer a publicly owned building to the university for new 
classroom space did not constitute interference in campus affairs 
he said he merely wanted the university council to follow 
regulations which call for it to convene and deliberate if a 
teacher poses serious problems for the university 
noir said last weekend it was out of the question the city 
would provide new facilities to the university if notin and other 
falsifiers of history continue to teach there 
notin has insisted on his right to freedom of opinion and said 
he has not used the classroom as a forum for his controversial 
views 
the president of the university pierre vialle issued a 
communique saying the school as a whole should not have to bear 
responsibility for a controversy involving an individual 
noir a member of the centerright rally for the republic party 
was praised by a local leader of the governing socialist party 
jeanjack queyranne 
the freedom of research and expression at universities cannot 
serve as an alibi for those who insult the history and the memory 
of our people queyranne said 
bruno gollnisch a deputy for the extremeright national front 
in the european parliament said his party did not endorse notins 
views but was concerned about noirs reprisal 
if the revisionists are wrong which is very possible it 
nonetheless seems that one is less and less free to speak about all 
aspects of world war ii gollnisch said

a canal was the last barrier today separating the 
sprawling big cypress national wildlife preserve from a 25000acre 
everglades fires that had already jumped one waterway fire 
officials said 
crews concentrated on keeping the 4milewide line of fire from 
crossing the l67 levee and sweeping into the droughtparched 
preserve west of miami 
we have the potential of this burning into big cypress and 
some critcal land out here some nice trees and that could cause a 
problem said state forest ranger jim taylor 
the fire leaped across the l67 canal thursday but was pushed 
back 
it did jump but then we managed to get a helicopter out there 
and dump a couple of buckets of water on it state division of 
forestry duty officer peter karayeanes said we managed to put 
that one out and we just have the fire on the east side of the l67 
levee 
l67 is part of the statewide canal system built early in the 
century to drain off swamplands in southern florida 
state ranger gene dempsey said crews started backfires today to 
make sure the blaze stayed on the east side of the canal calmer 
winds late thursday allowed them to take the night off but 
firefighters were still concerned about the preserve 
we feel very confident that we can keep the fire from going 
over the levee we did it yesterday and i think we can do it 
again 
he said there are very few animals affected by the fire 
alligators are in the canals and all other large animals such as 
deer and the endangered florida panther have been living by water 
because of the severe drought 
we have a few snakes and rodents scurrying away but thats 
about it 
the blaze one of three outside miami did not threaten any 
inhabited areas 
another fire in everglades national park about 27 miles 
southwest of the city scorched 10500 acres by late thursday 
afternoon 
firefighters were confident they could control it said park 
spokeswoman darlene koontz investigators determined the everglades 
fire was manmade 
with the conditions that we have out there with the ecosystem 
in somewhat stress we just really want to encourage people to be 
careful with fire koontz said 
seminole indian firefighters spent thursday battling a smaller 
blaze on their reservation in broward county after burning 800 
acres that fire appeared contained dempsey said 
fires are a normal part of the everglades ecology said park 
spokeswoman pat tolle but this this years fires worry 
environmentalists because the regions 20month drought has left 
the region extremely dry and the state is undergoing a heatwave 
normal high temperatures for this time of year in the tampa bay 
area are around 85 degrees but temperatures hovered at 93 there 
thursday and forecasters predicted highs to stay in the 90s at 
least through the weekend 
florida power corp has called on its 11 million customers to 
conserve energy 
we want everyone to understand that its tight utility 
spokesman ray blush said thursday in st petersburg the utility

thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and take other conservation 
steps to avoid the blackouts that affected much of florida over

latvias parliament adopted a declaration 
of independence today launching the baltic republics secession 
from the soviet union 50 years after it was forcibly absorbed by 
moscow 
the supreme soviet voted 1380 with one abstention to pass the 
measure which calls for independence after an undetermined 
transition period fiftyseven antiindependence deputies refused 
to vote 
when the results of the vote were announced via loudspeakers to 
a crowd of several hundred people outside parliament a loud cheer 
went up 
then those inside and outside the hall began singing god 
bless latvia the republics national anthem 
the measure that made latvia the last of the three baltic 
republics to formally break with moscow had needed a twothirds 
majority or 132 votes to pass 
the neighboring republic of estonia has taken a similar step 
the third baltic republic lithuania declared full independence on 
march 11 and the kremlin since has imposed an economic blockade on 
the republic 
the deputies also voted to drop the words soviet socialist 
from the republics name making it simply the republic of 
latvia 
two deputies walked out of the session during the vote 
including alfreds rubiks latvias communist party chief who 
earlier in the day had warned of mass demonstrations and strikes by 
nonlatvians if the measure had passed 
as the time for the vote approached young girls in gold 
headbands and bright pink skirts sang latvian folk songs outside 
the supreme soviet building beneath red and white latvian flags 
held aloft by proindependence demonstrators 
the supreme soviet or parliament put the independence 
declaration on the agenda despite complaints by some deputies that 
they were being rushed into a dangerous decision the parliament is 
dominated by the grassroots latvian peoples front 
members of the latvian opposition complained they first saw the 
draft declaration only this morning 
we are physically unable to give an answer today on this 
document sergejs diemans told fellow legislators time must be 
taken to study it carefully 
deputy leonids alksnis warned that if the declaration passed as 
expected moscow would apply heavy pressure on latvia to rescind it 
if we pass this declaration moscow will do the same thing to 
latvia as it did to lithuania alksnis said 
other deputies objected that latvians had wanted to restore 
their independence for 50 years in the end the lawmakers voted 
13956 to address the measure today 
this is our last possibility to survive and we are going to 
take advantage of it that is why we demand independence said 
writer alberts bels 
scores of protesters from the nonlatvian population gathered on 
cathedral square with signs demanding the republic not copy 
lithuania a proindependence rally was scheduled for later in the 
day 
lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis advised his neighbors 
thursday on a visit to riga to be strong and have courage 
he said latvians if they moved more slowly than lithuania on 
the path to secession would be trudging through a jungle 
however latvias ethnic balance is more delicate than 
lithuanias and could slow steps toward independence 
in lithuania 80 percent of the 28 million people are ethnic 
lithuanian but about 54 percent of latvias population of 27 
million people are latvian most of the rest are ethnic russians 
many of whom oppose independence 
in the past year latvia has copied within months and sometimes 
weeks lithuanias steps toward independnce 
in december it abolished the communist partys guaranteed 
monopoly on power in february it condemned the 1940 act that 
formalized its annexation by the soviet union and last month a 
large segment of its communist party broke from the moscowbased 
soviet party 
anatoly gorbunov who was reelected president of latvia during 
the parliamentary session backed independence in a nomination 
speech thursday 
i believe that the renewal of a legally sovereign nation must 
be accomplished he said declaring it a normal way of life for 
all the residents of latvia 
gorbunov a 48yearold former communist party functionary 
skilled at negotiating with moscow won 153 votes out of 196 cast

the man with the two boxes of trash bags looked 
out of place amid the models in cocktail dresses the stack of 
truck tires and the tiedyed salespeople from the worlds no 1 
jewelry company serving the sanitation industry 
im not trying to sell cinchsaks thomas w higgins 
confided im trying to sell an idea 
higgins idea clear hefty cinchsaks might seem a trifle 
mundane but last months earth day somehow has americans excited 
about a mundane task throwing out trash 
and that has people very excited at waste expo 90 the annual 
convention of the national solid wastes management association 
more than 10000 people are at the georgia world congress 
center attending seminars like women in waste and backyard 
basics how composting can improve your bottom line 
theyre looking over the latest new geegaws for their industry 
including the cramalot compactor sentry system computer software 
and recyclerfriendly garbage trucks 
garbage trucks it should be noted look mighty strange when 
they are a clean and b surrounded by models in cocktail 
dresses 
if we have another earth day everybodys going to be doing 
this said jerry andregg standing next to the kann curb sorter 
garbage truck a fancy white job with four compartments for four 
different kinds of garbage and a plastic masher in the middle 
its helped our business out he said it being earth 
day and its raised peoples awareness how important it is to 
start recycling 
the awareness here is nothing but recycling said doug mcgee 
of plastican 
you know those big buckets that joint compound and 
schoolcafeteria mayonnaise come in well with colorcoding a 
hole for rainwater to drain out of and a snazzy logo on the front 
plastican makes them into bins for household recyclables 
everyone wants to do it mcgee said it being recycling 
but everyones trying to figure out how to do it 
thats what the guy with the cinchsaks figures 
the most effective way to run a comingled curbside recycling 
program is to pick up the material in a clear bag said higgins 
manager of hefty recycling opportunities for the mobil chemical 
cos consumer products division 
the idea he explained is that homeowners dont want 17 
recycling bins cluttering up the garage and cities dont want to 
pay the garbageman to dawdle at the curb putting the brown beer 
bottles in one place the clear juice bottles in another place and 
the newspapers in a third place 
the answer the clear garbage bag 
maybe um a clear hefty cinchsak 
its up to our marketing guys to get their share of the 
market higgins said 
over at the dempster display a wastequip company john l 
thomas vice president for sales is showing off the recycle one a 
gleaming white garbage truck with a sideloading windowbox gizmo 
that dumps different kinds of garbage in the correct place in the 
truck 
earth day has really brought it into focus thomas said 
adding that recycling is the answer to our disposables problem 
so many of our landfills are filling up he said were 
running out of landfill space one way to extend landfill life is 
to put less in them 
dempster and the other exhibitors at waste expo 90 have their 
biggest ever audience to pitch to the conventions attendance of 
10000plus is a record for the show 
some of them may need a few garbage trucks others may need 
office trash cans or shredding machines 
but saul brett inc wants to sell something to all of them 
were the only company with 14karat jewelry for sanitation 
from 115 to 5000 in stock said jimmy brett whos hawking 
stuff while sauls back in new york minding the store 
the brett company makes decals for garbage cans and garbage 
trucks theyve plastered the convention with signs and buttons 
bearing the drugs are garbage message the company believes in 
they make goldcolored garbagecan tie tacks they even make 
some spiffy goldanddiamond garbagetruck pins for the valued 
sanitation employee or the supportive sanitation spouse 
no one jimmy said does it like we do

thousands gathered solemnly in the rain today 
to hear calls for peace and reconciliation at the dedication of a 
memorial to four students killed in an antiwar protest 20 years 
ago at kent state university 
we do appreciate what has been done and who did it said 
florence schroeder mother of bill schroeder one of the four 
students killed on by ohio national guardsmen on may 4 1970 
mrs schroeder said she was convinced the death of her son and 
three other students helped to shorten the vietnam war by 
increasing public opposition to american involvement in it 
he absolutely did not die in vain mrs schroeder said at a 
news conference 
despite a steady rain some 4000 gathered for the midday 
dedication according to a crowd estimate by kent state police 
chief john peach many kent state students were not even born when 
the killings occurred 
gov richard celeste said the 1970 shootings should serve as a 
source of learning rather than as a focus of bitterness 
to those who suffered from that tragedy 20 years ago i am 
sorry celeste said its time to turn the tragedy at kent 
state of may 4 1970 into a calling to peacemakers 
the 100000 granite memorial is the most ambitious attempt by 
the university to commemorate the dead and wounded but about 200 
student activists who wanted a larger memorial built and more 
student involvement in its planning waged a silent protest march 
during the dedication 
the protesting students stood near the white tent where 
ceremony participants spoke some of the students held up their 
arms fists clenched or displaying the peace sign and many others 
held up handmade signs reading whose may 4th is it anyway and 
dont minimize student death 
thursday evening some 2000 people attended a candlelight 
ceremony to mark the deaths of schroeder jeffrey miller sandy 
scheuer and allison krause nine other people were wounded in the 
shootings 
former sen george mcgovern keynote speaker at the dedication 
called the incident the most tragic episode in american foreign 
policy history 
the 1972 democratic presidential candidate who ran 
unsuccessfully against thenpresident richard nixon said before 
the ceremony that the kent state shootings and the death of two 
jackson state university students in mississippi 10 days later 
helped focus public attention on the war and opposition to it he 
said the deaths touched a common note of humanity 
at the dedication mcgovern called for us reconciliation with 
vietnam and the reestablishment of diplomatic ties 
the war in vietnam is unfinished he said the killing has 
stopped but the arrogance that produced it survives and so does the 
agony the guilt and the separation 
until now the shootings were marked only by a gravestonesize 
slab erected in 1971 in a corner of a parking lot where the tragedy 
occurred 
the lack of a memorial reflected continuing political 
differences over an event that brought the vietnam war home 
some viewed the shootings as an unprovoked act of state 
violence others said unpatriotic protesters had finally gotten 
what was coming to them although many of the victims were 
bystanders rather than activists 
campus police said they would maintain a discreet presence at 
the hilltop memorial site to keep order but did not expect a 
disruption 
to mark the anniversary of the shootings a 12hour candlelight 
vigil an annual tradition began at midnight on this 824acre 
campus of 23000 students the vigil followed a crosscampus 
candlelight march by more than 2000 people most of them students 
hundreds of students milled around the scene 
at each spot in a parking lot where a student died a student 
stood this morning roped off and encircled with candles 
kent state freshman michelle suttman of madison said the 
reaction on campus to the anniversary was mixed 
theres been a lot of indifference she said this is 
finals week 
university president michael schwartz went to kent state 
trustees with a proposal for a memorial eight years ago earlier 
suggestions for a memorial never got off the ground university 
spokeswoman janet thiede said 
some veterans groups objected to the idea of a memorial and some 
people felt the smaller marker and the universitys peace studies 
center were sufficient commemoration 
the university originally said it would build a larger memorial 
but scaled back the plan when it failed to raise 1 million it 
needed 
some students and survivors complained the universitys 
fundraising effort was halfhearted student critics said 
university officials were not interested in calling attention to 
the shootings 
last month the university announced creation of four fulltime 
scholarships in the names of the four dead students 
the memorial was designed by bruno ast a chicago architect who 
was selected in a competition ast designed the memorial without 
calling for the names of the victims to be included but he said he 
had no objections to last weeks decision by the university to add 
a separate square granite slab with the names 
the lack of the victims names on the memorial had been a 
persistent sore point among students and survivors who wanted a 
more elaborate memorial 
the anniversary didnt interest all segments of this campus 
community 40 miles southeast of cleveland 
they are not letting old wounds heal senior chuck bulick of 
mentor said thursday 
he called the shootings unfortunate terrible but said he 
also had read that student demonstrators had been unruly and had 
thrown rocks at guardsmen called to restore order after fire 
destroyed an rotc building 
most students accounts of the shootings said the national 
guardsmen sent in by thengov james a rhodes were not 
threatened by the protesters when they opened fire

marvin cantor is a victim of german 
unification 
cantors architectural firm spent two years designing plans to 
build a washington embassy for east germany as he was drawing the 
last walls the first crack was made in the berlin wall 
east germany rapidly advancing toward union with its neighbor 
to the west soon will cease to exist without a country who needs 
an embassy 
west germany has a sprawling embassy on a verdant hill in 
northwest washington the east germans have occupied one floor of 
an office building on the citys embassy row since establishing 
diplomatic relations with the united states in 1974 
but the east germans always viewed their quarters as temporary 
and sought an embassy building befitting their position as the nub 
of the warsaw pact and a major economic power in the soviet bloc 
in the early 1980s the east germans leased a lot in a planned 
complex of some two dozen embassies on international drive where 
several governments including ghana and israel already have 
moved 
after another period of inactivity east germany commissioned 
cantors firm in early 1988 to design the new embassy offices or 
chancery building as its known in diplomatic parlance 
cantor completed the blueprints late last year the east germans 
were pleased he said 
the building would cost 6 million to 8 million to build and 
would occupy about 45000 square feet 
a full political union of the two germanys is expected next 
year but the sisters already have agreed on a treaty merging their 
economies 
in a sign of things to come in washington the two embassies 
once separated by several miles of real estate and four decades of 
rival ideologies will hold their first joint function monday with 
a screening of a television documentary on composer johann 
sebastian bach 
the final decision on the fate of the embassy project is still 
before the newly elected noncommunist government the first and 
probably last east germans will know 
it has to be reviewed said peter janz first secretary of 
the east german embassy he said a decision was expected soon 
cantor believes that once the new government resolves the myriad 
pressing problems bedeviling the logistics of unification it may 
suggest to west germany that his plans be modified for an annex or 
consular section for the embassy of the unified germany 
maybe thats just wishful thinking he said 
either way he has nothing to worry about 
first he expects to be paid 
second for every country dropped from the us diplomatic 
roster a new one is tacked on cantor could be commissioned to 
build an embassy for mongolia which recently established 
diplomatic relations with the united states

president bush calling for a new 
western strategy for new and changing times said today he hopes 
an agreement on reducing troops and conventional arms in europe can 
be signed this fall 
once such an agreement is reached ussoviet talks should 
begin as soon as possible aimed at reducing the number of 
shortrange nuclear weapons stationed throughout europe bush said 
in prepared remarks for the oklahoma state university commencement 
ceremonies 
on changes taking place within the soviet union bush said 
president mikhail s gorbachev has made profound progress in 
his country reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned 
back 
but bush added neither can we turn the clock ahead to know 
for sure what kind of country the soviet union will be in years to 
come 
bush said that the western alliance must plan for a 
lessmilitarized europe that plays down the current focus on 
imminent war 
we are entering a new age of freedom in a time of uncertainty 
but great hope bush said 
looking forward to the nato meeting he proposed for early this 
summer bush said the alliance must join together to craft a new 
western strategy for new and changing times 
the us role he said will be to support europe militarily as 
long as the allies want however in light of democratic changes 
sweeping eastern europe the political focus of nato will increase 
and the military aspects will be different bush said 
if the soviet withdrawal continues and our armscontrol 
efforts are successful we must plan for a different kind of 
military presence focused less on the danger of an immediate 
outbreak of war he said 
he made the comments a day after announcing he is scrapping 
plans for upgrading battlefield nuclear weapons that are stationed 
mostly in west germany bush said he wants nato members to develop 
objectives for new arms control talks on us and soviet reductions 
of other shortrange missiles 
bush who in the past has only said that an agreement on 
reducing conventional forces in europe should be completed by the 
35 nations with an interest in europe by the end of this year 
today said he hoped it could be signed this fall 
elaborating on his call thursday for a complete review of natos 
mission bush said he wants a june or july summit of alliance 
members to 
assess the future of us nuclear forces in europe 
begin preparations for us soviet talks on reducing 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
set objectives for followup negotiations once the treaty is 
signed to reduce us and soviet conventional forces in europe 
develop nato goals for the future of the 35nation pact called 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe which 
includes eastern european nations as well as members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
our enemy today is uncertainty and instability bush said in 
stating a continued need for natos military role 
the alliance will need to maintain a sound collective military 
structure with forces in the field backed by larger forces that can 
be called upon in crises he said 
uncertainty centers around the future of soviet change and 
motivation including how gorbachev handles the lithuanian 
breakaway move he said 
the only noble answer lies in the dialogue that results in 
unencumbered selfdetermination for lithuania bush said 
the president told the oklahoma students he would use a series 
of commencement addresses this year to talk about democratic change 
in the world 
bush on thursday announced he was abandoning an upgrade of the 
shortrange lance missile and cancelling plans to further modernize 
nuclear artillery shells in europe 
as democracy comes to eastern europe and soviet troops return 
home there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest 
ranges the president said at a news conference thursday 
he also called for a summit meeting of the 16 nato nations to 
launch a wideranging nato strategy review for the transformed 
europe of the 1990s 
this summit should address first the future political mission 
of the alliance reaffirming its crucial role in managing and

angry mills college students blockaded 
buildings today during a raucous demonstration one day after 
trustees voted to admit undergraduate men at the exclusive womens 
institution 
several hundred students took part in the blockade surrounding 
major buildings at the college including the administration 
building and the presidents home 
trustees faced with declining enrollment and revenues voted 
thursday to accept men as undergraduates rather than dip heavily 
into the schools 70 million endowment they announced their 
decision on mills common and were jeered by some students yelling 
traitors 
during todays protest some students parked cars in front of 
campus buildings honking horns and setting off car alarms in a bid 
to disrupt classes 
were trying to shut down the operation of the college until 
they reverse their decision said esther barragan a senior 
economics major were not going to take this lightly 
the noisy demonstration brought mary metz the schools 
president out of her home about 9 am the students with radios 
at full blast were shouting we will not accept this 
metz spoke with some students agreeing to meet with them this 
afternoon or on saturday however she said thursdays decision by 
the trustees to admit men would not be reversed 
she acknowleged that the demonstration had disrupted classes and 
school administration 
many women at mills said they would not return next year because 
of the trustees vote ending 138 years as a female enclave 
current undergraduate enrollment is about 775 
i cant believe they would ignore us like that amy hutto 
one of the undergraduates who shaved their heads in protest said 
thursday i havent gone to class all week because this was on my 
mind ill strike now i dont know if i ever want to go back 
protesters and some experts on womens education said that 
coeducational programs can exclude women from opportunities because 
men tend to be more aggressive in the classroom 
trustees had been considering the move for more than a year 
enrollment in mills 33 undergraduate programs is down 42 
percent from three years ago and more than 20 percent below the 
1000 students needed to balance the 24 million annual budget 
said economists at the school where the tuition is almost 12000 
men are already admitted as graduate students 
if mills is to maintain academic quality and financial 
strength in the long run it must increase its undergraduate 
enrollment to at least 1000 board chairman warren hellman said 
amid screams that nearly drowned him out 
the trustees believe coeducation will enable mills excellent 
undergraduate academic program to reach more students he said 
metz predicted that 2030 men would enroll the first coed 
semester she said efforts would be made to let women continue 
taking leadership roles and not be dominated by male students 
at an offcampus news conference later hellman said 32 members 
of the 35member board took part in the vote and an overwhelming 
majority were in favor of coeducation about 60 percent of the 
board members are women 
most teachers had opposed the plan to admit men to the college 
the only singlesex college in northern california two womens 
colleges are located in southern california and there are 94 
nationwide there were 298 womens schools 30 years ago 
the whole environment on a campus changes when men are 
admitted no matter how hard the school tries to prevent that 
said peter mirijanian director of communications for the womens 
college coalition in washington dc male students are taken more 
seriously and women suffer 
wheaton college in massachusetts went coed three years ago and 
a harvard study last year showed men now dominate the classroom 
analysis of videotaped classes at wheaton showed that men made 
up 10 percent of the classroom but did a quarter of the speaking 
according to the study by catherine krupnick 
you ask whats the meaning of life and four hands will 
shoot up most of them male she said college catalogues 
should carry warnings the value you receive will depend on your 
sex 
but at colbysawyer college in new london nh which decided 
to go coeducational last year spokesman byron champlin said less 
than 10 percent of women interested in colleges look at womens 
schools 
janette robinson 21 of duxbury mass who will graduate from 
colbysawyer this month and was among the most vocal coeducation 
opponents last year said accepting men wasnt such a bad idea 
after all 
the people who were strongly against it have already 
graduated so i think the men will be fairly well accepted on 
campus she said

a chinese diplomat said friday that he has 
defected to the united states because he supports the prodemocracy 
movement in china 
many democracy activists in china now are being persecuted and 
arrested and my situation would not be different xu lin who 
dealt with chinese students in the united states said at a news 
conference 
xu said his application for political asylum was in process 
duke austin a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service declined to say whether an application had been received 
wu zurong first secretary in the press office at the chinese 
embassy said he was not familiar with the defection 
xu said at the news conference that he was the fifth person 
connected with the chinese embassy here to defect since the june 4 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square 
xu who said he left the embassy wednesday night would not 
disclose the whereabouts of his wife and daughter because he was 
concerned for their safety 
he said he was assigned to washington for a fouryear tour in 
july 1988 in march he said he was told that his tenure would be 
shortened by two years 
he said he has supported the student movement by helping 
students in the united states renew their passports and avoiding 
reporting their activities to authorities

backward into tragedy and totalitarian repression xu said 
today the opportunity for reform does not exist 
liu yongchuan president of the independent federation of 
chinese students and scholars praised xus action

confidence in the current chinese government and that he can no 
longer tolerate to serve this regime liu said 
we believe that mr xus action represents the wish of the 
majority of chinese government officials 
the student federation based in washington was formed last 
year to protect the rights of an estimated 40000 chinese students 
in the united states it also says it seeks to promote democracy in

secretary of state james a baker iii 
today tried to convince the soviet union that a united germanys 
membership in nato would not upset the delicate eastwest balance 
in europe 
baker met with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
who said he was pleased by us plans to cancel new shortrange 
nuclear missile deployments in west germany shevardnadze also said 
he and baker had a very constructive and useful conversation 
about arms control issues 
but shevardnadze told reporters they had not settled any of 
their differences over restricting longrange nuclear missiles 
during their 3hour session 
baker said well just have to wait and see he was 
referring to the talks he was to hold with shevardnadze on such 
sticking points as air and sealaunched cruise missles in moscow 
on may 1619 
earlier in the day shevardnadze flatly ruled out nato 
membership for a united germany 
baker met today with chancellor helmut kohl before beginning his 
talks with the soviet union over germanys future and lagging arms 
control talks 
the bakershevardnadze meeting came a day after the united 
states announced it will not modernize shortrange nuclear missiles 
in europe or deploy new ones the western allies announced they 
will meet in london in late june and hold a 35nation summit 
including the soviet union by the end of the year in paris 
baker also offered to consider withdrawing some of the 
shortrange lance missiles now based in west germany if the soviets 
drop their objections to nato membership for a united germany 
in comment late thursday in tass vladimir bogachev the 
official soviet news agencys military analyst said let us hope 
that accepting in principle the soviet proposal for talks on 
tactical nuclear weapons and suspending modernization of lance 
missiles and nuclear artillery washington does not at the same 
time intend to give a goahead for the deployment of more dangerous 
airbased nuclear missiles in europe 
new us airtoground missiles if mounted on tactical aircraft 
such as the f111b fighterbomber would be capable of striking 
targets well inside soviet borders bogachev wrote 
shevardnadze called the us armsreduction announcement a 
good decision but also noted that the soviets were the first 
to propose eliminating shortrange nuclear weapons 
we had proposed it a long time ago and offered it he said 
we have already almost completely destroyed this class of 
rockets 
behind thursdays decisions is a determination by the allies to 
respond to the historic political change sweeping europe and 
finding a new role for nato after 31 years of eyeing the red army 
suspiciously over an eastwest divide that is now melting away 
but the 35nation summit depends on completion of a treaty to 
reduce troops tanks airplanes helicopters and artillery in 
europe nato secretary general manfred woerner on thursday accused 
the soviets of footdragging in the negotiations in vienna 
baker meanwhile said at a separate news conference in brussels 
thursday that the negotiations have not proceeded as rapidly as 
we would have thought but deferred making a judgment until he 
saw shevardnadze later today 
baker arrived in bonn today and met with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher and kohl shevardnadze also met 
with kohl just minutes after baker departed no details were 
immediately available 
bakers meeting with shevardnadze was expected to focus 
primarily on arms control and be followed by more intensive talks 
in midmay in the soviet union by then baker said well know a 
lot more 
the talks also hold the key to how president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev will address reducing armories 
during their summit beginning may 30 in washington 
another projected treaty to set limits on longrange nuclear 
missiles bombers and submarines is also running into obstacles at 
the negotiating table in geneva bush and gorbachev would like to 
at least initial a framework agreement on key issues but officials 
on both sides are skeptical of meeting the deadline 
baker and shevardnadze will meet again saturday with the foreign 
ministers of britain france and the two german nations to discuss 
one of the trickiest obstacles to creating a united germany 
figuring out how to keep it from disrupting the european balance of 
power 
there are widespread concerns in europe that a stronger germany 
could again pose a threat to countries overrun during the two world 
wars 
the soviet union has consistently ruled out nato membership for 
a united germany 
we consider a unified germany as an important factor of 
stability and peace in europe shevardnadze said today for 
such a giant to belong to one bloc one alliance will not 
create conditions for stability 
the soviets have called for a neutral germany 
the united states and its nato partners view membership in the 
alliance as the best insurance policy at their meeting thursday 
they agreed germany would not have nuclear or chemical weapons and 
insisted that a united germany belongs in nato 
in a move that appeared aimed at allaying soviet security 
concerns the foreign ministers supported allowing soviet troops to 
remain in east germany after unification during a transition period 
until now east germany has served both as a loyal soviet 
military ally and a buffer against us nuclear missiles and troops 
in west germany

new york citys health and consumer chiefs urged 
lawmakers to ban cigarette machines 
health commissioner woodrow a myers jr and consumer affairs 
commissioner mark green spoke at a city council committee hearing 
thursday on two bills designed to keep children away from tobacco 
one bill would prohibit free distribution of cigarettes in the 
city the second would ban cigarette machines from places where 
minors might have easy access to them 
melinda sidak of the tobacco institute told the hearing her 
trade association considers smoking an adult practice 
but she opposed the bills saying 80 percent of vending machines 
are already in places inaccessible to children such as industrial 
plants bars and cocktail lounges 
she said the industry opposes giving free cigarettes to people 
under 21 but noted that the bill would prohibit free samples to 
adults as well 
since october at least 20 minnesota cities have prohibited or 
restricted the machines and a measure pending in congress would 
ban them in any location accessible to people under 18

seven years after it began gobbling 
homes creeping lava from the kilauea volcano cut through the heart 
of this beach town today threatening the general store and forcing 
congregants to move a church 
a swiftmoving finger of lava barely bypassed the kalapana store 
and drivein and came to within little more than 100 yards of the 
star of the sea church before it was loaded onto a flatbed truck 
for transfer to a safer place 
workers had to use a bulldozer to raise a corner of the 
foundation after the historic church known as the painted 
church because of the brightly colored murals inside refused to 
budge 
county civil defense chief harry kim said the church would be 
taken a mile out of town where homes evacuated from kalapana sit 
church officials have yet to decide where to relocate the church 
earlier he had said that efforts to move the church were 
delayed because authorities were busy tending to three homes full 
of belongings that the lava unexpectedly cut off 
civil defense officials kept worried and grieving residents at a 
safe distance today the officials had sealed off the community 
thursday as the lava flow headed directly for the center of town 
it is a community coming to death the churchs sister mary 
helen said the immediate loss is a loss of community something 
weve loved all through the years is going 
at the heart of the community since 1963 was the store and 
drivein owned by 82yearold walter yamaguchi who cleaned off 
shelves and stopped serving hot foods under an order to close 
jim halpin who lived in the kalapana gardens subdivision for 
nearly six years and watched his home destroyed last week said he 
would move back as soon as officials let people return something 
that could take years because the lava has to cool 
he stopped at yamaguchis store to say goodbye 
walters like everybodys uncle he said i came to say 
goodbye and get that last container of chocolate milk 
two homes were destroyed thursday bringing to 131 the number 
burned since kilauea started its present eruption jan 3 1983 no 
more homes were destroyed by the unpredictable flow by early today 
george hook owner of a construction company that offered to 
relocate the church for free said it will be taken to a clearing 
just outside of town and remain there until church officials decide 
on a new location 
members of another church kalapana mauna kea congregational 
church across from star of the sea voted not to relocate saying 
to do so would nullify their faith in god 
if we move it it will defeat the whole purpose of our 
christian faith said bernice mckeague church moderator our 
people will be here to watch it go this tiny church is a witness 
to the world because the foundation is strong and we stand on that 
foundation 
this morning lava was abutting a rock wall surrounding the 
church and authorities told the congregation they could not go 
inside the book is closed we open a new book today mckeague 
said

east germans on sunday will vote in local 
elections that likely will remove vestiges of communist control and 
virtually complete the revolution that began a year ago 
the balloting will turn over to local hands the obedient 
bureaucracies that were carefully controlled by the former 
stalinist leadership 
now must the selfreliance of the communities be realized 
said wolfgang berghofer the mayor of dresden and a former 
communist who is seeking to retain his post 
the balloting also may provide a gauge of the current mood 
toward german unification a process that is speeding toward 
completion 
there have been widespread protests in recent weeks by workers 
afraid that their factories will close when forced to compete with 
western commerce 
experts met in east berlin on friday to continue talks on 
merging the economies of the german states and the superpowers 
prepared for talks saturday in the west german capital on the 
international implications of a united germany 
the elections will probably mean the end of work for hundreds of 
former communists still holding power on the local level 
its similar to the old denazification campaign after the 
war said heinrich vogel a political analyst with the west 
german institute for eastern and international studies in cologne 
west germany this is going to be a longstanding moral issue 
with this society 
while elected leaders may be thrown out vogel said friday that 
many of the bureaucrats running city departments may be retained 
many cannot be replaced because of their knowledge he said 
the local balloting follows the countrys first free national 
elections on march 18 and will complete a cycle that began a year 
ago 
the last local elections were held may 7 1989 when the 
communist leaders claimed that nearly 99 percent of the voters 
chose candidates from communistapproved parties 
the small protests that traditionally followed such results did 
not end as in past years and instead evolved into the popular 
revolt that exploded in mass demonstrations in october the rallies 
led to the fall of four decades of hardline socialism and the 
opening of the berlin wall in november 
now the retooled and renamed communist party is having trouble 
finding candidates to compete in the elections near the cities of 
erfurt and dresden there are no candidates 
the communist party now called the party of democratic 
socialism still finished third in the national elections and is 
likely to do well in east berlin a stronghold of support 
it takes enormous bravery to run as a candidate for the pds 
said party leader gregor gysi 
candidates for the conservative christian democratic union of 
prime minister lothar de maiziere and the leftleaning social 
democrats are likely to capture most local posts 
although the social democrats have joined de maizieres broad 
governing coalition they favor more social guarantees to protect 
east germans from skyrocketing prices and the loss of subsidized 
housing and food 
more than 12 million voters in 7800 cities districts and other 
municipalities are eligible to vote in the elections candidate 
lists in many communities are huge and run the gamut 
sixtytwo parties and more than a quartermillion candidates are 
registered to run in the city of rostock 20 candidates from the 
german beer drinkers party alone are seeking election to the city 
council 
perhaps the most interesting elections are in leipzig where the 
protests against communism began last year 
in a true precursor to a united germany the social democrat 
candidate for mayor hinnrichlehman gruber has been allowed to 
run even though he is a city council member in the west german city 
of hanover

a businessman has been convicted of making an 
illegal donation designed to aid the 1986 reelection campaign of 
sen alan cranston 
michael goland 43 also was acquitted thursday on four 
misdemeanor counts of conspiracy and making false statements the 
jury deadlocked on a felony charge of making a false statement 
i am pleased for the acquittal goland said outside court 
im incredibly upset for the one i was found guilty on 
us district judge ronald sw lew set sentencing for july 16 
goland whose first trial ended in a deadlocked jury last july 
could receive up to one year in jail and 360000 in fines 
goland was convicted of secretly paying 120000 for a 
television advertisement for senate candidate edward b vallen of 
the american independent party prosecutors said the effort was 
part of an eleventhhour campaign designed to divert votes from 
cranstons republican opponent rep ed zschau 
the california democrat won the election with 3646672 votes 
or 4929 percent zschau received 3541804 votes or 4787 percent 
the contribution was illegal because the television commercial 
it produced falsely claimed at the end that it was financed by the 
vallen for senate committee no such committee existed 
goland insisted that an aide failed to fix the discrepancy and 
he was not aware of it 
no evidence was presented at trial that showed cranston knew of 
the 1986 plan the senator also was not implicated in election law 
violation charges brought against goland 
goland is a supporter of israel and had backed cranston because 
of the senators record of support for that country

the visiting prime minister of lithuania 
criticized president bush today for doing nothing more than calling 
for good faith negotiations in her countrys independence 
showdown with the soviet union 
simply making statements that there should be cooperation and 
urging lithuania to sit down at the bargaining table is not 
sufficient at this time when the soviet union is interfering in 
lithuanias relationships with western countries kazimiera 
prunskiene said a day after meeting with bush 
however mrs prunskiene said it was too early to ask the united 
states to impose economic sanctions against soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in an effort to prod him toward accepting 
lithuanian independence 
she also said she did not favor granting trade favors to the 
soviets doing that she said would be providing implicit 
support for their actions 
mrs prunskiene called for the united states to grant formal 
diplomatic recognition to lithuania such a move she said would 
be a logical consequence of the longstanding american position 
that it does not recognize the soviet annexation of her country 
she said the refusal of western nations to recognize an 
independent lithuania now is the main factor in the soviets 
refusal to accept lithuanias secession as an accomplished fact 
mrs prunskiene made her comments and replied to questions at an 
appearance at the national press club 
she backed away from calling on the american government to 
punish the soviets economically saying we would hope the 
imposition of economic sanctions would be held in reserve as a 
threat to encourage sitting down at the negotiation table but we 
are not looking for a situation where the soviet people are forced 
to suffer 
on thursday in a meeting with bush in the oval office mrs 
prunskiene failed to budge the president from his handsoff stance 
bush has limited himself in the dispute between the soviets and the 
tiny breakaway republic to expressions of hope that the issue can 
be ironed out in peaceful negotiations he has expressed confidence 
that ultimately lithuania would be free 
mrs prunskiene visited the national archives today to look at 
americas declaration of independence and she said that seeing it 
made her think it would be a mistake for her people to back down 
now from their own declaration 
the prime minister found many sympathetic listeners as she made 
the rounds thursday in washington sen jesse helms rnc took 
her by the hand and led her across the senate floor 
and members of the young americans for freedom accustomed to 
demonstrating against communism shouted outside the heritage 
foundation headquarters in support of a woman who until three 
months ago was a rising star in the communist party a member of 
the supreme soviet 
freedom yes gorby no they chanted lithuania dont give 
in 
as she must have anticipated bush refused to recognize the new 
democratic government in lithuania as an independent country 
and the president refused anew to apply economic pressure on 
gorbachev to call off his embargo designed to make lithuania 
abandon its secessionist notions 
instead after the two met for 45 minutes thursday in the oval 
office bush called again for goodfaith dialogue stressed his 
abhorrence of intimidation and reminded his guest that the 
united states has never recognized the forcible incorporation of 
the baltic states into the ussr 
mrs prunskiene 47 introduced as a courageous woman from a 
courageous country told the conservative heritage foundation she 
got the impression that the president at least was not 
indifferent to lithuanias plight 
i made it clear to president bush that the lithuanian nation 
is awaiting basic support from him she said 
everywhere she sought to drive home one point you do not have 
to choose between lithuania and gorbachev 
she argued that gorbachev would be strengthened by the existence 
of an independent lithuania it would help him overcome the 
reactionary forces which oppose not only independence for the 
baltic states but his reforms as well she said 
mrs prunskiene said she told bush the same thing it was not 
an eitheror choice either lithuania or gorbachev 
in any event she said even the worlds darling does not have 
the monopolistic right to decide the fate of other nations 
through all her rounds she heard disagreement in public only 
once it fell to a liberal democrat rep edward j markey of 
massachusetts to espouse support for the position the bush 
administration has wisely pursued 
he said it would be wrong to punish gorbachev for the sins of 
stalin 
america has a commitment to the principle of national 
selfdetermination markey told mrs prunskiene at a meeting of 
the us commission on security and cooperation in europe a human 
rights monitor on the other hand americans also want gorbachev 
to succeed in his program of reforms markey said

richard nixon a veteran political 
prognosticator says that only serious trouble in the economy would 
give democrats a chance to recapture the white house in 1992 
and said nixon in a television interview aired friday night 
the democrat who best could challenge george bush if the economy 
turns sour is new york gov mario cuomo 
the interview one of a series the former president has done 
this week to promote his new book was broadcast on public 
television stations 
nixon said bush is popular because of a mistakefree 
administration the democratic opposition he said is the 
weakest in 50 years 
cuomo would be able to seize on the haves vs the havenot 
issue more effectively than any of the other democrats because of 
his appeal nixon said cuomo has high intelligence he has 
heart or at least he appears to have and thats what matters 
nixon called cuomo a demagogue on foreign policy a term he also 
applied to richard gephardt the house majority leader 
hes hurt himself by demagoguing on the japanese issue 
nixon said about gephardt who has been the most outspoken foe of 
japanese trade practices 
he sounds as if he doesnt really mean it because he goes so 
far in doing so i think hes losing some of his basically 
democratic constituency as a result 
nixon said he seldom offers advice to bush because theres 
nothing that you appreciate less than having wellintentioned 
people even former presidents calling and saying why dont 
you do this why dont you do that 
the presidents problems are basically not primarily with his 
enemies theyre with his friends who think they know how to run 
the thing better than he does 
as he did in his book nixon talked about watergate but said 
i really think that 18 years of watergate is enough i really 
havent got anything to add to it 
nixon said he hadnt changed his mind either about the news 
media 
i am a conservative he said i was probably one of their 
favorite pinup boys theyd have a photograph of me over the press 
club bar and theyd throw darts into it 
he has no doubts he said that members of the news media lean 
to the left in their reporting 
i treasure my good relations with many members of the press 
they are not slobs as some people think they are not inaccurate 
as many people think but the press is generally biased

britain and france which have 
jealously guarded the independence of their nuclear forces 
announced friday they will forge closer links in security and 
defense matters 
the french and british defense ministers later announced they 
were looking at the possibilities of cooperation on unspecified 
nuclear programs 
prime minister margaret thatcher and president francois 
mitterrand of france spoke at a news conference during the annual 
anglofrench summit it was held a day after president bush 
announced that shortrange lance missiles in germany which will 
become obsolete in 1995 will not be replaced 
mrs thatcher who had favored a new lance missile said bushs 
decision increased the importance of modernizing the present 
freefalling nuclear bombs to a missile from airtoground 
mitterrand endorsed bushs decision on the lance which is the 
position i had in fact called for myself in 1988 he said france 
wants to link modernization or reductions in nuclear weapons to 
concrete results from vienna talks on reducing conventional forces 
both of us as independent nuclear deterrent powers the only 
two in europe we feel we should cooperate more closely on 
security and defense matters mrs thatcher said 
we have asked our foreign and defense ministers to supervise a 
program of enhanced cooperation on these issues with particular 
emphasis on future security arrangements in europe she said 
no field is precluded from such cooperation said 
mitterrand lets move forward we will not overnight achieve 
coordination as complete and as full as i would wish but we will 
move forward 
britain and france have not included their nuclear arsenals in 
the superpower arms reduction talks both countries maintain they 
need nuclear weapons as an essential minimal deterrent and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in recent years has not pressed the 
issue 
mrs thatcher said her talks with mitterrand focused on the 
situation in the soviet union and eastwest relations 
mitterrand told reporters he shares bushs fears for the 
stability of the soviet government saying he detects certain 
elements of fragility things that could become dangerous 
bush told reporters thursday that he sometimes worries about 
gorbachevs staying power and the possibility of a takeover that 
will set back the whole process of reform in the soviet union 
but mitterrand said we arent gambling on his failure 
the hypothesis that were definitely working on is the continuation 
of the renovation process that we very much hope for and that we 
hope will succeed 
mrs thatcher avoided direct comment on bushs fears 
president gorbachev has done wonders he has brought about a 
complete transformation in eastwest relations and i think has been 
the first person to have the courage to see that the communist 
system would not work for the soviet union she said 
i personally both hope and expect that he will continue as 
president gorbachev of the soviet union she said 
both leaders expressed hope that the crisis over lithuania the 
soviet republic that declared its independence from moscow will be 
resolved at the negotiating table 
we still think that the situation can best be resolved by 
continued discussions and we hope those discussions are coming near 
to being brought about mrs thatcher said she added that she 
planned to meet lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene when 
she comes to london 
the leaders met at waddesdon manor a stately home 30 miles 
northwest of london 
defense secretaries tom king of britain and jeanpierre 
chevenement of france also met friday and agreed to expand their 
program of joint military exercises beyond 1992 and look at the 
possibilities of cooperation on a future frigate 
a french helicopter regiment will join in british army field 
exercises in germany in september 1992 and other exercises an 
exchange of helicopter pilots is also being established they 
announced

a government report says efforts to save the 
rare northern spotted owl from extinction could lead to social 
upheaval in the pacific northwest including increased rates of 
violence divorce and suicide 
the study anticipates the environmental effort would cause 
workers to relocate real estate values to fall and rural areas to 
unite to ward off environmentalists 
timber harvests on federal lands in the northwest would be cut 
nearly in half by 1995 costing the region at least 13000 jobs if 
a proposed owl recovery plan is adopted the us forest service 
and bureau of land management said in a study released thursday 
the us fish and wildlife service is to decide by june 23 
whether to list the northern spotted owl as an endangered species 
the report focused on the economic impact of a proposal by a 
panel of government scientists led by forest service biologist jack 
ward thomas to protect the owls forest habitat 
however the study also addresses the social and other 
impacts of significant harvest reductions in the northwests 
timberbased communities 
the report said communities will pull together at first as 
common adversity is confronted in response to the collective 
perception that jobs and livelihood are being sacrificed to protect 
oldgrowth timber 
but it said tensions will rise as jobs become more scarce 
this will stem from a rift in these communities between those 
who already have found work and those who have not 
in severe cases of community dysfunction increased rates of 
domestic disuptes divorce acts of violence delinquency 
vandalism suicide alcoholism and other social problems are to be 
expected the report said 
forest service chief f dale robertson has indicated that if the 
spotted owl is listed as endangered the service may adopt the 
thomas proposal as its recovery plan for the species 
the looming economic upheaval has northwest lawmakers scrambling 
to find alternatives to the committees recommendations 
sen slade gorton rwash said the forest service report 
makes clear the outrageous and unnecessary hardship to families 
that will occur if the thomas report is adopted 
the only way to save our rural communities dependent on the 
harvest of public timber is to interject human values into a 
process that has thus far ignored them he said 
listing the spotted owl as an endangered species is going to 
be catastrophic to all oregonians not just those living in rural 
communities said rep denny smith rore

britains labor party rejoiced friday in sweeping 
local election victories but prime minister margaret thatcher took 
comfort that the results were not as devastating to her 
conservatives as expected 
and some analysts predicted mrs thatcher was now more secure 
against possible challenges to her leadership of the conservative 
party 
millions of voters protesting soaring home loan rates and an 
unpopular new local tax deserted the conservatives in the 
nationwide local vote thursday 
but while preelection polls showed mrs thatcher with a 
20point deficit the actual swing against the government was only 
11 percent share prices rose on the london stock exchange 
reflecting relief by big business 
in the most important trend for labor the party posted 
significant gains in the prosperous and heavily populated south for 
the first time since mrs thatcher ousted a labor government in 
1979 
that is the spread of support that we need which makes me 
forecast that we are certain to win the next election said labor 
party leader neil kinnock 
but in london the conservatives performed well in a 
particularly sore loss for kinnock the tories wrested from labor 
the west london borough of ealing where kinnock lives 
i am sure neils residence in ealing is extremely welcome to 
his immediate neighbors snapped bryan gould a labor campaign 
manager but i dont think it is a big factor in terms of 
peoples voting preferences 
and the tories held with increased majorities two other key 
boroughs wandsworth and westminster 
these councils have set the lowest local tax rates in britain 
under the new municipal tax system labor has accused them of 
rigging the tax amounts to bribe voters 
the conservatives remained virtually shut out in scotland and 
performed badly in northern england losing the industrial city of 
bradford 
weve lost some we hoped to hold but we have a very good 
basis on which to go forward and win the next general election 
declared mrs thatcher she said the party had confounded the 
polls 
with results declared from all but one of the 201 councils 
contested labor gained 300 seats the conservatives lost 191 
seats and the centrist social and liberal democratic party lost 48 
apart from the scottish nationalists and the tiny green party 
other minority parties all had net losses in the some 5000 seats 
contested 
labor had control of 110 of the councils contested up from 97 
the conservatives had 51 down from 60 the centrists had 17 down 
two no party won a majority in the rest 
a computer analysis by the british broadcasting corp showed 
labor with 42 percent of the vote enough for a comfortable general 
election victory and the conservatives with 31 percent 
the centrists performing far better than their singlefigure 
showing in polls got 18 percent the rest was scattered among 
minority parties 
bbc political correspondent john cole said the 
betterthanexpected result for mrs thatchers party will 
fortify her leadership against the assault that is going on 
all have some cause to be grateful for the results all have 
some cause to be anxious said cole 
speculation had increased as mrs thatchers ratings slid over 
the past 12 months that the party would attempt to ditch her this 
autumn 
but most analysts now believe the next election up to two years 
away remains wide open and will depend heavily on how the economy 
performs 
at present the outlook is bleak interest rates are at 15 
percent and have failed to curb inflation which is expected to hit 
doubledigit figures next month 
government officials hinted that the new tax known as the poll 
tax will still be amended although not changed in principle 
the tax has caused a national furor it is widely perceived as 
unfair because local councils divide the charges for local services 
equally among all adults regardless of income 
it replaced the previous property tax system under which only 
17 million homeowners paid for local services such as education 
police and garbage collection all 38 million adults are liable 
for the new tax with rebates for the 95 million poorest 
mrs thatcher introduced the new system thinking that it would 
prove to voters that local councils dominated by labor were bigger 
spenders however the average local tax has worked out to 580 
onethird above government targets instead of labor councils 
getting blamed for the bills mrs thatcher is taking the blame

presidents hafez assad and hosni mubarak 
met this week to cement a spectacular reconciliation between syria 
and egypt after a 12year rift 
the meeting was friendly but the two countries differ 
fundamentally on how to bring about an arabisraeli peace and 
mubarak made only halting progress in his efforts to end the feud 
between syria and iraq 
the welcome given to the egyptian president in syria would have 
been unthinkable over the last decade when syria was vilifying 
egypt as a traitor to the arab cause for signing the camp david 
treaty with israel 
the two countries resumed relations in december of the 17 arab 
nations that cut ties with cairo in the wake of camp david only 
libya holds out 
egypt is trying to get middle east peace negotiations going 
sometimes in concert with the united states egypt has been 
advocating a separate path to peace involving direct 
israelipalestinian negotiations that could lead eventually to an 
international parley 
mubarak told reporters that the crux of the problem is the 
palestinian problem if there is an active role for the 
palestinians president hafez assad will never miss the train 
but there would have to be some agreement between assad and plo 
leader yasser arafat who are bitter enemies 
assad regards arafats recognition of israels right to exist as 
an unnecessary concession born of weakness he wants to build up 
his armed forces to achieve strategic parity with israel and 
negotiate from a position of strength 
syria is the only arab state that has not recognized the 
independent palestinian state announced at the palestine national 
congress session in november 1988 and it blocked damascusbased 
palestinians from attending 
arafat has been in the vanguard of arab leaders who have been 
pushing for an arab summit in baghdad to discuss the surge in 
soviet jewish emigration to israel but assad is also a foe of 
president saddam hussein of iraq and there is little chance assad 
would travel to damascus unless syrianiraqi relations improve 
assad told egyptian reporters that great differences remain 
between damascus and baghdad but that time and effort might 
heal them mubarak expressed hope that he might persuade assad 
to attend a summit in baghdad 
assad however expressed surprise that baghdad was being 
discussed as a summit venue without prior consultation and syrian 
official sources speaking on condition of anonymity said assad 
remained skeptical about the proposed arrangements for a summit 
crown prince abdullah bin abdel aziz of saudi arabia was due in 
damascus on saturday on a trip aimed at trying to reconcile syria 
and iraq abdullah in the past played a similar role in mending 
ties between jordan and syria 
foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq announced that his country 
would officially invite assad to attend the summit but the date 
and the precise agenda remain vague 
in addition to the feuds between the iraqi and syrian wings of 
the arab baath socialist parties in the two countries syria was 
the only arab country to side with persian iran in its 198088 war 
with iraq

the united states has rejected a reported 
offer by libyan leader moammar gadhafi to dismantle a plant the 
bush administration contends was designed to produce poison gas 
the state department said friday 
gadhafi has said the plant produces pharmaceuticals and 
according to diplomats he offered to dismantle the facility if 
western countries agreed to replace it 
id like a free pharmaceutical plant too this is not a 
pharmaceutical plant this is a chemical weapons facility state 
department deputy spokesman richard n asked about 
the reported offer 
gadhafi built it gadhboucher said wheafi should dismantle it were 
not 
attracted by the offer 
the rabta plant was said to have been damaged by fire in late 
march shortly after gadhafi reportedly made the offer 
the united states initially said the blaze caused heavy damage 
to the plant but later news reports said us officials had 
decided the fire was a hoax 
a review of satellite photographs reportedly showed that burn 
marks were painted on the building apparently in an effort to head 
off any us military action against the facility

departing savings and loan cleanup boss l 
william seidman said friday that real pain is yet to come in 
the bailout and urged patience with his successor 
all the evidence to date is that the costs will exceed those 
originally estimated he told a house banking committee task 
force on the sampl bailout 
we are operating now in markets where interest rates are going 
up and property values are going down he said 
panel members lavished praise on the 69yearold regulator who 
is often at odds with the administration and is being nudged out as 
chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp and the resolution 
trust corp the fdic insures bank and thrift institution deposits 
the rtc conducts the sampl bailout 
at seidmans suggestion president bush is turning to william 
taylor the federal reserve boards director of bank supervision 
to take over the position 
panel members welcomed the prospect of taylors appointment 
cautiously but questioned whether he would match seidman as an 
independent voice seidman asked them not to judge taylors 
performance too quickly 
dont be impatient this is a long hard job it isnt going 
to be accomplished anytime soon he said 
the real pain of whats taking place on everything from 
increased government borrowing to the effect on real estate 
markets is still being felt i think it is very important that no 
one expect by this time next year well all feel great said 
seidman 
however rep bruce vento dminn chairman of the task force 
said i worry about the independence of the fdic and the rtc i 
worry about future policy decisions driven by political spin 
control 
and rep charles schumer dny berated the administration for 
its willingness to let seidman go he said taylor despite his 
ability would fail without stronger administration support 
i think the administration should be on its hands and 
knees begging you to stay the messenger shouldnt be blamed for 
the bad news schumer told seidman 
mr taylors talents will be wasted and the country will 
suffer unless this administration makes this crisis a top 
priority the president cant do it if he treats bill taylor with 
the same resounding indifference as he did bill seidman said 
schumer 
ventos panel focused on the slow pace of the sale of real 
estate loans securities and other assets of failed thrifts 
seidman acknowledged that real estate sales of 21 billion 
leaving a 164 billion portfolio have been not as much as we 
would have liked however he said the agency is preparing policy 
changes that would allow it to sell property at auction and at a 
discount from appraised values 
he warned though that the requirement that the agency appraise 
nearly all of its assets could greatly slow the bailout some 
appraisals in areas where appraisers are flooded with business 
are taking up to a year 
i think we have to be very careful and apply common sense 
or appraisals alone will stop this whole process seidman said 
seidman was backed by former fdic chairman irvine h sprague 
who said appraisals were little better than guesstimates and 
that by far the cheapest approach is to get what you can 
quickly 
the alternative is an ever increasing carrying cost ever 
multiplying fees to attorneys appraisers and accountants and an 
ever growing bureaucracy he said

rocks and firebombs fought street battles with riot police in three 
cities friday but labor unrest around the country showed signs of 
easing reports said 
police reported some arrests and injuries in protests in seoul 
ulsan and kwangju but gave no overall figures

hospital morgue and seized the body of a labor activist guarded by 
militant workers

former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr 
relied on political ties to decide discretionary housing grants and 
once ordered money to help a down and out former campaign 
manager an imprisoned former aide said friday 
dubois l gilliam concluded three days of testimony about abuse 
in the reagan administrations department of housing and urban 
development by describing pierce as deeply involved in funding 
decisions under one program where politics was virtually the only 
qualification examined 
secretary pierce when he wanted something done he would 
tell you to get it funded gilliam said 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the house panel 
investigating the hud scandals called gilliams testimony 
credible 
he said gilliam had contradicted assertions pierce made under 
oath before the committee on may 25 1989 that he had not been 
involved in deciding who received hud grants 
the former deputy assistant secretary is serving a prison 
sentence for abuse of hud programs and testified under a grant of 
court grant of immunity 
we established the fact that contrary to his testimony mr 
pierce personally directed the funding of a very large number of 
projects lantos said mr pierce did favors for friends 
and political allies on countless occasions 
but pierces attorney paul l perito angrily accused lantos and 
other committee members of defaming my client while protected 
by congressional immunity he said gilliams testmony was not 
credible and doesnt amount to a loaded water pistol 
perito said pierces denial of involvement applied only to the 
section 8 moderate rehabilitation program the first to be publicly 
implicated in allegations of abuse the grants gilliam testified 
about friday were under the secretarys discretionary fund 
my client was never asked did you personally make decisions 
in your own discretionary fund perito said had he been asked 
he would have said sure i did it was my discretionary fund 
congressional investigators contended pierces yearold 
statement was a broader assertion some members of the panel have 
urged that special prosecutor arlin adams be permitted to broaden 
the scope of his investigation of pierce to include perjury before 
congress it now is confined to section 8 program activities 
pierces may 1989 appearance before the committee was at the 
start of the panels hud investigation and he appeared without a 
lawyer pierce refused later subpoenas to testify invoking his 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
in his final testimony gilliam asserted pierce ordered projects 
receive federal grants under huds community development technical 
assistance program 
he said he did not believe pierce or other top aides received 
gratuities or kickbacks gilliam has admitted taking some 100000 
in gratuities while at hud 
gilliam said pierce ordered him to provide a 350000 grant to a 
private group in which his friend and former political manager sam 
singletary was a partner he said pierce wanted to help singletary 
because he was down and out and i did so he told me to 
fund the project 
the grant was arranged even though singletary and his partner 
lacked experience and the city that was to benefit from the 
project camden nj did not request it 
although the secretary had discretion to direct grants under the 
technical assistance programs committee staff director stuart 
weisberg said basing decisions on politics could be considered an 
abuse of the program and against the intent of congress 
weisberg said singletary was a close friend of pierces who had 
run his unsuccessful election campaigns for a new york state 
judgeship in 1959 and 1960 lantos said singletary was indicted in 
1985 on state charges involving a job training program receiving 
state money 
perito in response denied pierce was close to singletary and 
said pierce had virtually no knowledge of any of this he 
simply approved a routine funding recommendation in the usual and 
customary way 
gilliam described meetings held with himself pierce and 
executive assistant deborah gore dean in which they would would 
discuss the political sponsors of each applicant and often not 
mention the merits of a project 
i would give him the name of the company and the political 
sponsors gilliam said boom boom boom and thats the way 
we would conduct the meeting 
lantos said the program was a cross between a slush fund and a 
political action committee 
in another case gilliam said he directed a grant to another 
group because of its connection with a brother of pierce he 
offered few other details perito denied pierce ever directed a 
grant to his brother

l island on march 21 
it and five other sea lions had been captured near seattles 
ballard locks on march 12 
the animal was last tracked at san miguel island on april 3 
alabaster said 
some sea lions migrate north in the winter to puget sound and 
some have discovered that the fish ladder at the ballard locks 
offers abundant easy meals 
the sea lions have devastated the run of wild steelhead that 
head past the locks to spawn in streams that feed lake washington 
scientists have tried several schemes to discourage the sea 
lions including trapping firecrackers and bopping them with blunt 
arrows shot from crossbows 
the free ride home for the six animals was an experiment to see 
whether they would return to puget sound within the same season 
after being relocated to their channel islands rookeries noaa said 
in a statement 
we wanted to find out if they would come back and we did 
alabaster said now we have an idea how long it takes 
each of the animals had a radio transmitter glued to its back 
until now only one animal no 42 had been recorded north of the 
channel islands it was detected april 6 near big sur south of 
monterey calif noaa said 
national marine fisheries services spokesman joe scordino said 
no 22 probably will turn around and head back south the steelhead 
run is over and the fish ladder at the locks is closed for 
maintenance 
scordino said scientists arent sure why no 22 made the swim 
north since this is the time of year when sea lions usually leave 
puget sound to return to california

stalinists czarists and other ultrarightist 
protesters insulted mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet leaders 
during the may day parade forcing them to leave the festivities a 
top adviser said friday 
alexander yakovlev speaking at a news conference also 
dismissed reports in europe suggesting the soviet army was 
mobilized feb 25 to try to overthrow gorbachev or pressure him to 
toe the militarys line 
the unofficial may day demonstration that followed the 
traditionally wellorchestrated workers parade tuesday brought 
tens of thousands of protesters onto red square in an outpouring of 
discontent from both left and right 
gorbachev who tapped his fingers in apparent impatience and 
the other leaders left their perch atop the lenin mausoleum after 
enduring the protest for about 20 minutes 
the leadership left red square because of political 
considerations because we do not agree with that ultraright 
political position that was demonstrated by those people 
yakovlev said 
he made no mention of the criticism from those who complained 
that gorbachevs reforms have not been radical enough yakovlev is 
widely considered to be an architect of the reforms 
i saw stalin portraits nicholas ii portraits he said 
slogans were heard that ceausescus destiny is in store for some 
people that was really unfortunate anybody would treat these 
slogans as an insult 
the romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu was overthrown and 
executed in december 
to us with our tragic history it is not admissible that some 
people would have a chance to turn back the course of history back 
to the abyss he added 
yakovlevs comments came in a lengthy questionandanswer 
session with soviet and foreign journalists at a meeting sponsored 
by interfax a soviet news agency 
asked about reports published in europe that the army was 
mobilized feb 25 to pressure gorbachev or even overthrow him 
yakovlev labeled them rumors and said there are no grounds to 
support them he denied there were military movements that day 
it was widely reported at the time however that thousands of 
troops many in riot gear were brought into moscow to ensure that 
a mass demonstration that day did not get out of hand the troop 
movements mostly of soldiers from the interior ministrys internal 
security forces were widely viewed as a government effort to deter 
people from participating in the gathering which authorities 
repeatedly warned might be violent 
there is no basis to the claim that gorbachev had to somehow 
change his policies in response to that pressure yakovlev said 
we do not see any grounds to suspect our army to think that they 
are hatching some kind of plans against the party against the 
leadership we do not believe that this is the case 
asked repeatedly about lithuania he did not retreat from the 
kremlins position that the breakaway baltic republic must freeze 
suspend or reverse its march 11 independence declaration before the 
soviet union will ease its economic blockade and open negotiations 
any negotiations begin from the beginning not from the end 
he said 
yakovlev met last month with lithuanian lawmakers in what was 
billed as a strictly unofficial conversation but was seen at 
the time as a possible precursor to negotiations it apparently led 
nowhere 
asked about the redeployment of military forces in europe as a 
result of the reunification of germany yakovlev said some 
redistribution will be necessary but he would not favor 
surrounding germany with a deterrent force 
it would be highly undesirable even inadmissable to have 
some grouping of forces emerging around germany he said i 
believe that germany has had its share of fighting i believe 
germany has had enough of wars as all of us have 
the soviet people still retain some psychological concerns 
as a result of their devastating wars with germany he said they 
are somewhat guarded in their attitude because we have experienced 
too many tragedies but we believe that new relations will emerge 
in europe and revenge or other such feelings will be prevented 
through joint efforts

lithuanias prime minister said friday that 
white house policies merely urging goodfaith negotiation to 
resolve the baltic republics independence crisis are an inadequate 
response in the face of soviet economic warfare 
simply making statements that there should be cooperation is 
not adequate at this time when the soviets are interfering in 
lithuanias ties with other countries kazimiera prunskiene said 
in a blunt comment just a day after her unofficial oval office 
meeting with president bush 
mrs prunskiene also urged the united states not to grant 
favored trade status to the soviet union 
now that moscow has imposed an economic blockade it wouldnt 
be logical to grant most favored nation tariff status it would 
be providing implicit support for their actions 
however in a shift of position she said it was too early to 
ask the united states to impose economic sanctions against soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in an effort to prod him toward 
accepting lithuanian independence 
we would hope the imposition of economic sanctions would be 
held in reserve as a threat to encourage sitting down at the 
negotiating table because we are not looking for a situation where 
the soviet people are forced to suffer she said 
vytatus landsbergis president of lithuanias parliament has 
harshly criticized bushs recent decision to defer possible 
sanctions saying it was reminiscent of western appeasement of nazi 
germany immediately before world war ii 
mrs prunskiene said after her thursday meeting with bush that 
she would not have used such a comparison but that landsbergis had 
spoken in his zeal for lithuanian independence 
the prime minister failed to persuade bush to change his stance 
on the secessionist republic 
mrs prunskiene in comments friday at the national press club 
suggested that guarantees of lithuanian independence should be both 
political and economic 
lithuania wants quick diplomatic recognition from the united 
states and other nations and mrs prunskiene said the refusal of 
western capitals to do so is the main factor in the soviet refusal 
to accept lithuanias secession 
diplomatic recognition should be the logical consequence of the 
policy of many of these nations during the last 50 years to 
recognize the forced incorporation of lithuania latvia and estonia 
into the soviet union she said 
the republic also seeks concrete political support to enable 
it to enter the world economic market she said adding that 
lithuania does not seek handouts or direct assistance 
the may 30 bushgorbachev summit in washington may prove crucial 
for baltic independence she said 
i think they have a chance to make decisions which are of 
critical importance to the future of europe and bring to a final 
close world war ii 
but she said it was important for the united states and other 
western governments to move decisively in the few weeks remaining 
before bush and gorbachev meet 
i would hope that when gorbachev comes to the united states 
this question of international guarantees for lithuania will not 
have been left hanging but that something will have been done 
about it 
mrs prunskiene began her second busy day in washington with a 
pilgrimage to the national archives for a firsthand look at the 
declaration of independence 
it occurred to me that america was very fortunate that the 
declaration of independence of the united states was never 
suspended and that you enjoy true democracy she said 
for that reasons for us to suspend our declaration of 
independence would be contrary to the spirit of democracy i find 
here in the united states 
on saturday mrs prunskiene was scheduled to address a 
lithuanian youth congress before beginning her journey home 
spokesman mark johnson said mrs prunskiene had been invited to 
stop in london for talks with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher but that final arrangements had not been made

star of the sea church was moved as a 
lava flow burned through the heart of this picturesque beach town 
friday more than seven years after kilauea volcano began its 
latest eruption 
the flow picked up speed and advanced more than 200 yards 
overnight but so far it has bypassed the kalapana store and 
driveinn and the kalapana mauna kea congregational church 
it was moving behind both structures and was beginning to rise 
along the congregational churchs wall that abutted a meeting hall 
but civil defense officials said they were more concerned about 
three homes in danger of being cut off from road access before 
residents could remove their belongings 
the wooden roman catholic church also called the painted 
church slowly made its way down beach road which crews had 
cleared of utility poles and overhanging tree branches 
an elderly native hawaiian woman pleaded with workers and civil 
defense officials not to move the church church officals decided 
last week to save its handpainted wall murals 
how can you move it how can you move it the woman screamed 
at workers for a construction company that volunteered its services 
others echoed similar sentiments 
how can you call it star of the sea church if they put it on a 
mountain asked kapena kamahele whose family has a long history 
in kalapana 
workers toiled throughout the night to prepare the church for 
relocation it was taken about a mile out of town where it will 
stay until church officials decide where to move it 
civil defense ordered members of the congregational church who 
had spent the night in the building to evacuate friday morning 
the book is closed we open a new book today said bernice 
mckeague church moderator 
the congregation held a prayer vigil thursday night and watched 
as the lava built up in a gully behind the church long before the 
present flow arrived church members voted never to move the 
church saying it would be hypocritical of their faith 
the church originally built along the seashore in 1823 was 
destroyed by an earthquake tidal wave and lava in 1868 
the earthquake sunk the land the church was located on and a 
few years later it was rebuilt at the site where star of the sea is 
located erosion prompted the congregation to move again across the 
street to its present location mckeague said 
she packs a real history mckeague said 
so far walter yamaguchi owner of the kalapana store and 
driveinn since 1963 has been correct in maintaining that his store 
would be spared 
he has been making daily offerings to hawaiian volcano goddess 
pele 
madame pele will never take me the 82yearold man said 
he added that he left some supplies in the store to sell once he 
is allowed to open again 
of increasing concern to authorities is the threat to public 
health when the lava begins to flow into the ocean which it 
eventually will do if it continues its present path when lava hits 
the water it creates sulphuric acid a harmful toxic substance 
known in volcano country as laze 
officials have not disclosed plans on how they will deal with 
that 
to date 131 homes in the community on the island of hawaii have 
burned since the eruption began on jan 3 1983

what a trip man the lava lite a fixture in 
psychedelic pads in the 60s is 25 years old 
during the past quartercentury the flowing glowing lamps were 
praised by the american institute of architects and seen on the 
us presidents desk in the movie amazon women on the moon 
people feel the way about their lava lites that other people 
feel about their pets said christopher baldovin marketing 
director for haggerty enterprises the chicagobased company that 
began making them in 1965 its like watching fish but you dont 
have to feed them 
in the last two years more lava lites were sold annually than 
when they were introduced even though the price has doubled to 
about 50 baldovin said 
customers include former hippies who can finally afford one and 
teenagers not yet born when they were introduced 
retailers nationwide said demand for the lamp has steadily grown 
since sales dropped to their lowest point in 1983 
although the company also manufactures the wave a fluidfilled 
rectangle that simulates wave shapes while rocking slowly on a 
motorized base the lava lite is by far the companys most famous 
product 
a lanternlike glass chamber lit from the bottom the lava a 
goop of 11 nontoxic substances discovered by accident by english 
inventor craven walker gurgles slowly to the top then settles 
gently back at the bottom where the cycle begins again 
lava lite owners are fiercely loyal haggerty customer service 
representative jean bartyzel said that the day after northern 
californias oct 17 earthquake she was swamped with calls from 
distraught customers whose lamps had broken during the quake 
even the american institute of architects praised lava lites an 
institute official quoted in the washington post said their 
kinetic structural elements constitute an intriguing relief from

a man who murdered two police officers 14 
years ago was put to death friday by three jolts in the electric 
chair that produced flames sparks and smoke from his masked head 
jessie joseph taferos lawyer described the execution as 
torture and florida gov bob martinez immediately requested an 
investigation of the technical problems in carrying out the 
sentence 
tafero 43 condemned for the shooting deaths of highway patrol 
trooper phillip black and visiting canadian constable donald irwin 
died at 713 am at florida state prison near starke 
in a 1984 interview tafero likened himself and sonya jacobs 
his girlfriend and codefendant to a modernday bonnie and 
clyde they were denied permission to marry after both were 
condemned to die 
when a blackhooded executioner turned the switch for the first 
time at 707 am flames rose 6 inches from the hood covering 
taferos face and scalp 
the executioner then interrupted the standard twominute 
2000volt electrical cycle and prison officials later determined 
a wet sponge on taferos head caught fire said state corrections 
department spokesman bob macmaster 
prison superintendent tom barton who usually shows no emotions 
in the clinical atmosphere of florida executions had a pained look 
on his face 
despite the repeated jolts dr frank kilgo the prisons chief 
medical officer believed tafero died quickly macmaster quoted 
kilgo as saying i believe he was unconscious the minute the 
current hit him 
mark olive an atlanta attorney who represented tafero said 
martinez should ask for an independent investigation and suspend 
further executions until the technical problems have been resolved 
the state cannot bring a person to justice by torturing 
them said olive torture is per se cruel and unusual 
punishment 
the governor instructed department of corrections officials to 
prepare a report on the execution but he defended the use of the 
death penalty recalling that tafero coldly took the lives of two 
officers 14 years ago 
it is unfortunate that this incident affected the execution 
but it is far more unfortunate that it took 14 years to bring to 
justice a man who killed two police officers martinez said 
tafero was the 22nd person put to death in florida and the 124th 
nationally since the us supreme court restored states rights to 
execute prisoners in 1976 taferos execution was floridas first 
in exactly a year 
in a final statement tafero complained that lastminute motions 
filed on his behalf with a federal judge and a state circuit court 
judge apparently were ignored 
id like to say that the death penalty as applied by the 
states is very arbitrary and capricious he said 
outside the prison four supporters of capital punishment peered

thousands of people lit candles in the rain 
friday to dedicate a memorial to four kent state university 
students who were slain by ohio national guardsmen during an 
antiwar protest 20 years ago 
about 4000 people huddled beneath umbrellas on a parking lot 
near the site of the shootings which took place on may 4 1970 
and marked a tragic rallying point for those who opposed american 
involvement in the vietnam war 
most of the people in the crowd placed lighted candles on the 
hilltop granite memorial some placed their candles amid the 58175 
daffodils planted on the nearby hillside for each american killed 
in the war 
about 200 students nearby waged a silent protest by raising 
clenched fists and holding up handmade signs bearing messages of 
whose may 4th is it anyway and dont minimize student 
death some held up two fingers vshaped in the peace sign 
popularized during the antiwar movement 
some kent state students have contended the universitys 
200000 memorial is too little too late 
former us sen george mcgovern the keynote speaker said the 
memorial should encourage reconciliation between the united states 
and vietnam which do not have diplomatic relations 
the war in vietnam is unfinished the unsuccessful 1972 
democratic presidential candidate said the killing has stopped 
but the arrogance that produced it survives and so does the agony 
the guilt and the separation 
mcgovern drew applause when he said the nation should never 
pursue military action counter to the public sentiment 
its important to our democracy that military operations 
should be halted if they run counter to the wishes of the american 
people 
florence schroeder mother of slain student bill schroeder 
thanked the university for building the memorial 
the memorial on 2 acres adjacent to the parking lot where the 
students were killed includes a granite plaza with four pylons 
similar in shape to elongated gravestones 
a smaller waisthigh marker was erected in honor of the slain 
students in 1971 
we think this is a fine memorial mrs schroeder told the 
crowd 
although she and her husband louis participated in the 
ceremony the families of two other slain students allison krause 
and jeffrey miller did not show up university spokeswoman janet 
thiede said 
the parents of the fourth victim sandra scheuer were on campus 
but did not speak at the ceremonies 
ms krauses mother doris krause of monroeville pa had said 
she did not plan to attend because she believed the memorial should 
have been bigger and built earlier 
the memorial was designed by chicago architect bruno ast and 
was scaled down from a proposed 1 million memorial the university 
said it was unable to raise the money 
dean kahler who was paralyzed from the waist down when he was 
wounded in the shootings said he has forgiven the guardsmen but 
added that the memorials message was important the injustices 
that were committed here should never be forgotten he said 
kahler now an athens county commissioner in southeast ohio 
said he could not be an angry bitter man 
he was the only student disabled by his wounds 
gov richard celeste read the dead students names and said each 
time i am sorry 
i felt disbelief that we had turned our weapons on our own 
children 
the governor at the time of the shootings was james a rhodes 
who ordered the national guard to restore order on the campus after 
an rotc building was set on fire in protest against the us 
invasion of cambodia he later signed a statement along with 
national guardsmen expressing regret 
mrs schroeder said she did not accept rhodes contention that 
the statement did not amount to an admission of guilt their 
signatures betray them she said 
shortly after the shootings a portage county special grand jury 
found that the guardsmen acted in selfdefense and exonerated them 
of criminal charges in march 1974 a federal grand jury in 
cleveland indicted eight guardsmen on charges of violating the 
civil rights of the dead and wounded students a judge later 
dismissed the charges for lack of evidence 
university president michael schwartz said rhodes and the 
guardsmen involved in the shootings had not been individually 
invited to the dedication but he said an open letter the 
university published as fullpage advertisements in newspapers was 
an invitation to all ohioans 
the office of the ohio adjutant general which oversees the 
guard said it had no comment or statement on the anniversary 
schwartz said the kent state community felt a kinship with 
chinese students who were attacked by the military during a 
demonstration in tiananmen square in beijing last year 
those students were seeking democracy our students were 
practicing it he said 
wuer kaixi a tiananmen square demonstration leader who later 
fled china was invited to the kent state events and took part in a 
candlelight vigil early friday

here is a text of president bushs 
commencement address friday at oklahoma state university 
you know when graduates of my vintage were sitting through 
ceremonies like this right after the second world war we faced a 
world of changes full of potential and new possibilities and 
barbara and i got into a red twodoor studebaker you still drive 
those dont you around here but nevertheless we drove from 
connecticut down to west texas i have often wondered how far id 
have gone if id made it on up to oklahoma 
postwar america was ready back then in 1948 for peace and 
prosperity but while the free world was recovering the nations of 
eastern europe were being consolidated behind an iron curtain 
and so began four decades of division in europe 40 long years of 
suspicion between two superpowers the soviet union and the united 
states 
and today you also graduate at the end of an era of conflict 
but a contest of a different kind a cold and abstract war of 
words and walls and now europe and the world have entered a new 
era the age of freedom and i hope youll forgive me if i use 
this great forum at your great university to handle a subject of 
a very serious nature 
it may be a little longer than you want to hear i remember the 
graduation at yale university my school the man giving the 
graduate speech got up and he said y is for youth and he 
talked about 25 minutes a is for altruism another 32 
minutes l is loyalty he brushed that one off in 20 minutes 
e is for excellence and when he finished there was one kid 
out here in the audience everyone else had fled 
he looked like he was praying and the speaker said to him 
well im glad youre saying a prayer what are you praying for 
son he said im praying to god and giving thanks that you 
didnt go to oklahoma state university 
so i but i want you to bear with me because ill be 
reflecting on the power and potential of democratic changes in 
several of these commencement addresses that i make this year and 
i begin today my very first at your great university with a few 
words on few words on the changes and americas place in the new 
europe 
a few of you may be wondering what a continent 4000 miles away 
has to do with you your class and you 
throughout our history great upheavals in europe have forced 
the american people to respond to make deep judgments about the 
part we should play in european affairs this has been true from 
the time of the french revolution and the war which followed it to 
world war i and the flawed peace which ended it on to the second 
world war and the creation of the postwar order 
and i believe that now we are poised at another such moment a 
critical time in our strategic relationship with our neighbors 
across the atlantic 
many of the graduates of americas class of 1916 have wondered 
why the faraway war making headlines in their newspapers would have 
anything to do with them and they might have agreed with president 
wilson who that year said we are not interested in the causes 
of war in the obscure foundations from which its stupendous 
flood has burst forth 
but a year later those classmates and their country were swept 
up in the torrent carrying them to the horror of the trenches in 
france and yet after the war we again turned away from active 
involvement in european affairs and instead we sponsored a treaty 
to outlaw war and then as the outlaws gained strength the united 
states passed new neutrality laws

americas reputation as a maker of livesaving 
medical miracles is being tarnished with a new image as an exporter 
of disease and death critics of the nations cigarette exports 
said friday 
free trade is not a license to export lung cancer or ride 
roughshod over the antismoking laws of other nations sen 
edward m kennedy dmass told a hearing of the labor and human 
resources committee he chairs 
kennedy sided strongly with critics of the industry in a growing 
debate over whether the us government should continue seeking 
expanded foreign markets for american cigarettes 
the house has scheduled committee hearings later this month on 
legislation to prohibit such trade promotion and to require on us 
brands sold abroad the same health warning that appears on 
cigarette packages in the united states 
fridays hearing was the first airing of the issue in the 
senate where legislation has not yet been proposed 
the governments success in opening markets to us cigarette 
brands in japan south korea and taiwan and a current effort in 
thailand drew strong praise and support from witnesses representing 
the cigarette industry and tobaccogrowing states and in a letter 
earlier this week from house members to ambassador carla hills the 
us trade representative 
their message was that the dispute is not a health issue but a 
question of fair trade of gaining equal rights for us brands to 
be sold to people who will continue to use a legal product 
tobacco regardless of what country it comes from 
millions of people around the world smoke and will continue to 
smoke whether or not american cigarettes are available said sen 
mitch mcconnell rky one of several legislators testifying from 
tobaccogrowing states 
tobacco was one of the few us exports earning a surplus more 
than 42 billion last year to help offset the 109 billion us 
trade deficit he said 
accusing the thai government of hypocrisy mcconnell charged 
that it is protecting its tobacco monopoly and planning to expand 
its own exports yet has the audacity to ask us not to export 
cigarettes to thailand for health reasons 
dr prakit vathesatogut director of the thai antismoking 
coalition displayed to the committee shirts and caps bearing the 
marlboro and winston brand names which he said are handed out in 
thailand and thai advertising depicting smoking as part of a 
youthful american image 
in the modernday equivalent of the opium wars our government 
is aiming to unleash the marlboro man on the thai citizenry said 
rep chet atkins dmass a sponsor of the house legislation 
the opium war between britan and china was fought from 1839 to 
1842 over the right of british traders based in india to ship opium 
to china china which sought to ban the import of opium lost and 
was forced to permit the opium trade for decades

another generation of americans sat in the bright sun of 
commencement ceremonies at colleges all across the country 
thinking war in europe would somehow pass them by 
but when war came they paid an awful price a horrible price 
for americas isolation and then when the war ended those 
students who no longer questioned our role in the future of europe 
they no longer asked what europe had to do with them because they 
knew the answer everything 
about a year ago in germany i defined the kind of europe our 
country is committed to a peaceful stable europe a europe what i 
call whole and free 
today that goal is within our reach were entering a new age of 
freedom in a time of uncertainty but great hope 
emerging democracies in eastern europe are going through social 
political and economic transformations shaking loose stagnant 
centralized bureaucracies that have smothered initiative for 
generations and in this time of transition moving away from the 
postwar era and beyond containment we cannot know what choices 
the people of eastern europe will make for their future 
the process of change in the soviet union is also still 
unfinished it will be crucial to see for example whether moscow 
chooses coercion or peaceful dialogue in responding to the 
aspirations of the lithuanian people and nationalities within the 
soviet union 
the only noble answer lies in a dialogue that results in 
unencumbered selfdetermination for lithuania 
president gorbachev has made profound progress in his country 
reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned back and 
yet neither can we turn the clock ahead to know for sure what kind 
of country the soviet union will be in years to come 
and for the sake of the future we share with europe our 
policies and presence must be appropriate for this period of 
transition with a constancy and reliability that will reassure 
our friends both old and new my european colleagues want the 
united states to be a part of europes future and i believe theyre 
right 
the united states should remain a european power in the broadest 
sense politically militarily economically and as part of our 
global responsibilities the foundation for americas peaceful 
engagement in europe has been and will continue to be nato 
recognizing in peace what we learned from war we joined with 
the free nations of europe to form an atlantic community an 
enduring political compact our engagement in europe has meant that 
europeans accept america as part of their continents future 
taking our interests into account across the board our commitment 
is not just in defense it must be a wellbalanced mix of 
involvement in all dimensions of european affairs 
because of our political commitment to peace in europe there 
hasnt been a war on the continent in 45 years think of your 
history books not a war on the continent in 45 years this long 
peace should be viewed through the long lens of history then 
europe has now experienced the longest uninterrupted period of 
international peace in the recorded history of that continent 
now the alliance the alliance is now ready to build on that 
historic achievement and define its objectives for the next 
century so the alliance must join together to craft a new western 
strategy for new and changing times 
having consulted intensively with prime minister thatcher 
recently there in bermuda and president mitterrand in key largo in 
florida and chancellor helmut kohl up in camp david and by 
telephone or cable with nato secretary general woerner and all of 
my other allied colleagues i am calling for an early summit of all 
nato leaders 
margaret thatcher one of freedoms greatest champions of the 
last decade told me that while nato has been fantastically 
successful we should be ready now to face new challenges the time 
is right for the alliance to act 
the fundamental purpose of this summit should be to launch a 
wideranging nato strategy review for the transformed europe of the 
1990s and to my nato colleagues i suggest that our summit direct 
this review by addressing four critical points one the political 
role that nato can play in europe two the conventional forces the 
alliance will need in the time ahead and natos goal for 
conventional arms control three the role of nuclear weapons based 
in europe and western objectives in new nuclear arms control 
negotiations between the united states and the soviet union and 
four strengthening the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe csce to reinforce nato and help protect democratic 
values in a europe that is whole and free

the nations unemployment rate climbed to 54 
percent in april its highest level in more than a year the 
government said friday in a report analysts called a disturbing 
sign the economy could slip into recession 
there was paltry growth in the number of us jobs for the 
second straight month and the total actually would have declined 
if not for the hiring of temporary census workers 
the report indicates the bottom dropped out of the labor 
market in april it speaks more toward a possible recession than a 
rebounding economy said allen sinai chief economist at the 
boston co 
added robert dederick of the northern trust co of chicago 
i dont think we can say the economy is toppling over a cliff 
but it is not showing any signs that its backing away from the 
cliff either so theres that danger 
bond markets rallied in response to the report traders took 
weakerthanexpected employment a report running counter to 
recent indications that the economy was picking up as a sign the 
federal reserve would not boost interest rates to slow things down 
the government reported last week that the economy grew at a 21 
percent rate in the first three months of the year twice as fast 
as some private analysts had predicted 
on wall street stocks rose 1419 points although brokers said 
the unemployment report also raised some fresh doubts about the 
outlook for economic growth and corporate profits in coming months 
in april the civilian jobless rate as measured by a household 
survey was up from the 52 percent registered in march before 
that the unemployment rate had held steady at 53 percent for nine 
months 
the last time the jobless rate reached 54 percent was january 
1989 
the number of new jobs created edged up only slightly with a 
net gain of 64000 that included the governments hiring of 78000 
workers for the 1990 census 
the job growth figure is derived from a separate survey of 
business establishments and is generally considered a more reliable 
indicator of economic activity than the household survey on 
unemployment 
the nations factories in a slump for months continued to 
falter as manufacturing jobs fell by 22000 it was the 12th 
decline in 13 months 
the manufacturing sector is continuing to bleed workers 
its starting to have a debilitating affect in other areas as 
well dederick said 
the manufacturing pinch is starting to spill over into areas 
such as business services which includes such jobs as caterers and 
security guards dederick said that sector suffered a 13000 job 
loss last month 
the biggest payroll drop in april came in construction with a 
seasonably adjusted fall of 99000 jobs construction jobs had been 
inflated early in the year by unusually warm weather 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
noted that job growth was robust in the first two months of the 
year as about 700000 new jobs were created 
that means that since january the economy has produced an 
average of 175000 new jobs a month she said a year ago at this 
time the economy had produced a monthly average of 200000 jobs 
while the 1988 average for the first four months was 275000 
ms norwood said the slowdown is not particularly surprising 
after more than seven years of business expansion 
meanwhile the service sector which has been carrying the 
economy added 179000 jobs bolstered by the hiring of temporary 
census workers 
labor costs which have been speeding upward and are blamed for 
worsening the nations inflation problems continued to increase 
although moderately the report showed 
average hourly earnings rose to 995 from 992 at least 
partly because of the april 1 increase in the minimum wage from 
335 an hour to 385 
overall total civilian employment declined slightly to 1181 
million in april the jobless numbered 68 million up from the 65 
million outofwork americans in march 
many economists had predicted the nations unemployment rate 
would eventually creep up this year since mid1988 the rate has 
ranged between 5 percent and 55 percent the lowest range since 
the early 1970s 
some analysts said fridays report was not a sign of a sudden 
collapse 
i think the numbers are finally catching up with reality it 
looks to me as though we have slow but positive growth said 
cynthia latta of drimcgraw hill 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the april 
jobless rate was 53 percent up from 51 percent in march

now the first task the nato summit should consider is the 
future political mission of the alliance as military threats fade 
the political dimension of natos work always there but seldom 
noticed becomes more prominent 
and so at the nato summit we should look for ways to help our 
german friends sustain freedom and achieve german unity something 
which we and our allies have supported for over 40 years and we 
should reaffirm the importance of keeping a united germany as a 
full member of nato 
the alliance needs to find ways to work more closely with a 
vigorous european community that is rightly asserting its own 
distinct views and in eastern europe governments once our 
adversaries are now our partners in building a new continent 
and so we must also talk about how to encourage further peaceful 
democratic change in eastern europe and inside the soviet union 
but even as nato gives more emphasis to its political mission 
its guarantee of european security must remain firm you see our 
enemy today if you think about whats the enemy today our enemy 
today is uncertainty and instability and so the alliance will need 
to maintain a sound collective military structure with forces in 
the field backed by larger forces that can be called upon in some 
crisis 
and which brings me then to the second task for the nato summit 
a review of how the alliance should plan its conventional defenses 
while we need to recognize that it will take some time before the 
soviet military presence is gone from eastern europe before those 
soviet troops are taken out of eastern europe and before the major 
reductions contemplated by both sides can be implemented we need 
to develop our strategy for that world now 
obviously as i look at the equation soviet actions what the 
russians do will be critical and yet even after all the planned 
reductions in its forces are complete even if our current arms 
control proposals are agreed to and implemented the soviet 
military will still field forces dwarfing those of any other single 
european state armed with thousands of nuclear weapons 
militarily significant us forces must remain on the other side 
of the atlantic for as long as our allies want and need them and 
these forces demonstrate as no words can the enduring political 
compact that binds americas fate with europes democracies 
if the soviet withdrawal continues and our arms control efforts 
are successful we must plan for a different kind of military 
presence focused less on the danger of an immediate outbreak of 
war and we must promote longterm stability and prevent crises 
from escalating by relying on reduced forces that show our 
capability and our readiness to respond to whatever may arise 
the conventional forces in europe treaty which we have 
proposed would be the most ambitious conventional arms control 
agreement ever concluded and we must finish the work on this 
treaty soon and plan to sign it at the csce summit this fall but 
at the nato summit we need to look further ahead preparing 
followon negotiations after the conclusion of the cfe treaty 
and the nato summit should develop the alliances objectives for 
these talks 
and third the nato summit should also assess the future of us 
nuclear forces in europe as democracy blooms in eastern europe as 
soviet troops return home and tanks are destroyed dismantled 
there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest range and 
the nato summit should accelerate ongoing work within the alliance 
to determine the minimum number and types of weapons that will be 
needed to deter war credibly and effectively 
in light of these new political conditions and the limited 
range and flexibility of these shortrange nuclear missile forces 
based in europe ive reviewed our plan to produce and deploy 
newer more modern shortrange nuclear missiles to replace the 
lance system thats now in europe 
weve almost finished the rampd research and development work for 
these new missiles but ive decided after consultation with our 
allies to terminate the followon to lance program i have also 
decided to cancel any further modernization of us nuclear artillery 
shells deployed in europe

latvian lawmakers voted for independence 
friday but plotted a more cautious break from the soviet union than 
neighboring lithuania latvians greeted the declaration of 
independence with tears a chorus of the republics traditional 
anthem and dancing in the streets 
the 1380 parliamentary vote 50 years after moscow seized the 
three baltic states on the soviets western border put latvia on a 
similar secessionist path with lithuania and estonia 
however unlike lithuanias independence declaration of march 
11 the vote by latvias supreme soviet called for a gradual break 
with the soviet union 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov said he was already thinking 
about the next step negotiations with moscow 
everything is ahead he said this is only the very very 
beginning 
gorbunov later was asked at a news conference what reaction he 
expected from the kremlin he said he could not predict what moscow 
would say but he added that the latvian government had tried to 
make it clear in the declaration that there is no cause to close 
the door on dialogue and start setting ultimatums 
fiftyseven antiindependence lawmakers refused to cast ballots 
even so the measure had no problem achieving the twothirds 
majority needed for approval 
after the vote was announced latvians inside and outside the 
hall broke into a chorus of god bless latvia the republics 
traditional anthem a cheering crowd showered emerging lawmakers 
with roses pansies and daffodils 
the deputies also voted to drop the words soviet socialist 
from the republics name making it simply the republic of 
latvia 
i waited my whole life for this said ilma kaminska 65 who 
said she remembered when latvia was forcibly annexed by joseph 
stalin in 1940 
i believed i always believed she said tearfully 
the bill proposed by the proindependence latvian peoples 
front that dominates the parliament proclaimed the start of an 
unspecified period of transition to full independence in the 
interim it calls for negotiations with moscow 
the neighboring republic of estonia took a similar step march 30 
lithuania which declared full independence seven weeks ago is 
now suffering a kremlinimposed economic blockade of oil natural 
gas and other raw materials 
friday evening tens of thousands of people gathered on the 
banks of rigas daugava river long a national symbol for latvians 
with the setting sun glinting on the river red and white 
latvian flags fluttered above the singing crowd 
my people you are free live and act like a people who 
deserve to be free said dainis ivans chairman of the latvian 
popular front 
hours later scores of people danced in the streets of central 
riga scattered fireworks exploded in the night sky 
two deputies walked out of the session during the vote 
including alfreds rubiks latvias communist party chief who 
earlier in the day warned that ethnic russians and other 
nonlatvians living in the republic opposed the measure 
they will express themselves in mass demonstrations and 
political strikes in all the cities he said 
the party chief also said antiindependence forces would appeal 
to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to impose presidential 
rule and said there ought to be a popular referendum on the 
independence question 
members of latvias opposition complained they were not given 
enough time to study the declaration some warned that moscow would 
respond to the move with heavy pressure to rescind it 
if we pass this declaration moscow will do the same thing to 
latvia as to lithuania said deputy leonids alksnis 
other speakers however cast the declaration as a means to 
avoid being overwhelmed demographically latvians are close to 
becoming a minority on their own territory 
this is our last possibility to survive and we are going to 
take advantage of it that is why we demand independence said 
writer alberts bels 
in lithuania 80 percent of the 38 million people are ethnic 
lithuanians but only about 54 percent of latvias 27 million 
people are ethnic latvians most of the rest are ethnic russians 
many of whom oppose independence 
a day earlier lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis had 
advised his neighbors to be strong and have courage on friday 
his deputy prime minister algirdas brazauskas reported that the 
economic embargo was making life in lithuania more difficult 
and appealed for substantial aid from abroad 
latvia has followed lithuanias lead on many issues in 
december it abolished the communist partys guaranteed monopoly on 
power in february it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its 
annexation by the soviet union and last month a large segment of 
its communist party broke from its moscowbased parent 
the independence measure adopts four articles from the 
republics 1922 constitution establishing an independent and 
democratic republic the historic territory of latvia giving power 
to the people and establishing a sovereign latvian parliament 
it also recognizes the legitimacy of soviet laws that do not 
contradict the republics own laws 
the deputies drafted a message reassuring gorbachev that a 
declaration of independence only opens the door to a transition 
period a period of honest dialogue and a working out of mutual 
interests 
but they added that the people of latvia have no stronger 
desire than to restore its democratic statehood it never 
reconciled itself to the loss of statehood and will never give up 
this goal 
we are hoping mikhail sergeyevich for your governmental 
understanding of latvias choice since we believe the road of 
changes for you and the nation that was started by you will remain 
unchanged in the future 
gorbunov who was reelected president of latvia on thursday 
said in his nominating speech that latvia could not expect help 
from the west 
the world on account of 5 million baltic people is not going 
to risk what has been done in the area of arms control and by 
mikhail gorbachev he said

now these there are still shortrange us and many more 
soviet nuclear missile systems deployed in europe and were 
prepared to negotiate the reduction of these forces as well as a 
set of arms control new set of arms control talks 
at the nato summit i will urge my colleagues to agree on the 
broad objectives for these future ussoviet negotiations and begin 
preparations within the alliance for these talks i would also like 
to suggest that these new ussoviet arms control talks begin 
shortly after the cfe treaty on conventional forces has been signed 
in taking these steps the united states is not going to allow 
europe to become safe for conventional war 
there are few lessons so clear in history as this only the 
combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces have ensured 
this long peace in europe but every aspect of americas engagement 
in europe military political economic must be complementary 
and one place where they all come together is in the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe an organization of 35 states of 
europe and north america the csce is already a beacon for human 
rights and individual freedoms and now it must take on a broader 
role 
and so the fourth task for this nato summit im calling for is 
to reach common allied objectives for the future of csce itself it 
can help the victorious forces of democracy in eastern europe 
secure their revolutions and as they join the commonwealth of 
free nations be assured a voice in the new europe 
and the csce should offer new guidelines for building free 
societies including setting standards for truly free elections 
adopting measures to strengthen the rule of law and pointing the 
way in the needed but painful transition from centralized command 
economies to the free markets 
the csce can also provide a forum for political dialogue in a 
more united europe and i agree with those who have called for 
regular consultations among senior representatives of the csce 
countries 
we should consider whether new csce mechanisms can help mediate 
and settle disputes in europe and i believe my allied colleagues 
and i should agree to take up these new ideas at a csce summit 
later this year in conjunction with the signing of the treaty i 
talked to you about that conventional force treaty the cfe treaty 
in eastern europe in this hemisphere the triumph of democracy 
has cast its warm light on the face of the world like a miraculous 
dawn but the outcome of this struggle for freedom is not ordained 
and its not going to be the work of miracles 
all of you who graduate here today are part of a historic 
decision for americas engagement in the future of europe and i am 
convinced that our work to protect freedom to build free 
societies will safeguard our own peace and prosperity 
the security of europe and the world has become very complex in 
this century but americas commitment to stability and peace is 
profoundly clear and its motivation derives from the strength of 
our forefathers from the blood of those who have died for freedom 
and for the sake of all who would live in peace 
and as you leave this great university every voice every 
hearts commitment to freedom is important theres a story about 
man trying to convince his son that in the struggle for freedom 
every voice counts 
and they stood in a valley watching the snow fall on a distant 
mountain it might have been a day like today but they stood there 
tell me the weight of a snowflake the man said 
almost nothing answered the boy 
as the snow swirled around them up on the mountain they saw an 
avalanche whose thunder shook the earth 
do you know which snowflake caused that the old man asked 
i dont answered the boy 
maybe said the man like the last snowflake that moves a 
mountain in the struggle for freedom a single voice makes a world 
of difference 
americas mission in europe like millions of individual 
decisions made for freedom can make a voice can make a world of 
difference the cry for freedom in eastern europe in south africa 
right here in our precious hemisphere to our south was heard 
around the world in the revolution of 1989 
and today in this new age of freedom add your voices to the 
thundering chorus 
its a great honor for me to have been at this university thank 
you very much god bless you and god bless the united states of 
america 
thank you all thank you so much thank you

more than 200 human skulls have been found 
in caves near a guerrilla camp high in the andean mountains but 
authorities said they did not know who the dead were 
a medical examiner who accompanied an army patrol to the caves 
said some of the victims had died violently and in the past two 
years but that other remains might be hundreds of years old 
army sources said some of the bones may be those of rebels 
fatally wounded in clashes with the military and the police others 
may be those of guerrillas who tried to desert or of peasants 
kidnapped from nearby villages 
the caves are located 14200 feet above sea level 20 miles 
north of this andean city ayacucho is the birthplace of the 
maoistinspired shining path guerrilla movement and rebels control 
much of the surrounding countryside 
the skulls and other human bones were found last month by a 
civil defense group on the lookout for shining path rebels near 
the caves the group found 200 sticks of dynamite medicines 
knives and rebel propaganda 
a military patrol from ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima 
went to investigate the groups findings the patrol accompanied 
by an associated press reporter returned to ayacucho friday 
the medical examiner speaking on condition of anonymity said 
many of the bones in the two caves were quite old and could have 
been placed there hundreds of years ago 
he said he was unable to count the exact number of skulls of 
recent origin 
but some of the recently dead apparently were killed by bullet 
or machete wounds the examiner said 
more than 18000 people have died in political violence since 
the shining path began its armed insurgency 10 years ago

police clubbed demonstrators friday 
and hauled some off to jail during protests over observing the 10th 
anniversary of the death of josip tito the founding father of 
communist yugoslavia 
police also broke into a school and detained pupils who ripped 
tito pictures off the wall and destroyed them 
the incidents took place as factory sirens wailed at 305 pm 
a signal to mark the hour of titos death on may 4 1980 at age 87 
passersby mostly ignored the sirens and teenagers continued 
enjoying their ice cream 
in previous years yugoslavs stood still and observed a minute 
of silence 
this time police fought members of the serbian radical party in 
belgrade arresting people who kept yelling down with the 
communists out of serbia 
shouts against hardline serbian communist leader slobodan 
milosevic also were heard 
no official word came on the number of arrests or possible 
injuries but witnesses said some police action was brutal 
protesters tore up and threw in the air old 500dinar banknotes 
bearing titos image now almost worthless following 2500 percent 
inflation 
police forced a photographer taking pictures of demonstrators 
being pushed into a police van to expose his film to light 
demonstrators were seen pulling off a marshal tito street sign 
in downtown belgrade 
the main street of every city town and village in yugoslavia is 
named after tito 
about 200 radical party members and other yugoslavs opposed to 
continuing public veneration of tito unfurled a serbian flag in 
front of parliament and carried a placard reading exterminate 
the evil communism 
for almost 45 years tito has been officially revered for his 
role in fighting the nazis in world war ii for his break with 
moscow in 1948 and for guiding yugoslavia into the nonaligned 
movement in the 1960s 
but now many yugoslavs feel their current ethnic economic and 
political troubles took root during titos rule they blame the 
weak decentralized leadership system he bequeathed for many of the 
problems 
parliament is expected to decide soon to annul a law that makes 
it a criminal offense to criticize tito or his policies 
criticism of tito has centered recently on his authoritarian 
style of rule 
he is now openly charged with setting up a death camp on an 
island off the central adriatic coast in which more than 5000 
prosoviet communists died after tito took yugoslavia out of the 
soviet orbit 
in his native croatia tito is criticized by those he purged as 
nationalists in 1971 several are successfully returning to 
politics now that croatia and slovenia have embraced multiparty 
systems and free elections 
in serbia which still advocates communism nationalism has 
grown over the past two years fueling criticism of tito the croat 
serbs allege that titos rule gave croatia and slovenia the two 
most developed of yugoslavias six republics unfair economic 
advantages 
serbias communist party staking its fate on the popularity of 
serbian president milosevic on friday promised free democratic 
elections in yugoslavias largest republic within six months 
in slovenia croatia and other parts of yugoslavia several 
peaceful memorial gatherings were held to commemorate tito 
particularly in the armed forces the state tanjug news agency 
reported

enraged students took control of mills 
college on friday staging sitins and blockades they vowed would 
continue until the exclusive womens school reverses a decision to 
admit men 
the noisy but nonviolent demonstrators conducted a sitin at 
the office of mills president mary metz and shut down classes at 
the normally quiet treelined liberal arts college most teachers 
supported the disruption which could last until the may 20 
graduation 
students wearing signs demanding the resignation of board of 
trustees chairman warren hellman even drove metz from her home 
about 9 am with blaring horns and music and cries of we will 
not accept this 
were shutting them down said thomlyn gingell a sophomore 
art history major we havent been listened to maybe this will 
make them listen 
but administrators who couldnt get to their offices because of 
student blockades and sitins involving several hundred of the 777 
undergraduate women said the board of trustees wouldnt change its 
mind 
the board citing declining enrollment and revenues voted 
thursday night to accept men as undergraduates bringing an end to 
mills 138year policy of admitting only women 
no one was happy with the decision but we believe that life 
goes on said metz who agreed to meet with students friday and 
again tuesday to discuss the decision to go coed 
i dont believe the board will reverse itself she said i 
hope this grieving starts the healing process 
while students protested members of the mills college alumnae 
association held what they described as a wake at the groups 
campus office after the trustees vote the alumnae group decided 
to consult an attorney to see if mills students can sue the school 
to keep from going coed in the fall of 1991 
marge thomas of the graduate class of 1963 said alumnae dont 
believe they can get the trustees to reverse their decision but 
that maybe the board will approve waiting to go coed until after 
the 1990 firstyear students are graduated 
they came here to go to a womens college and they should be 
allowed to finish in a womens college thomas said 
many women at mills said they would not return next year because 
of the trustees vote 
i cant believe they would ignore us like that said amy 
hutto one of a handful of undergraduates who shaved their heads in 
protest 
enrollment in mills 33 undergraduate programs is down 42 
percent from three years ago and below the 1000 students needed to 
balance the 24 million annual budget economists at the school 
said tuition at mills is almost 12000 
mills is the only singlesex learning institution in northern 
california two womens colleges are located in southern california 
and 94 remain nationwide

the government and the african 
national congress said friday they will work together for the first 
time to stop political violence and clear the way for talks on 
ending whiteminority rule 
president fw de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela looking 
relaxed and confident after the three days of talks said the 
preliminary discussions were an important step toward giving south 
africas black majority a share of power 
it is the realization of a dream for which we have worked 
patiently and consistently mandela said after the first talks 
ever between the anc and government 
in a joint communique the sides said a working group will 
be created to try to end obstacles to full negotiations on changing 
the constitution 
in a major clause the communique said the government 
reiterates its commitment to work toward lifting the nearly 
4yearold state of emergency the lifting of the emergency is one 
of the ancs demands before constitutional negotiations can begin 
the communique indicated the delegations made progress on most 
other issues as well among them it said the government will 
consider urgently granting temporary immunity from prosecution 
to anc executive members in exile this would enable them to return 
to south africa to help end political violence 
the granting of immunity to anc exiles has been another demand 
of the african national congress 
i regard what is contained in this document as an important 
breakthrough in the peaceful process we want to take place in south 
africa de klerk said 
he said no agreement had been made on further talks but the 
working group would report by may 21 and both sides hoped for quick 
progress 
in washington the united states hailed the courageous 
decision by the sides to work toward further talks 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu in london to receive an award 
warmly welcomed the outcome of talks 
we are very thrilled with the way things seem to have 
developed the nobel laureate said smiling broadly i think 
the way things have gone has exceeded our highest hopes 
this weeks talks were an attempt to clear obstacles standing in 
the way of formal negotiations on changing the constitution to give 
the black majority a voice in national affairs 
in addition to lifting the state of emergency the anc wants the 
release of all political prisoners and the return from exile of top 
anc officials without fear of prosecution 
the state of emergency has been in effect since june 1986 and 
the anc says it is used by police to suppress political activity 
and peaceful dissent 
the government says it wants to lift the emergency but that it 
remains necessary to combat black factional fighting that has 
claimed more than 600 lives this year many in the southeastern 
province of natal 
the communique stressed the need to end that political violence 
which pits rival zulu factions against each other 
the government also has demanded the anc renounce its largely 
ineffective guerrilla war 
the anc will therefore look into the question of the armed 
struggle and take appropriate decisions mandela said 
while the two sides appear to have made progress both stressed 
that extremely difficult and long negotiations lie ahead before 
there can be any hope of a peaceful settlement 
de klerk has rejected majority rule for south africas 28 
million blacks and says there must be safeguards for the 5 million 
whites and other minorities including veto power over government 
decisions the anc insists it wants full democracy with no special 
privileges for any group 
the two leaders who shook hands and smiled in front of news 
cameras disagreed during the news conference on several issues 
including apartheid and international economic sanctions 
asked if apartheid was dead in south africa mandela replied 
i must tell you what i have told the state president and his 
delegation that 27 years ago when i went to jail i had no vote and 
27 years thereafter i still have no vote and that is due to the 
color of my skin 
de klerk released mandela in february after he had served 27 
years of a life term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the 
government 
de klerk responded that talks would be needed before blacks 
would get to vote while apartheid is going in south africa the 
antiapartheid movements are keeping it alive he said without 
further explanation 
but mandela also was quick to praise de klerk saying i have 
not the slightest doubt that the state president means what he 
says and i have no doubt whatsoever about their the governments 
integrity he said 
mandela said the anc would not ask the international community 
for more economic sanctions against south africa but he also said 
there would be no call to ease or end the sanctions 
de klerk said sanctions were not in the interests of south 
africa

the acting chief of the drug enforcement 
administration wants to shift some top deputies in a personnel 
shuffle that would include transfer for a man considered a 
competitor for the top job 
acting dea administrator terrence burke is preparing to formally 
propose the changes to the justice department dea spokesman frank 
shults said friday 
shults said the proposed changes would be normal rotations and 
would not reflect a change in policies 
the most visible change proposed by burke would shift david 
westrate from assistant administrator in charge of operations to 
assistant administrator for planning and inspection 
westrate one of the deas chief spokesmen on capitol hill was 
burkes boss until burke was named deputy administrator of the dea 
last year burke has become acting administrator since the 
retirement of former administrator john c lawn 
the bush administration has not yet nominated a permanent 
replacement for lawn but both westrate and burke are among those 
being considered for the job according to justice department 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
westrate has held the job directing deas worldwide operations 
since august 1985 and has generally spoken for the dea at 
congressional hearings 
replacing westrate as operations director would be stephen h 
greene who has been westrates deputy for about a year said 
shults greene was also burkes replacement when burke became 
deputy administrator to lawn 
peter f gruden who has been assistant administrator for 
planning and inspection for several years would become the special 
agent in charge of the washington field office shults said 
the chief of the washington field office ronald j caffrey 
would replace greene as the deputy assistant administrator for 
operations under burkes reorgnization 
our agents normally rotate to different jobs every two to 
three years shults said executives dont rotate that often 
because there arent that many jobs available for them 
shults said these latest moves dont mean anything in terms 
of change in dea policy and are not meant to be critical of 
anyones performance 
westrate did not immediately respond to a request for comment

prosecutors in the drug trial of mayor marion 
barry argued friday that they should not have to provide his 
lawyers with copies of regulations that govern drug investigations 
or all the fine details of the case against him 
in another development in the case us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson set may 25 for a pretrial hearing on a series of 
motions by the mayor seeking dismissal of the eight criminal 
charges against him 
barrys lawyers say he is the victim of prosecutorial 
overreach by a us attorneys office that violated government 
regulations in an fbi sting operation leading to the mayors arrest 
barry was arrested jan 18 after being videotaped smoking crack 
cocaine in a room of a washington hotel he is accused of five 
misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and three felony counts of 
lying to a federal grand jury about involvement with drugs 
in one of their motions the mayors lawyers said the government 
had violated its own procedures in the arrest and demanded that the 
goverment produce its regulations for undercover drug operations 
in a court filing friday in reply the government said barry should 
not be given the regulations 
even if there were a violation of an agency regulation and 
the government vigorously denies that there was it would not 
entitle barry to any relief unless his constitutional rights 
were violated said prosecutors 
disclosing the guidelines could compromise ongoing and future 
undercover operations if the confidential aspects of law 
enforcement investigative techniques were publicly disclosed 
they wrote 
barry seeks specific times of his alleged possessions of 
cocaine amounts of cocaine and descriptions of narcotics 
paraphernalia far more detail than the government is required to 
produce before trial said the prosecutors in opposing barrys 
motion for a bill of particulars of the charges against him 
barry has been informed of all tangible evidence provided 
copies of all laboratory reports provided copies of his grand jury 
testimony and given access to all of the governments evidence 
that is required by federal court rules said the government 
prosecutors noted a court case which concluded that if 
defendants were given the minutiae they seek the slightest 
discrepancy between the particulars and the evidence at trial would 
open the door to an attempt to confuse the jury 
in a 1979 case an internal revenue service agent obtained 
incriminating evidence against a defendant in a manner that 
violated irs regulations the supreme court refused to suppress the 
evidence prosecutors in the barry case noted in their filing the 
high court ruled that it could discourage the development of 
additional law enforcement safeguards to apply the existing 
regulations too rigidly

a 7yearold boy who faced amputation of his leg 
because of a congenital defect will likely regain full use of the 
limb following a complicated bone graft and legstretching process 
his surgeon said friday 
josh ellison who underwent eight hours of surgery on tuesday 
was recovering at the hospital for special surgery in manhattan 
after the second half of the twopart process was completed dr 
andrew weiland said 
hes a tough little kid hes doing great doing just fine 
said weiland surgeon chief at the hospital he should end up 
with a fairly normal functioning left leg 
without the procedure the boy unquestionably would have lost 
his leg weiland said 
hes amazing the boys mother kate ellison said from his 
hospital room its already hard to keep him down he wants to 
get out and do whatever 
the cabool mo boy was born with congenital pseudarthrosis in 
the left leg a localization of the disease which afflicted the 
elephant man the ailment caused his left tibia or shin bone to 
bend rather than grow straight 
when he was eight months old he suffered a fractured leg 
because of the illness and underwent several unsuccessful 
operations in missouri his right leg was 3 inches longer than his 
left before this most recent treatment began in february 
we were told they would have to amputate but we didnt want 
to hear it said mrs ellison we tried to find someone who 
could help josh 
they were directed to weiland an expert in microvascular bone 
grafting in this procedure a bone the surrounding tissue and its 
blood supply are transplanted to another part of the body where 
microsurgery reconnects all the blood vessels 
josh was brought to new york in february to begin the first 
phase of treatment the ilazarov procedure to lengthen the leg 
every day for two months mrs ellison turned three dials 
surgically attached to her sons leg to stretch it out 
the device lengthened his leg by one millimeter per day and 
when josh arrived for the surgery on tuesday the legs were almost 
the same length weiland said doctors took a bone from his right 
leg and implanted it where the diseased bone had been 
if everything continues to work out mrs ellison will bring 
josh back to missouri on monday he will spend the next three 
months wearing a splint to support the transplanted bone with 
weiland expecting to see the boy for a checkup this summer

reservation which straddles the uscanadian border 
a federal mediation effort was beefed up and new york gov 
mario cuomo proposed creation of a internal police force for the

some 500 mourners walking in rows sevento10 wide holding hands

barred reporters from crossing the border to the church 
a woman in the front row carried a framed picture of pyke while 
mourners at the rear of the procession sang give peace a 
chance the antiwar song by the late john lennon 
a procession of about a dozen cars followed some bearing the 
scars of the gambling violence one was missing all its windows 
except the windshield because the others had been shattered by

in honor of pyke though he worked on the on opposing side in the 
gambling dispute 
its our traditional belief that we have total respect for the 
dead said warriors supporter minnie garrow 
violence has flared occasionally on the 28000acre reservation 
since last july when the fbi and state police raided casinos on 
indian land 
mohawks who oppose gambling say the casinos breed crime 
supporters say the gambling halls are an economic boon for the 
reservation where about 9000 mohawks live 
in other developments friday warriors said the 12member band 
council which governs the canadian side of the reservation had 
been voted out of office an interim council was sworn in thursday

ordered evacuation of 500 women children and elderly because of 
the violence they accused him of trying to make the violence seem 
worse than it was 
chief mike mitchell who heads the band council could not be 
reached for comment friday on whether the interim council had 
superseded his own 
the canadian government still recognizes mitchells council 
said ron boivin a spokesman for the canadian indian affairs 
department 
gov mario cuomo under fire from some indians for sending in 
state police said in albany that he would press for creation of

expected to arrive saturday to buttress the efforts of one federal 
mediator already there said grace flores hughes director of the

congressional testimony by convicted junk bond 
dealer michael milken before he is sentenced could complicate the 
governments massive securities fraud investigation securities and 
exchange commission chairman richard c breeden said friday 
the house energy and commerce oversight and investigations 
subcommittee voted tuesday to subpoena milken who pleaded guilty 
last month to six felonies and agreed to pay 600 million 
if milken receives immunity from the panel nothing he says at a 
congressional hearing could be used against him in state or federal 
courts 
i think well try to work with congress to make sure they 
understand the status of the case as they consider what hearings 
they wish to have and when they want to have them breeden told 
reporters during an informal session in his office 
if you had immunized testimony before the plea agreement 
and the settlement becomes irrevocable on the date of sentencing 
then it does create potential for introducing complications into 
the case said breeden 
the subpoena must be approved by the full house committee before 
milken is called to testify before congress something he refused 
to do two years ago 
milken once head of the drexel burnham lambert inc department 
that dealt in highrisk highyield junk bonds faces up to 28 
years in prison when he is sentenced in new york on oct 1 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of both the committee and 
subcomittee said in a statement issued through his office 
were aware of the concerns of the sec and others and will 
work closely with them to avoid major complications however the 
subcommittee intends to continue to perform its duties and 
oversight with vigor 
on other topics breeden said it was premature at this point 
to say what impact a recent appeals court decision in new york 
overturning the insider trading conviction of exstockbroker robert 
chestman would have on sec enforcement efforts 
he said the sec was studying the decision to determine whether 
to appeal it and what implications it has for pending cases and 
settlements already reached 
were certainly not going to get into renegotiating 
settlements at a preliminary stage said breeden 
in settling civil and criminal charges with the sec and the 
justice department milken agreed to testify truthfully before 
grand juries and at trials or court proceedings stemming from any 
drexelrelated activities 
if milken fails to comply with those rules he can be prosecuted 
for perjury and obstruction of justice and jailed for contempt of 
court the agreements do not mention congressional testimony

airstrip as the dc6a plane ran low on fuel on a flight from el 
salvador

two crew members 
some speculated at the time that the flight could have been 
involved in supplying contra rebels in nicaragua no connection 
ever has been established said attorney john eversole who 
represents exwife regina reti and her daughter

israels military command denied friday that 
one of its navy boats opened fire on the yacht of jordans king 
hussein in the gulf of aqaba 
the military however admitted shots were fired while the 
monarchs craft was in the vicinity but said the shots were aimed 
in another direction and were part of a routine weapons check 
an israeli newspaper had reported an israeli patrol boat opened 
fire on husseins yacht on saturday as it sailed in international 
waters accompanied by a jordanian navy vessel with the monarch on 
deck 
the liberal daily haaretz citing sources said the incident 
occurred in the gulf of aqaba and resulted in no damage or 
injuries 
the newspaper said jordan had protested sharply to israel and 
the united states and that israeli officials refused to apologize 
but assured jordan it would not happen again 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
expressed anger when informed about the incident the newspaper 
said 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the us ambassador to israel william brown had expressed deep 
concern to the israeli government over the matter brown was told 
the israelis have taken steps to avoid such another such incident 
the spokesman said 
palace officials in jordan declined to comment and spokesman 
for prime minister yitzhak shamir and the defense ministry could 
not be reached for comment 
the newspaper account said after the first shots were fired the 
king took over command of the yacht ordering the vessel to turn 
and head for saudi arabian waters 
the israeli vessel accelerated and continued to fire as it 
tailgated the kings yacht the report continued halting and 
holding fire only when it reached saudi waters 
the king has a residence in the red sea port town of aqaba 
which abuts the israeli resort town of eilat and is near the saudi 
border 
the newspaper said neither the kings bodyguards nor the 
jordanian navy vessel accompanying the yacht returned fire the 
sources quoted by haaretz also said the israeli fire came from 
weapons mounted on the deck not just shots from a pistol 
the israeli military commands account differed sharply from the 
newspapers version of events 
the military comment said in a statement friday that no shots 
were fired by the israeli navy at king husseins yacht and no chase 
was conducted 
but it said its naval vessel did fire some shots toward empty 
waters in what it described as a check of its guns it also said 
the israeli craft was in israeli waters 
israel naval units have long standing and clear orders 
regarding rules of conduct during the passage of king husseins 
yacht and in the incident noted the israel naval vessel acted 
in accordance with these instructions the statement said 
a military spokesman who could not be named in accordance with 
regulations said husseins yacht was to the east of the israeli 
boat the military statement said the israeli shots were fired 
south 
i speculate that they the jordanians probably thought the 
gunfire was directed at them the spokesman said 
the spokesman said husseins yacht was easily recognizable and 
that sailors almost certainly knew it was the monarchs 
israel television reported the naval vessel apparently 
approached the yacht and that the jordanians probably interpreted 
this as a chase

dissension broke out in east germanys first 
democratic government on friday over the costs of unification with 
west germany 
the fragile coalition government of prime minister lothar de 
maiziere appeared threatened as the leftleaning social democrats 
attacked what they said was the governments willingness to agree 
to west germanys terms for unity 
experts from both countries met in east berlin on friday for 
ongoing talks on shifting east germany away from a socialist 
economy as quickly as possible 
although the social democrats agreed to join the government of 
de maiziere who leads the conservative christian democrats they 
complained friday that the terms of the economic union would create 
hardships for east germans 
the social democrats hold important cabinet posts in de 
maizieres government but have begun distancing themselves from the 
agreements between the germanys on merging their economies 
in the east berlin cabinet stands a crack in the house 
because we up to now cannot be held responsible for the outcome of 
the unification state treaty said richard schroeder head of 
the social democrat faction in parliament 
i am worried about a break in the axle on the way to unity 
he said 
social minister regine hildebrandt a social democrat 
criticized the decision between the governments to tailor east 
germanys pension program to west germanys she said it would 
reduce benefits for east germans 
the economies and social institutions of the two nations are to 
merge on july 2 as a prelude to full unification next year 
but social democrats have become increasingly critical of what 
they say is a willingness to accept bonns terms and the lack of 
guarantees to protect east germans who will give up enormous social 
subsidies 
de maiziere whose party finished first in the march 18 
elections formed a coalition with the social democrats to have the 
twothird parliament majority needed to make constitutional changes 
that would make unification possible 
west germany says a quick move to a free market will create jobs 
and raise living standards and eventually eliminate the economic 
hardships that are expected in the early stages of unification 
the dissent in east germany came as the superpowers france 
britain and the two germany states prepared for talks in bonn on 
saturday on the role of a united germany in the military alliances 
although the christian democrats who finished first in the 
march 18 national elections and the social democrats who finished 
second are part of the same government many of their candidates 
are facing each other in sundays local elections 
the two governments agreed on the general terms of an economic 
union on wednesday it would exchange salaries wages and small 
savings accounts of east germans for an equal amount of west german 
marks 
social democrats are critical of a provision to keep the debts 
of east german factories many of which are expected to fail they 
are demanding that the debts be forgiven 
mrs hildebrandt also criticized the pension plan agreement that 
she said would reduce benefits to a third of the 29 million 
elderly and handicapped participants 
wolfgang tierse deputy chief of the social democrats faction 
said his party would not endorse the economic and social treaty 
that is being negotiated as a basis for unification he said it 
would bring massive poverty

freed american hostage frank 
reed returned to his homeland friday with a prayer that my mates 
left behind will quickly share his freedom and joy god he 
implored make it soon 
drawn and unsteady despite several days rest at a us military 
hospital in wiesbaden west germany reed was embraced by his 
family and another former hostage robert polhill who was released 
by separate captors in lebanon just eight days before reed was let 
go monday 
reed freed after 42 months whispered in polhills ear were 
going to get the rest of them out arent we 
in a brief formal statement that left his greeters shedding 
tears as a gentle rain fell reed said fellow americans because 
of all of you im alive 
and in a special tribute to all hostage relatives several of 
whom were on hand in a customary show of unity he declared 
because of peggy say kit and joan sutherland the keenan 
sisters pat mccarthy and many many others i am unchained and 
unblindfolded 
moments after he boarded a bus which was to take himself and his 
family to the malcolm grow medical center at the base the caravan 
was diverted down the tarmac where to reeds delight he was 
greeted by barbara bush as she was about to board a flight to 
kentucky 
were so glad youre home mrs bush said i know the 
president wishes he was here to meet you bush was in oklahoma 
giving a speech on nato and the future of europe 
the release of reed and polhill left six americans and nine 
other westerners still held in lebanon 
of those reed 57 has said he shared moments in captivity with 
terry anderson the associated press chief middle east 
correspondent who was kidnapped in march of 1985 and is the longest 
held hostage as well as thomas sutherland an american university 
of beirut official and britons brian keenan and john mccarthy 
ms say andersons sister and sen edward m kennedy of 
massachusetts where reeds family resides in malden were among

plane for a private reunion moments earlier 
reed told the airport gathering because tom terry john and 
brian refused to give up i am with you today 
reed was accompanied on the flight from germany by his wife 
fahima known as fifi and their young son tarek who played on the

england never forget brian or john for gods sake they are you 
and you are they you cant let them down 
reed while still in west germany had said britain should be 
doing more to free its own citizens in lebanon 
he offered no such criticism of his own government reed likely 
will visit president bush within days as has polhill already

a 34 million libel judgment against the 
philadelphia inquirer raises serious constitutional questions and 
will likely be overturned on appeal a media lawyer and a 
reporters group said friday 
a common pleas court jury on thursday awarded 25 million in 
compensatory damages and 315 million in punitive damages to 
former first assistant district attorney richard sprague he sued 
the paper over stories published 17 years ago that questioned his 
actions as a prosecutor 
its unimaginable to me that a punitive damage award in this 
amount could or would be upheld said floyd abrams a prominent 
first amendment lawyer he represents nbc in appealing a 53 
million libel judgment won by entertainer wayne newton 
this is another example of libel law running amok abrams 
said i think that this case and others will sooner rather than 
later lead the supreme court to address the constitutionality of 
punitive damages in libel cases 
henry kaufman general counsel of the libel defense resource 
center a mediasponsored clearinghouse in new york said the 
judgment was the largest ever against the news media he said only 
two libel judgments of more than 1 million have been affirmed on 
appeal 
sprague now a successful attorney in private practice won for 
the second time before a jury in the case the inquirer had earlier 
successfully appealed a 45 million verdict less than 
oneseventh the amount of thursdays award which sprague said gave 
meaning to the idea of punitive damages 
i intend to fight to maintain it sprague said friday the 
whole theory of punitive damages is that it should not just be a 
little slap on the wrist its got to be meaningful 
a tendency for juries to grant everhigher punitive damages has 
come under scrutiny in other areas recently 
last month the supreme court agreed to decide in an alabama 
insurance fraud case whether punitive damage awards can be so great 
as to become unconstitutional 
the court last year ruled large awards in civil suits do not 
violate the constitutions ban on excessive fines but the court 
did not address the question of whether such awards violate due 
process protections 
punitive damages in general are dangerous abrams said in 
libel cases they are perilous juries are given no standards no 
limits no bounds and sometimes they act that way 
in the philadelphia case jurors were given only the newspapers 
net worth 102 million in determining how to set the punitive 
damages the newspaper was not allowed to cite spragues income 
which forbes magazine estimated at 16 million in 1988 
common pleas court judge charles p mirarchi jr said the jury 
had to find outrageous conduct and that it could set an award to 
punish the inquirer and to send a message to the rest of the news 
media 
my basic opinion is that the law is fair and the jury must 
make that determination not the judge mirarchi said 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press sees a first amendment issue in such awards 
all a punitive damage award is when its awarded against a 
news organization is a fine for speaking she said but beyond 
that it doesnt have to bear any relationship to anything 
reed irvine chairman of accuracy in media a conservative 
watchdog group believes punitive damages do have a place in libel 
cases but he also sees problems with the judgment against the 
inquirer 
the amounts involved here are almost ruinous in a sense 
irvine said i think thats going too far myself its legitimate 
to give em a good hard rap across the knuckles but its another 
to take it out of their hide 
the groups director of media analysis former philadelphia 
inquirer staffer joseph goulden said such awards are saying what 
the publics saying about the press the only way to enforce a code 
of ethics is in the courtroom 
abrams said he was worried about the impact on news gathering 
punitive damages have the potential for so chilling speech that 
the public would lose a significant amount of the most important 
news that reporters present

secretary of state james a baker iii ran into a 
stone wall friday when he tried to persuade the soviet union to 
withdraw its objections to nato membership for a united germany 
i cant say we heard anything different than we heard 
before a senior us official said after baker met for 3 hours 
with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in bakers hotel room 
overlooking the rhine river 
the official who briefed reporters under rules guaranteeing him 
anonymity said the two sides also made no dent in issues blocking 
treaties to reduce their longrange nuclear missiles and to lower 
troop and tank levels in europe 
baker and shevardnadze will meet in moscow may 1619 to try to 
close the gap on weapons cutbacks but with the washington summit 
less than a month away prospects appear to be diminishing for 
presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev initialing a landmark arms 
control accord 
fridays meeting produced one tentative agreement a joint 
effort to assist the hungry in ethiopia 
the official said the idea is to fly american food to ethiopia 
aboard soviet planes 
but on germany and on arms control the results were slim 
baker also brought up the issue of lithuania where an 
independence movement is being stifled by a kremlin economic 
blockade 
its fine to talk about a need for dialogue but one actually 
has to take steps to get to a dialogue the senior official said 
of soviet inability to reach a formula for talks with lithuanian 
leaders 
baker and shevardnadze were in bonn for the twoplusfour 
german unification talks that open saturday the foreign ministers 
from britain france and the two german states also will take part 
baker meanwhile released a text of a statement he made to 
foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization at a 
closed session in brussels 
in it baker said the reform process in the soviet union will 
be called into question if selfdetermination in lithuania is 
denied 
he said the bush administration did not wish to take any action 
that could escalate the situation 
but he hinted us patience is running out and that critics of 
the administrations soft approach could win out 
we understand the pressures affecting the soviet leadership 
baker said they too must understand that we have our own 
principles and are subject to our own political pressure 
at the start of fridays talks shevardnadze told reporters 
we consider a unified germany as an important factor of stability 
and peace in europe 
but he added for such a giant to belong to one bloc one 
alliance will not create conditions of stability 
shevardnadze seemed to want us troops to remain in germany 
however and offered no alternative to nato membership the senior 
official said i think the soviets are still wrestling with the 
problem he added 
shevardnadze called his talks with baker on arms control issues 
a very constructive and useful conversation but he said they 
had not settled any of their differences over restricting 
longrange nuclear missiles 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany held separate talks with 
shevardnadze and baker on friday kohl spokesman hans klein said 
kohl offered shevardnadze a significant expansion of bilateral 
ties particularly economic cooperation 
west german foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said 
thursdays us decision to scrap deployment of new shortrange 
nuclear weapons will be of enormous importance because the 
question of disarmament is very much linked with the develoment in 
europe and also the germangerman question 
he said nato and the warsaw pact were increasingly becoming 
political organizations rather than military alliances 
baker has said germanys membership in nato is not a decision 
for the soviets to make that it is up to the 16 western allies 
but he hopes to persuade shevardnadze the powerful nation to 
emerge from the union of west germany and east germany will not 
menace neighbors that lost millions of people at the hands of the 
nazis in world war ii 
baker also hopes to overcome the slump in negotiations in vienna 
to conclude a treaty to reduce troops tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear arms in europe 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former west german 
defense minister said thursday in brussels the allies agreed a 
united germany would have no nuclear or chemical weapons in its 
military arsenal he also suggested soviet troops might be 
stationed temporarily in what is now east germany 
shevardnadze suggested last week that a united germany should 
belong to nato and the warsaw pact 
vitaly churkin a soviet foreign ministry spokesman told 
reporters friday its very hard to see how germany loses in that 
kind of situation 
the us announcement that it will not deploy any new 
shortrange nuclear missiles in west germany set a positive tone 
for the talks in bonn 
america also will not modernize nuclear artillery shells stored 
in europe and baker offered to negotiate a reduction in the 88 
lance launchers that target east germany with 700 nuclear missiles 
and 900 conventional rockets 
shevardnadze called the us move a good decision

a federal judge friday ordered prosecutors to come 
up with a list of 20 million in assets seized from manuel noriega 
saying some of the money must have come from the deposed panamanian 
rulers legitimate activities 
during an hourlong hearing prompted by defense attorneys 
request to withdraw from the case lead defense lawyer frank rubino 
claimed that us intelligence agencies paid 11 million to 
noriega with another 6 million coming from foreign governments 
i dont know if you can call money from the cia tainted or 
not but its certainly not drug money said rubino 
us district judge william m hoeveler said while noriega 
clearly could not use illgotten gains to pay his attorneys 
the government could not arbitrarily seize money without proving he 
had earned it through drug trafficking or other illegal means 
defense attorneys have demanded the frozen accounts be released 
saying they can no longer afford to represent noriega in the 
complex and expensive case without being paid 
but the government insists rubino may have been paid 1 million 
or more and says it is under no obligation to turn over 
drugtainted funds to the jailed suspect 
the judge observed that noriega had been a military officer for 
more than 20 years and said he must have acquired some money 
legitimately 
it is all the more important of course because of who is 
being prosecuted the judge said and we have got to recognize 
that our justice system is on display 
hoeveler tentatively set a hearing for friday for the government 
and the defense to discuss the confiscated assets 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan said the government did 
not object to such a list but he said all the accounts except 
one were in foreign banks 
foreign governments will have some interest in the money and 
their laws will prevail over those assets sullivan said 
defense attorneys for two weeks tried unsuccessfully to 
negotiate with the us attorneys office to release money before 
deciding monday to file a motion to withdraw from the case 
rubino said the government already has spent 12 million and was 
prepared to spend 25 million more prosecuting his client the 
attorney said the defense has the right to use noriegas funds to 
hire more attorneys investigators and secretaries 
but sullivan responded with an affidavit from another prosecutor 
who said rubino told her he had received a retainer of seven 
figures from noriega rubino has acknowledged the comment but 
said it was a joke 
along with the motion to withdraw the defense has asked the 
judge to order the funds released because the government has failed 
to show as required by law that the money was illegally earned 
we believe that at least 17 million frozen was derived from 
legitimate sources said a defense motion filed thursday we 
will disclose the source of 11 million as directed by this court 
the remaining 6 million is covered by federal classified 
information restrictions limiting public disclosure the motion 
said 
rubino noted at the hearing that 58 million confiscated by 
us troops in noriegas quarters in panama had been handed back to 
the panamanian government by the united states without informing 
the defense he said the government had never established whether 
that money had been acquired illegally 
in pleading the defense case rubino said attorneys learned 
the intelligence community is in possession of evidence that 
completely exonerates general noriega as to a particular count of 
the indictment but said the defense lacks the money to pursue 
the lead 
the prosecution says the money at issue is held in 27 bank 
accounts apparently including some in the bank of credit and 
commerce international which was at the center of a 
moneylaundering conspiracy recently tried in tampa 
only one of these accounts located in panama is in the 
defendants name the government motion said adding

a slight wobble detected in the hubble space 
telescope has disappeared engineers said friday 
we are not seeing anything of that right now said mike 
harrington who is directing the monthslong checkout of the 
telescope we are not sure exactly what we saw or what it was 
harrington had good news to report ground controllers received 
their first data from the telescopes science computer after 
sending commands 
when the telescope is up and running it will be that computer 
that sends the sophisticated science data 
the slight jitter showed up thursday a motion of just 1600th 
of a degree too much in an instrument thats supposed to be able 
to measure the width of a human hair at a range of five miles 
asked what caused it harrington said nobody really knows it 
could be as simple as the fact that we werent calibrated quite 
right as we started and that we overexcited the controls 
harrington an engineer at nasas marshall space flight center 
in alabama said the telescopes pointing control system would be 
turned on sunday morning and the jitter if its still there will 
show up then 
the series of problems experienced by the telescope since 
astronauts left it in space april 25 have put the checkout at least 
a week behind schedule harrington said 
its perfectly expectable he said this probably is the 
most complex spacecraft weve ever flown you know you are going to 
have these kinds of things unexpected and unpredicted little 
quirks of the spacecraft youve got to take your time to figure 
them out and move on 
the telescopes electronics have gone into a protective mode 
three times because of small glitches the telescopes lens cover 
twice introduced too much motion and a primary antenna brushed up 
against a cable and could move no further 
the first picture had been expected from the telescope by 
midweek but its now expected no earlier than tuesday

firefighters backed up against the last natural 
barrier between a 4mile wall of flames and a wildlife preserve 
said friday they had controlled the fire which has blackened 
25000 acres of the droughtcrisp everglades 
fire had raced across the dry grasslands and leaped a canal but 
was beaten back before reaching a levee the last natural barrier 
between the flames and the sprawling big cypress national wildlife 
preserve officials said 
shortly after 5 pm edt the fire was reported under control 
said peter karayeanes duty officer for the state division of 
forestry the area would be monitored in case of flareups he said 
a heavy downpour around noon friday missed the center of the 
fire but helped firefighters trying to control the last area of 
violent burning 
with that rain it slowed it down a little bit brought the 
humidity up so right now we have a whole lot of helicopters out 
here said john kern of the state division of forestry were 
going to try to put it out with water 
although arson has not been ruled out investigators believe the 
fire was sparked accidentally in an area frequented by people on 
motorcycles and allterrain vehicles said senior state forester 
gene dempsey 
despite the size of the scorched area about 25 miles west of 
downtown miami wildlife officials say the fire has had little 
effect on animals because the severe drought had already forced 
most of them to water 
we have a few snakes and rodents scurrying away but thats 
about it dempsey said 
david maehr a biologist with the state game and fresh water 
fish commission said 17 panthers wearing the agencys 
radiotracking collars were checked during a routine helicopter 
flight friday and were nowhere near any danger from fire 
that is panther habitat he said but the thing about the 
everglades themselves is its not as regularly used as more 
forested landscapes so we dont have the number of cats using the 
everglades nor do we have the regularity of use 
only about 30 to 50 panthers are believed to live in the wilds 
of south florida 
no injuries have been reported from the fire and no inhabited 
areas were threatened by the blaze one of three west of miami 
another fire in everglades national park about 25 miles 
southwest of the city scorched 10500 acres by friday but 
firefighters were confident they could control it by saturday said 
park spokeswoman darlene koontz 
seminole indian firefighters spent thursday battling a smaller 
blaze on their reservation in broward county near the collier 
county line the fire was contained after burning 800 acres 
fires are a part of the everglades ecology said park 
spokeswoman pat tolle but this years blazes worry 
environmentalists because the regions 20month drought has left 
some normally damp grasslands so dry that they are threatened

irans foreign minister said friday 
that his country will not work to free more western hostages in 
lebanon until israel releases hundreds of imprisoned lebanese 
meanwhile the iranianbacked hezbollah on friday said it held 
the us government responsible for hindering the release of the 
remaining western hostages hezbollah or party of god is believed 
to be an umbrella group for the hostageholding factions 
the us administration bears the responsibility for any 
complications in this issue said a statement issued in beirut 
friday by hezbollahs press office it said the ball is now in 
americas court 
the iranian foreign minister ending a twoday official visit to 
finland said israel must free several hundred lebanese 
hostages before any steps are taken to free any of the 16 
remaining hostages 
the minister ali akbar velayati demanded that the united 
states and britain put pressure on the israelis and make goodwill 
gestures to reciprocate for the recent release of two american 
hostages 
frank reed was released monday after 42 months in captivity and 
arrived in the united states on friday robert polhill was released 
april 22 after being held 39 months 
the other side has to take practical steps to influence 
israel and the phalangists velayati said referring to a 
christian lebanese group once allied with israel 
especially the united states and britain can persuade israel 
to release these abducted people the iranian official said at a 
news conference 
velayati said the hostages are not in the hands of the 
iranians and that iran had to persuade the lebanese groups to 
release polhill and reed 
of course we played a key role but we worked over months 
he added 
velayati said no deals had been done for the release of the 
two americans and said that iran had not been involved in any talks 
with the united states 
among the remaining hostages in lebanon are six americans the 
longest held is associated press correspondent terry anderson 
abducted march 16 1985 
the hezbollah statement also urged the bush administration to 
help bring about the release of lebanese and palestinian prisoners 
in israeli jails as well as tracing three iranian officials and 
their driver who disappeared in lebanons christian heartland in 
1982 the four are widely believed killed 
hussein musawi who heads a prosyrian wing in hezbollah was 
quoted earlier friday by the leftist beirut newspaper assafir as 
saying we expect sharp complications in resolving the hostage 
question in the future 
assafir quoted musawi interviewed at his headquarters in the 
bekaa valley city of baalbek as saying that the united states had 
not responded appropriately to the release of reed and polhill

afghan soldiers battled islamic 
guerrillas around the eastern city of jalalabad on friday hours 
after the government ended its 15month state of emergency in the 
country staterun radio reported 
kabul radio monitored in islamabad said a number of 
political opponents were killed in the fighting and large amounts 
of weapons and ammunition destroyed it said nothing of government 
casualties 
the radio said forces loyal to president najibullah recaptured 
key outposts around the city in an offensive that began tuesday 
fighting has flared and faded since the guerrillas attempted a 
conventional assault on jalalabad in march 1989 three weeks after 
the soviet union withdrew its troops from afghanistan 
the radio also said government forces pushed back guerrillas 
surrounding the southern cities of kandahar and khost with heavy 
fighting and aerial bombardment under way 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
said up to 165 soldiers at khost were killed or wounded when 
government planes bombed the garrison wednesday in the fear the 
soldiers planned to defect 
the reports could not be independently verified 
emergency rule was lifted at midnight thursday najibullah who 
uses only one name had promised it would end by may 20 
the emergency was imposed just after soviet troops ended nine 
years of direct involvement and pulled out of afghanistan in 
february 1989 the decree gave najibullah power to override 
parliament and placed afghanistans defense under the control of a 
supreme military council 
lifting the emergency cleared the way for constitutional reforms 
aimed at ending the 12yearold war which has killed more than 1 
million people destroyed much of the country and ruined its 
economy 
the president named a 15member committee to call a loya jirga 
or grand assembly to adopt constitutional reforms it will consist 
of an estimated 8000 people representing different regions and 
tribal groups in afghanistan 
najibullah reportedly wants guerrillas among the committee 
members the former terrorists and bandits now are called 
opposition members 
the seven pakistanbased guerrilla groups bankrolled by the 
united states and by saudi arabia and other sympathetic arab 
states tacitly offered to let najibullah test his popularity in 
unrun elections provided he hands over power to a transitional 
government 
najibullah rejects this and appointment of the council was seen 
as his response to the guerrillas 
the mujahedeen control 80 percent of the countryside the 
marxiststyle government controls the cities

the president of mongolia where fastmoving 
political reforms stand in contrast to the hard line in beijing 
arrived friday for a visit aimed at forging a new relationship 
ties between china and sovietallied mongolia have been strained 
the past three decades and president punsalmaagiin ochirbat is the 
first mongolian head of government to visit china since 1962 
ochirbat here at the invitation of chinese president yang 
shangkun is seeking greater economic exchanges and access to a 
chinese port for landlocked mongolia 
mongolias ruling communist party has given up its monopoly on 
power and has promised free elections this summer a number of 
opposition parties have sprung up since the reform movement 
inspired by similar campaigns in the soviet union and east europe 
began last december 
however the reforms have sparked unrest including a wave of 
protests reported in mongolia as orchirbat began his visit 
china reportedly has stepped up surveillance of its 35 million 
mongol minority out of concern the democratic impulses of mongolia 
could spill across the border chinese premier li peng indicated 
friday that beijing expects mongolia to do what it can to keep that 
from happening 
li said the two countries should have noninterference in each 
others internal and party affairs 
in mongolia sitins demanding replacement of the 
communistdominated legislature were being staged in a halfdozen 
mongolian cities and a hunger strike continued in the northern city 
of moron a foreign source in the capital of ulan bator said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said five of the 
17 hunger strikers some of whom stopped eating last saturday had 
been hospitalized 
the source also said talks between the government and opposition 
groups seeking a faster pace of democratic reform had stalled 
opposition activists on thursday said no new talks were scheduled 
with the government 
the official chinese news agency xinhua reported that 
mongolian prime minister sharavyn gunjaadorg had accused opposition 
groups of causing political panic with their unbridled 
activities it said the comments came in a televised speech 
thursday night 
the government has accused the opposition of refusing an offer 
to hold a national referendum on disbanding the legislature and 
replacing it with a provisional multiparty body that would govern 
until elections the source said 
about 25 to 30 people were taking part in the sitin in the main 
square of ulan bator the demonstration which began may 2 
attracted 300 to 400 people thursday night there were few police 
in view 
opposition leaders were criticizing ochirbat for traveling to 
china when the country was facing a political crisis the source 
said 
at a banquet friday night hosted by yang ochirbat called his 
visit an important step in furthering political economic cultural 
and scientific cooperation 
other details of the talks were not available but it was likely 
they discussed the easing of tensions along the sinomongolian 
border as well as trade and other bilateral issues 
china has long objected to the heavy concentration of soviet 
troops in mongolia many stationed along the desert and grassland 
frontier that divides mongolia and china however the soviet union 
last year began withdrawing its troops and says the last of 60000 
soviet soldiers will leave mongolia by 1992 
mongolia which has a population of only 2 million in a nation 
nearly as big as all of west europe became the worlds second 
communist state in 1921 
china which in the past laid claims to all of mongolia did not 
recognize the sovietallied state until the chinese communists came 
to power in 1949 
relations were good during the 1950s but from 1960 onward 
mongolia joined the soviet union in splitting with china over 
ideological differences ties began to slowly improve as 
sinosoviet tensions eased from the mid1980s

president bush said friday that nuclear 
weapons must continue to play a key role in safeguarding europe 
from war declaring there are few lessons so clear in history as 
this 
while offering an advanced timetable for negotiating with moscow 
on reducing shortrange nuclear arms bush declared the united 
states is not going to allow europe to become safe for 
conventional war 
bush discussing the changing face of europe during a 
commencement speech at oklahoma state university hailed the sweep 
of democracy through warsaw pact nations 
however he cautioned our enemy today is uncertainty and 
instability 
bush said it will be crucial to see whether moscow 
chooses coercion or peaceful dialogue in responding to the 
aspirations of the lithuanian people and nationalities within the 
soviet union 
bushs remarks were intended to offer the outlines of a new 
military and political mission for nato as europe is transformed by 
the reunification of germany and the collapse of communist 
governments 
leaders of the 16 nato nations will meet in london in late june 
or early july to chart a revised strategy for the 41yearold 
alliance 
bush said the allies should accelerate work to determine the 
minimum number and types of weapons that will be needed to deter 
war credibly and effectively 
he said moscow and washington should open negotiations to reduce 
shortrange nuclear missiles in europe once a treaty is signed 
perhaps later this year to curb troops and conventional arms 
originally bush had insisted that a conventional arms treaty 
not only be signed but also implemented before talks could begin on 
shortrange nuclear forces 
however bush said that as the soviet union pulls back troops 
from warsaw pact nations there is less need for nuclear systems 
of the shortest range 
acting on bushs suggestion nato scrapped plans thursday to 
deploy more powerful shortrange lance nuclear missiles and 
artillery shells in europe even so the united states and soviet 
union will still maintain sizeable shortrange nuclear arsenals in 
europe 
were prepared to negotiate the reduction of these forces as 
well the president 
yet bush said he did not want to leave europe vulnerable to 
conventional warfare 
there are few lessons so clear in history as this only the 
combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces have ensured 
this long peace in europe bush said 
a senior administration official briefing reporters on air 
force one under condition of anonymity said we think there 
needs to be some nuclear weapons in europe deterrence has to have 
a nuclear component 
in his speech bush said the united states should remain a 
european power in the broadest sense politically militarily and 
economically and that militarily significant us forces 
would be stationed in europe 
as the military threat in europe fades bush said natos 
political role will become more prominent 
he said nato leaders at their summer summit should look for 
ways to help our german friends sustain freedom and achieve unity 
something which we and our allies have supported for over 40 years 
and we should reaffirm the importance of keeping a united 
germany a full member of nato 
bush said nato also must develop a new strategy for its 
conventional forces which include tanks troops and nonnuclear 
artillery 
if the soviet withdrawal continues and our arms control 
efforts are successful we must plan for a different kind of 
military presence focused less on the danger of an immediate 
outbreak of war the president said 
another objective for the summit bush said is to determine how 
the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
could help spread democracy and facilitate the transition from 
governmentcontrol economies to free markets 
the oklahoma students listening to bush outdoors at a football 
stadium gave him a warm welcome but sat silently throughout most 
of his address which was laced with armscontrol jargon and 
acronyms 
from stillwater bush flew to tulsa to address the oklahoma 
foundation for excellence as it honored 100 outstanding high school 
seniors and four teachers he also attended a state gop fundraising 
reception 
lets be honest our educational system isnt making the 
grade bush said urging programs such as magnet schools and 
incentives for students to excel in science math and engineering 
after a latenight flight home bush was spending the weekend at 
camp david

10company competition to supply a radarbased command system for 
tactical aircraft 
norden was not among the three finalists but was added at 
stones insistence according to the statement 
the government said stone passed information about bid proposals 
to mark e saunders a private consultant who in turn passed it to 
another consultant thomas e muldoon muldoon and saunders also 
were charged with conspiracy in the case 
at one time or another muldoon passed information to three 
companies unisys litton corp and norden the government said 
at first he worked for litton but when litton found out its 
proposal trailed the others it released muldoon and he signed on 
with norden muldoon never had a contract with unisys the 
government said 
muldoon has been convicted of bribing an official in another 
case and sentenced to 27 months in prison he is appealing that 
conviction last month us district judge arthur bryan dismissed

ethanol used in nuclear waste storage tanks 
at the hanford nuclear reservation could ignite the us 
department of energy said friday it was the third report of an 
explosive hazard there in nine months 
but federal officials state regulators and hanford critics all 
played down the ethanol problem friday saying it was easy to fix 
the air of calm was in contrast to earlier revelations about 
explosive threats from ferrocyanide and a hydrogen gas buildup 
this will be resolved in the next few days said ken morgan 
of the does richland operations office in a telephone interview 
jim thomas of the spokanebased hanford education action league 
said the ethanol danger is not as serious as the potential danger 
from the hydrogen gas buildup but was another example of inept 
management by the energy department 
they were introducing a potentially energetic chemical in 
tanks that have very dangerous wastes in them thomas said 
this has gone on for years 
the latest concern centers on the tubes that run the length of 
hanfords giant nuclear waste storage tanks 
the tubes contain probes that use sound waves to take readings 
of the contents of the tanks the tubes are filled with liquid to 
better conduct the sound morgan said usually the liquid is water 
but during cold months an antifreeze ethanol is added he said 
there were six tubes recently tested and in one case the ethanol 
fumes were gathering at the top of the tube in a potentially 
explosive quantity morgan said 
the suspect tube will either be diluted with water or pumped 
out morgan said 
the tubes are about three inches in diameter and 45 feet long 
and sealed at the bottom so nothing inside them actually makes 
contact with the waste morgan said 
ethanol has been used for years in the monitoring tubes of many 
tanks said mike berriochoa of westinghouse hanford co the 
government contractor that operates the hanford tank farms 
berriochoa said he was not sure how many tubes westinghouse would 
need to remove ethanol from 
the exploding tanks controversy began last october when the 
staff of sen john glenn dohio released a 1984 report that 
concluded some storage tanks at hanford contained ferrocyanide that 
could explode 
a flurry of analyses has since concluded that the risk from 
ferrocyanide is quite low 
but in studying that issue doe scientists uncovered a new 
threat from hydrogen gas that was building up underneath the hard 
crust inside about 20 waste storage tanks at hanford 
the energy department announced that hazard in late march and 
said they could not guarantee an explosion would not occur that 
produced a whole new round of tank studies which so far have 
concluded that the explosion risk is low but the energy department 
also admits it does not yet have enough data for a solution 
morgan acknowledged that extensive criticism focusing on the 
energy department in the recent controversies prompted officials to 
call reporters with the latest news 
were a little touchy he said 
hanford has 177 nuclear waste storage tanks which contain the 
highly radioactive byproducts of more than 40 years of plutonium

began talks friday with contra rebels who are refusing to disband 
as promised and pledged that the military role in nicaraguas new 
government will diminish little by little and as soon as 
possible 
the contras who fought a usbacked war against the previous 
leftist sandinista government had said they would disband by june

mrs chamorro made her remarks as she began closed talks with 
the rebels their demands include a reduction of the sandinista 
army by far the largest in central america 
members of mrs chamorros cabinet and cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo of nicaragua are also attending the talks 
contra leader israel galeano said the fact that the contras are 
meeting with mrs chamorro shows a willingness to work to rebuild 
a society that is destroyed 
many contras are angry over mrs chamorros decision to keep 
gen humberto ortega as head of the army although she said the 
post would be temporary 
ortega brother of former president daniel ortega had been 
defense minister under the sandinistas 
when mrs chamorro took office april 15 she charged gen ortega 
with coming up with a program for reducing the armed forces she

what we want is to rebuild our country in peace in 
reconciliation and also to demilitarize our country the 
president said friday 
mrs chamorro did not say if the army would be reduced at the 
same time the contras were disbanded 
former president ortega earlier promised that the sandinistas 
will not at any time promote a policy of revenge with disarmed 
and disbanded contra forces 
before turning over power the sandinistas distributed thousands 
of weapons to their supporters who have vowed publicly not to give 
them back 
aristides sanchez a contra spokesman implied thursday that the 
rebels will not hand in their weapons to un representatives by 
june 10 as they had pledged to do in an april 19 agreement 
one doesnt have to be so airtight about it sanchez replied 
when asked if the rebels planned to meet the deadline 
roberto ferrey a spokesman for mrs chamorros government and 
himself a former contra said the government would not yield to the 
rebel demand 
june 10 is the deadline its not possible to change it he 
said 
about 30000 people died in the struggle between the 
americanbacked contras and the leftist sandinista regime

caryl churchill doesnt make things easy for an 
audience 
the proof is currently on stage at the new york shakespeare 
festival public theater where a double bill of two short works by 
the english playwright is puzzling theatergoers 
the title ice cream with hot fudge is deceptively sweet 
the two plays are not 
hot fudge the shorter and more arcane of the plays begins 
with a chorus of lowerclass brits plotting an intricate 
checkcashing scam their greed is similiar to the moneygrubbing 
celebrated by the stockbrokers churchill skewered in serious 
money her last new york outing 
much of the dialogue in hot fudge is overlapping making it 
impossible to understand clearly you get the idea if not the 
actual words the avarice goes upscale in the next scene or two 
when ruby margaret whitton pairs off with colin john pankow and 
meets his wealthy friends 
people talk about their careers in global industry or their 
selfdevelopment vacations or their homes as investments 
but theres a nastiness underneath the chic cocktail chatter that 
doesnt become apparent until ruby is confronted by colins exwife 
julianne moore the confrontation and the play end in 
violence and the bleak realization that nothing is as it seems 
ice cream composed of 20 short scenes is the more 
substantial dangerous dessert the black often bewildering 
comedy illustrates churchills disenchantment with romantic notions 
of both england and the united states 
two innocent american tourists lance and vera find delight in 
everything british from the way the natives say ice cream to 
all those ancient buildings to even discovering distant cousins of 
lances 
but these relatives are not mr micawber and mary poppins they 
are vindictive uncouth slightly menacing people who end up 
murdering their landlord and they draw their american cousins into 
the crime 
when the english brother and sister visit america they are 
similiarly misinformed about the habits of the foreign land but 
churchills scalpel is not nearly as sharp in her dissection of 
american life and culture her portrait of two rural bumpkins for 
example seems straight out of the beverely hillbillies only 
not as funny 
the violence the british couple committed in england follows 
them to america and it dogs the american husband and wife too 
its a chilly link between the two nations 
the play ends weirdly unexpectedly in fact many in the 
audience at a recent performance didnt know it was over until the 
actors came out to take their bows 
the cast is competent rather than inspired except for john 
pankow who plays the disturbed colin in hot fudge and a 
variety of very different small roles in ice cream with 
distinction 
director les waters certainly keeps the plays moving quickly 
helped by the minimal settings of stark sliding walls churchills 
plays are just as stark keeping the audience offbalance but that 
may be her main goal 
ice cream with hot fudge is more unnerving than entertaining

satisfied that some kind of justice has been done 
horton and hyden were allowed to remain free on appeal bonds of 
25000 because their sentences were less than 15 years ladner was 
taken into custody 
prosecutor jack skeen had urged jurors to go to the limit in 
choosing among sentencing alternatives ranging from five to 99 
years or life in prison and fines up to 10000 the defendants 
will be eligible for parole because they had no prior convictions 
the three were acquitted in 1988 of civil rights violation

houston woman by a hispanic police officer during a gunfight while 
the officer was offduty the officer was convicted last week of 
manslaughter

this is loyal garner jrs last chance 
hyden was the only defendant to testify during the punishment 
phase he pointed out that he has a wife and three children and he 
believes he could live up to the rules of probation 
skeen later criticized hydens brief statement saying not one 
time did he indicate any remorse 
wagners attorney john seale compared skeens efforts to put 
the three former lawmen in prison to those of a lynch mob 
on one occasion these men got mad lost their temper and 
overreacted seale said we all lose our tempers 
defense attorneys said they fear for their clients lives if 
they were imprisoned because of retribution by other inmates 
garner from florien la died dec 27 1987 of severe head 
injuries the former officers claimed they struck garner in 
selfdefense when he became unruly in the jail

american continental corp the controversial 
savings and loan company would be liquidated under a plan 
presented friday by federal regulators and the companys unsecured 
creditors 
the plan which must be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge 
calls for the ouster of american continentals controversial 
chairman charles h keating jr 
it would require the companys failed savings and loan 
subsidiary californiabased lincoln savings and loan to pay 21 
million to settle numerous lawsuits against it 
the plan was proposed jointly by the unsecured creditors 
committee and the governments resolution trust corp the entity 
charged with cleaning up the nations savings and loan mess the 
rtc runs lincoln savings which was seized by regulators in april 
1989 
an attorney for keating complained he hadnt been consulted 
about the plan which seeks to separate the affairs of lincoln and 
american continental 
i think its an end run around us said keating attorney 
james j feder who learned of the plan at a bankruptcy court 
hearing the government has refused to negotiate with us 
this is the showcase so they refuse to discuss it with us and 
instead go to the creditors committee 
the settlement doesnt affect an rtc civil lawsuit against 
keating that suit accuses keating and other lincoln insiders of 
racketeering alleging they conspired to buy lincoln for the 
purpose of diverting federally insured deposits to their own use 
keatings contributions to influential lawmakers figure in an

200 million on junk bonds sold by american continental 
lawsuits contend that as many as 23000 people were persuaded to 
buy the risky bonds american continental or lincoln employees 
the deal negotiated by lawyers for the unsecured creditors 
must be approved by a vote of the creditors themselves 
instead of the former adversarial relationship between the rtc 
and the creditors committee both parties will now work 
cooperatively to unwind the corporate affairs of acc and lincoln 
and to investigate and pursue claims against various persons who 
may have injured lincoln and acc rtc special counsel rex

by gay rights activists friday as naive and dangerous 
there are too many tragic consequences of such treatments for 
this work to be tolerated said robert austin president of 
the utah aids coalition reorientation therapy is to psychiatry 
what bloodletting is to the healing arts 
the twoday conference you dont have to be gay is 
sponsored by the evergreen foundation a selfdescribed group of 
former homosexuals dedicated to helping others move toward 
heterosexuality in addition to psychotherapy the group promotes 
development of athletic skills to spur the transition 
joe dallas a fundamentalist christian therapist told an 
opening session crowd of 120 that while not technically an illness 
homosexuality is a symptom of inner conflict often stemming 
from a childhood devoid of proper male identity development

chinas largest city has announced plans 
for an urban renaissance but says it will take billions of 
dollars lots of political savvy and about 40 years 
the pudong development project has won beijings qualified 
endorsement now shanghai must convince foreign investors there is 
hope in this troubled metropolis 
most of shanghais 12 million people and thousands of factories 
compete for land air and water in teeming puxi on the west side 
of the huangpu river 
the development of pudong east of the huangpu would shift 
factories homes and people to the 140squaremile triangle of land 
between that river and the yangtze 
among things the city plans to do in the next five years are 
finish a third bridge across the huangpu start construction on a 
port power plant and waterworks open an export processing zone 
for foreign investors and complete a highway circling the city 
work on a subway linking the two sides of the river is to begin 
this year planners envision more highways another bridge a 
second international airport and apartments hospitals and schools 
for 17 million people in pudong 
finance and trade centers hightech industries and science 
centers are planned older factories in puxi are to be moved to 
pudong and modernized 
shanghais planners say all that and 40 years to accomplish it 
will make a modern efficient city of this former capitalist 
enclave which has been the overworked draft horse of ccommunist 
china for the last 40 
zhu rongji shanghais energetic and ambitious mayor told 
reporters the city will need the equivalent of 10 billion in the 
first decade 
the national budget has allocated 138 billion over the next 
five years much of the rest will have to come from foreign 
investors and the city itself 
according to the mayor the climate for investment is better 
than at any time in the past and especially better than the time 
before last june 
he referred to prodemocracy demonstrations and in june 1989 
the military crackdown that frightened off many potential investors 
and drastically slowed loans from the world bank and other 
international lenders 
the asian development bank is backing the new huangpu bridge and 
a west german consortium has extended credit for more than half the 
500 million subway such lending agreed upon before june will be 
crucial for the pudong project 
a western diplomat in shanghai did not share zhus optimism 
about foreign money 
he noted that foreign investment was down sharply so far this 
year and that hong kong and taiwan businessmen were more interested 
in the special economic zones of southern china 
international lending is blocked up and foreign banks are not 
exactly doing tricks to increase exposure in china he said 
zhu offers major incentives 
foreign banks now allowed to have branches only in the special 
economic zones will be invited to shanghai joint ventures will be 
given tax breaks like those in the zones 
businesses from abroad will be able to obtain leases of 50 to 70 
years on large tracts of land for development to issue bonds and 
stocks and conduct stock trading inside and outside china 
shanghai also is blessed for once with strong support from 
beijing jiang zemin zhus predecessor as mayor is general 
secretary of the communist party and zou jiahua chief of the 
powerful central planning commission also is from shanghai 
perhaps more important the conservative politicians now on top 
in beijing see shanghai with its large state industries as a 
counterbalance to capitalismtainted canton and the special 
economic zones in guangdong and fujian provinces 
even without the fear of creeping capitalism it would make 
sense for them to give fewer favors to guangdong and try to help 
out the older industrial bases the western diplomat said 
shanghai formerly had to pay nearly 90 percent of its earnings 
to the state providing about 10 percent of state revenues that 
left too little to repair a rapidly deteriorating infrastructure 
last year it was allowed to keep about onethird of revenues 
still less than other provinces 
the city made great contributions to the state in the past 
and it is time to return the favor zhu said 
premier li peng visited shanghai in april and endorsed the 
pudong project as an event of important strategic significance 
both to shanghai and the whole country he said the central 
government will provide necessary support and the whole country 
should give active support 
li added however that the city should rely on the support 
and efforts of the people of shanghai 
in his remarks to reporters two weeks later zhu said the city 
could gain 212 million a year just by making its antiquated 
industrial base more efficient 
he noted that shanghais people have lots of money in their 
pockets but also quoted a saying that they are clever but not 
too wise more concerned with shortterm profit than longterm 
interests 
pudong will succeed zhu said only if shortcomings in the 
general mentality of the city are overcome

arthur hailey takes a look at what might 
happen when the news conflicts with the interests of a tv networks 
corporate owner in his latest novel the evening news 
he concludes that corporate interests come first 
i feel that im not alone in believing that the worst thing 
that could happen to television news was the takeover of the three 
networks by large corporations hailey said 
the company that owns the network in my book is fictional but 
theres a lot of reality in the influence of the news by the 
conglomerates its inevitable when people have power 
i think however the competition between the networks will 
prevent a lot of it nbc is now owned by general electric a major 
defense contractor nbc used to do a lot of investigative report 
into defense spending i wonder if they will continue to do that 
at one time the networks were not expected to turn a profit 
said hailey a former television dramatist turned novelist 
it was william paley who founded cbs who pioneered the 
concept of a free and independent news department he said 
the manipulation of the news by the multinational corporate 
owner of the fictional network in haileys book is only a small 
part of the evening news published at 2195 by doubleday 
its essentially a thriller about the kidnapping of the family 
of an anchorman the news department learns the kidnappers are 
terrorists from peru with which the corporation has just agreed to 
develop a major resort the corporation moves to suppress 
unfavorable news about the country 
haileys books include airport wheels hotel the 
moneychangers and strong medicine the evening news will 
be his last book to take on an american institution he said 
im now 70 and my health is not the best he said 
my publisher has offered me the same advance with no deadline 
for the next book he said but a book takes three years of 
hard work i plan to write three novellas at my own pace and 
publish them in one book 
hailey a canadian citizen lives in the bahamas with his wife 
sheila much of the book was written aboard their motor launch 
while cruising among the islands 
when i started the book all i knew was that i wanted to write 
about television news and terrorists he said i felt 
terrorists from the middle east had been written about too much and 
one producer told me about peru and the shining path a group with 
ties to the drug traffickers 
he visited peru twice at his island home he has a satellite 
dish so was able to keep up with news shows from us networks 
while working on the book 
all of haileys previous major novels have been made into movies 
or miniseries but so far he has rejected movie and miniseries 
offers for the evening news

do not despair the world is not coming to an 
end individuals can make it a better place thats the good news 
these days from public television 
still youre in no immediate danger of contracting that warm 
fuzzy feeling from programs like local heroes global change a 
fourpart documentary series opening on pbs tonight 
what we have learned is that the world is extremely complex 
messy that simple solutions and slogans dont work said 
francisco sagasti head of strategic planning for the world bank in 
washington 
local heroes is one of a number of programs on public tv 
trying to show what smart committed people can do against hunger 
poverty and pollution especially in developing nations 
using these people pbs programmers and independent producers 
can relate complex stories without oversimplifying them 
theres been a lot of talk among programmers about doing news 
from the bottom up rather than the top down said harry chancey 
top programmer for pbs affiliate wnet in new york city theres a 
sense of excitement about letting the unremarkable people tell the 
story 
the first episode of local heroes global change considers 
rice farming in indonesia where farmers learned that ecologically 
balanced insect populations could supplant the governments 
disastrous pesticide program 
it also looks at a nearrevolutionary loan program of the 
grameen rural bank of bangladesh which targets women and the 
landless for loans to buy livestock and homes 
the other episodes of the south carolina etv series will 
consider the influences of politics psychology and the global 
economy on third world development 
the pbs series profiles in progress also focuses on local 
heroes a recent episode profiled nepal where deforestation and 
infant mortality are interconnected issues of national survival 
nepals infant mortality rate 20 years ago was 250 per 1000 
live births today at 110 per thousand its still one of the 
highest in the world yet the decrease and a traditionally high 
birth rate have helped increase nepals population more than 50 
percent since 1970 to 17 million people 
that population puts pressure on the forests the traditional 
source of fuel and fodder since 1970 nepal has lost onethird of 
its forest or 6 million acres of trees deforestation robs nepal 
of soil beauty and ultimately the tourism that is a main source 
of its foreign exchange 
its local heroes are prabhakar rana a hotelier who pushes for 
national game preserves and local forest management and dr yagya 
karki a health official who produces videos on prenatal care and 
midwifery and enlists village women as advocates for family 
planning 
we can expect to see many more local heroes on pbs in the 
weeks and months ahead in october bostons wgbh will be offering 
a 10part series called the race to save the planet 
another kind of local hero is naturalist jane goodall whose 
30year study of the chimpanzees of tanzanias gombe national park 
has expanded our understanding of humans closest relative 
its being there with the chimpanzees being out of the rat 
race that gives me the energy to travel around lecturing and 
meeting people she says on hbos documentary chimps so like 
us which airs on may 9 
its a beautifully photographed documentary on her work and her 
deeply felt opposition to the inhumane use of chimps in medical 
research 
on may 20 tbs and the awardwinning national geographic 
explorer present the life and legend of jane goodall 
a little good news never hurt anybody

cecilia peck recognizes herself in the character 
she portrays in the movie torn apart a woman struggling to 
follow her heart even if it goes against her fathers wishes 
cecilia whose father is the actor gregory peck appears with 
adrian pasdar as starcrossed lovers she an arab schoolteacher 
laila and he an israeli soldier ben 
during the course of the plot laila is forced to confront her 
father over the doomed romance 
i really related to her having to go against her father to 
follow her own heart peck said in a recent interview and 
thats the big conflict for laila because she reveres him and 
adores him but she has to follow her own heart and i admired her 
for that 
that wouldnt happen with my dad because of the religious 
reasons but there are those circumstances when a father loves and 
wants to protect his daughter and she has to find her own way 
for peck finding her own way as an actress has taken a 
circuitous route 
after earning a degree in english literature from princeton 
university she moved to new york in the early 1980s to manage a 
punknew wave band called the groceries 
how did her parents react to their only daughter becoming a rock 
n roller in new york i think they kind of ignored the whole 
thing and pretended it wasnt happening peck said with a hearty 
laugh 
when that gig ended she became a story analyst for a film 
company reading scripts and providing synopses that led to 
writing plays and studying acting to help the playwriting 
gradually offbroadway roles started coming her way 
in retrospect i think acting was something i wanted to do 
but i was always academic and didnt think of myself as a 
performer but i think it was inside me she said 
when your parents are in the arts and you spend a lot of time 
in the theater and around artists it really captures your 
imagination 
though her performance is strong in torn apart the film is 
a flat redo of the romeo and juliet theme its characters are 
too shallow and the script too tepid to hook the viewer into 
wanting to care about their worries and longings 
the israeli backdrop however is stunning the sweeping plains 
and the dusty burnt sienna sunsets and makes for pleasant viewing 
she says she has fond memories of growing up with her famous 
father 
i was always on his sets i grew up on location with him i 
saw all his films and i remember when i was little when he won 
the oscar for to kill a mockingbird i had given him a rabbits 
foot to have in his pocket 
gregory peck was careful to shield his four children from some 
of the artificial trappings of hollywood she said 
i didnt grow up in a mansion and i think my father took a lot 
of care that we were normal i think thats because they didnt 
want us to take things for granted 
when she finally pursued acting his advice was for her to get 
good training but the famous name hasnt opened any doors in 
fact it sometimes works against her 
i think us offspring are subjected to extra scrutiny 
especially early on that maybe other actors dont have to contend 
with peck said and i know that in some situations and 
auditions people are skeptical about whether im serious about it 
or welltrained or disciplined or really talented or whether im 
assuming that things are going to be handed to me 
but it just makes you focus on what youre doing and there 
arent any short cuts you cant get a job because of who you are 
you can only get it if youre good and youre serious about it 
part of her aprenticeship has included studying with herbert 
berghof and uta hagen she got her first big role playing in the 
cult movie my best friend is a vampire 
its a comedy and i play this seductress vampire said peck 
who refuses to give her age saying only you know actresses never 
answer that question she later got a role in wall street 
shes hoping the starring role in the lowbudget torn apart 
filmed on location in israel for under 2 million will lead to 
bigger parts in bigger movies 
id like to be on that level of actresses who are being 
considered for the good parts peck said its been a struggle 
ive worked a lot in theater i audition and i get close and my 
work is good and then someone more famous gets it so im hoping 
torn apart will help me out

everyone has heard the story in one form or 
another since everyone has been affected in some way it is the 
story of the variable dollar 
a person bought a house in 1978 for 50000 and now the house 
has a market value of 100000 what an investment the homeowner 
says or you find that a car worth 5000 five years ago still 
sells for 5000 what a car 
youve been duped by the dollar 
in the case of the house divide by two because the 1990 
dollars buying power is only onehalf that of the 1978 dollar the 
house is still a 50000 house in terms of the 1985 dollar the 
car is worth only 4135 or so 
with some degree of inflation always present in the economy it 
is difficult to make yeartoyear comparisons of anything 
denominated in dollars such as paychecks prices profits and 
gross national product 
everyone dupes himself to some extent uncle sam for instance 
has thrown little celebrations every time the gross national 
product reaches another trillion dollar level knowing full well 
that he isnt dealing with reality 
in reality the buying power of the dollar changes every day 
every week every month every year and almost always downward 
but perceptions are slower to change perhaps there is even a 
slight reluctance to change 
while the changes often are small yeartoyear they add up 
substantially after several years have passed ten years ago for 
instance the 1980 dollar bought 158 worth of goods or services 
as measured by the 1990 dollar 
to determine where you stand financially in 1980 dollars you 
must multiply your current dollar amount by 158 by doing so you 
will find how many 1990 dollars and cents are needed to equal the 
buying power of one 1980 dollar 
if you earned 25000 in 1980 for example you would have to 
earn 25000 times 158 in 1990 or 39500 just to avoid losing 
ground deflating isnt it yes and worse it can be terribly 
misleading and confusing 
in geography for example teachers often lament that if 
students cannot point to the place on the map where they live they 
cant possibly relate to the rest of the world and its peoples 
in economics the lament is only slightly different how can 
individuals relate to the economic world and their progress in it 
if they cant comprehend that the measuring stick changes every 
year 
would it make sense to measure snowfalls by a 12inch stick one 
year and a 9inch stick another or change the value of the quart 
or pound or time races by a 58second minute or change the 
gradations on a thermometer 
with such thoughts in mind martin lefkowitz an economist for 
the national chamber of commerce foundation annually updates an 
index for calculating the impact of inflation all the way back to 
1965 
its a shocker the index for 1965 is 413 meaning you would 
have to have 413 in 1990 dollars to equal the buying power of 
just one 1965 dollar the index for 1970 isnt much better at 336 
here are others at fiveyear intervals from 1990 which is 100 
1985 index 121 1980 158 1975 242 multiply 1990 dollars 
against the index to determine how many 1990 dollars equal 1 in 
those years 
it can be a deflating experience but isnt it better to face 
reality than to live in fantasy

sidney lumet has mixed feelings about a lot of 
things these days 
new york city for instance 
it was a marvelous city in the 50s 60s 70s said the 
65yearold filmmaker a native new yorker who has earned academy 
award nominations for such new yorkbased films as dog day 
afternoon and network 
i think its dreadful now im surprised the fish has gone 
belly up that ethnic camaraderie has gone its separate 
wolfpacks 
and new york cops 
ive always been proud of the new york police force the 
uniforms dont fit and their hairs too long and theyve got a bit 
of a belly still theyve never lost a hostage in a hostage 
situation theyve done some great things 
but now theres been 12 14 shootings of blacks in the past 
few years its never happened before in this city 
that ambivalence has been channeled into his films into such 
characters as treat williams disenchanted cop in prince of the 
city and paul newmans shady lawyer in the verdict 
lumet didnt know how he felt about either character when he 
began filming forming his opinions simply by calling print at 
the completion of a scene and for his new film qampa he had 
the same mixed feelings about the characters played by stars nick 
nolte timothy hutton and armand assante 
qampa is based on a novel by edwin torres a justice of the 
new york state supreme court nolte stars as mike brennan a 
corrupt irish cop who shoots a puerto rican thug and attempts to 
cover up the crime 
hutton is al reilly a naive assistant prosecutor assigned to 
noltes case and assante plays bobby texador another puerto rican 
underworld figure murdered by nolte 
i said at the beginning of rehearsal that if i do this movie 
well youre going to feel a kind of sadness when armand gets blown 
up lumet recalled theres something noble about him 
with nicks character hes going on and on and on and you 
think hes the most hateful thing thats ever been then the thing 
at the end when he talks about being a cop about our widows 
and our orphans theres all of those facets 
in qampa lumet offers a bleak vision of new york depicting a 
city that has heard peter finchs tormented call to arms in 
network im mad as hell and im not going to take it 
anymore and adopted it as a way of life 
lumet presents a fallen rainbow coalition with racism expressed 
in the harshest language or the slightest twitch of the face 
there used to be a celebration of difference lumet said 
and that feeling has completely gone its profound and its not 
just new york i think its happening all around one of the 
reasons i wanted to make this film is that i sensed this old boy 
network was all bull 
lumets mixed feelings even extend to location shooting it 
began in the late 1950s as a necessity when lack of studio space 
forced him outside proudly the director recalled his years of 
location work in dog day afternoon serpico and the 1965 
film the pawnbroker shot entirely in harlem 
but while lumet and crew covered everything from greenwich 
village to kennedy airport for qampa the director admitted that 
after years of hitting the streets and never looking back he now 
catches himself peering nervously over his shoulder 
tim and nick went out riding in squad cars riding in 
washington heights one of the last integrated neighborhoods in new 
york nick said to me how come you dont go 
i said i cant do that anymore i cant stand those domestic 
disputes a cop getting shot or a cop shooting someone living like 
that i dont know how the cops do it its a very ambivalent 
feeling 
for lumet the blurring of right and wrong has been a mixed 
blessing a feeling of loss over people and places he once revered 
but also a challenge to become more openminded the director says 
he values forgiveness in life and film and always looks for three 
dimensions even with people that exist only on screen 
i think a big part of my own life and my own concerns have 
had a lot to do with judging and not judging people rigid behavior 
versus behavior that flows with life 
i think its very jewish im not a religious person at all 
and i had to go to a seder for passover i was reminded how stern 
judaism is how unforgiving how tough you cant get off the hook 
you cant get confession you cant do nothing once youve blown 
it youve blown it

political power and billions of dollars are at 
stake in a battle over which final census numbers will be better 
the raw or the cooked 
its an argument thats been obscured by the early problems 
plaguing the census count 
but a year from now the question of adjusting the results 
of the census could be the center of a crucial and bitter debate 
among the states and cities in congress and in the courts 
they cant beat us out so they want to count us out john 
d rogers a republican floor leader in the kentucky senate 
charged in a letter to the commerce department 
democrats and other advocates for minorities see the refusal to 
adjust as a method of disenfranchising their voters 
new york city mayor david dinkins charged that the undercount of 
minorities will cost cities hundreds of millions of dollars and 
many seats in congress 
they have gotten away with statistical malfeasance for 200 
years and figure they can get away with it for another 10 
dinkins said 
a decision against adjustment is a decision against a more 
accurate census javier p guajardo an assistant attorney 
general in texas wrote the commerce department 
a decision against a more accurate census is a decision 
against fair representation of the american public in particular 
those who need to be counted most minorities the poor and the 
homeless 
the sides already are staking out their positions in terms of 
language with opponents referring to adjustment as fiddling 
with the numbers while those in favor prefer the term 
correcting the count 
rep thomas c sawyer dohio who heads the house subcommittee 
that supervises the census seems to be leaning toward the idea of 
adjustment 
when the billions are spent and the counting is all done will 
we know how many americans there are he was asked 
i hope so when we add in the known error sawyer said 
the question is will we take that into account 
the time he said may have come when the nation is just too 
large for current methods of counting 
we may be seeing the point where we need to consider more 
modern statistical methods to bring the basic numbers closer to the 
truth 
why adjust the census 
because it isnt perfect 
the bureau has never claimed it could count everyone 
in 1980 a bureau analysis estimated that 14 percent of the 
population was missed but the error wasnt uniform 
most white middleclass folks got counted while the poor and 
minorities were more likely to be missed young black men were 
undercounted by as much as 6 percent officials have estimated 
a decade ago the decision on adjustment was left to the census 
bureau statisticians there decided they werent confident enough 
in their methods to make changes in the final numbers 
by 1987 many census workers thought an adjustment could and 
should be made in 1990 
the commerce department stepped in and in late 1987 ruled that 
no adjustment would be made in 1990 the ruling cited statistical 
questions and contended that adjustment would erode confidence in 
the census 
barbara bailar who headed the census office studying 
adjustment resigned 
some politicians and officials charged the decision was 
political because the minorities who are undercounted are more 
likely to be democrats 
a group of local governments led by new york city filed suit 
that suit was settled with a promise by the commerce department 
to reconsider but was later reinstated 
the commerce department has set a group of criteria that will be 
used to make a decision by july 15 1991 several months after the 
numbers have to be delivered to state and local governments for 
reapportionment 
those criteria opponents argued in reinstating their lawsuit 
are so stringent that they virtually prohibit adjustment 
if a decision is eventually made to adjust it will not be until 
mid1991 
because the first census reports will come out dec 31 that 
means there would be two sets of numbers providing easily 
identifiable winners and losers 
the fact that there is a limited amount of money and only 435 
seats in the house of representatives means that every gain by one 
state requires a loss by another 
while the 1990 census will likely mean movement of a dozen or so 
house seats from one state to another the difference between raw 
and adjusted numbers should affect only two to four seats sawyer 
said 
it will also mean a difference of billions of dollars in federal 
and state money distributed over the next 10 years based on 
population numbers 
university of wisconsin historian margo anderson author of a 
book on the history of the census said the framers of the 
constitution knew that the orderly transfer of political 
representation is always disruptive to some groups or interests in 
society 
the test of the new methods is not whether they are 
disruptive but whether they are fair she said adding that the 
departments guidelines for adjustment conjure up an idealized 
history the notion of a 200year process of enumeration which 
cannot be tampered with 
in fact she noted census methods have changed radically over 
the centuries 
the premise that the actual enumeration is the best count 
possible has no factual support john w tukey of princeton 
university told the department 
the census bureau launched its effort to count the estimated 250 
million americans in late march a project expected to take the 
rest of the year 
the tally was embroiled in controversy from the start with 
millions of forms misaddressed 
the public response was less than the bureau had hoped the 
effort has moved to a doortodoor count but that will cost 
considerably more than if people had all received their forms and 
mailed them back

no country is ready to knock the united states 
from its roost as the worlds top poultry producer but in the 
global game of chicken there is a beaktobeak race to see who is 
the most efficient 
efficiency can translate into profits for producers and lower 
prices for consumers efficiency also is a big factor in one 
countrys having an export advantage over another 
the worlds poultry trade is one of the many items under 
discussion in the current uruguay round of negotiations under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade which is scheduled to 
conclude by the end of this year 
according to agriculture department analysts the gatt talks 
which are aimed at general liberalization of world trade could 
lead to greater traffic in poultry meat and lower consumer prices 
in many countries 
basically the departments economic research service says in a 
recent report efficient producers such as the united states 
thailand and brazil would reap benefits from successful gatt 
negotiations 
poultry is the fastest growing source of meat representing 
about 22 percent of all meat production in 1988 the report said 
the countries with industrial market economies accounted for 
about 54 percent of total world poultry production and 59 percent 
of world exports in 1988 
the five major poultry importers in 1988 were japan saudi 
arabia the soviet union hong kong and iraq the five biggest 
exporters were the united states the european economic community 
brazil hungary and thailand 
poultrys relative share of total meat consumption after trade 
liberalization would probably continue to grow because costs of 
poultry production could continue to be lower than for other 
meats the report said 
the united states produced about 207 billion pounds of poultry 
in 1988 based on estimated readytocook weight that was almost 
double the output of 1970 broilers make up most poultry 
in 1940 us broilers once called fryers required more than 
4 pounds of feed for each pound of live weight gain today the 
ratio is about 2 pounds of feed for each 1 of gain 
moreover the report said improved genetic stock and management 
have reduced the time to grow out a broiler from 14 weeks in 
1940 to 6 or 7 weeks currently 
consequently based on 1986 figures us broiler producers are 
able to turn out readytocook birds for an average cost of 299 
cents per pound 
given the great size of the overall us chicken factory that 
should rank american producers at the top of the heap for 
efficiency collectively the no 2 producer including chickens 
consumed domestically and those exported was the eec which 
produced 13 billion pounds in 1988 
the soviet union was third at 702 billion pounds followed by 
china 529 billion brazil 44 billion japan 324 billion and 
france the leading eec producer 316 billion 
feed conversion rates and costs of production were not available 
to agency researchers for the eec although the 1986 cost of 
production of broilers in france was 348 cents per pound 
in the soviet union the thirdranked broiler producer it 
required 36 pounds of feed to grow 1 pound of broiler compared 
with 53 pounds in 1965 no costs were shown also it takes a 
soviet chicken 66 to 77 days to grow enough to be eaten more than 
40 percent longer than the us broiler 
much of the differential between soviet producers and 
producers in other countries can probably be attributed to the low 
protein content of soviet poultry feed because most protein meal 
must be imported the report said 
but us broiler efficiency is being challenged by some other 
countries thailand a relative newcomer to broiler production 
turns out birds at a cost of 299 cents per pound of readytocook 
weight matching the us cost feed conversion also is at the us 
rate of 2 pounds of feed for each pound of live weight 
new zealand is producing broilers with 19 pounds of feed for 
each pound of growth but its costs were reported at 336 cents per 
readytocook pound 
the report showed that consumer broiler prices in the united 
states in november 1988 averaged 85 cents per pound only brazil 
was lower at 68 cents 
others included in a selected list of prices for broiler meat in 
capital cities in us dollars included australia 169 per 
pound canada 124 france 222 japan 290 and mexico 93 
cents

a fading cold war and growing 
philippine nationalism may cause the united states to close its 
oldest and largest military bases on foreign soil 
american and philippine officials open talks monday on whether 
the united states will be allowed access to clark air base the 
subic bay naval base and four smaller installations after sept 16 
1991 when the 1947 military bases agreement expires 
because the bases have been the cornerstone of american defense 
of the far east the outcome of the talks will be a central element 
in defining the future us role in east asia 
a new longterm agreement is far from certain 
soviet military retrenchment has led to demands in the us 
congress that the expensive network of foreign bases be trimmed 
filipinos question whether they can be truly independent while 
40000 american service personnel defense department civilians and 
military dependents remain on their soil 
president corazon aquino has refused to say whether she supports 
an extension of the agreement us diplomats and government 
sources say they believe she favors it but has avoided a public 
commitment because the issue is so sensitive 
most filipino politicians who have commented publicly want the 
bases closed next year or phased out by the end of the century 
opposition stiffened after congress cut 96 million from an aid 
package the reagan administration had promised manila in order to 
keep the bases until the agreement expired 
since the end of world war ii filipinos assumed the united 
states wanted to keep the bases at all costs and would pay 
handsomely for the privilege 
in 1988 foreign secretary raul manglapus demanded 2 billion in 
aid but eventually accepted a twoyear package of 962 million 
congressional pressure to reduce defense spending as the soviet 
threat recedes has raised doubts that the bases are worth such a 
price 
defense secretary dick cheney has announced plans to reduce the 
120000 us troops in the far east by 10 to 12 percent over three 
years as the newly prosperous nations of asia assume greater 
responsibility for their own defense 
my sense is that if it looks too testy the united states 
will simply tell the philippines that we will close down paul h 
kreisberg of the carnegie endowment for international peace said 
about the negotiations 
us policymakers and private researchers believe the bases 
still have an important role in projecting american military power 
and maintaining security in the far east 
the american military has been in the philippines since 1898 
when the united states seized the archipelago in the 
spanishamerican war ending 350 years of spanish rule 
it has larger forces elsewhere in asia 64000 troops in japan 
and 43000 in south korea but the philippine bases allow the 
united states great flexibility in crises including those far from 
pacific waters 
nato agreements prohibit the united states from using its 
europeanbased forces outside the alliance area without allied 
permission 
no such restrictions apply in the philippines 
threequarters of the us warships that escorted oil tankers 
through the persian gulf during the iraniraq war were from the 
pacific fleet most were supplied and outfitted at subic 50 miles 
west of manila 
planes from clark and the cubi point naval air station monitor 
shipping lanes and supply the large indian ocean air and naval 
installations at diego garcia 
in a straight military sense the value of the bases declines 
only slightly in a postcold war era said richard fisher a 
heritage foundation policy analyst there will still be a 
requirement to deploy to south korea or potential conflicts in the 
persian gulf 
some functions could be performed on guam saipan and tinian 
more than 1500 miles east but experts say the guam harbor is far 
smaller than subics the islands also lack the skilled labor 
especially ship repairmen available in the philippines 
despite official opposition to foreign forces most east asian 
governments privately support the bases fidel ramos the 
philippine defense secretary said there was little evidence of a 
major reductions in soviet forces in vietnam or in vladivostok 
headquarters of the soviet pacific fleet 
in vietnam the soviet navy uses the usbuilt base at cam ranh 
bay 
the soviets said in january they had reduced air strength at cam 
ranh bay to no more than 10 planes foreign minister nguyen co 
thach of vietnam says all soviet forces will be gone by 1992 
in recent years us officials have played down the soviet 
presence as the reason for maintaining bases philippine bases 
brent scowcroft now president bushs national security adviser 
told a news conference two years ago that trading cam ranh bay for 
subic would be very much in the soviet interest but not 
necessarily in ours the russians dont need it nearly as 
much as we do the philippines 
regional governments fear a drastic reduction in us forces 
would cause such nations as china japan vietnam and india to 
expand their forces 
without a persuasive us presence there will be a power 
vacuum which other powers would scramble to fill said lee hsien 
loong singapores deputy defense minister 
such geopolitical concerns mean less than money and national 
pride in the introspective philippines 
most surveys indicate supporters of the bases outnumber 
opponents but filipinos in growing numbers believe the american 
presence infringes national sovereignty 
the installations pump an estimated 1 billion into the economy 
however and more than 270000 filipinos depend on them for a 
livelihood 
those people who say we have alternatives to the bases have to 
prove they can replace the considerable support given by the us 
facilities to the city said mayor richard gordon of olongapo 
home of the subic base 
opposition to the bases stems from complex oftencontradictory 
views of the united states which ruled the philippines from 1898 
to 1946 
admiration of american culture borders on obsession among 
filipinos the most westernized asians but many believe this has 
created a psychological dependence that inhibits national 
development 
the philippine military relies almost entirely on the united 
states for external defense its navy often turns to the americans 
for help in air and sea rescues us air force meteorologists warn 
their filipino counterparts of approaching typhoons 
on the other side critics claim the bases encourage 
prostitution the sleazy bars and nightclubs of olongapo and 
angeles home of clark air base serve as evidence 
the whole bases campaign is a quest for finding out who we 
are said socorro diokno chairman of the antibases coalition 
can the filipino stand on his feet without having to rely on 
america 
dependence on the united states was dramatized in december when 
american f4 phantom jets from clark flew air cover for government 
forces during a coup attempt 
the planes never fired a shot but their presence stopped rebel 
air attacks on military and government buildings including the 
presidential palace 
last year mrs aquino appointed a committee to study 
alternative uses for the bases if no new agreement was reached 
proposals include converting clark to a civilian airport and 
establishing a commercial ship repair facility at subic 
businessmen in olongapo and angeles are skeptical 
we firmly believe that any conversion plan regarding 
alternative uses of the bases entails huge costs and implementation 
is doubtful the angeles chamber of commerce and industry in a 
statement

inside the luxury hotel was a 
conference on tourism and crime in rio just outside two 
tourists were mugged 
men with shotguns hold up airport buses valuables are stolen at 
the beach from hotel rooms 
police booths sprout in every block cariocas as rios 
residents are called have special devices on their cars that cut 
off the fuel supply when a thief has driven a few blocks 
crime always has infested rios slums but now it is common on 
the glitzy tourist beaches and the streets where money lives 
cariocas have little affinity for the police or justice system 
and often settle disputes themselves increasingly guns are the 
arbiters of choice 
not long ago antonio enrique de oliveira sighted down the 
barrel of his new 38caliber pistol and squeezed off a shot 
thats my law the husky 26yearold mechanic said as the 
report echoed off the hills overlooking the vast poor suburb of 
nova iguacu its the only law that works in rio anymore 
death squads generally offduty policemen fed up with the 
inefficient courts and turnstile justice make another kind of law 
they simply kill known criminals or suspects often for pay from 
merchants 
among reasons for the crime wave are poverty rarity of 
punishment the example of official corruption inflation that 
reached nearly 5000 percent and forced harsh economic measures 
and an everwidening gap between rich and poor 
the top 1 percent of brazils 150 million people have as much 
wealth as the bottom 50 percent 
police statistics say homicides in metropolitain rio rose from 
2924 in 1983 to 7654 last year 
residents and religious leaders say most killings dont get into 
the records a city police official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said there were nearly 20000 in metropolitan rio last 
year 
crime has never been this bad were fighting a guerrilla 
war said helio vigio a police inspector for 20 years 
a sociologist helio jaguaribe said the elite and the 
establishment can no longer control tensions between rich and poor 
crime is now seen by the poor as social retribution 
gun sales icreased from 15520 in 1987 to 22872 in 1989 
cariocas bar their windows and buy burglar alarms and watch dogs 
neighbors often band together to hire armed guards 
my sales are doubling every three months said mauro cesar 
martins who displays eight models of 38 caliber revolvers in his 
downtown sporting goods store people trust only their gun for 
protection can you blame them 
police say thousands of automatic weapons smuggled from paraguay 
and bolivia are bought and sold in illegal gun markets 
for years violent crime was largely confined to rios north 
zone a poor densely populated area far from the beaches of the 
wealthy south zone 
automatic weapons abound in the north zone gang wars end in 
massacres 
citizens carry pistols in their shorts children as young as 5 
run cocaine to customers in affluent neighborhoods 
bodies are dumped in the streets every day sometimes outside 
police stations one sunday in january 10 were found in a group 
shot through the head a month later a record 57 corpses turned up 
in rio in a single weekend 
gang leaders establish personal fiefdoms in the favelas or 
hillside shantytowns and organize residents into defense units 
the slums are becoming armed fortresses of urban warfare 
said lt eide trindade director of rios task force on organized 
crime 
on drug raids in the hills you run into nests of machine 
gunners when they open fire its like walking into lightning 
city police poorly equipped trained and paid are no match for 
the wellarmed criminals they are sent into the streets without 
nightsticks holsters or bulletproof vests and must buy their own 
uniforms 
each officer is given six bullets every three months they 
patrol in 13yearold volkswagen beetles which often have broken 
radios 
rio has 12000 municipal police and 27000 state police in a 
metropolitan area of 105 million people 
death squads which first appeared in the 1950s are growing 
with the crime wave community leaders say they have more than 
2000 members compared with 500 two years ago 
a police inquiry made public in april said the chiefs of 15 
death squads in greater rio were active state policemen 
the death squads are in complete control of the people if 
anyone sees a murder and opens his mouth hes as good as dead 
said azuleika rodrigues president of the federation of 
neighborhood associations in nova iguacu 
low pay causes police strikes and corruption a rookie cop earns 
the equivalent of 100 a month and a topranking inspector 335 
you have to be a parttime crook or mobster to eat or have 
your teeth fixed said officer jose quimonte 33 who works 48 
hours a week for 188 
there is temptation for officers to break the law and little 
incentive for them to enforce it 
police say lawbreakers are encouraged by a slow understaffed 
judicial system and the belief that criminals will get light 
sentences or go free 
if you bring someone in chances are that if hes rich 
enough hid salespeople from the worlds no 1 jewelry company 
serving the sanitation industry the idea clear hefty cinchsaks 
might seem a trifle mundane but last months earth day somehow

the marapicu cemetery in the impoverished 
baixada fluminense suburbs of rio de janeiro has been a burial 
ground for victims of death squads for nearly 30 years police 
officials admit knowing this but have neither undertaken an 
investigation nor explained their failure to do so todd lewan 
visited the graveyard 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the dead have no names in marapicu 
cemetery 
no one knows who they were or where they came from death squads 
killed them that is all anyone remembers 
sebastiao fernandez da rocha a sparrowlike man of 72 buries 
them at first it made him sad to think he was the last to see the 
victims he was gentle in lowering the younger ones 
after 17 years pity no longer hangs on his features he is a 
gaunt old man with thick calluses raised by the hoe and shovel the 
bodies mean little more to him now than the dirt he throws over 
them 
each morning before dawn rocha begins a twohour walk to work 
on a winding road through one of brazils most lawless regions the 
baixada fluminense 
orange groves and cotton once flourished in the baixadas 
lowlands but the the plantations were divided into plots 30 years 
ago and sold to squatters poverty is everywhere machine guns make 
the law death is judgment 
when rocha arrives in queimados which means burned ones he 
whistles into the open doors of the shacks of two young helpers 
they walk up the red dirt road together to the cemetery on the hill 
so close are the graves that they nearly touch hundreds of 
white stone crosses bearing painted numbers jut crookedly from 
the rocky ground there are no headstones 
the task on this morning presuming death squads attacked again 
in the night was to dig six graves when that was done rocha and 
the young men sat in the shade painting crosses white while they 
waited 
in the heat of the midday sun a dust cloud rose on the ridge a 
morgue van rolled up rocha put on his straw hat and went to it 
the barefoot youths followed 
lots of meat today said the driver a big sweaty man he 
threw the rear doors open 
inside were the bodies of eight men and a small girl in a sun 
dress who had been shot in the stomach some of the mens faces 
were unrecognizable nearly blown away 
rocha went into a small office near the gate wrote the number 9 
in a ledger and returned they pulled the corpses out like sacks of 
beans and dropped them into plywood boxes the boxes keep wild dogs 
from digging bodies up 
the young men carried the boxes down the slope while rocha dug 
three more holes 
fifty yards away was a single grave with flowers blooming on it 
thats my son rocha said i found his body about 10 
minutes walk from here on my way in one morning they broke his 
neck and spine dont know why no one ever finds out why they 
die 
rocha thrust the shovel into the earth he was wheezing ribs 
pressing against a torn blue shirt 
he was 15 the old man said his name was luis luis 
enrique 
he and the others worked quickly silently to cover the graves 
only the rasp of their hoes on the crude coffins interfered with 
the sound of a rising wind 
when it was done they went out through the black gates and sat 
under a mango tree on a bluff drinking rum from tin cups 
will there be more today old man one of the young ones 
asked 
yes 
it is terrible isnt it 
rocha grunted this is the way things are he said i 
remember a proverb the blame lies not only with the ax but the 
tree as well yes that is the proverb 
the young men nodded and had another pull of rum

ten years time enough for a 
forest to spring from lifeless ash time enough for people in the 
shadow of a restless volcano to recover even profit from 
catastrophe 
but never time enough to forget 
even as nature heals this shattered mountain with a blanket of 
green the violence of may 18 1980 remains seared in memory that 
was the day mount st helens exploded killing 57 people 
flattening a forest and spitting out an ash cloud that circled the 
globe 
don mcelwain remembers he was camping 20 miles away when hot 
ash engulfed him turning his day to night 
im a former army ranger and not much scares me he said 
but ill tell you i was doing some praying 
mcelwain and two camping partners barely escaped on horseback 
breathing through rags torn from their shirts as they rode across 
ash that singed the hair on the horses legs 
but the ordeal did not destroy his love of mount st helens 
like many of the volcanos neighbors mcelwain 53 hopes to profit 
from a disaster that changed this regions economic life as surely 
as it rearranged the landscape hes been scouting out land 
thinking of starting up a small tourist resort 
someday he said this place will be beautiful again 
before it erupted mount st helens was a snowy symmetrical 
seemingly dormant volcano surrounded by tall evergreen forests 
thousands of campers experienced their first real wilderness along 
crystalclear spirit lake on the mountains north side 
the idyll couldnt last mount st helens historically one of 
the cascade ranges most active volcanoes had not erupted since 
1857 geologists warned it was overdue 
at 832 am on may 18 1980 after weeks of sputtering and 
rumbling the volcano roared awake an earthquake jarred loose a 
huge slab that slid into the lake weakening the mountains north 
side 
magma that for months had risen slowly up the volcanos vents 
suddenly let loose in a sideways explosion of gas rock and ash 
2500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed 
hiroshima 
a superheated cloud of pulverized rock focused horizontally by 
the misshapen crater flattened 150foottall fir trees like pieces 
of straw across spirit lake a mammoth wave caused by the 
landslide sloshed over the opposite ridge washing the slopes bare 
of the downed timber 
victims caught in the blast included us geological survey 
scientist david johnston killed even as he monitored delicate 
measuring devices on a ridge 5 miles away photographer reid 
blackburn snapped a few pictures then retreated to his car he was 
found two days later smothered by ash 
harry truman who had lived on the mountain 54 years defied 
orders to leave his spirit lake lodge declaring that mountain 
is a part of truman and im a part of it 
his words were prophetic truman and his lodge were buried under 
120 feet of debris and 180 feet of the new deeper spirit lake a 
steaming cauldron of mud and water covered by a floating layer of 
uprooted trees scoured of bark 
the volcanos heat melted glaciers and starting surging 
mudflows one wall of mud 12 feet high swept down the toutle river 
destroying trucks bridges and more than 200 homes 
an ash plume rose 14 miles into the air and drifted eastward 
darkening three states and choking towns with ashfalls up to 6 
inches deep 
to observers first returning to the mountain the destruction 
seemed complete but as weeks went by scientists watched in 
amazement as life appeared amid the ruin 
pocket gophers burrowed up from their tunnels poking their 
heads through ash colonies of ants went busily about their 
business even the most barren areas were soon invaded by 
ballooning spiders and beetles scavengers that floated in on 
parachutelike webs and survived on the remains of other insects 
blown their way 
the first summer green shoots of fireweed and huckleberry rose 
through 10inch layers of ash later elk and deer wandered back 
and the windblown seeds of alders and evergreens sprouted in 
fertile patches where water and wind had eroded the ash 
inside the mount st helens national volcanic monument a 
110000acre preserve created in 1982 for watching natural 
regeneration the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall 
outside the monument the us forest service and logging companies 
gave nature a jump start salvaging downed trees and planting 
seedlings in holes bored through ash today some of those trees 
stand 25 feet tall 
as nature heals so do people after the eruption communities 
still grieving for victims started crawling out and slowly cleaning 
up 
fearing more floods the army corps of engineers dredged rivers 
built levees and bored a drainage tunnel to spirit lake this may 
19 officials will dedicate a sediment retention dam on the toutle 
river finishing a decade of recovery work costing more than 560 
million 
muddy rivers have grown clearer and many residents now look to 
st helens in hope not fear theyre staking their futures on the 
flood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in the 
contiguous united states 
more than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints or 
stop at a forest service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano 
almost 50000 have climbed the volcanos south side since entry 
restrictions were eased in 1987 
roadside gift shops specialize in volcano souvenirs and the 
onceflooded town of toutle sponsors an annual volcano daze 
festival developers are preparing for 1992 when a highway will be 
extended to a new visitors center peering into the volcanos 
crater 
on sunny spring weekends the mountains southern flank becomes 
a playground for up to 400 climbers and skiers there are higher 
northwest mountains for climbing more accessible mountains for 
skiing but mount st helens its former 9677foot summit reduced 
1300 feet by the eruption has a magnetic appeal 
i think its a morbid curiosity said martha miller peering 
into the barren crater from the rim after a grueling sixhour 
climb on skis 
its the mystique said her husband ben who skied the 
volcano partly to impress friends back home in new hampshire where 
the mountains are more sedate st helens is an an active 
volcano and everyones heard of it 
ten years is a blink of an eye in geologic time and the volcano 
still sputters the latest steam release occurred april 25 
scientists dont rule out more fireworks but say the possibility 
of an eruption is low a 920foot lava dome on the crater floor has 
not grown since 1986 and geologists who have honed their 
predictive skills since 1980 are confident they can give days or 
weeks notice of significant eruptions 
thats scant reassurance at the volcano rim where the 
mountains jagged wounds are still raw its destructive power still 
overwhelming silent fields of snow and towers of rock dwarfed the 
skiers as they stared into the immense crater 
ten years later mount st helens still commands respect 
it makes you feel pretty small martha miller said she 
turned her back to a chill wind blowing up from the crater and the 
skiers headed down to the springtime warmth of the forest far 
below

tom kadlec had just left church may 18 
1980 when the black clouds began rolling in he doesnt remember if 
the pastor preached fire and brimstone that sunday morning if he 
did it was fitting 
about 330 in the afternoon it turned blackest dark and the 
automatic street lights came on like the world was coming to an 
end kadlec said we were all wondering what was happening 
what happened was something residents of this farming town of 
1800 never want to experience again mount st helens roughly 200 
miles to the southwest blew its top at 832 am within hours 
tons of windcarried volcanic ash and dust were being dumped on the 
eastern washington towns of ellensburg yakima moses lake and 
ritzville 
i didnt hear any explosions or anything recalled terry 
reed owner of the 21room empire motel a little later on in the 
afternoon people started coming in and saying we want to get in 
here and get a room before it hits and i said what hits well 
i found out 
overnight ritzvilles population more than doubled the five 
motels in town filled up within hours as roughly 2200 stranded 
travelers abandoned their ashclogged cars on roads and highways 
homes schools and churches served as emergency shelters the mail 
stopped businesses closed and the citys vibrantly blooming 
hawthorn trees sagged and died 
by monday morning 4 to 7 inches of pale gray ash blanketed main 
street family wheat fields the golf course drug stores had a run 
on dust masks grocery stores and restaurants ran out of supplies 
and food 
it got so bad the mayor had to close the bars down people got 
to fighting and stealing from one another reed said 
for three days nobody could get into town or out 
all this ash was everywhere and it was just quiet there 
wasnt a bird or anything no sounds at all it was just eerie 
eerie said diane keetch coowner of colwell motor inn 
kirk danekas a funeral home operator who was mayor at the time 
postponed a funeral scheduled for monday he trudged up a hill by 
the cemetery and looked forlornly down on the heart of the city he 
had governed for less than a year and a half 
and there was this great gray mass and i asked myself are 
all these people going to leave is this the end of the town 
it wasnt of course nearer the volcano 57 people were killed 
many by the scorching blast of the eruption or the smothering ash 
but few serious health problems or emergencies were reported here 
more than anything the tons of ash were an enormous mess 
in the weeks that followed the town dug out danekas said 36 of 
39 counties sent equipment or other aid homeowners cleaned their 
roofs and yards and piled the ash along the street water trucks 
hosed it down earth moving machinery pushed it into piles 
scooploaders picked up hundreds of cubic yards of ash and dumped 
it in a gravel pit a quarter mile from town 
it was just hard work for everybody danekas said 
the abrasive ash wore out farm machinery but didnt seem to 
poison any crops in fact many wheat farmers suggested the ash was 
the reason for a bumper crop that year 
when it rained the ash seemed to seal the moisture said 
mike bauer adding that his crop was 20 percent above average that 
year 
to this day the ash remains in bauers soil compressed in a 
quarterinch layer a whitishgray film can also be seen along 
roadsides and undisturbed hillsides 
and reminders of the fallout a decade ago will long rest in the 
hearts and minds of people like janet sanger of neighboring lind a 
town that beckons visitors with a sign that says drop in mount

entrepreneurs have turned the ash from 
mount st helens into everything from gemstones to jesus in the 
last decade and volcano kitsch still is a hot seller 
ash is washington states answer to the velvet elvises and straw 
cowboy hats that lure tourist dollars in other areas 
when sally warren surveyed the ruined cucumbers in her woodland 
garden that may day in 1980 she never imagined mount st helens 
ash would one day put money in her pocket 
but 10 years after the eruption ms warren and a partner 
continue to make and sell porcelain figures containing some of the 
ash it is one of several businesses born of the volcano 
a little economy has definitely developed and grown from using 
this mount st helens ash said mary mains whose company makes 
jewelry from it 
inventive residents put the ash in everything from pottery to 
earrings to christmas ornaments paperweights and pens there are 
even ashcolored volcanoes with little ash smoke plumes coming out 
the top 
they sell to tourists and to washington residents seeking gifts 
for outofstate friends said kay thomas owner of a gift shop in 
this city about 100 miles east of the volcano the lure is the 
volcano connection 
i wish i had known you could do wonderful things with it 
ms thomas said of the ash that piled up on her roof i would 
have sold it 
other people immediately saw the potential workers who went up 
the mountain to salvage the engines of destroyed logging trucks 
learned their cutting torches would melt the ash into a green stone 
that discovery prompted ms mains to found a new branch of her 
retail business the emerald fox 
she keeps five employees busy producing emerald obsidianite 
jewelry made by melting the ash at 2700 degrees in an oxygenfree 
environment the jewelry is sold over the united states she said 
the ash is not actually ash but rock dust that is largely 
composed of silicon aluminum iron calcium sodium and at least 
12 other elements she said 
chromium and iron when heated give the stone its rich green 
color making it a dead ringer for emeralds she said they are so 
close in appearance that new york city jewelry stories concerned 
about security use the stones in window displays as a substitute 
for emeralds 
the jewelry priced from 30 to more than 200 may indeed 
attract buyers because of its beauty 
the same cannot be said for the 2 pens whose plastic bodies are 
filed with ash or what looks like a clump of wet sand in the form 
of a tiny smoldering volcano only hardcore ash enthusiasts could 
love those 
and all ash is not created equal 
the debris from different eruptions came from different depths 
of the earth and reacts differently to processing 
ms warren and partner fay miller make their porcelain figures 
with ash gathered from the june 12 1980 eruption rather than the 
may eruption 
its more like sand she said the first eruption was more 
like talcum powder it made it look muddy 
ms mains disdains the 1980 ash altogether preferring for her 
jewelry a 1981 vintage believed to have come from 10 to 20 miles 
below the earths surface 
fred ybarra a gemologist in yakima said many people still come 
into his shop offering to sell their ash he cant use it but said 
that items made from ash would eventually become more valuable as 
the ash supply runs out 
ms warren uses about 2 tablespoons of ash for every gallon of 
porcelain she mixes up her husband shoveled up a large amount of 
ash shortly after the eruptions and they keep it in gallon jars at 
their home 
weve got enough for another 40 years she said

one of the nations most decorated soldiers 
has ended nearly two decades of selfimposed exile to fight for 
reform of a military establishment that he says lacks the moral 
courage to change 
col david h hackworth broke with the army in 1971 
disillusioned and angered by its use of conventional tactics to 
fight a guerrilla war in vietnam 
forced to retire from the service because of his public 
criticism of the vietnam strategy an embittered hackworth built a 
a new life in australia it took 18 years before he put the 
bitterness behind him and returned to the united states 
i was angry i was vindictive said hackworth author of the 
1989 bestselling autobiography about face 
writing the book was an incredible catharsis for me i was 
able to heal myself 
now he is directing his energy toward a campaign to reshape a 
military bureaucracy that he says must change its mindset and 
come up with fresh ideas 
hackworth said he is pressing for the merger of the army navy 
and air force into an american defense force he says the change 
would reduce waste and duplication and provide for a more 
streamlined command system 
our military is all wrong has been all wrong since world war 
ii he said the key to change is getting warrior leaders at 
the top rather than managercareerists hackworth said 
all we need is leadership people whove got the guts 
determination and the vision to turn things around instead of 
those who live by the motto of go along to get along 
its imperative that congress and the pentagon make reforms 
because the american people are tired of being ripped off said 
hackworth who will make his case in a may 14 meeting with army 
secretary michael stone 
maj joe pidilla an army spokesman declined to comment on 
hackworths statements 
orphaned before he was a year old hackworth 59 was raised in 
california by his grandmother and in foster homes 
he lied about his age to join the army in 1946 when he was 15 
and received a battlefield commission in korea five years later at 
40 he became the youngest full colonel in vietnam where he served 
for nearly six years 
his many awards for valor include two distinguished service 
crosses nine silver stars eight bronze stars and eight purple 
hearts for wounds suffered in battle 
hackworth gained a reputation for blunt talk when as a teenage 
private in italy he told gen dwight d eisenhower the chow 
stinks 
his unsparing criticism of tactics and doctrine continued 
throughout his 25year career it culminated in 1971 when he 
appeared on abcs issues and answers show he told a national 
television audience that the armys vietnam tactics were not unlike 
the food he had in italy 
that was too much for the army which unceremoniously retired 
the man who had been told a few months earlier that he was 
virtually assured promotion to brigadier general 
i was brokenhearted because the army was my family he said 
i loved it 
hackworth said he chose australia as a new home because it was 
the farthest place from the united states where english was spoken 
he bought a diner and two gas stations and later purchased a 
restaurant in brisbane he sold the restaurant a few years later 
for 1 million and took up farming 
hackworth decided to reconcile with his country during a may 
1988 visit to turn in the manuscript of about face to his 
publisher simon amp schuster inc it was then he realized that 
writing the book had driven the devil out of me 
last year he bought a home in montana where he will live about 
six months a year the rest of the time hell spend at his home in 
australia 
a major focus of his campaign for military reform has been the 
vietnam war from which the military has learned little he said 
we havent conducted an honest postmortem we are treating it 
exactly as we treated korea we were so humiliated by not winning 
in korea that we took all the mistakes and swept them under the 
rug vietnam became the stepchild of the korean war 
hackworth cautioned against reckless dismemberment of the 
military as the soviet threat diminishes 
we did it in 1918 1945 1953 and 1973 we went into world war 
ii not prepared we went into korea not prepared 
the contraction of the military has to be done carefully he 
said what i would do is have a moratorium on the acquisition of 
any goodies we wouldnt buy any stealths we wouldnt buy any 
midgetman missiles 
we should use the money to keep our military personnel and 
build down through attrition he said 
if theres one lesson we learned in vietnam it was that 
hardware couldnt win over dedicated men one thing the viet cong 
had just like our revolutionary forefathers who beat a superior 
force in the field was fire in their bellies men win wars not 
hardware 
he also urged a return to the draft because a standing 
volunteer army violates what our country is about it becomes 
isolated from the values of our society 
our young people are couch potatoes theyre weak and their 
moral values are bad at least the military can give them values

sales of north americanmade cars and light 
trucks edged up 28 percent in late april as rising sales of 
transplant cars from foreignowned factories helped overcome a 
sharp sales drop at chrysler corp 
north americanmade cars and trucks sold at an average rate of 
47684 during the period up 28 percent while the average rate 
for big three vehicles was 41543 up just 01 percent the 
companies reported thursday 
chrysler said its car sales in the april 2130 period dropped 
338 percent and light truck sales dropped 165 percent from that 
period a year earlier increases at general motors corp and ford 
motor co barely offset the declines

profits fell by 54 percent at general motors 
corp and by 69 percent at ford motor co in the first quarter due 
to us production slowdowns and problems with overseas operations 
the figures released thursday combined with chrysler corps 80 
percent drop in first quarter net income meant an overall 64 
percent profit drop for the big three automakers during the period 
but the results were not as bad as the 75 percent profit decline 
that analysts had expected for the companies which are struggling

a federal appeals court decision striking down a 
key insider trading rule deals a sharp blow to enforcement of wall 
streets crime of the 1980s lawyers say 
the ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york 
also renewed calls for congress to pass a law precisely defining 
insider trading which refers to the use of information not 
publicly available to buy and sell securities 
this should put a little bit of fear into people who want to 
see a very strong enforcement program harvey l pitt a top 
securities lawyer who helped draft failed 1987 insider trading 
legislation said thursday 
it demonstrates again why the securities and exchange 
commission would be better off if they had a definition of insider 
trading that was blessed by the congress said pitt who 
represented ivan boesky the speculator who settled insider trading 
charges in 1987 
the appeals court wednesday overturned the conviction of former 
stockbroker robert chestman found guilty of insider trading using 
fourthhand information about the pending takeover of a supermarket 
chain in 1986 
in a 30 decision the court ruled there was no proof chestman 
knew that information about the takeover of waldbaum inc which 
trickled down to him through a family chain was confidential 
also the panel by a 21 vote slammed the door on a key 
securities exchange act provision that makes any trading using 
confidential information a crime even if the trader isnt 
violating a fiduciary responsibility to the company involved 
that provision known as rule 14e3 was adopted by the 
securities and exchange commission in 1980 to broaden its attack on 
insider trading 
the government has relied on fraud rules and case law to 
prosecute insider trading which became a household term during the 
boom years last decade via fraud rings run by figures such as 
boesky and investment banker martin siegel 
i think its a very substantial blow to both the justice 
department and the secs enforcement efforts if the decision 
stands said robert l plotz a former assistant us attorney 
who prosecuted the chestman case now in private practice 
sec enforement director william mclucas declined to comment on 
the decisions impact saying the commission was disappointed but 
still reviewing the case the government could ask for a full 
appeals court review or appeal to the supreme court 
lawyers said the decision erodes some power investigators had 
gained over insider trading they said without a statutory 
definition the government was leaving the door open to future 
cases that will chip away at its authority 
they ought to define it as a matter of criminal law said 
don buchwald who defended former wall street journal reporter r 
foster winans in a 1985 insider trading case fairness requires 
you have a definition especially if youre going to put people in 
jail 
but congress repeatedly has resisted efforts to define insider 
trading on the theory that pinpointing illegal behavior would leave 
loopholes for abuse a lack of consensus about a law also has been 
cited 
chestman was convicted by a jury on 31 counts of fraud last year 
and spent about 10 months in federal prison before his release 
wednesday 
two congressional aides to committees that oversee the sec said 
it was too soon to tell whether the chestman case would resurrect a 
movement to define insider trading the most recent attempt was in 
1988 when congress stiffened insider trading penalties 
the appeals court nullified rule 14e3 which allowed 
prosecutors broad leeway to chase insider trading in a corporate 
takeovers a situation that often caused a target companys stock 
price to jump the rule was designed to attack wrongdoing that 
didnt necessarily involve a company directly 
other sec rules already made clear that individuals with 
responsibilities to a company including employees management 
directors lawyers and other advisers could not trade on 
marketsensitive information about it 
columbia university law professor john c coffee jr said that 
under the added rule it was enough to show that the individual 
had reason to believe the information came from a source either 
within the bidder or the target 
the rule was used in key wall street civil and criminal fraud 
cases including the original case against former junk bond 
financier michael milken though not in his plea bargain admitting 
securities and tax fraud last month 
besides the rule 14e3 question the appeals court ruled that 
chestman heard no more than family gossip when the husband of 
the daughter of the sister of waldbaums family patriarch told him 
the company would be sold

apparel retailers got a lift during april as the arrival of 
easter and spring weather brought consumers back into the stores 
many stores that had a disappointing march fared better last 
month according to figures released thursday by several of the 
nations biggest retailers 
woolworth corp whose sales had fallen in march compared with a 
year earlier had an 182 percent sales gain in april at stores 
open at least a year and a 211 percent increase overall 
results from stores open a year or longer known as same or 
comparablestore sales give a more accurate reading of a 
retailers performance 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer reported 
a 31 percent samestore sales increase and 16 percent overall 
gain 
most of sears improvement was due to clothing sales not the 
companys wellknown line of appliances and other durable goods 
said monroe greenstein a retail industry analyst with bear stearns 
amp co 
consumers still burdened by high installment debt were again 
cautious about major expenditures but they were willing to pick up 
new clothes greenstein said this trend which has been in place 
for several years would continue until later in 1990 
retail sales are closely watched not only as a gauge of the 
industrys health and that of individual companies but also as an 
economic barometer consumer spending accounts for about twothirds 
of the gross national product 
changes in the calendar such as easter falling on april 9 this 
year and on march 26 last year often have an impact on retail 
sales and affect yeartoyear comparisons by inflating results in 
some months 
however after accounting for the shift the industrys results 
in april were generally favorable said jeffrey feiner a retail 
analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
analysts consider march and april sales together in assessing 
how well a store has performed 
among other retailers announcing april results thursday 
walmart stores inc reported a 7 percent increase in 
samestore sales while overall results were up 20 percent 
jc penney co inc had a disappointing month after a much 
stronger march penneys samestore sales fell 28 percent while 
overall sales were off 17 percent 
greenstein said penneys sales looked bleaker than they actually 
were because they were compared against especially strong results 
in april 1989 when the company ran special sales promotions 
melville corp which runs specialty chains including thom 
mcan kaybee and cvs said its overall sales rose 219 percent 
melville did not release samestore figures 
other major retailers including dayton hudson corp and may 
department stores co are expected to release their sales figures 
next thursday analysts said it appeared these companies which 
own some of the countrys biggest department store chains would 
report favorable results 
k mart corp the nations biggest discount chain and limited 
inc the largest specialty apparel retailer also are expected to 
announce results next week 
the figures released thursday differ from the federal 
governments monthly retail sales report besides stores the 
governments figures include sales at a range of establishments 
from auto dealerships and supermarkets to restaurants and movie 
theaters

cosmetics giant avon products inc is under 
pressure from its shareholders to either drop a key takeover 
defense or put it to a vote 
shareholders approved two nonbinding proposals thursday at 
their annual meeting relating to the companys share rights plans 
commonly known as poison pills that can make unsolicited buyout 
bids prohibitively expensive 
the company has been in turmoil for more than a year as it found 
buyers for its health care business and a fragrance company while 
improving the profitability of the direct selling business on which 
it was founded 
it struck a deal with a large investor group that resulted in 
putting two of the groups representatives on its board and the 
formation of a committee to explore the companys alternatives 
which include more asset sales a recapitalization or outright sale 
of the company 
avon management opposed both shareholder proposals on its share 
rights plans and favors keeping the company independent while 
pursuing its own plan for sales and earnings growth by focusing on 
direct selling 
one proposal urged the company to either drop the rights plan or 
submit it to a shareholder vote the second urged a vote on the 
plan 
both passed with nearly 254 million shares in favor more than 
167 million opposed and more than 167 million abstaining 
the united shareholders association a washington dcbased 
advocacy group said it was behind one of the proposals 
avons management would be foolish not to implement proposals 
that so clearly expressed the will of the shareholders said 
association director ralph whitworth 
in trading on the new york stock exchange avon fell 75 cents a 
share to 3637 
the shareholders also elected four directors to the avon board 
including two nominees representing the investor group chartwell 
associates lp chartwell owns 12 percent of avons voting stock and 
had planned to run a slate of candidates for the four open seats on 
the 11member board 
but under a settlement reached in late march avon agreed to 
support two chartwell nominees along with two incumbent directors 
for the four seats that were up for election those nominees were 
elected thursday 
in addition avon agreed to set up a committee to consider ways 
of boosting value for avon stockholders the committee will include 
four avon directors and executives and the two new board members 
from chartwell m anthony fisher and marc leland 
the settlement also called for the appointment of john p 
rochon a principal in the chartwell group as an avon advisor once 
he resigns as vice chairman of mary kay cosmetics avons 
dallasbased rival 
james e preston chairman and chief executive of avon said 
negotiations are continuing on how much rochon will be paid and 
said there was no financial settlement at all with chartwell 
preston said he did not feel avon had a hostile relationship 
with chartwell which also includes members of the fisher real 
estate family of new york and gordon p getty the oil heir 
avon recently voted to lower the threshold of its rights plan to 
make one element of it effective when an outsider buys 125 percent 
of its stock rather than the previous 20 percent 
the action came after chartwell disclosed it had raised its 
voting stake in avon to 12 percent from 75 percent chartwell won 
a court order against the avon board on the threshold increase 
avon has appealed 
preston told about 400 people gathered for the meeting at the 
museum of natural history that avon was making progress by focusing 
on its core business 
he said avon would push ahead with plans to sell its 60 percent 
interest in avon japan by the end of the year an earlier proposal 
to sell the stake to tokyobased friends of freesia ltd for 450 
million fell through 
asked why avon was getting out of japan while other companies 
were scrambling to get in preston said avon japans market niche 
is in danger of being eroded by bigger companies and would require 
large investments to defend 
we are better off selling that business and cashing out today 
and reinvesting in markets where we can grow faster he said

those supermarket tabloid headlines may have to 
get even wilder to hold their own against tv in the checkout aisle 
cable giant turner broadcasting system inc and actmedia a 
marketing firm specializing in promotions in the store said 
thursday they are teaming up to design a tv service for shoppers 
lined up to bag and pay for their groceries 
the checkout channel will feature news sports and other 
speciallytailored programming plus advertising on tv monitors 
placed above each checkout aisle 
turner and actmedia plans to test the service this summer 
launch it nationally in early 1991 and install it in 5000 
supermarkets by mid1992 
wayne w locurto chief executive and president of actmedia 
said the service should help advertisers reach 30 million to 40 
million people each week while making the wait in the checkout line 
more enjoyable for shoppers 
if the plan works it would be the latest commercial 
encroachment into places that formerly were beyond the reach of 
television advertisers 
in recent months media companies either have introduced or 
announced plans to develop commercial tv programs designed to reach 
teens in the classroom women at the beauty salon and patients in 
the doctors waiting room 
there will be a few people to complain but we believe the 
overwhelming majority of people will like it locurto said in a 
telephone interview 
its informative entertaining and its going to make their 
wait seem to go quicker he said 
atlantabased turner broadcasting has agreed to create 
speciallytailored programs of news sports business weather and 
consumer information taken mainly from its headline news cable 
network each eightminute program will include 2 minutes of 
commercials 
the programs will be delivered by satellite 24 hours a day to 
participating stores which will be equipped with tv monitors above 
each checkout aisle 
actmedia plans to provide the tv sets and the satellite hardware 
locurto said the sets will be designed so that the sound shuts 
off unless someone approaches within a halfdozen feet or so of the 
monitor 
but once someone gets that close there will be no way to shut 
the set off or adjust the volume he said 
he said the programs are being broken into eightminute shows 
roughly the same amount of time as the average wait in a checkout 
line 
turner and actmedia plan to test the system from august through 
october in 12 stores in six cities although they would not name 
the cities locurto said plans are to begin a national service in 
the first quarter of 1991 and said he hopes to have the checkout 
channel in 5000 of the nations 30000 supermarkets by mid1992 
locurto declined to give the cost of launching the system or the 
relative investments of turner and actmedia in the venture 
actmedia expects to generate about 100 million a year in 
revenue from the the two minutes of advertising time it sells on 
each eightminute program while turner will get to keep proceeds 
from the ads in the remaining halfminute 
locurto said actmedia will share some of its revenue with 
supermarkets advertisers will be asked to pay rates roughly 
equivalent to those charged on daytime television 
ad time will be sold for terms of a year or more with an annual 
rate of about 12 million for a 15second ad in each show once the 
system is in 5000 stores 
actmedia based in darien conn and a unit of heritage media 
corp of dallas texas was founded in 1973 and is the leader in 
instore marketing programs it operates couponing and sampling 
programs and places advertising on shopping carts aisle 
directories and store shelves in 20000 supermarkets

gms total vehicle sales were up 52 percent in the april 2130 
period and fords gained 78 percent but chrysler reported a 254 
percent decline the nations no 3 automaker said car sales 
dropped 338 percent in the period and light truck sales were down 
165 percent 
industry sales are still at a fragile pace said scott 
merlis auto industry analyst at morgan stanley amp co in new york 
sales of the transplants vehicles made a japaneseowned 
factories in the united states rose 165 percent for the period to 
a combined average sales rate of 5135 a day for the year through 
the end of april transplant sales were up a sharp 394 percent 
the latest figures may show the beginning of a rally for the 
worlds no 1 automaker said analyst jack kirnan of kidder 
peabody amp co in new york i have a feeling that gms market 
share may have effectively bottomed out 
and kirnan said ford may report stronger increases as its new 
ford escort and mercury tracer compacts still scarce on dealers 
lots become easier for customers to find 
he blamed much of chryslers plunge on the companys move to 
deemphasize fleet sales which he pointed out will hurt sales 
numbers but could help the companys bottom line 
chairman lee iacocca has said chrysler would cut down on 
business with company rental and other fleets though the high 
volume low profit margin business helps sales figures it adds 
little to earnings 
for the year to date big three car and truck sales ran 61 
percent behind last year with car sales lagging 86 percent and 
truck sales down 23 percent 
that left total domestic car and light truck sales down 32 
percent for the year 
sales of imported cars and trucks were down 107 percent for 
april and down 58 percent for the year in part reflecting the 
substitution by japanese car companies of domestically made 
vehicles

last year and truck sales gained 76 percent gm car sales since 
january were down 48 percent while truck sales for the year were

behind last years and truck sales lagged 62 percent

higherthanexpected first quarter earnings for 
the big three automakers may mean they are coming out of a severe 
recession analysts say 
earnings reported thursday by general motors corp and ford 
motor co combined with those released tuesday by chrysler corp 
were down 64 percent compared with the same three months of last 
year 
the decline fell short of wall street analysts predictions of a 
cumulative drop of more than 75 percent 
its almost like the auto industry was going through its own 
inventory recession in the first quarter and in a sense its 
coming out of its own selfcreated recession in the second 
quarter analyst david healy of barclaysbzw of new york said 
analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co said signs of 
recovery although welcome were relative 
when you go from a depression to a recession its a nice 
improvement he said 
each of the big three laid part of the blame for lower profits 
on severe production cuts they instituted in january to help reduce 
inventories which had built to a high 90sellingday level at the 
end of last year 
the production reduction coupled with increased incentives 
knocked inventories down to the 65day range considered good for 
this time of year 
but the twopronged attack combined with economic and labor 
problems overseas ate into profits 
fords overseas earnings were hammered by strikes in europe and 
economic problems in brazil 
i think we are going to see a material drag on fords earnings 
from brazil in the second quarter largely because there has been no 
production there since the 15th of march analyst john kirnan of 
kidder peabody amp co said 
on that day ford shut down its autolatina plant after the 
government froze most savings in an attempt halt inflation that was 
running at an annual rate of more than 4000 percent 
the plant is back in operation but it will take time for it to 
gear up production to preshutdown levels 
gm which declined to detail regional operations said it set 
record overseas profits but also had been hurt in brazil although 
to a smaller extent than ford 
gm spokesman terry sullivan said the effects of brazils 
economic problems may show up later for gm 
chrysler has few overseas operations 
the big three said they earned 129 billion in the quarter 
down from 354 billion from the yearago period combined revenues 
fell 11 percent to 6127 billion 
gm said it earned 710 million or 102 per share of common 
stock on revenues of 3011 billion compared with 155 billion 
or 237 a share on revenues of 3324 billion in the yearago 
period 
ford said it made 5062 million or 110 a share compared 
with 164 billion or 344 a share a year ago revenues fell 9 
percent to 236 billion from 2587 billion 
earlier in the week chrysler reported earnings of 71 million 
down 80 percent from the yearago period 
through the first quarter of this year big three car and truck 
sales were 36 percent behind last years pace figures for january 
through april released thursday showed sales of big three north 
americanmade vehicles slid to 61 percent behind last years pace 
the companies also said increased incentive costs during the 
quarter chewed up profits

an agreement by opec members to jointly curb 
overproduction wont provide a quick fix for the oil market where 
prices continue to sag analysts say 
in fact the markets initial reaction to the accord reached 
thursday was to push prices decisively lower in fairly heavy 
trading 
the market may have been looking for more than opec was 
willing to give said peter beutel an energy analyst for elders 
futures inc in new york it came out looking like another of 
these vaguely unsatisfying agreements 
the cartels 13 members came out of a twoday emergency session 
with an accord to cut total output by 1455 million barrels a day 
for the next three months 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries hope the 
cutback will help prices recover to the groups minimum reference 
price of 18 a barrel set in november 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil fell to 1590 a barrel in london late thursday after 
opecs anouncement that was down 55 cents from late wednesday 
the markets shaky confidence that opec would actually deliver 
the promised cut was undermined in one fell swoop by a comment 
from the united arab emirates oil minister said peter gignoux 
manager of the international energy desk at shearson lehman hutton 
inc in london 
selling then begets selling gignoux said of the markets 
reaction 
the uae minister mana saeed otaiba said on leaving the meeting 
that his country would cut its oil production to 19 million 
barrels a day from 21 million barrels 
the statement caused industry analysts to doubt the persian gulf 
countrys commitment to lowering output because they estimate the 
uaes actual production already is at 19 million barrels 
at best analysts predicted the cartel will muster a total 
reduction of 1 million barrels 
overproduction by the united arab emirates saudi arabia and 
kuwait has caused a worldwide oil glut just as demand traditionally 
eases in the second quarter analysts say 
since about midmarch the price of west texas intermediate 
crude oil has seesawed above 20 a barrel back down to nearly 16 
up again to almost 1950 and then back down again to 18 
the june contract for wti the benchmark grade of us crude 
fell 69 cents thursday to settle at 1799 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
although recent oil price movements have been violent 
gignoux said were not talking disaster and i dont think 
anybody in the marketplace feels we are heading for an 85 86 
situation he was referring to the price collapse a few years ago 
that sent prices plunging to below 10 a barrel 
this is simply an indication of second quarter weakness and 
oversupply gignoux said 
analysts say increased demand and a slowdown in production from 
the north sea and alaska should boost prices later in the year 
i think we have to wait for winter restocking and winter 
demand to turn things around said geoff pyne an analyst with 
ubs phillips and drew in london 
opec president sadek boussena said opecs quota violators were 
to contribute most of the cutback by returning to their official 
output ceilings all members will participate in the reduction 
though he added 
opec pumped 235 million barrels a day in april boussena said 
well above the cartels official ceiling of 221 million barrels 
for the first half of the year 
the cartel postponed its regular midyear session for a month to 
july 25 when it will rethink its output and pricing policy for the 
remainder of 1990

america west airlines says it has made no deal 
to take over some of the domestic business of twa but industry 
analysts say the young lean carrier might have what it takes to 
make such a deal work 
twa chairman carl icahn said this week that the smaller company 
might be just the cure his lossmaking domestic airline operation 
needs america west which is nonunion may make profits where he 
cannot icahn said 
the company which was founded in 1983 has a reputation for low 
costs ontime service clean planes and a very aggressive business 
stance 
america west chairman edward r beauvais and president michael 
j conway said in a joint statement thursday that there have been 
talks but no deals have been struck 
it is well known that there are airlines in the united states 
that are considering the disposal of various assets and we have 
been contacted to determine our level of interest the statement 
said 
as a matter of policy it continued we do not respond to 
speculation regarding potential transactions accordingly we will 
not comment further on these or any other possible transactions 
until such time as there is relevant and concrete information to 
announce 
paul h nisbet senior airline analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york said america west had a very 
lowcost structure 
he added it may be able to capitalize on a motivated work 
force its bust or boom with that kind of an operation and right 
now they are booming theyre aggressive as hell 
analysts also said the airline had a reputation for clean new 
planes and customer service america west ranks first in federal 
ontime performance tests 
icahn and officials of the twa pilots and machinists unions 
met tuesday with officers of america west at the icahn amp co 
headquarters in mount kisco ny 
at the meeting icahn said he would not need cash from the 
smaller airline instead america west would simply take over his 
domestic operations leaving him with twas international routes 
which he considers much more valuable 
america west has 12000 employees and 92 planes with gross 
revenue of 9934 million last year it was designated as a 
major airline it has hubs in phoenix and las vegas nev 
nisbet said the airline was pushing hard for expansion into the 
pacific rim narrowly losing a recent bid on a hawaiitotokyo 
route it also bid on the eastern airlines shuttle between boston 
new york and washington which was sold to developer donald trump 
last year and expressed interest in the shuttle again last week 
after trump suggested he might sell it 
so they are looking in every direction he said 
but nisbet cautioned the company is highly leveraged carrying 
a proportionately high level of debt that means substantial cash 
investments could be difficult he said 
still nisbet said america west could restore profitability to 
twas domestic operations 
they are i think very wellmanaged and they have a very 
smooth labormanagement situation something that carl icahn hasnt 
found out how to achieve nisbet said 
news of the possible takeover by a nonunion airline did nothing 
to improve those labor relations 
kent scott leader of the twa pilots union said his requests 
for financial details have gone unanswered 
from what i see the proposal doesnt make any sense he 
said he dismissed the negotiations as a pressure tactic 
twa lost 300 million last year and had to pay 366 million in 
interest on debts of 25 billion 
icahn has asked the pilots for wage concessions of 10 percent 
he has promised to buy up to 100 new jets in return for the 
concessions the alternative icahn said is to shrink the 
airline through deals like one with america west

environmentalists are praising the senate 
agriculture committee for toughening conservation efforts on farms 
through the 1990 farm bill 
its a major step forward ken cook of the center for 
resource economics said thursday after the committee finished work 
on the conservation section of legislation that will set 
agriculture policy for the next five years 
were very pleased with the way the committee has responded to 
environmental concerns said cook who lobbied for tougher 
standards 
committee chairman patrick leahy dvt said the bill is good 
for both the environment and farmers this new title 
significantly strengthens the conservation provisions of current 
law he said 
leahy said the 1985 farm bill signaled a new attitude in 
congress about the important role our farmers play in preserving 
the environment they also set the standard by which the 1990 farm 
bill will be judged 
most of the provisions were approved wednesday but one of the 
stickiest the section on wetlands was passed out of committee 
thursday 
it actually eases up on farmers in some ways 
current law strips a farmer of his or her federal subsidies if 
wetlands are drained and planted with crops 
if the new measure becomes law violators would be fined 750 to 
10000 and required to restore the wetland the farmer would be 
removed from federal crop programs after a second offense 
the farmer would have his record expunged after 10 years and 
return to firsttime violator status if wetlands are drained again 
sen kent conrad dnd voted against the wetlands measure 
because he felt farmers sometimes make innocent mistakes and the 
potential for abuse by regulators under the legislation was too 
high 
the new measure also allows drainage of land that has been 
extensively farmed but still has wetland characteristics if the 
drainage would have minimal effect on wetland values 
most of the time a farmer would have to restore another piece 
of property to prevent net wetland loss 
a provision that toughens current wetland policy outlaws the 
draining of land if the intention is to make it available for 
planting at some time under the law enacted in 1985 a farmer has 
to actually plant on the drained land to be a violator 
enforcement of federal wetland policy is conducted by the soil 
conservation service and the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service fish and wildlife service agents make reports 
when they see lands in use that are supposed to remain in a wet 
condition 
wetlands are important not only as habitats for wildlife but as 
natural filters for pollutants only about half the countrys 
original wetlands still exist and the government is fighting to 
save them 
conservation measures adopted by the committee wednesday 
included 
enrollment of at least 40 million acres by 1995 in a program 
that pays farmers not to plant in order to protect highly erodible 
land marginal pasturelands windbreaks and vegetation planted for 
wildlife 
payments to farmers who enroll in a new program to reduce water 
contamination by cutting back on fertilizers and chemicals that 
cause pollution 
technical assistance from the agriculture department to help 
farmers meet state and federal environmental standards 
purchase of wetlands from farmers 
requirements that farmers keep records of pesticides they use 
assistance to states that want to protect farms from being 
converted to other uses 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee rep kika de la 
garza dtexas introduced conservation legislation thursday with 
many provisions similar to the senate bill hearings on it will be 
held later

advertisers think a new program video 
power will keep kids glued to their television sets a tv 
watchdog group thinks the show may be bending the law 
although video power is not on the air yet action for 
childrens television the bostonbased advocacy group complained 
about the show to the federal communications commission on thursday 
acts filing with the fcc was prompted by a report in mondays 
wall street journal that commercials would be inserted into video 
power so seamlessly that young viewers wouldnt be able to tell 
where the ads begin and the program leaves off 
the journal said the halfhour syndicated show planned to air 
weekdays after school next fall would be hosted by a 14yearold 
named johnny arcade johnny the journal said will rattle 
off news items such as countdowns of top hits in video games 
sandwiched in the minutelong countdowns will be 10second or 
20second commercials without so much as a pause between the news 
and the commercial 
act thinks the show as described violates fcc rules that require 
tv producers to clearly distinguish advertising in kids shows and 
that prohibit a shows host from peddling products 
we are requesting a public notice from the fcc to 
investigate the trend in childrens tv which blatantly ignores 
existing fcc policy act attorney donna lampert said in an 
interview 
the show also will include interviews with videogame champions 
and will feature cartoons with characters from current video games 
some of those characters are based on video games from acclaim 
entertainment inc which is buying 20 percent of the shows 
commercial time the journal said 
were ecstatic about the format acclaim executive anthony 
williams told the newspaper children change channels during 
commercials for one thing their concentration span is shorter 
than that of adults this we think is a good way for both 
producer and advertiser to sidestep that problem 
attempts to locate acclaim entertainment or the producers of 
video power were not successful thursday 
the fcc in 1984 lifted rules that limited the amount of 
advertising that may be shown during childrens shows at the same 
time however the commission reaffirmed its 1974 rules on host 
selling and adprogram separation in childrens shows 
in its 1974 ruling the commission said young children lack 
the necessary sophistication to appreciate the nature and purpose 
of advertising 
efforts are under way in congress to restore ad limits on kids 
shows 10 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on 
weekdays 
the journal also said corporations increasingly are promoting 
their products in movies or home videos 
mcdonalds corp has sold about 250000 copies of a 30minute 
mctreasure island video in which ronald mcdonald and pals step 
into the robert lewis stevenson classic treasure island to 
help save jim hawkins from long john silver and aid in finding the 
treasure the newspaper said 
motion picture companies also reap substantial fees for using 
advertisers products in their movies 
the fcc does not regulate videos or movies

the soviet union has emerged as a stunning new 
market for broilers and may edge out japan this year as the 
traditional no 1 foreign market for us poultry according to 
agriculture department analysts 
more than 110 million pounds of broiler leg quarters were sold 
to the soviet union recently by us companies a sale worth an 
estimated 50 million 
the soviets began buying us broilers last fall for the first 
time in years according to the departments economic research 
service the 1989 sales involved about 26 million pounds 
usda economist larry witucki said in a telephone interview 
thursday that moscow has bought around 260 million pounds of us 
broilers so far in calendar 1990 those could have a value in the 
range of 100 million to 150 million 
i would say the soviets are going to surpass the japanese 
this year witucki said the japanese market is growing but 
not that fast 
the soviet union has been buying us grain for years and is 
apparently is committed to remain a major buyer for the long haul 
can broiler producers expect similar demand from chickenhungry 
kremlin leaders 
witucki said the soviet broiler market is characterized by large 
potential and large uncertainty its hard to tell at the moment 
what may happen he said 
japan topped the list of us broiler markets overseas at 233 
million pounds in calendar 1989 which witucki said was a downward 
revision from 3399 million pounds initially reported by us 
customs the soviets already have passed that mark for 1990 
witucki said 1989 us customs figures for broiler exports to 
hong kong currently shown at 2066 million pounds are under 
review for possible errors 
other big foreign markets include mexico canada singapore 
jamaica spain and french polynesia 
overall subject to revision the usda figures published in a 
current outlook report show broiler exports rose to a record value 
of about 441 million in 1989 up 15 percent from 1988 
another broiler export record is expected in 1990 because 
sales to japan and other pacific rim markets will likely remain 
strong said the report which was written prior to the recent 
new sale to the soviets 
it added although exports could decline to mexico and canada 
where production is expected to increase the ussr and some 
eastern european countries will become a major new market 
in a related report the departments foreign agricultural 
service says the soviet union and eastern europe represent 
substantial market opportunities for us meat and poultry 
exporters 
if goals for meat consumption are to be met domestic and 
imported supplies will have to increase a main thrust will be in 
rising demand for improved livestock breeding and technology 
the report said average soviet citizens spend 50 percent to 60 
percent of their takehome salary of 200 rubles per month 330 
for food

thailand is one of the few developing 
countries with a substantial food surplus says an agriculture 
department report and that is important to us farmers 
in the last 20 years the southeast asian country of 56 million 
people has established itself as a strong competitor in world feed 
grain markets the report said 
recent years have shown thailand to be the worlds largest rice 
exporter the fifthlargest corn exporter and an important exporter 
of sorghum all commodities that rank highly as us exports 
but thailand also is boosting livestock output according to the 
report by sara j schwartz and douglas h brooks of the 
departments economic research service looking ahead to the turn 
of the century that raises some possibilities 
under a moderate growth scenario developed for the study 
thailands rice and poultry meat exports may increase 
substantially by the year 2000 other livestock also are likely 
to increase 
thus according to the report thailands corn exports could 
decline significantly over the next decade as more feed is needed 
for livestock 
expectations of thailands falling corn exports and rapidly 
rising imports of oilseed meal for highprotein animal feed can 
create important market opportunities for us corn and soybean 
meal exporters the report said however the united states may 
face increasing competition in world rice and poultry meat 
markets 
the projections showed thailands poultry meat production could 
more than double by 2000 as domestic and export demands increase 
pork production also could more than double if incomes continue 
to rise and marketing constraints are relaxed the report said

genentech inc a 
biotechnology firm under investigation by the securities and

routine audit of donald trumps financial empire while the tycoons 
newest casino hired an independent auditor to examine bills of 
contractors angry about not getting paid 
new jersey gaming enforcement director anthony parrillo said 
thursday that such a review by his agency is normal and that 
it hasnt looked at trumps operations for a long time

said 
the review will include all the billionaire develpers holdings 
in and outside of atlantic city he said 
about 100 contractors involved in the 1 billion taj mahal 
casino resort have gone to the state casino control commission in 
an effort to get paid 
the contractors who claim trump owes them 35 million are 
angry because they pushed to meet the casinos april 2 opening date 
based on promises they would be paid in full 
some also charged that trump has withheld payment he faces a 
cashflow problem 
the audit announced thursday will examine labor costs time 
and material payment requests change orders and expense

holdings including manhattan real estate and the trump shuttle 
airline to raise cash 
tracy said withholding payment until completion of the audit is 
a common practice in the construction business 
theres nothing unusual about this except the size of the 
project tracy said

stockbrokers want the government to 
compensate them from the losses they expect to incur as a result of 
a planned reform of the brussels stock exchange officials said 
friday 
the association for the defense of the stockbroking profession 
which represents about 75 percent of the brussels exchanges 
stockbrokers told the government in a memorandum that minimum 
capital requirements and other measures would inevitably entail 
the disappearance of a certain number of stock houses 
in addition to setting minimum capital requirements for brokers 
the reforms will open the exchange to banks and other financial 
institutions tighten rules on insider trading and give more power 
to the belgian banking commission the stock exchange watchdog 
the state which has promoted this reform must indemnify 
these stockbrokers for the loss of their profession and for the 
loss of professional revenues they will sustain the memo states 
the reforms are part of governments plan to update belgiums 
antiquated financial markets to better compete once the european 
community melds into a single market in 1992

grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade after opening 
stronger amid talk of a large sale of us corn to the soviet union 
there was no confirmation of rumors that the soviets bought as 
much as 3 million metric tons of corn overnight grain traders have 
become extrasensitive to talk of large export sales since the 
agriculture department on wednesday offered to subsidize sales of 2 
million tons of wheat to china 
analysts said prices retreated when the soviet purchase was not 
confirmed and amid drenching rains in the midwestern corn and 
soybean belt 
the rain should be welcomed by farmers who have had about two 
weeks of nearly unbroken dry weather in which to begin their spring 
planting 
in early trading wheat futures prices were unchanged to 1 cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in may at 373 a bushel 
corn was unchanged to cent lower with may at 285 a bushel

it takes more than a rise in the dow jones 
industrial average right now to keep many a stock market investor 
from feeling low 
if you use the dow average as a gauge stock prices have been 
holding their ground of late within about 5 percent of the record 
high they reached in the first session of 1990 
but the picture looks less rosy if you examine it by the light 
of several other less publicized statistical measures that take a 
broader sample of stocks into account 
this divergence in the parlance of wall street makes for 
hard times in the trading rooms of money managers at investing 
institutions where mission no 1 is often to try to beat the 
prominent market averages 
it isnt much of a morale booster either for individual 
investors when they see their own stockholdings losing value while 
the market is supposedly giving a good account of itself 
whats more some chartwatching analysts on the street contend 
divergences are a poor portent for the likely future behavior of 
the stock market in general 
the overwhelming majority of equities are moving lower while 
the major averages are held up by just a few of the bigcap large 
capitalization names says joseph feshbach at shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
the current condition of the market continues to deteriorate 
indicating that lower prices lie ahead 
at the end of april the dow jones industrials stood at 2645 
not a drastic distance below their peak reading of 2810 on jan 2 
over the last trading week of april by contrast 296 issues 
traded on the new york stock exchange hit new lows for the past 52 
weeks compared with just 27 new highs 
at the american stock exchange the new lows outnumbered the 
highs 104 to 17 in the nasdaq system for overthecounter stocks 
the margin was 416 to 136 
its very rare to see a long string of more new lows than new 
highs with the dow close to its high observed stan weinstein in 
his investment advisory letter the professional tape reader 
the few prior times that its occurred early september 1987 
late juneearly july 1981 and early january 1973 all foreshadowed 
serious market declines 
adds martin zweig in his zweig forecast letter the 
divergences between the bluechip dow and the average stock keep 
yawning wider ever increasing the risk 
to explain why this kind of disparity troubles them so much 
many wall streeters resort to a military metaphor when the army of 
soldiers isnt enthusiastically keeping in step with the 
generals the battle may well be lost 
one historical precedent for just such a defeat occurred in the 
severe bear market of 197374 when the select few favorite 50 
growth stocks of that era came toppling down along with their more 
obscure counterparts 
to at least a few resolute optimists however the outcome need 
not be so negative this time after all they contend dont the 
present figures suggest that stocks are a lot cheaper than they 
might appear at a superficial glance 
in the view of martin sass chairman of the new york money 
management firm of md sass investor services the circumstances 
have set up some potential bargains among small growth stocks and 
industrial companies considered sensitive to the ups and downs of 
the business cycle 
the poor showing of the cyclical stocks in the past year or so 
was only partly justified by deteriorating fundamentals sass 
maintains furthermore he says there is growing evidence that 
the manufacturing recession has now bottomed out

guarantee to anyone walking past his display booth at whats billed 
as the worlds largest convention of inventions 
youll never have to tie your tie again he said 
to demonstrate his claim cecil tugged at a knot in his silk tie 
as if to loosen it but instead of one end of the fabric slipping 
out of the knot the tie itself zipped open 
once you start wearing one youll never go back to tying a 
tie its the perfect tieless tie said cecil who represents 
zippertie enterprises a pittsburgh company marketing the tie for a 
midwestern inventor he declined to identify 
cecil pulled again on his tie this time on the short end and 
the zipper hidden in the knot closed up 
a perfect doublewindsor knot he said 
cecil and hundreds of other promoters and inventors gathered 
thursday at the monroeville expo mart near pittsburgh for the 
inventionnew product exposition billed as the worlds largest 
among other items displayed were a portable fire escape that can 
be anchored inside a window a trap designed to lure fleas off a 
carpet and a device to repel mosquitoes with sound waves 
the start of the threeday exhibition also included the 
unveiling of a waterpowered engine created by yoshiro nakamatsu 
who became known as the edison of japan after inventing the 
computer floppy disk and the digital watch 
nakamatsu said his pollutionfree engine called enerex runs on 
tap water alone and can create three times the power of a standard 
gasoline engine 
it will generate electricity for any purpose he said 
petroleum will exhaust in 100 years 
he said he will modify the engine and build a special vehicle 
powered by it 
nakamatsu displayed some of his other inventions including 
packages of brain food which he said contains good 
elements to encourage clear thinking the snack food which 
tastes something like seaweed is sold in japan 
nakamatsu 62 said listening to beethovens fifth symphony and 
swimming have helped him maintain the creativity that helped him 
obtain more than 2000 patents in the united states and japan 
my best place to create inventions is under the water he 
said so i swim every day 
others said necessity is indeed the mother of invention 
ken wittman said his sore left shoulder prompted him to invent a 
guitar strap that hangs on his right shoulder the strap also 
allows the guitar to be worn by right and lefthanded musicians 
and spins all the way around 
and if you cant play at all you can get their attention 
he said 
kirk renaud vice president of designtech international inc

outgoing savings and loan bailout chief l 
william seidman showered with congressional praise today 
cautioned legislators not to expect miracles from his successor 
dont be impatient this is a long hard job it isnt going to 
be accomplished anytime soon seidman told a house banking task 
force on the sampl bailout 
the real pain of what is taking place on everything from 
increased government borrowing to the effect on real estate 
markets is still being felt i think it is very important that no 
one expect by this time next year well all feel great he said 
president bush is turning to william taylor the federal reserve 
boards director of bank supervision to take over from seidman 
who recommended that choice 
if nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate 
taylor would become chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
and the resolution trust corp the fdic insures bank and thrift 
institution deposits while the rtc conducts the sampl cleanup 
taylor 50 got a cautious welcome from task force members they 
praised his experience and ability but some questioned whether he 
would share seidmans willingness to speak out independently about 
the rising cost of the bailout and other conflicts with the 
administration 
i worry about the independence of the fdic and the rtc i 
worry about future policy decisions driven by political spin 
control said rep bruce vento dminn chairman of the task 
force 
rep charles schumer dny called taylor a superb choice 
but told seidman i think the administration should be on its 
hands and knees begging you to stay 
he said taylors talents will be wasted unless the president 
puts a higher priority on the sampl cleanup 
in a statement thursday sen donald w riegle jr dmich 
chairman of the senate banking committee said id like to see 
bill seidman finish his term next year should he leave any 
nominee would require the thorough assessment of a formal 
confirmation process 
ventos panel was conducting a hearing today with seidman as a 
witness on the progress of the bailout it is focusing on the slow 
pace so far in selling real estate loans and other assets the 
government has inherited from bankrupt thrifts 
seidman has said he would leave sometime after the rtc achieves 
its ambitious goal of closing or selling 140 sampls by the end of 
june however vento said a more important measure of progress will 
be whether the agency will avoid having to retain and warehouse 
most of the assets of the thrifts it is selling 
seidman 69 had said for some time that he did not plan to stay 
until his term ends in october 1991 but he had not indicated his 
resignation was imminent 
on tuesday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated the 
administration would not resist seidmans departure however the 
president on thursday disputed a newspaper report suggesting he had 
encouraged seidman to go 
its his initiative bush said i think seidman has 
conducted himself with extraordinary grace and great ability 
although he scored points with congress for his candor in 
revealing the bailouts soaring cost estimates seidman offended 
some administration officials particularly white house chief of 
staff john sununu and deputy treasury secretary john robson 
on the other hand taylor reportedly is wellregarded by 
treasury officials for his lowkey style since midfebruary he 
has been on leave from the federal reserve serving as chief staff 
officer of a treasuryled policy panel overseeing the rtc 
taylor has a reputation as a conservative regulator and was one 
of the most vigorous advocates of toughening capital standards in 
the thrift industry 
hes a safety and soundness man said kenneth guenther 
executive vice president of the independent bankers association of 
america 
beyond the enormous task of directing the disposal of more than 
300 billion in sampl assets taylor will find himself at the center 
of a clash next year between the administration and congress when 
the two sides try to come up with a way to fund a second 
installment of the bailout 
taylor declined to respond to a request for comment thursday 
government sources asking not to be named said taylor wants the 
fdicrtc chairmanship considered the nations preeminent bank 
regulatory post 
early this year he turned down an invitation to become director 
of the office of thrift supervision who serves under the treasury 
secretary the fdic chairman once appointed serves independently 
and cannot be removed by the president 
seidman in a telephone interview said he backed taylor because 
hes a very capable guy hes familiar with the situation and i 
have a lot of confidence in him 
the transition will take place in a very friendly manner when 
i think its the appropriate time seidman said

the new york stock exchange wants to fine the 
fallen brokerage drexel burnham lambert inc 25 million in 
connection with securities fraud and other crimes sources said 
friday 
the fine would be the largest ever imposed on a securities firm 
but whether the big board ever would collect is unclear drexel is 
liquidating after its parent company filed for bankruptcy court 
protection in february 
the nyse has the ability to levy fines against member firms and 
executives for violating exchange rules and securities laws the 
exchange has been mulling whether to fine drexel since the firm 
pleaded guilty to six felony crimes and agreed to pay 650 million 
in government penalties last year 
the nyse also is said to be considering brining separate 
disciplinary proceedings against drexel chief executive frederick 
h joseph and other top officers of the firm 
those charges would be in connection with the activities of the 
firm and its former junk bond leader michael milken who pleaded 
guilty last month to six separate felonies and agreed to pay 600 
million in penalties 
nyse spokesman richard torrenzano declined comment on whether 
the nyse was pursuing charges against drexel but he said drexel 
is the biggest regulatory problem by a member firm that weve had 
in the 200year history of the new york stock exchange 
the possible fine first was reported in todays editions of the 
wall street journal people with knowledge of the proceedings who 
asked not to be named confirmed the report 
in a statement drexel defended its compliance mechanisms 
saying its procedures were as good or better than other firms on 
the street and its transgressions chiefly involved verbal 
agreements that werent disclosed to the firm 
its clear that there were things that went wrong but the 
firm and its shareholderemployees have already paid dearly for 
them drexel said any further penalties would be added 
unnecessary punishment for creditors and shareholders and could be 
viewed simply as piling on 
we understand the stock exchanges need to project an image of 
being a strong regulator it said however that should be 
balanced with a sense of fairness in evaluting the companys and 
managements behavior 
the journal report said that the big board has stepped up its 
investigation of drexel in recent weeks and has subpoenaed several 
individuals to testify about drexels and milkens behavior 
the charges against joseph and other drexel officials that are 
being considered were said to include failure to properly supervise 
milken and others such charges could be important because they 
carry possible expulsion from the securities industry 
under stock exchange procedures drexel could challenge any 
sanction before an nyse hearing board the firm later could appeal 
any ruling to the nyse board of directors the securities and 
exchange commission or a federal appeals court

a weaker than expected employment report has 
stopped the drive for higher interest rates and should help the 
treasury find buyers for its quarterly sale of notes and bonds this 
week economists say 
fears that the economy was expanding too rapidly and threatening 
to drive inflation higher had gripped the credit markets in recent 
weeks driving longterm bond yields above 9 percent for the first 
time in nearly a year 
economic data in the past few weeks had supported that bearish 
scenario the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 85 
percent in the first quarter the fastest rate since the 
inflationary spiral at the start of the 1980s 
orders for durable goods a key benchmark for the economy 
surged 67 percent in march and purchasing managers reported that 
the manufacturing economy expanded for the first time in 11 months 
in april 
fridays jobs report from the labor department went a long way 
toward dissolving those fears however and should keep longterm 
rates below 9 percent economists say 
the nations unemployment rate ticked up to 54 percent in april 
from 52 percent in march the number of jobs grew by a slight 
64000 and would have shown a small decline if not for the 
temporary hiring of census workers factory payrolls fell by 
22000 the 12th drop in the last 13 months 
the best you can say about the manufacturing sector is its 
stopped shrinking said david h resler chief economist at 
nomura securities international inc 
as for the economy in general maybe its not on the brink of 
recession but its certainly not growing vigorously either he 
added 
mitchell held chief economist at smith barney harris upham amp 
co said the figures were especially encouraging in showing a 
continued slowdown in the growth of service sector employment that 
sector had been particularly resistant to the federal reserves 
effort to slow the economy 
whats more average hourly earnings rose a mere 03 percent in 
april or 3 cents to 995 an hour despite the 50 cent hike in the 
minimum wage to 385 an hour 
all those things together are really encouraging held said 
they should dispel worries that the fed might have to engineer a 
rise in interest rates to keep the economy and inflation in check 
the fed is probably going to keep policy steady he 
predicted 
manufacturers have reported greater price pressure for labor and 
materials in the first quarter as well as an increase in their 
selling prices said john d walter economist for dow corning 
corp and director of the national association of business 
economists industry survey 
nevertheless walter said consumer sticker shock and restrained 
growth in the money supply will cool inflation from the first 
quarter pace while strong capital spending is raising industrys 
capacity 
he sees the economy in a modest upturn with growth waffling 
between 1 percent and 3 percent over the next year in short the 
softlanding scenario of restrained growth without recession is 
still on track walter said 
that would be good news for a market that has to digest the 
treasurys auctions of 305 billion in three and 10year notes 
and 30year bonds from tuesday through thursday its also good 
news for the government 
resler estimates the employment report will enable the treasury 
to price the auctions at least an eighth of a percentage point 
lower than it otherwise would have say between 8 percent and 9 
percent for the long bond instead of 99lsqb percent 
that would save 250 million over the life of the three issues 
a nice little windfall for the treasury 
held says longterm bonds should settle into a trading range of 
8 percent to 9 percent down from a widely perceived 8 percent to 
9 percent before friday

the nations most powerful labor union 
reached agreement friday to cut its work week to 35 hours 
signalling a broad move toward more leisure time for workers in one 
of the worlds richest countries 
fridays pact worked out during tense allnight negotiations 
with an employers organization immediately affects about 700000 
factory workers in the state of badenwuerttemberg 
the precedent is expected to be followed as the ig metall 
metalworkers union negotiates contracts for the rest of the country 
west germans already have six weeks of vacation each year a 
sprinkling of about 10 holidays and legally guaranteed work breaks 
on the job 
for years the mighty ig metall union which negotiates 
contracts for 4 million workers in the metalworking automobile 
and related industries has demanded a reduction to 35 hours the 
current work week is 37 hours compared with 40 hours in 1985 
our dream goal has been reached said union president franz 
steinkuehler in frankfurt we wanted time and money and we got 
both 
the cut will come in two stages to 36 hours in april 1993 and 
35 hours in october 1995 while the agreement also calls for 6 
percent pay hike spread out over 12 months 
in frankfurt the printers union immediately said that it also 
will be seeking to cut hours to 35 a week 
i expect this compromise probably to be adopted nationwide 
said joerg barzcynski ig metall spokesman 
ig metall had staged warning strikes involving more than 300000 
workers and temporarily halting production at a few hundred west 
german plants this week 
steinkuehler promised a round of strikes to keep up pressure on 
employers in other parts of the country to reach agreements 
the compromise was reached in the key west german industrial 
area around the city of stuttgart which houses car and truck 
manufacturer daimlerbenz among other major companies 
west german politicians reacted critically to the compromise 
economics minister helmut haussman termed it a false signal 
ahead of german unification 
the unions are artifically restricting our most important 
production factor he said 
otto lambsdorff head of the coalition partner free democrats 
called the accord on the 35hour work week a speculative 
agreement about the future 
west german employers organizations repeatedly have said the 
trend toward less work and higher pay combined with the nations 
massive social security net is driving more businesses to cheaper 
countries in southern europe

tw services inc one of the nations largest 
food service companies said friday that it was dropping pepsicola 
co products from its 465 hardees restaurants 
cocacola co had been the primary supplier for those 
restaurants and will continue in that role the spartanburg 
scbased company said 
tw services is the largest franchisee of hardees food systems 
inc which owns or franchises 3300 restaurants nationwide and 
already counts cocacola as its primary soft drink syrup supplier 
as a hardees franchisee tw services was free to make its own 
arrangements on soft drinks for its restaurants 
earlier this week burger king corp said it planned to switch 
to cocacola as the soft drink supplier for its 5400 restaurants 
dumping pepsicola after an association of more than six years 
karen randall a spokeswoman for tw services said her companys 
465 hardees restaurants have been offering several cocacola 
drinks along with the pepsi brand and in some cases pepsis 
mountain dew 
but she said the company decided that consolidating its business 
with cocacola would improve operating efficiency 
she declined to say how much business pepsicola stands to lose 
as a result of the decision the changeover will take several 
months 
tw services said it also had designated cocacola as the primary 
supplier for its canteen contract food service operations 
the canteen division has more than 1600 accounts at sites 
ranging from school cafeterias to industrial vending machines some 
of which had been serving cocacola products along with other soft 
drinks the decision means canteen will be offering cocacola 
products more often the company said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
friday on the chicago board of trade with wheat futures up 
strongly soybeans lower and corn narrowly mixed 
the corn markets performance was surprising in light of strong 
indications the soviet union bought up to 2 million metric tons of 
us corn overnight or early friday analysts said 
they said buying linked to the soviet rumors was offset by heavy 
speculative fund selling 
the fact that corn closed mixed against all that selling is 
good from a bullish perspective said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc the fact that we couldnt rally 
corn more than we did is bad 
soybean futures extended the fairly steep losses posted 
thursday obliterating strong gains made in wednesdays session 
wheat futures surged late in the session possibly reflecting 
concerns about floodrelated harvest delays and damage to the 
winter wheat crop in eastern texas and oklahoma 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 4 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in may at 377 a bushel corn futures 
were cent lower to 1 cents higher with may at 287 a bushel 
oats were cent lower to cent higher with may at 166 a

trade ministers from three continents 
reported today they had failed to resolve several disputes that are 
threatening to scuttle an ambitious effort to reform the global 
trading system 
officials from the united states japan the 12nation european 
community and canada said at the conclusion of three days of talks 
that they had a frank exchange of views but remained far apart in 
many areas especially on the contentious issue of how to end 
expensive farm subsidies 
us trade representative carla hills said the talks were in the 
home stretch but she conceded that much work needed to be done 
the ministers did report some progress on bridging differences 
on some lowlevel issues such as how trade disputes should be 
handled but said sharp differences remained in the two key areas of 
agriculture subsidies and barriers to textile imports 
hills spoke at a sundrenched news conference held on the edge 
of a golf course at the resort where the talks were held 
the bush administration is counting on an agreement by the end 
of this year to lower americas huge trade deficit by expanding 
export opportunities for us farmers and businesses 
the american side is pushing to eliminate expensive farm export 
subsidies to dismantle barriers to trade in services such as 
banking and to crack down on copyright and patent piracy estimated 
to cost american firms 60 billion annually 
officials said they aim to draw up the general outline of an 
agreement during a bargaining session in geneva in late july and 
then work toward a final agreement in december 
the talks held under the auspices of the 97nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt are known as the uruguay 
round of free trade talks for the country where they were launched 
in 1986 
us trade representative carla hills who selected her home 
state of california for the meeting expressed satisfaction with 
what she termed a quite constructive session 
a senior us official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said the talks produced no major breakthroughs although 
he said they helped define the opposing positions 
all sides reported that the biggest dispute how to put an end 
to tradedistorting farm subsidies remained far from resolution 
as the european community held fast to its desire to protect a 
subsidy system for its network of small farms 
frans andriessen trade minister for the european community 
termed the discussions frank often a diplomatic code word for 
unfruitful talks 
many third world nations who were not represented at the napa 
meetings are battling the us proposals especially on lowering 
trade barriers for service industries they contend that their 
fledgling service companies should be protected from foreign 
concerns invading their markets 
canadian trade minister john crosbie said he would put the 
chances of successfully wrapping up the negotiations in december at 
little better than 50 percent 
but he said he was still hopeful because the consequences of 
failure are so horrific the alternative is the law of the 
jungle and only the largest beasts will survive and they wont 
survive very well 
hills sounded a similar theme contending that without a 
strengthened trade agreement both industrial and third world 
nations would suffer declining standards of living as trade flows 
contracted behind protectionist walls 
the administration is having to wage a dual war seeking to 
convince the europeans and developing countries to drop their 
opposition to the free trade proposals while fighting off efforts 
in congress to erect barriers protecting threatened us industries 
congress must approve any final agreement and the outcome of 
that debate is far from certain already special interest groups 
representing the textile industry and peanut and sugar growers are 
working to build congressional opposition to changes in gatt rules 
that would strip them of trade protections they now enjoy

cut their production by about 6 percent 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude oil fell 1 cent to close at 1798 a 42gallon barrel

gasoline advanced as the summer driving season approached and 
amid reports of shortages on the gulf coast heating oils decline 
was attributed to reduced demand during the spring and summer

announced it was cutting its production by 145 million barrels a 
day from 235 million barrels in april the cartels overproduction 
has brought oil prices down by 20 percent since january

substantial enough to relieve the glut of oil on world markets

donald trumps three casinos are 
being investigated in a financial review that state officials said 
friday was routine and had nothing to do with disgruntled 
contractors or the manhattan developers desire to sell some assets 
anthony j parrillo director of the state division of gaming 
enforcement said the review has been under way for two months 
such reviews are done periodically for each casino operator in 
atlantic city he said 
parrillos division is the investigative arm of the state casino 
control commission which oversees the gaming industry 
parrillo said it was coincidental that the review coincided with 
statements from trump last week that he was considering selling 
some of his holdings which include manhattan real estate and the 
trump shuttle airline 
also a story published in forbes last week lowered estimates of 
trumps wealth by more than 1 billion to about 500 million but 
parrillo said that also was no factor 
the information will not cloud our vision either negatively or 
positively parrillo said its based solely on the facts not 
on estimates by forbes or in the print media 
parrillo said his office has yet to receive a formal complaint 
from about 100 contractors who contend they are owed about 35 
million for work on trumps 1 billion taj mahal casino resort 
which opened april 2 any such complaint would be investigated he 
said 
trump officials announced thursday they hired an independent 
auditor to check the contractors work before making final payment 
parrillo said he could not estimate how long the state review 
would take he said past investigations of trumps finances 
occurred when he first got his license in 1982 again in 1983 and 
in 1987 
he said the review may include trumps entire organization 
including properties outside atlantic city 
the division produced a favorable financial report on the taj 
mahals prospects before it officially won its license march 29 
ed tracy president of trumps atlantic city holdings said the 
review is a nonissue because it is required periodically by 
state law 
last month the taj mahal set an atlantic city record taking in 
342 million from gamblers 
trumps other two casinos both saw drops in gross revenues last 
month though both were hurt by unusually low hold percentages 
hold is what is kept by the house and is subject to the luck of 
gambling 
trump plaza dropped from 266 million in april 1989 to 203 
million last month trump castle fell from 210 million to 185 
million 
were doing great the numbers at the taj continue to be 
astounding tracy said the numbers at trump plaza and trump 
castle were down but not significantly in terms of market share 
ron grobeck a gaming analyst with new yorkbased rd smith 
said trump plaza remains a strong property but questioned the taj 
mahals longterm potential for taking business away from trump 
castle 
he also said the 342 million firstmonth figure for the taj 
mahal was not as good as might be expected given the hypedup 
atmosphere 
the taj may not be as strong as donald would have hoped 
grobeck said

sugar futures prices collapsed friday plunging more than a 
penny a pound on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange amid 
heavy selling by frustrated speculators on signs of slack global 
demand 
on other commodity markets cocoa futures also fell sharply 
copper futures retreated precious metals were mostly lower oil 
futures advanced grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock and 
meat futures were mixed 
world sugar futures settled 50 cent to 116 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 1444 cents a pound the 
lowest close for a nearmonth sugar contract since march 1 
everybody was bailing out of the market today merrill lynch 
amp co analyst judith ganes said 
she said the market had been poised for a fall after repeated 
failures in the past week to sustain prices above 16 cents a pound 
speculators who had been holding out for higher prices finally 
gave up and began liquidating their positions analysts said 
triggering a selloff of nearrecord proportions with an estimated 
76000 contracts changing hands 
the decline was spurred on by a bearish supplydemand report by 
the london trading house edampf man ltd the firm sharply reduced 
its 198990 sugar deficit estimate predicting consumption would 
outstrip production by 258000 metric tons instead of 146 million 
metric tons as previously forecast 
ms ganes said the man report probably contributed to the 
bearish sentiment but that the revised deficit forecast was in line 
with other trade house predictions 
she said the sharp rise in sugar prices from less than 13 cents 
a pound last december has stifled demand which is the reason for 
the lowered consumption expectations 
but mondays sharp decline could stimulate new demand ms ganes 
said 
cocoa futures also fell sharply in new york amid skepticism 
about a plan by six major producer countries to curb excess 
production and encourage local consumption 
cocoa futures settled 23 to 29 lower with may at 1261 per 
ton

1189 a pound 
also on the commodity exchange gold futures settled 60 cents to 
130 lower with june at 37310 a troy ounce silver was 09 cent 
lower to 02 cent higher with may at 5 a troy ounce 
crude oil futures were little changed on the new york mercantile 
exchange but nearmonth gasoline futures rose sharply erasing 
thursdays loss 
the oil market is adjusting to opecs decision this week to 
reduce crudeoil production in an attempt to alleviate a global 
supply glut 
world demand for oil is running about the same as last year 
said peter cardillo commodity trading adviser for josephthal amp co

new evidence from april employment figures of an 
unexpectedly weak economy triggered a furious rally friday in the 
bond market sending interest rates sharply lower 
the bond buying binge offered a marked contrast to the gloom 
that depressed the market for much of the month of april hammering 
bond prices and pushing longterm interest rates bove 9 percent for 
the first time since last may 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond climbed 1 points or 
1625 for every 1000 face amount in one of the years biggest 
rallies 
its yield which falls when prices rise tumbled to 881 percent 
from 897 percent late thursday 
analysts said the governments report that the unemployment rate 
rose to 54 percent in april from 52 percent in march was the 
catalyst for the big price rally 
what caught most bond traders interest was the report of a 
measly net gain of 64000 jobs in april well below what analysts 
had expected 
elliott platt fixedincome research director for donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said if the addition of 78000 
temporary census workers were excluded from the numbers jobs would 
have fallen by 14000 last month he said analysts expected an 
increase of 150000 jobs not counting the census workers for april 
in addition he said wage inflation was up 03 percent in april 
when many analysts were expecting 05 percent growth partly due to 
the april 1 boost in the minimum wage but the minimum wage 
increase had minimal impact on overall wage growth officials 
indicated 
this report indicates a lot of weakness in the economy people 
had thought the economy was stronger with a much deeper inflation 
problem platt said 
the bond market benefits from a slow economic growth and low 
inflation because credit demand generally falls off during sluggish 
periods and allows interest rates to decline 
rising inflation and rapid growth on the other hand erodes the 
value of fixedincome securities such as notes and bonds and could 
prompt the federal reserve to encourage higher interest rates 
there is nothing the bond market likes better than bad news 
said robert brusca chief economist for nikko securities 
international 
he said the bond market had overreacted over the past few months 
to indications that the economy was growing rapidly and inflation 
was accelerating 
the market rally could not have been timed any better for the 
treasury department which is planning to sell 305 billion in new 
securities next week barring a sudden reversal in market sentiment 
early next week the government may find buyers at lower yields 
than had been expected only a few days ago 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose point intermediate maturities climbed by 
between 1116 point and a full point and longterm issues advanced 
1 points according to telerate inc the financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 915 to 114076 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds climbed 716 point to 89 the average yield 
to maturity fell to 768 percent from 772 percent 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 800 percent as the 
discount lost 10 basis points to 775 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills fell to 823 percent as the discount dropped 16 basis points 
to 781 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 839 percent as 
the discount fell 22 basis points to 782 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent unchanged 
from late thursday

trade ministers representing the largest 
industrial countries reported friday they had failed to resolve 
major disputes blocking an ambitious effort to overhaul the global 
trading system 
speaking at the end of a threeday negotiating session 
officials of the united states japan the 12nation european 
community and canada said sharp differences still remained over 
such issues as a us demand for the elimination of costly 
agricultural barriers 
us trade representative carla hills and the leaders of the 
other delegations sought to portray the talks in a positive light 
saying the discussions were useful in highlighting areas of 
disagreement and providing momentum to resolving disputes 
canadian trade minister john crosbie praised the discussions for 
turning the heat up in the fouryear effort to liberalize the 
rules governing world trade 
the officials said progress has been made toward narrowing 
differences in certain lowerlevel issues such as how trade 
disputes are handled 
but they were unable to point to any breakthroughs in the major 
areas of dispute including agriculture and barriers erected by the 
united states and other industrial countries to textile imports 
with time running out on the fouryear effort to reform the 
global trading system hills said the negotiators would appeal to 
president bush and other leaders at the sevennation economic 
summit in july to supply a political push to break the 
stalemates 
hills and crosbie participated at the closing press conference 
with japanese trade minister kabun muto and frans andriessen top 
trade negotiator for the european community 
they spoke to reporters on the patio of a posh resort in the 
heart of california wine country a site selected by hills a 
california native 
the talks were intended to provide guidance so that lower level 
negotiators would be able to come up with at least the outline of a 
final agreement during talks scheduled for late july in geneva 
hills said she remained confident that with intensive effort 
such a document could be produced in coming weeks 
the bush administration has made a successful conclusion of the 
complex negotiations which are scheduled to end in december its 
no 1 trade priority 
the administration believes the freer trade that would result 
would lower americas huge trade deficit by expanding overseas 
sales by american farmers and businesses 
us negotiators are pushing to eliminate all tradedistorting 
farm subsidies to dismantle barriers to trade in services such as 
banking and to crack down on copyright and patent piracy estimated 
to cost american firms 60 billion annually 
the talks being held under the auspices of the 97nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade are known as the uruguay 
round for the country where they were launched in 1986 
the united states has proposed a 10year phaseout of the farm 
subsidies estimating it would boost exports for more efficient 
american farmers by 11 billion annually 
but the european community seeking to protect its wide network 
of small family farms has refused to budge from its opposition 
many third world nations which were not represented at the napa 
meetings are battling the us proposals to lower trade barriers 
on services and to toughen copyright protections fearing harm to 
their infant domestic industries 
congress must approve any final agreement and the debate there 
is likely to be intense 
already special interest groups representing the american 
textile industry and peanut and sugar growers are working to build 
opposition to changes which would strip them of trade protections 
they now enjoy

general motors corp said friday it has begun a 
campaign to boost the image of its cars and trucks that includes 
asking current and retired employees to tell their friends that 
vehicle quality has improved 
gm spokesman harold jackson said the advertising project is the 
automakers most ambitious ever he declined to say how much gm is 
spending but the wall street journal estimated friday it would 
cost 40 million 
the nations big three automakers have stumbled badly in a 
industrywide downturn due to soft markets and intense foreign 
competition 
gm on thursday reported that firstquarter profits fell by 54 
percent earnings declined 69 percent at ford motor co in the 
first quarter and 80 percent at chrysler corp 
gm said it plans to contact each of its estimated 500000 active 
us employees its 330000 retirees and employees of its 9700 
us dealers and urge them to tell friends and neighbors that gms 
vehicle quality has improved 
were particularly concerned that people who havent driven 
our recent cars are still judging us by the vehicles they bought in 
the early 80s some of which perhaps werent quite as high in 
quality as they are today jackson said 
chrysler has been airing a television commercial featuring its 
chairman lee iacocca telling top executives basically the same 
thing that the quality of the companys cars has improved but no 
one knows it 
ours is not tied to iacocca jackson said ours has been 
in the development stage since late last year 
the gm program includes television magazine and newspaper 
advertising some of which began friday along with the individual 
mailings which started earlier this week 
jackson said the program has no scheduled end

congressional testimony by convicted junk bond 
financier michael milken before he is sentenced could complicate 
the securities fraud case the nations top securities regulator 
said friday 
the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee voted unanimously tuesday to subpoena 
milken who pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay 600 
million in penalties last month 
if milken receives immunity from the panel nothing he says at a 
congressional hearing could be used against him in state or federal 
courts 
i think well try to work with congress to make sure they 
understand the status of the case as they consider what hearings 
they wish to have and when they want to have them securities and 
exchange commission chairman richard c breeden said 
before milken is called to testify before congress something 
he refused to do two years ago the subpoena must be approved by 
the full house committee 
milken once head of drexel burnham lambert incs highrisk 
highyield bond department faces up to 28 years in prison when he 
is sentenced in new york on oct 1 
asked if the sec would oppose having milken testify before he is 
sentenced breeden said 
if you had immunized testimony before a point in time that the 
plea agreement and the settlement becomes irrevocable on the date 
of sentencing then it does create potential for introducing 
complications into the case 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of both the committee and 
subcomittee replied in a statement issued through his office 
were aware of the concerns of the sec and others and will work 
closely with them to avoid major complications however the 
subcommittee intends to continue to perform its duties and 
oversight with vigor 
on other topics breeden said it was premature to say how an 
appeals court decision in new york this week overturning the 
insider trading conviction of exstockbroker robert chestman would 
affect sec enforcement efforts 
he added that the sec was still studying the decision to 
determine whether to appeal it and what implications it has for 
pending cases and settlements already reached 
were certainly not get into renegotiating settlements at a 
preliminary stage breeden said during a meeting with reporters 
in his office 
in settling civil and criminal charges with the sec and the 
justice department milken agreed to testify truthfully before 
grand juries and at trials or court proceedings stemming from any 
drexelrelated activities 
if milken fails to comply with those rules he can be prosecuted 
for perjury and obstruction of justice and jailed for contempt of 
court under the settlement the agreements do not specifically 
mention congressional testimony

greyhound lines inc said friday it lost 558 
million in the first quarter and would miss millions of dollars in 
payments due in coming weeks because of problems related to a 
2monthold strike by bus drivers 
greyhound said it missed about 5 million in lease payments due 
in april and would not make a 975 million interest payment due 
may 15 greyhound also announced layoffs of 172 administrative 
workers at its dallas headquarters and elsewhere 
the losses put greyhound in technical default on some credit 
agreements opening the door for creditors to force the company 
into bankruptcy officials say they do not believe that will happen 
we wont pull the rip cord if nobody forces us to greyhound 
vice president and treasurer don seaquist said our assets have a 
lot more value as a going operation as a bus company that they 
would broken up 
he said greyhounds senior bank lenders were getting daily 
reports on company operations and cash flow and were expected to 
grant waivers on some interest payment requirements 
the disclosures were the first indication of financial straits 
at greyhound which operates the only nationwide bus system 
greyhound blamed the losses and cutbacks in large part on 20 
million in unanticipated expenses to cope with strikerelated 
violence 
greyhound had maintained since bus drivers walked out march 2 
that it had sufficient cash to withstand the strike and would make 
the may 15 interest payment 
at the time our cash projections showed a return to ridership 
that was higher than weve seen so far seaquist said 
the company has been running at between 53 percent and 60 
percent of last years ridership in recent weeks although 
spokesman george gravley said the latest figures show an 
improvement 
greyhound said it is taking vigorous actions to return to 
profitability during the peak summer months but the company said 
it expects to lose money in april may and possibly june 
the actions include the layoffs announced friday and a new 
advertising campaign to take effect next week greyhound already 
laid off about 270 mechanics last month 
in papers filed with the securities and exchange commission 
greyhound said the firstquarter loss caused it to violate certain 
agreements with creditors 
as a result the companys major creditors will be in a 
position to accelerate payments due greyhound said the 
company is developing a financial restructuring plan that it will 
begin discussing with its creditors and lenders in the very near 
future 
seaquist admitted the creditors could force greyhound into 
involuntary bankruptcy and that the company had briefly 
considered but rejected filing for voluntary bankruptcy 
although greyhound said it had been prepared financially for the 
strike it said it had not anticipated the excessive amount of 
violence directed at its buses and facilities 
violence caused the company to spend more than 20 million for 
additional security legal fees and driver training greyhound 
said 
there have been 46 shootings at greyhound buses or terminals and 
more than 100 bomb threats the company said the company has sued 
union officials in a florida federal court for 30 million 
claiming they have supported violence 
greyhound had refused to return to the bargaining table until a 
week had passed without violence that condition was met earlier 
this week and talks are to resume in washington on saturday with a 
federal mediator 
gravley said the company would have no new proposal to present 
saturday 
greyhound has said it cannot afford more than the 63 million 
threeyear contract it first offered union officials contend their 
own offer is less but greyhound values it at about 200 million 
in the quarter ended march 31 greyhound said it lost 558 
million on revenues of 173 million that compares to a 144 
million loss on 224 million in revenue during the same period last 
year 
the company created three years ago in a leveraged buyout lost 
20 million its first two years before turning a small profit last 
year

a computer expert who created a worm 
program that paralyzed thousands of computers nationwide was placed 
on three years probation friday and fined 10000 for the crime 
us district judge howard munson also ordered 25yearold 
robert t morris to perform 400 hours of community service 
prosecutors had asked munson to order the maximum sentence of 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine they sought at least some 
jail time for the former cornell university graduate student 
defense attorney david obrien said morris was too decent a 
kid to be sentenced to jail 
there is a world of difference between what robert did and 
what others who have used this technology did obrien said 
noting that morris did not benefit from his actions 
morris did not speak at the sentencing or talk to reporters 
after the hearing he remained grimfaced through most of the 
hearing then cracked a wide smile and hugged his mother when the 
sentence was announced 
morris parents said they were pleased with the sentence 
we love our son hes a great kid anne morris said we 
wish that this last year and a half had been different for him but 
were weathering it and so is he 
mrs morris said the experience had made her son more 
responsible 
in january morris became the first person to be convicted under 
the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act for breaking into a federal 
computer network and preventing authorized use of the system 
he created the worm program while at cornell university in 
ithaca on nov 2 1988 the rogue program immobilized an estimated 
6000 computers linked to the internet research system including 
ones at the national aeronautics and space administration military 
bases and major universities 
morris formerly of arnold md and now living in cambridge 
mass testified during his trial that the worm was an experiment 
that went out of control because of a programming error he made he 
admitted he designed the worm to invade the internet system but 
said it wasnt supposed to replicate wildly as it did 
prosecutors disagreed during the trial they described morris 
experiment as a fullscale assault that was methodically 
planned they said morris also took deliberate steps to make the 
worm difficult to trace and eradicate 
us attorney frederick scullin jr however said he thought 
the sentence was fair the case was unique and the sentence does 
not mean that future offenders will not face prison terms he said 
in case anybody had any doubt these are serious crimes and 
will be prosecuted as such scullin said 
thomas guidoboni another defense attorney said he thought the 
sentence was reasonable but said he will file an appeal to 
challenge the law under which morris was convicted 
i dont believe mr morris deserves to be a felon for what he 
did said guidoboni who had asked munson to consider a sentence 
of no more than six months in jail and a 5005000 fine

columbia savings amp loan association said 
friday it lost 293 million in the first quarter as the value of 
its junk bond portfolio declined by 274 million 
but edward g harshfield columbias president and chief 
executive said the thrift had received several bids to purchase 
substantially all of its 3 billion junk bond portfolio in a 
single transaction 
the quarterly loss equal to 1462 per share contrasted with a 
profit of 79 million or 20 cents per share in the same 1989 
period 
columbia had bought more highyield highrisk junk bonds than 
any other thrift in large part due to close ties with convicted 
drexel burnham lambert inc financier michael milken whose junk 
bond network involved major thrifts 
columbia said that as of march 31 it was 338 million short of 
federal requirements for minimum capital 
the thrift said it had sold or redeemed 254 million in 
highyield bonds and preferred stock and 195 million of equity 
and equityequivalent securities 
columbia said its financial adviser first boston corp had 
received several bids to purchase nearly the entire portfolio of 
junk bonds the bids are being discussed by columbia first boston 
and the potential buyers the thrift said 
harshfield described the thrifts relationship with regulators 
as positive constructive as the thrift tries to sell of its 
junk bond portfolio 
we are also encouraged by the wide interest in the highyield 
portfolio that first boston has received so far and have a greater 
degree of confidence that a favorable transaction can occur he 
said 
columbias junk bond portfolio was worth 43 billion at the end 
of 1988 and has declined in large part because of the sharp 
decline in the highyield bond market that began last fall due to 
several prominent defaults 
the thrift has been forced to carry the junk portfolio on its 
books at market value because of accounting changes required under 
the governments bailout program for the nations saving and loan 
insurance fund 
columbia is seeking to unload the portfolio to meet net capital 
requirements for insurance the thrift is expected to receive a 
better price if it can sell the portfolio whole rather than 
piecemeal 
junk bonds are a form of debt security that offer high yields in 
exchange for their perceived high risk thrifts in the 1980s bought 
billions of dollars in the bonds which were used to finance small 
companies and hostile takeovers columbia also said it set aside 
1927 million for credit loss reserves which reflects the 
declined junk bond portfolio earlier in the quarter when it 
announced it was insolvent the thrifts accounting loss from the 
reserve for the quarter was 809 million 
due to the firstquarter loss columbia had a stockholders 
deficit of 2156 million compared with shareholders equity of 
776 million as of dec 31 
columbia said its net interest income fell to 127 million from 
602 million

federated department stores inc and sister 
allied stores corp posted net losses totaling more than 21 
billion in their fourth fiscal quarters largely because of a 
writedown stemming from their bankruptcy reorganization 
the companies which own nearly 260 us department stores such 
as bloomingdales richs and lazarus also reported that excluding 
nonoperating charges they posted operating profits for both the 
fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended feb 3 
i believe we have turned the corner on stabilizing the 
business and that we are well into a period of operational 
recovery chairman allen questrom said in a prepared statement 
separately the companies parent campeau corp said it had 
proposed a business plan to its bondholders that includes the sale 
of real estate assets and a temporary halt in its interest payments 
federated and allied sought federal bankruptcy court protection 
from creditors on jan 15 citing the burden of paying off 77 
billion in debt much of the debt was incurred when campeau 
acquired the companies federated in 1988 and allied in 1986 
largely with borrowed funds 
worsening the companies condition was a sluggish retailing 
environment which forced pricecutting and other competitive moves 
that cut into profits 
federated said it lost 134 billion during the fourth quarter 
on sales of 159 billion compared with a profit of 276 million 
and sales of 149 billion in the yearearlier quarter 
the results were sharply affected by a 115 billion writedown 
of goodwill the amount over federateds book value that campeau 
paid to acquire the company in 1988 an accounting move made to 
reflect the deterioration of federateds financial situation during 
the year 
federateds earnings also were reduced by 1265 million in 
deferred financing and reorganization costs and by 5161 million 
in net interest expense 
the company had operating income of 486 million down from 
1759 million a year earlier 
allied said it lost 8368 million on sales of 8922 million 
compared with a profit of 376 million on sales of 8698 million a 
year earlier 
allieds earnings were reduced by nonoperating charges of 
6603 million for its equity in federated 2906 million in net 
interest expense and 1388 million in income tax expense 
the companys operating income was 252 million in the quarter 
down from 862 million a year earlier 
for the full year federated posted a net loss of 15 billion 
compared with a loss of 1563 billion a year earlier sales rose 
72 percent to 487 billion from 357 billion 
allieds net loss on the year was 9252 million compared with 
a profit of 514 million the previous year sales rose 52 percent 
to 27 billion from 257 billion 
at the end of the fiscal year federated had 367 million in 
cash on hand and allied had 185 million in cash the companies 
reported 
both also showed positive cash flows 3724 million for 
federated and 1997 million for allied for the full year although 
the companies are not making interest payments while in bankruptcy 
court reorganization 
federated owns the bloomingdales lazarus abraham and straus 
richs and burdines chains allieds chains include jordan marsh 
sterns maas brothers and the bon marche 
campeau which spun off its department store businesses shortly 
before they entered bankruptcy court protection is attempting to 
work out of its own financial problems 
in a business plan proposed to holders of 184 million of its 
debentures campeau said it would ask bondholders to waive any 
defaults and defer interest payments through dec 31 1991 
in return the company would sell assets from its real estate 
holdings to make a major reduction in its secured debt campeau 
also would pay secured loans with cash flow from the properties 
used as collateral 
bondholders would consider the plan at a previously scheduled 
june 1 meeting in toronto 
campeaus real estate holdings consist primarily of shopping 
malls and office complexes and business in the united states and 
canada

the federal communications commission ruled 
friday that the fox broadcasting co will be able to grow as a 
network while its parent company continues selling television shows 
into syndication 
the decision which grants fox a oneyear waiver to fcc 
guidelines allows the network to show up to 18 hours of 
programming a week but fox will be prohibited from acquiring any 
financial interest in or syndication rights to new programs while 
the the waiver is in effect 
before the ruling networks showing more than 15 hours of 
programming a week were forbidden by the fcc from participating in 
the television syndication business 
fox asked for the waiver in january saying the television 
market had changed substantially since the rules were adopted in 
1970 when the three major networks dominated the television market 
shows syndicated by fox inc the parent company of the network 
include a current affair mr belvedere and mash 
the ruling comes as the three networks are fighting to repeal 
the 1970 financial interest and syndication rules the rules forbid 
the networks from owning programs sold into the lucrative 
television syndication market 
the networks contend the prohibition unfairly limits their 
access to viewers 
the 3yearold fox network was awarded the limited waiver the 
fcc said because the commission wants to encourage new national 
networks help supply programming for the 112 foxaffiliated 
stations on the uhf band and advance childrens programming 
the fox network plans to introduce a 2hour daily block of 
childrens shows this fall fox also plans later this year to add 
programming on wednesday and friday night and on saturday morning 
the interim waiver announced today will permit the continued 
growth and development of fox broadcasting co as we all strive to 
achieve a global resolution of the financial interest and 
syndication issues barry diller chairman of fox inc said in a 
statement 
the ruling was opposed by the motion picture association of 
america and the walt disney co among others those opposing the 
decision fear the three established networks and fox will force 
other production companies out of business if they enter into 
syndication 
joe rutledge vice president of corporate communication for nbc 
said the network feared the ruling removes the immediate pressure 
on fox and the studios to reach a settlement on the issue of the 
financial interest and syndication rules 
he did say however that nbc applauded the fccs inclination to 
remove anticompetetive barriers from television networks 
preston padden senior vice president for affiliates for fox 
broadcasting said the network will continue to battle against the 
financial interest and syndication rules 
we are prepared to see the fight through and get appropriate 
regualatory relief for the three networks as well
