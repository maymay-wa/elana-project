at a recent house democratic leadership 
meeting lawmakers were asked to raise their hands if they were 
eager to adjourn and hit the campaign trail back home nobody did 
in fact one member joked we want to be held hostage here 
and dont pay any ransom according to one official who attended 
the closeddoor session 
the show of hands and the comment that followed were in a 
lighthearted vein but they spoke a serious truth incumbents are 
finding washington a good place to ride out the electionseason 
budget storm 
its easier to campaign here doing your work in washington 
than out on the stump said rep david bonior a michigan 
democrat who faces a stiff reelection challenge i prefer to be 
doing my job what the people sent me here to do 
this year theres a new survival strategy for incumbents stay 
in washington keep your nose to the grindstone appear to be above 
politics and stay in touch through television and radio advertising 
and news coverage 
it is a congressional variant of the rose garden strategy 
sometimes used by incumbent presidents such an approach not only 
keeps challengers at bay but angry voters as well members of 
congress can avoid the prospect of facing boos and angry 
interrogation at live public events 
incumbents are not anxious to return home while the government 
is in crisis particularly when the government is being shut down 
and president bush is laying the blame on congress 
a measure of the public discontent came when vandals 
spraypainted cut taxes deficit and repeal stolen pay 
raise on the house of house republican leader robert michel in 
peoria ill 
house speaker thomas foley dwash bristled when asked monday 
about the budget standoff another sign of the heat it has 
generated for lawmakers 
the president often takes the stance of standing aside as if 
hes not a participant in these budget negotiations as if its 
somehow a congressional activity he said 
thumping his desk for emphasis foley added it was the 
presidential veto earlier this month that shut down the 
government he bears full responsibility for that and he will bear 
full responsibility if it happens again 
the threat of another government shutdown this weekend together 
with a general antiincumbent mood and a sparse list of 
accomplishments for the 101st congress has made home a 
lessthanhospitable place for lawmakers 
theyre pretty darn vitriolic said a senior midwestern 
republican he said constituents were calling his office and 
screaming epithets at his staff 
a legislator whose image is beamed home in the televised house 
floor proceedings might think shoot i can make more points here 
doing this said the congressman who requested anonymity and 
besides if hes getting challenged to debate his opponent its a 
good excuse not to 
that feeling is not universal rep george brown dcalif who 
many regard as among the most endangered incumbents this year has 
been thrashed by challenger bob hammock for missing important 
budget votes while out campaigning 
i cant be in both places at the same time so i have to make 
tough choices brown countered 
republican sen pete wilson who is running for governor of 
california also has been chastised for missing votes his 
democratic opponent dianne feinstein said of wilson if hes 
not going to do his duty then he should resign his job in the 
united states senate 
in other cases the campaigns have simply moved to washington 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn and his democratic challenger 
paul wellstone held a debate sunday night in a studio set up at 
washingtons national press club it was beamed back to minnesota 
by satellite 
but those cases seem to be the exception and the new mood is a 
pronounced switch from past years in 1986 republicans blamed 
their loss of the senate on incumbents being held too long in 
washington and away from the campaign trail 
one senior congressional official said there traditionally are 
two schools of thought as election day approaches those with 
tight races who want to go home and campaign and those who are not 
threatened and say whats the rush 
now theres a third school of thought the official said 
those who have a tough race and say whats the rush 
the official added until we finish the budget and a couple of 
important pieces of legislation we dont want to be adjourned

congressional proponents of the b2 stealth 
bomber are breathing easier after the senate narrowly rejected an 
attempt to stop production of the radarevading aircraft 
we had to have it sen james exon dneb a member of the 
senate armed services committee and a b2 proponent said monday 
night after the senate approved a 268 billion defense spending 
bill 
by a 5044 vote the senate rejected an amendment that would 
have halted production of the stealth aircraft at six planes far 
short of the 75 that president bush is seeking at a cost of nearly 
865 million each 
backers of the northropbuilt bomber argued that a plane that 
can penetrate soviet air defenses is still needed because of 
uncertainty over the future leadership of the kremlin 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sen sam 
nunn dga also pointed out that a predecessor of the b2 the 
b1b bomber has failed to meet pentagon performance standards he 
urged his colleagues not to abandon the stealth capability 
opponents do not understand were talking about revolutionary 
technology nunn said 
but the opponents complained that in the postcold war era a 
nation on the verge of economic ruin cannot afford to buy a bomber 
geared toward the soviet union 
there is a threat to the nation greater than the soviet air 
defense said sen dale bumpers dark 
rejection of the amendment came as house and senate negotiators 
on a military authorization bill pushed to complete a final 
blueprint for the current fiscal year with the b2 bomber the main 
point of contention 
defeat of the b2 in the senate would have taken the big 
thrust out of the argument for any continuation said rep bill 
dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the house armed 
services committee 
shortly after the b2 vote the senate overwhelmingly approved 
the military spending package that meets the levels set forth in 
the budget resolution approved by congress 
the legislation adopted 7916 trims about 1 billion from 
bushs 47 billion request for the strategic defense initiative 
and cuts the number of us troops by 100000 including 50000 in 
europe 
the spending bill also includes 238 million for the v22 
osprey the tiltrotor aircraft bush has sought to cancel during 
the past two years eliminates 11 billion the pentagon sought for 
the milstar communications satellite and scales back the 
administrations request for landbased nuclear missiles 
the bill includes about 500 million for the mx missile and 200 
million for the planned midgetman missile as well as funds for one 
ssn21 seawolf submarine 
negotiators for the senate and the house which had passed a 
defense spending bill earlier will meet to thrash out a final 
version with an aim to wrap up the legislation by weeks end 
before congress adjourns for the year

if youre a college student your school may 
no longer be eligible for certain governmentbacked loans if 
youre a wheat farmer your federal subsidies will shrink if 
youre a veteran your benefits will be less generous 
the deficitreduction legislation congress plans to vote on this 
week will hit home all across america and its not only in the 
bigger bite the internal revenue service will take although 
thats likely to sting too 
congressional votes on budgetcutting packages were expected to 
begin as early as today the competing measures aim at slicing the 
federal deficit over the next five years by about 500 billion 
including 40 billion in the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the plans range from a measure written by house democrats that 
is topheavy with higher taxes on the wealthy to a house 
republican plan that slashes spending and relies only lightly on 
new levies 
in the senate the leaders of both parties are united behind a 
package that would make the rich pay more but also would double the 
gasoline tax 
this is where members put their money where their mouth is 
said the house budget committee chairman rep leon panetta 
dcalif 
the votes will be painful ones for members because just three 
weeks from election day they will be considering packages that 
mean higher tax bills and reduced federal services for the public 
the 33 million elderly and handicapped people enrolled in the 
medicare program will feel the pinch in several ways 
the 75 they must pay each year in doctors bills before the 
government begins picking up the tab would increase to 150 next 
year under the senate bill 100 under the house democratic plan 
and the 2860 they pay each month for doctors coverage would 
increase by 1995 to 4650 monthly under the house democratic plan 
47 by 1995 in the senate package 
all americans who are sick could see their bills increase 
because the reimbursements doctors and hospitals receive for 
treating medicare patients will be held to below the rate of 
inflation 
with their federal reimbursements reduced doctors and hospitals 
could be forced to pass their costs on to all patients the 
government limits the ability of health care providers to boost 
costs for medicare recipients 
farmers also would be hit lawmakers would reduce acreage 
eligible for crop subsidies by 15 percent for each farmer beginning 
in 1992 
and subsidies would be cut in another way by changing the 
formula by which farmers receive payments when market prices are 
low the five subsidized crops are wheat corn feed grains rice 
and cotton 
veterans would see many benefits restricted they would no 
longer be automatically considered disabled and therefore 
eligible for higher payments at age 65 and they would have to 
contribute 2 for prescriptions paid for by the government 
the guaranteed student loan program which serves 3 million 
students in colleges graduate and technical schools would also 
have new limits loans would no longer be available at the 
approximately 1000 schools where more than 35 percent of past 
loans have defaulted 
the banks that make federally backed loans would receive 
slightly less interest from the government which probably would 
make fewer loans availabl 
and for all but the poorest americans the tax bite will get 
deeper under the house democratic plan according to congress 
joint committee on taxation 
people with incomes under 20000 would see their taxes drop 
slightly but people earning more than 200000 annually would have 
to absorb a 74 percent increase americans in between would see 
increases in the 1 percent range 
the changes would be a result of higher taxes on alcohol and 
tobacco giving up next years income tax adjustment to offset 
inflation and raising the amount of wages subject to the medicare 
tax 
the senate plan would reduce taxes slightly for people earning 
less than 20000 raise taxes by just under 3 percent for families 
in the 20000to50000 income range increase them 19 percent 
for those between 50000 and 75000 and boost them 35 percent 
for those between 100000 and 200000 the 200000plus group 
would pay 37 percent more 
other measures affecting consumers would 
end for five years the option that civil service retirees 
have to receive their benefits in a lump sum people over age 64 
with 30 years of service would be exempted 
impose a 1 fee on aircraft or ship passengers entering the 
united states including returning americans except for those 
traveling from canada mexico the caribbean or us possessions 
increase us patent office fees for items such as patent 
applications 
boost fines for violations of labor safety laws

pounds of pure cocaine discovered huge coca fields and destroyed 
laboratories an army official said 
the cocaine seized in mondays operation near colombias 
northern coast was hidden among cargo bags and ready to be exported 
to the united states said regional army commander col carlos 
castro 
he said troops destroyed six cocaineprocessing laboratories 
arrested 103 suspected drug traffickers and found nearly 5000 
acres of coca leaf the raw material used to make cocaine 
soldiers also seized 30 vehicles all with venezuelan license 
plates which had been used to transport drugs castro said also 
confiscated were cocaine processing chemicals and a cache of 
weapons he said 
the bust was considered one of the years most important so far 
in 1990 security forces have confiscated about 45 tons of cocaine 
compared to 33 tons in all of 1989 
colombias medellin and cali cocaine cartels supply most of the 
cocaine consumed in the united states the coca leaf is mostly

a houseapproved 119 billion appropriations 
bill heads to the senate today with a compromise plan aimed at 
settling a bitter controversy over the national endowment for the 
arts subsidy of allegedly obscene works 
for the second time in less than a week the house voted monday 
to scrap strict antiobscenity curbs on the nea and let the courts 
decide whether federally supported arts projects are obscene 
the plan drafted by reps pat williams dmont and e thomas 
coleman rmo says obscenity shall not be funded by the 
endowment it would require grant recipients to repay the 
government if they are convicted of violating obscenity laws 
a new provision in the money bill which finances several 
federal agencies and provides 180 million to the endowment would 
require nea chairman john e frohnmayer to eliminate his 
requirement that grant winners sign a nonobscenity pledge that 
rule has been strongly criticized by the arts community and its 
supporters 
the williamscoleman plan would replace restrictions that 
congress slapped on the nea a year ago at the urging of sen jesse 
helms rnc who was angered by endowment support for an 
exhibition of sexually explicit works by the late photographer 
robert mapplethorpe 
helms amendment prohibited the nea from supporting any works 
that may be considered obscene including depictions of 
homosexual or sadomasochistic activity or sexual exploitation of 
children 
the williamscoleman compromise attached to the appropriations 
bill was identical to a separate measure that the house approved 
last thursday when it authorized extending the neas statutory 
authority for three years 
both measures were sent to the senate where a similar but 
simpler bill favoring a judicial approach to the obscene art 
controversy is awaiting floor action 
it is unusual for the entire contents of an authorization bill 
to be attached to an appropriations bill and approved by the house 
but williams said the parliamentary maneuver was necessary to 
enhance the prospects for final congressional approval of the nea 
measure 
williams said there was little if any chance that the 
previously approved authorization bill would survive in the waning 
days of an electionyear congress that is mired in a budget crisis 
he noted that a highpriority appropriations bill stands a much 
greater chance of passage than the nea authorization bill this 
will assure i hope that something that the house wants in this 
very divisive matter reaches the presidents desk and becomes 
law williams said 
the money bill containing the nea provisions passed the house on 
a 32780 roll call vote it includes 180 million in arts endowment 
spending in the new fiscal year that began oct 1 a 5 percent 
increase from the neas 171 million budget last year 
before the final vote the house approved the williamscoleman 
plan 234171 as a substitute for a more strongly worded proposal 
by rep ralph regula rohio and ratified the bipartisan 
compromise on a 34258 roll call 
regulas amendment would have forbidden the endowment to 
subsidize obscene or indecent works and ordered the nea chairman to 
ensure that federally supported works are appropriate for a 
general audience 
the measure contains billions more for the interior department 
the forest service some energy department programs indian 
education and health services the smithsonian institution and 
other federal agencies 
the bill also includes a oneyear moratorium on exploring for 
oil and gas in federal waters in many areas off new england the 
east coast florida california the pacific northwest and alaska 
the house also approved 251155 a proposal by rep mike synar 
dokla to increase grazing fees on public lands by 500 percent 
over the next four years the plan supported by environmental 
interests was heatedly opposed by western lawmakers

the bush administration no longer is demanding 
that all farm subsidies that distort world trade be eliminated by 
the end of the century but critics question whether the change 
undermines an effort to boost us agricultural exports 
us negotiators on monday offered a compromise proposal aimed 
at breaking a deadlock that has threatened to scuttle a fouryear 
effort to reform the global trading system 
the administration said it would seek agreement from other 
countries to cut farm export subsidies by 90 percent and farm 
income supports by 75 percent over the next 10 years 
previously the united stateshad sought total elimination of 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter insisted that the 
administration remained committed to an ultimate goal of 
eliminating all such subsidies but felt the new proposal 
represented a good first step and would help to end a negotiating 
stalemate 
ninety percent reform is certifiably better than no reform and 
if this process fails we are going to have no reform yeutter 
told reporters monday 
but some critics questioned whether the united states by 
signaling a willingness to bargain on the percentage of subsidy 
elimination was opening the possibility that it will have to 
settle for a good deal less than even 90 percent 
they noted that the european community the 12nation trading 
bloc that is fighting the hardest to retain its subsidy program is 
considering offering a negotiating position to trim farm income 
supports by just 30 percent while leaving its export programs 
basically untouched 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of a senate finance 
subcommittee overseeing trade issues said the administrations 
latest offer embraced the dangerous concept of percentage 
reductions in agricultural support rather than insisting on total 
elimination 
since the european community already subsidizes its 
agricultural sector substantially more than does the united states 
a 75 percent reduction by both the united states and the ec would 
leave european farmers with a substantial advantage baucus said 
the fight over farm subsidies has threatened to scuttle an 
ambitious fouryear effort to overhaul the world trading system 
the talks being held under the auspices of the 97nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade are due to conclude in 50 days with 
a marathon bargaining session in brussels 
president bush has made successful conclusion of the discussions 
his top trade priority but he has threatened to walk away if the 
united states does not prevail on the farm subsidy question 
the administration believes that the trade negotiation known as 
the uruguay round offers the best chance for boosting export sales 
by american farmers and businesses and thus reducing annual trade 
deficits that have topped 100 billion for six consecutive years 
agriculture is just one of 15 areas being negotiated the us 
team is pushing an ambitious agenda that also calls for dismantling 
barriers to trade in services a highgrowth area where american 
companies are extremely competitive and a crackdown on copyright 
piracy estimated to cost american companies 60 billion annually 
but agriculture is seen as the key to the talks because third 
world countries have balked at agreeing to us proposals on 
removing barriers to trade in services and strengthening copyright 
enforcement unless they win expanded markets for their farm 
products 
us trade representative carla hills said that in addition to 
the new proposal on agriculture the administration will unveil a 
proposal probably this week on changes needed to lift 
restrictions on access to markets

a house subcommittee is investigating whether 
the domination of cattle slaughtering by three corporations is 
hurting farmers and consumers 
the house government operations subcommittee on information 
justice and agriculture is gathering testimony on all aspects of 
the beef business from the agriculture and justice departments 
economists farmers meat industry representatives and members of 
congress 
there is a huge dispute over whether the socalled big three 
is a marketdriven concept or whether the big three is driving 
the market to its own advantage said rep bob wise dwva the 
subcommittee chairman 
conagra inc ibp inc and excel corp have dominated the beef 
industry since the early 1980s about 24 percent of the business 
from the raising of cattle to the delivery of carcasses to butcher 
shops is owned by the three companies a subcommittee aide said 
the subcommittee intends to look at the regulatory and 
legislative aspects of meatpacking concentration from both an 
antitrust and agricultural point of view said wise 
he said the panel would also investigate allegations that lack 
of competition in the industry is leading to lower wages and higher 
injury rates for employees in the plants

legislation requiring federal inspection of 
seafood is expected to be debated on the floor of the house this 
week 
however three bills with inspection responsibilities assigned 
to different agencies have been voted out of three committees 
the house rules committee was to decide today which bill would 
be the main vehicle for debate the other two were expected to be 
offered as amendments floor action would be later in the week 
congress has been in general agreement that seafood inspection 
must be strengthened but house members have not been able to agree 
which agency should do it one bill would give the job to the 
agriculture department the second would assign it to the food and 
drug administration and the third would split the responsibility 
between the fda and the commerce department 
last month the senate unanimously approved legislation that 
places inspection responsibilities with usda 
if the house of representatives lets the enactment of a 
mandatory federal seafood inspection fail due to its own 
paralysis then the list of those real victims who have suffered 
and died from eating contaminated uninspected seafood will grow 
longer said ellen haas executive director of public voice for 
food and heath policy 
haas who has been working for years to get congress to act on 
this issue praised the senate bill as a strong bill with many 
important public health protections 
currently seafood is inspected on mostly a voluntary basis 
some states have their own programs and a limited service is 
offered by the fda 
contaminated fish poses a real health threat to consumers 
said haas finfish feed on bacterialaden algae and shellfish 
filterfeed water contaminated with sewage increasing the risk of 
illness to consumers

phil sokolof president of the national heart 
savers association is pressuring the senate through fullpage 
newspaper advertisements to take a floor vote on a 
nutritionlabeling bill before congress adjourns for the year 
with adjournment any legislation that has not been acted upon 
will die 
sokolof a multimillionaire businessman from omaha neb said 
monday he spent 350000 of his own money for ads calling for 
action 
americans desperately need this bill enacted into law so they 
can make the informed choices necessary to lead healthier lives 
said sokolofs ad in the washington post 
the house already approved a bill that would set specific 
standards for labeling a food lite or lowfat it also

hampshire college the 
designyourowndegree school founded when the summer of love was 
still a warm memory turns 20 this year having survived the 
greedisgood 80s 
graduates and administrators of the school which still has no 
course credits grades or tenure say thats a testament to 
hampshires staying power 
we are certainly a long way from the 60s now said 
filmmaker ken burns a 1975 graduate whose civil war documentary 
recently won acclaim on public television 
when it opened hampshire was a bold experiment the brainchild 
of a group of educators from nearby smith amherst and mount 
holyoke colleges and the university of massachusetts its motto 
to know is not enough 
from its first class of 175 the school has grown to about 
1200 tuition meanwhile has grown from about 4800 in 1970 to 
more than 20000 
i think hampshires shown an enormous amount of courage in 
staying the course said 1977 graduate aaron lansky who credits 
the adventurous spirit of hampshire with helping inspire him to 
create the national yiddish book center now the worlds largest 
collection of yiddish works 
hampshire which has also produced nine oscar nominees and two 
winners has always had shock value with its coed dormitories 
gradeless classes and the story of the graduate who wrote his 
thesis on the aerodynamics of the frisbee 
graduates say it wasnt all freewheeling fun 
this whole thing of frisbee u and kind of the hippie school 
thing has gotten blown out of proportion burns said i never 
worked harder than i did at hampshire college in all my life 
at hampshire there are just passfail designations on a series 
of exams students must pass through three divisions in division 
i a student must demonstrate a rudimentary grasp of the concepts 
of the four schools of humanities and arts social science 
communications and cognitive science and natural science in 
division ii courses must be organized around a particular theme 
in division iii a student turns in a project equivalent to a 
thesis 
competition to get into those early classes was fierce 
there was a sense that we were making history that we had 
pioneered a whole new way of approaching education that wasnt 
based on processing individuals through a kind of assemblyline 
method of teaching said burns who has twice been nominated for 
an academy award for his documentaries 
hampshires slump came in the 1980s when applications dropped 
and concern grew that unqualified students were being admitted in 
response the student body was cut from 1200 to 900 and the school 
spent some of its 10 million endowment to operate 
perennial problems at hampshire are faculty overload from what 
amounts to a tutorial system of education attrition among students 
unable to cope with hampshires unorthodox ways and money the 
college depends on tuition and fees for much of its approximately 
25 million annual budget 
financial stability is one of the goals of president gregory 
prince who became hampshires fourth president in 1989 
recently after a nineday occupation of a dormitory in 1988 by 
students protesting what they perceived as indiference to minority 
issues students and teachers were required to incorporate a third 
world perspective into courses 
administrators say they wont relinquish hampshires 
experimental attitude 
for a college like hampshire what an anniversary like this 
helps underscore is how much time is on our side prince said

a nobelwinning physicians group is calling for the 
immediate removal from the persian gulf region of the more than 400 
nuclear warheads it estimates are aboard us british french and 
soviet warships in the area 
the group the international physicians for the prevention of 
nuclear war appealed monday toall parties in the persian gulf 
crisis to renounce the use of nuclear biological and chemical 
weapons 
the gulf crisis presents an unprecedented threat of 
conflagration of a war with catastrophic consequences said the 
group which won the nobel peace prize in 1985 
the physicians released their appeal in rome following a 
threeday meeting in the northern italian city of prato among 
those attending were representatives from israel jordan egypt and 
the palestinian red crescent 
the red crescent is the equivalent of the red cross in the arab 
world 
our greatest fear is that if hostilities break out there is a 
very real prospect that nuclear weapons would be utilized said 
william w monning executive director of the group which is based 
in cambridge mass 
monning released the details of a study predicting the 
consequences of a nuclear strike on baghdad the iraqi capital 
under this scenario dropping a single onemegaton nuclear bomb 
on the city would immediately kill 1 million people or 23 percent 
of the population and seriously injure another 128 million 
the blast would kill 770 of the citys 3080 physicians and 
incapacitate 920 others leaving 1400 doctors to care for the 128 
million wounded monning said 
the physicians presented their appeal to officials of the us 
soviet and iraqi embassies in rome 
monning said an american diplomat told the group the united 
states has no intention of starting a war or using nuclear weapons 
while the iraqi ambassador pledged his country would only use 
chemical or biological weapons in case of nuclear attack 
the group offered to send a multinational team of doctors to 
iraq egypt israel and jordan to explain the possible effects of a 
nuclear war 
about 40 doctors or representatives of medical associations 
attended the meeting the first bringing together israeli and arab 
doctors to discuss the middle east crisis monning said 
the palestinian red crescent was represented by its president 
fathi arafat brother of plo chief yasser arafat hillel schenker 
attended on behalf of the israeli branch of the international 
physicians group 
no kuwaiti delegate was able to attend two iraqi doctors had 
planned to take part but were denied visas by the italian 
government monning said 
iraq precipitated the gulf crisis with its aug 2 seizure of 
kuwait a usled multinational force has since massed in the 
saudi arabian desert and on ships in the region to counter iraq

easterners afraid to come to california 
because of earthquakes should consider the risks at home 
new york boston and other eastern cities are gambling with 
catastrophes far worse than last years san franciscoarea 
earthquake if they dont prepare better for a major quake expected 
within 30 years an expert said monday 
the prediction from ian buckle deputy director of the national 
center for earthquake engineering research shook up a national 
quake conference two days before the anniversary of the oct 17 
1989 quake here 
the earthquake in the bay area last year is the writing on the 
wall for the east he told more than 300 scientists government 
officials and engineers this is a race against time and the 
odds of winning do not look favorable 
seismologists at the us geological survey estimate there is a 
64 percent probability of a quake measuring 60 on the richter 
scale occurring somewhere in the east within the next 30 years 
if that happens hundreds of thousands of apartment buildings 
are in danger of collapsing along with some bridges roads and 
railroad passes buckle said the result would be a huge number of 
deaths and injuries and tens of billions of dollars in damage he 
said 
new york city hit hard by a quake in 1884 could get some of 
the worst damage because of its poor soil in brooklyn and queens 
its dense population and thousands of older buildings of 
unreinforced masonry 
if the 1884 quake estimated at 59 on the richter scale much 
less severe than the 71 quake a year ago in the bay area were to 
occur again in new york it would cause 11 billion to 26 billion 
in damage buckle said a study has shown damage in the better 
prepared bay area was estimated at 6 billion 
and this is not thinking of fires because of broken water 
mains and the inability to control fires said buckle a 
professor of civil engineering at the state university of new york 
in buffalo 
skyscrapers built to withstand wind shear and long suspension 
bridges are less vulnerable he said 
mediumheight masonry buildings are common all along the 
atlantic seaboard where moderate and strong quakes have been 
recorded over the past 200 years charleston was struck by a quake 
estimated at 75 magnitude in the 1800s and boston had an estimated 
70 in the 1700s 
buckle said that because of a growing awareness of the 
earthquake hazard in the east some progress has been made 
massachusetts connecticut new jersey new york city and 
memphis tenn have adopted or are close to adopting seismic 
provisions in their building codes but he said that would affect 
only new structures 
the retrofit of critical existing structures and lifelines 
must be undertaken without delay he said 
in addition he said the dropandcover rules that california 
schoolchildren are taught should be taught to schoolchildren in new 
york and along the atlantic seaboard

to those americans who shrugged at the news 
that mikhail gorbachev won the nobel peace prize some experts on 
ussoviet relations say exactly right that makes the point 
we always said that they started the cold war and it was up to 
them to end it said michael mandelbaum director of eastwest 
studies at the council on foreign relations now theyve ended 
it the nobel prize simply recognizes that fact 
forty or 20 or 10 years ago thered be an uproar in america if 
the leader of the soviet state had been singled out for the prize 
and the title of peacemaker 
it would have been a slap at the united states and would have 
discredited the nobel peace prize for a soviet leader to have won 
it then mandelbaum said 
but the revolution that gorbachev made the event that brought 
him the prize made communism no longer much relevant in world 
affairs and the cold war no longer a reality shaping every aspect 
of american life 
i cant imagine anybody in this country would take it as a 
slap in the face today said john gaddis a diplomatic historian 
at ohio university in athens ohio of gorbachevs singular honor 
the things that were done in the soviet union last year were 
things only a soviet leader could do but they were things that 
weve been asking soviet leaders to do since the beginning of the 
cold war so we can only applaud 
for gregory treverton senior fellow at the council on foreign 
relations and a former member of the staff of the national security 
council the award raised questions about how long the honoree will 
be in office treverton said gorbachev like so many 
revolutionaries may be consumed by the flames he lit 
its hard to believe that he will be around for too many more 
acts in the soviet drama said treverton alluding to the 
economic and nationalistic unrest in the soviet empire hes 
likely to go down as a man who set forces in motion and then was 
overwhelmed by them 
diplomat winston lord who spent nearly three decades observing 
communist affairs at the state department pentagon and white house 
and as ronald reagans ambassador to china said gorbachevs honor 
reflects well on america too 
without taking away credit from the soviet leader he said it 
should be recognized that this country had a hand in persuading him 
to ring down the iron curtain and to curtail stalinist repression 
and marxist dogma at home 
one can debate to what extent his own domestic problems plus 
western firmness induced him to make the moves on the world scene 
that hes making said lord but the fact is objectively he has 
helped make the world less tense i believe the united states 
including presidents reagan and bush deserves credit for these 
developments as well 
if americans shrugged at the news soviet citizens probably did 
too said lord for many gorbachev is irrelevant and so are 
his foreign achievements at a time when russians are short of bread 
and see their economic system is a state of disarray 
the soviets are preoccupied with their own problems he 
said 
a cautionary note was sounded by helmut sonnenfeld a former 
associate of henry kissinger in the nixon administration events 
will yet determine whether gorbachev was a man who brought peace to 
his country he said 
it is a question of whether the soviet union dissolves in 
chaos or whether things improve he said gorbachevs own role 
may be diluted if it turns out the people of the soviet union start 
fighting each other and god forbid nuclear weapons get set off 
in the meantime sonnenfeld said the world in celebrating 
gorbachevs prize should not forget what 45 years of cold war 
meant 
a lot of people were treated miserably a lot died and we 
spent a huge amount of treasure and got involved in huge and costly 
wars he said that doesnt get swept under the rug

fines for corporate crimes should be based on 
the seriousness of the offense rather than the amount of 
illgotten gain or the financial loss to victims the justice 
department says 
the system we are advocating will result in stiff corporate 
sanctions said paul l maloney a deputy assistant attorney 
general who briefed reporters monday 
the departments position was contained in a letter to the us 
sentencing commission which is considering various ways to punish 
businesses convicted of crimes 
the sentencing commission was set up in 1984 when congress 
passed legislation aimed at ending disparity in sentences given to 
criminal defendants 
the commission has set guidelines for individual defendants that 
are based on the severity of the offense and any aggravating or 
mitigating factors such as a persons criminal history or 
acceptance of responsibility 
the justice department shied away from its earlier proposal in 
which companies involved in a massive fraud could be fined twice 
their gain or twice the loss to victims 
we no longer believe that this alternative maximum fine is 
appropriate since it is inconsistent with the approach of basing 
the fine on the seriousness of the offense attorney general dick 
thornburgh said in a letter to the commission 
the department rescinded its earlier position on corporate 
sentences after receiving an inquiry from the white house which 
had been lobbied heavily by business groups concerned about heavy 
fines 
at the time the attorney general said the views had been 
submitted without his knowledge or permission by thendeputy 
attorney general donald b ayer the dispute with ayer was one of 
several that contributed to his resignation last spring 
after a lengthy review the department reiterated its support 
monday for basing fines on the severity of a crime 
such factors as the knowledge or participation of top management 
in a criminal scheme the involvement of bribery or a history of 
corporate misbehavior would determine the crimes severity and 
therefore the fine 
companies that promptly report wrongdoing of employees and 
cooperate with government prosecutions would receive lower fines 
corporate lawyer victoria toensing who had argued against the 
earlier proposals called the departments proposal a sensible 
approach 
calculating fines according to mitigating and aggravating 
factors would help distinguish between responsible companies whose 
employees go astray and firms whose executives dont care about 
observing the law said toensing a former senior justice 
department official

sen mark hatfield has been a force in oregon 
politics for four decades but the republican now finds himself in 
a tough reelection fight after watching his comfortable lead 
plummet 
pouring on the pressure is businessman harry lonsdale a staunch 
environmentalist waging a television ad campaign that portrays 
hatfield as beholden to special interests 
hatfield is out of touch with oregonians on timber and abortion 
issues says lonsdale 
lonsdale also has raised questions abou possible conflicts of 
interest by the senators longtime chief of staff gerry frank 
the 67yearold hatfield who is seeking a fifth term wouldnt 
mention lonsdale by name in the early going now he is fighting 
back with a vengeance 
when people begin to attack your family and your friends it 
demonstrates to me that they have no issues no program and no 
vision says hatfield it is negative campaigning at its 
foulest 
lonsdale says hatfield is the negative campaigner 
the guy paints himself as mr clean but by god hes just 
one more washington insider lonsdale says he calls the senator 
the imperial mark hatfield for refusing to debate 
hatfield says debates are political theatrics he keeps in touch 
with voters by traveling extensively around the state he says 
oregonians deserve a debate we pay his salary complains 
lonsdale 
hatfield has never lost a political race and was regarded as 
invulnerable when the campaign began 
the alarms went off when a poll late last month showed 
hatfields lead had fallen sharply he led by six points in a 
survey carrying a margin of error of four percentage points 
that was a surge of 16 points for lonsdale since august 
hatfield said the latest poll has done for us what we couldnt 
do for ourselves it has dispelled over confidence among our 
supporters 
hatfields acceptance of campaign contributions from political 
action committees shows hes beholden to the rich and powerful 
says lonsdale who plans to spend as much as 600000 of his own 
money on the race 
but hatfield contends lonsdale is being hypocritical about the 
campaign finance issue as a wealthy businessman lonsdale can 
afford to make pious statements about not accepting special 
interest contributions says the senator 
lonsdale 58 runs a hightech company employing about 80 
people 
he said very clearly that anybody who takes pac money is on 
the take hatfield said hes saying that rich people are the 
only ones who can be impartial i think its a phony accusation 
the two also have clashed over timber supply issues 
hatfield said lonsdale wants to prohibit all logging in old 
growth forests he is supporting the basic concept of creating 
ghost towns in this state because hes going to lock up timber 
supply hatfield said lonsdale says hatfield is siding with 
timber interests in opposing a ban on log exports from private 
lands 
its estimated that if we keep all the logs here theyll 
provide 20000 jobs in oregon lonsdale said 
lonsdale also has hit hatfield on the abortion issue saying 
that hatfields opposition to abortion puts him at odds with 
largely prochoice oregonians hatfield said he is philosophically 
opposed to abortion and supports contraception and sex education 
programs to cut down on unwanted pregnancies 
lonsdales questions about frank center on the hatfield aides 
past position as a member of a savings and loan that later failed 
and on trips that he took at government expense

house and senate negotiators are edging closer 
to an agreement to control toxic industrial pollution one of the 
last hurdles to enactment of a clean air bill 
a house proposal on air toxics was presented to the senate late 
monday after house members decided to give the steel industry more 
time to comply with the pollution controls 
the house negotiating team had been divided on whether to accept 
the senate proposal to give steel companies an additional 20 years 
to the year 2020 to fully comply with the measure 
the house negotiators agreed monday to a provision similar to 
the senate plan congressional sources said the house and senate 
were largely in agreement over the broad outline of the toxic 
section of the bill 
the section on toxics which requires industry to cut these 
emissions by more than 90 percent over the next 10 years and 
another section on acid rain are the two major remaining issues 
housesenate conferees have been trying to craft a clean air bill 
since midjuly 
the acid rain provisions would require electric utilities to cut 
annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons 
much of the debate over acid rain is expected to concern the 
division of pollution credits among utilities in various parts of 
the country 
midwest lawmakers also are pushing for a change in the base 
figures for calculating how much sulfur dioxide will have to be 
cut they contend the current base figures will require emissions 
to be cut by substantially more than 10 million tons 
the steel industry has argued that the proposed pollution 
control requirements will force the nations coke ovens to shut 
down 
rep dennis eckart dohio who fought for special treatment for 
the steel industry said the industry would be faced with very 
tough standards 
environmentalists have acknowledged that coke ovens will need 
more time to comply with the toxic emissions requirements but 
opposed giving the steel industry special treatment beyond 2010 
the conferees earlier reached agreement on urban smog controls 
including pollution controls for industrial plants and automobiles 
as well as requiring the sale of cleanerburning fuels in cities 
with the worst smog 
agreement also was reached to phase out chemicals that harm the 
atmospheric ozone layer and on timetables for cities to reach 
federal air quality requirements

a republican lawyer is asking the state 
board of elections to investigate whether gov mario cuomo is 
illegally claiming new york city as his voting residence when he 
lives in albany 
the elections board was also asked monday to probe whether cuomo 
illegally voted by absentee ballot during the sept 11 democratic 
primary when he was actually in new york city 
election law says absentee ballots can only be used when a 
person knows hes going to be out of the city on election day says 
thomas spargo who filed the complaint in fact he said cuomo was 
in new york city on the day of the primary 
the complaint is an example of the hypertechnical silliness 
that cuomo is trying to change by simplifying state election law 
said gary fryer cuomos press secretary 
if cuomo were convicted of intentional voting fraud he could 
face one to four years in jail and up to 5000 in fines said 
david flanagan board of elections spokesman

while house members are trying to reduce the 
nations massive deficit theyre also voting to authorize new 
spending for projects that are too politically appealing to resist 
for instance 15 bills approved by the chamber monday would cost 
taxpayers about 3 billion over a number of years if the money is 
actually spent but the appropriations are not guaranteed 
all the bills were approved by voice vote they included 
measures to help veterans strengthen financial management in the 
federal government protect the environment in antarctica create a 
new federal agency and help the disabled 
the most expensive was the 26 billion veterans compensation 
amendments bill which would provide a 45 percent costofliving 
increase for those with serviceconnected disabilities 
the measure also would provide permanent disability benefits for 
vietnam veterans who suffer health problems that resulted from 
exposure to agent orange the herbicide used as a jungle defoliant 
another bill is designed to revise financial management systems 
in federal agencies and establish a us chief financial officer 
but in this case you have to spend money to save money additional 
audits under the bill would cost 10 million a year the potential 
savings have not been estimated 
the house authorized 3 million for measures that would protect 
the environment in antarctica 
a 4 million authorization would give taxpayers a new 
international cultural and trade center to create opportunities for 
us trade commerce communications and cultural exchanges with 
other nations it would be housed with other agencies in a new 
building at the federal triangle in washington 
another 251 million would be authorized in new programs for 
education and training for the disabled

talks constructive and useful in exploring concerns of both nations 
in making sure the june agreement is implemented 
you have to have these occasions so that one side can sense 
where the other side has its priorities dallara said in a 
telephone interview 
the us side said it raised questions in particular about 
japanese spending proposals on public works projects efforts to 
stiffen enforcement of antimonopoly laws and plans to conduct 
pricing surveys aimed at determining how much japanese consumers 
are being harmed by government policies that protect home 
industries 
the talks being held in boston were scheduled to conclude 
today 
for their part japanese negotiators focused on the current 
gridlock over reducing the us budget deficit which tokyo has 
targeted as a chief culprit in this countrys poor trade 
performance 
many economists believe that government borrowing to finance the 
deficit drives up us interest rates and thus makes it more 
expensive for american companies to raise the capital they need to 
modernize and become more competitive 
a senior administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the japanese expressed concern about the failure so 
far of us policy makers to reach agreement on a deficitreduction 
plan however the official said they were encouraged by the 
apparent willingness of the administration and congress to consider 
raising taxes to close the gap 
the official said us negotiators were pleased to see initial 
steps by the japanese to open up business opportunities for 
american and other foreign firms but they believed much more 
progress needed to be made particularly in eliminating the 
practice of keiretsu the interlocking arrangements between 
japanese companies that keep foreign firms out of the marketplace 
this weeks talks were to be followed by another session in 
early 1991 leading up to an interim status report expected in april 
or may 
the administration is counting on the structuralimpediments 
agreement to significantly reduce the trade deficit with japan 
which last year totaled 49 billion 
critics in congress however question how long it will take to 
show results 
sen max baucus dmont said monday that the japanese have 
failed to live up to many past marketopening agreements it is 
critical in this first round of talks to review the initiative 
that our negotiators emphasize that the united states expects japan 
to fully implement all commitments made he said 
baucus who chairs a senate trade subcommittee said that where 
compliance was lacking the administration must be prepared to use 
sections of us law that permit economic retaliation if barriers 
are erected to prevent sales of american products 
among the commitments made by japan in june were to increase 
public works spending reduce the time it takes to issue patents 
and begin vigorous criminal enforcement against bidrigging 
pricefixing and other anticompetitive business practices 
while past negotiations with the japanese have sought access for 
specific american industries the new talks sought to address 
fundamental problems in the american and japanese economies that 
have contributed to the trade imbalance

a governmental insider for more than 20 
years president bush comes across as an antiwashington outsider 
as he campaigns for republican candidates 
at stops in texas and nebraska on monday congress was the 
villain along with that insidethewashington dc beltway 
jargon 
more of the same was certain to follow today as bush campaigns 
in iowa illinois and michigan 
iowa voters were not kind to bush in 1988 they gave him an 
embarrassing thirdplace finish in the gop presidential caucuses 
and then backed democrat michael dukakis for president 
not one to accept rejection easily bush is asking iowans to 
back his choices this november republican gov terry branstad and 
rep tom tauke who is challenging democratic sen tom harkin 
in the latest iowa poll published sunday in the des moines 
register branstad was leading his democratic opponent don 
avenson by 19 percentage points 
but the same survey said harkin was 14 points ahead of tauke 
in illinois bush hopes to give a critical boost to jim edgar 
the gop candidate for governor who is in a close race with 
democrat neil hartigan gov james thompson a republican is not 
seeking reelection 
but as in iowa the gop prospects for upsetting an incumbent 
democratic senator were not bright 
polls show gop challenger lynn martin trailing well behind sen 
paul simon 
bushs last stop for the day was michigan where neither 
gubernatorial candidate john engler or gop sen challenger bill 
schuette were given more than longshot chances of upsetting 
democratic incumbents 
it was hard to tell from his stump rhetoric that bush has spent 
most of his adult life in such washington insider jobs as 
republican party chairman cia director un ambassador and vice 
president 
oh how nice it is to be out where the real people are 
outside of washington dc the president told a republican 
audience in omaha where he raised 250000 for gov kay orr 
the gop governor who alienated many voters when she pushed for 
a tax increase after a nonewtaxes campaign is trailing her 
democratic opponent by eight percentage points in the most recent 
poll 
what the states need is not more programs mandated from 
washington dc said the president 
texas and texans have the solutions he said in dallas 
give nebraskans a chance to solve the problems he said in 
omaha 
i honestly believe said the president if we had had more 
republicans in control of capitol hill over the last couple of 
decades this budget mess that were in right now would never have 
happened 
that partisan sentiment ignored the fact that budget deficits 
soared while there was a republican president ronald reagan 
working with a republicancontrolled senate 
as for the current budget crisis the president laid the blame 
on the democrats in control of congress even though much of the 
opposition to the bipartisan agreement rejected two weeks ago came 
from his on party 
but that is the way of campaign rhetoric and for all his jibes 
at the democrats in congress bush stopped far short of the attack 
rhetoric used by ally milder the gop candidate challenging 
democratic rep peter hoagland in nebraska 
milder described congress as full of rats gnawing at the ship 
of state 
throw the rats overboard she urged the partisan audience

fewer than one in five people in the united 
states believe things in the country are generally going in the 
right direction according to a new poll 
that response reported monday was the lowest since the 
washington postabc news poll began asking the question in 1982 
seventynine percent of respondents said they believed things 
have gotten pretty seriously off on the wrong track 
most people still approve of the way president bush is handling 
his job 56 percent but only a week before 65 percent approved 
in early september threequarters of respondents approved 
similarly the proportion approving the way bush is dealing with 
the economy fell from 53 percent in september to 38 percent during 
the survey taken wednesday through sunday 
bush still got high ratings for his handling of the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 64 percent but it was down from 78 percent 
in september 
respondents were asked whether they approved or disapproved of 
the way the president democrats in congress and republicans in 
congress were handling the deficit nobody won high marks 
compared with the previous week the presidents approve 
response fell to 33 percent from 38 percent the democrats fell to 
30 percent from 32 percent within the likely margin of error and 
the republicans fell to 23 percent from 33 percent 
the poll interviewed 1006 people selected at random in such a 
poll the likely margin of error is 3 percentage points either way

dugan remains on active duty and has been working as a special 
assistant to rice since shortly after defense secretary dick cheney 
demoted him on sept 17 said air force spokesman col joe purka 
the matter of dugans status arose after cheney said during a 
radio interview in london on monday that dugan is no longer in 
the air force 
however dugan a 32year veteran and former fighter pilot 
maintains his rank as fourstar general until president bush 
formally nominates him for retirement and the senate acts on the 
nomination purka said bush had not yet made the nomination 
if the senate does not act within 90 days of the date of dugans 
dismissal as chief of staff his rank would slip to major general 
purka said major general is two notches below general

legislation that would establish a chief 
financial officer to target wasteful spending in the bureaucracy 
has cleared the house over the bush administrations opposition 
the house passed the bill on a voice vote monday it now goes to 
the senate where similar legislation is pending 
rep john conyers dmich the bills sponsor said scandals in 
the department of housing and urban development and elsewhere in 
government could be traced to the deplorable state of the 
governments own management infrastructure particularly our 
financial management systems 
it is almost inconceivable that an organization which controls 
almost onefourth of the countrys gross national product has 
incompatible and outmoded financial management systems conyers 
said 
the bill would create a centralized and professional 
leadership structure at the office of management and budget he 
said 
the bush administration opposes the bill the omb said in a 
statement while supporting efforts to improve government 
management the bill would create confusion and blur the lines 
between the executive and legislative branches it said 
the administration favors establishing a deputy director for 
management and a governmentwide controller in omb as well as 
chief financial officer positions in each department the statement 
said

an ambitious plan to build a glittering new 
airport in britains last great colony has turned into a battle 
between beijing and london for political influence and billions of 
dollars 
the airport was supposed to be a parting gift 
now there are widespread worries that it wont open by the 
target date of 1997 when hong kong reverts to chinese rule 
some fear it will never be built at all 
the airports expense 16 billion by conservative estimates 
has prompted charges that it will be a cash cow for british 
companies 
its britains last great present to itself says gordon wu 
a leading hong kong businessman with close links to china its 
their license to print money 
these allegations provoke countercharges that china will not 
back the project unless it gets a substantial slice of the pie 
the controversy highlights fears that the colonial government is 
a lame duck that china already calls the shots in the territory 
the first works contract for the airport a 26 million deal for 
dredging went to a chineseowned firm 
beijings main reason for allowing hong kong to exist is so 
the goose can lay golden eggs said an american executive 
involved in the project the airport project is definitely a 
golden egg 
the latest chapter in the imbroglio concerns funding for a main 
item in the project a 4719foot suspension bridge that would be 
the secondlongest in the world and connect the airport to kowloon 
peninsula the side of hong kong located on the chinese mainland 
on friday chinese officials lashed out at hong kongs decision 
to fund the bridge from government coffers the move added further 
weight to chinese fears that london is treating the project as its 
last asian pork barrel 
ji pengfei the most senior chinese official in charge of hong 
kong affairs called the move unilateral and inappropriate and 
warned the hong kong government not to try any more tricks 
hong kong authorities defended the bridge and criticized one 
probeijing awyer in the territory for making a political 
speech against the airport 
hong kongs governor sir david wilson announced the airport 
plan last october saying it demonstrated britains commitment to 
hong kongs future 
the announcement came as the government tried to restore 
confidence in this territory of 57 million people severely shaken 
by chinas bloody crackdown on a prodemocracy movement in june 
1989 many people in the colony do not believe chinas promise that 
it will maintain hong kongs open economic and social system for 50 
years after it resumes control 
the airport plan one of the biggest engineering projects of the 
1990s includes flattening two hilly islands and connecting them by 
dumping 260 million cubic yards of rocks and sand into the ocean 
the centerpiece is the new airport on chep lap kok an island 
separated from downtown hong kong by 16 miles of open sea 
the airport would replace the current one kai tak on the 
kowloon peninsula famed for its wild landings some approaches are 
so harrowing that passengers feel theyre heading for an unwanted 
kiss with a poster of the marlboro man on a garage wall 
the new airport would operate 24 hours a day and handle 80 
million passengers a year more than three times the capacity of 
kai tak 
when the airport was announced zhou nan chinas top 
representative in hong kong demanded negotiations with the 
colonial government 
but after intense pressure from beijing the government relented 
and talks began monday in hong kong 
joseph ys cheng a leading educator and political observer in 
the colony predicts problems like the airport project will 
multiply in the next seven years 
china is staking a claim to exert control over hong kong not 
in 1997 he said but now

residents downwind from openair nuclear 
tests of the 1950s and 60s said they felt vindicated by the 
governments decision to pay up to 50000 compensation to those 
who may have gotten cancer from the radiation 
but some remained bitter monday after years of legal wrangling 
over the issue others doubted whether they would actually see any 
money 
president bush signed a bill during a campaign trip to dallas on 
monday that provides up to 50000 to cancer victims who were 
exposed to test radiation in three western states and up to 
100000 to uranium miners also stricken 
it also offers an apology to the victims the white house said 
victims do not have to establish scientifically that the fallout 
caused their cancer 
im glad theyre owning up to it said rula orton of 
parowan i feel very good about that ortons 14yearold 
daughter peggy died in 1960 of leukemia that her doctors believe 
may have been linked to nuclear radiation 
elmer pickett whose wife died of leukemia in 1960 was still 
bitter 
i feel those people who were running the atomic energy 
commission knew very well what they were doing to us up here he 
said from his home in st george 
theyre just as guilty of murder as those running the death 
camps in germany there should be some punishment there 
the number of victims or survivors eligible for the payments was 
not immediately known 
the united states conducted more than 200 atomic tests in the 
open air in the south pacific and nevada before they were outlawed 
by the test ban treaty of 1963 
rep wayne owens dutah who cosponsored the bill called 
those who lived downwind from the tests victims of the cold 
war 
elizabeth wright of the national association of radiation 
survivors said mondays action is vindication for her father 
arthur f bruhn the former president of dixie college in st 
george died of cancer in 1963 
he said someday theyll know these tests are killing me 
she said 
one of those who helped lead the fight for compensation former 
gov scott m matheson died of cancer last week he grew up in 
cedar city during the tests of the early 1950s his son scott 
said his father found it an interesting wrinkle that he too was 
diagnosed with a disease linked to the tests 
the downwinders won a federal lawsuit against the government for 
compensation in 1982 but it was overturned on appeal 
the bill signed by bush on monday provides compensation for 
people who developed cancer in certain time periods and 
spent one or two years depending on their type of cancer in 
downwind areas of nevada arizona or utah between 1951 and 1958 or 
were present in june or july of 1962 
or mined uranium in colorado new mexico arizona wyoming or 
utah from 1947 to 1971 
the bill authorizes placing 100 million in a radiation exposure 
trust fund for victims future legislation is needed to actually 
allocate the money 
sen orrin hatch rutah another of the bills sponsors said 
some payments could be made before the end of the year 
steve p foster a uranium miner from grand junction colo who 
lost part of his right lung to cancer was skeptical i suspect 
from my past association with the government i dont think we will 
ever get anything out of it he said

the king of tonga a bananaexporting 
south pacific island nation with 443 cars wants all the tires 
washington state can spare 
not to put them on cars but to burn them 
king taufaahau tupou iv sees mounds of rubber as the answer to 
his kingdoms quest for energy independence and is pounding on the 
governors door to cut a deal 
washington state has an estimated 30 million old tires which 
pose a major fire and environmental hazard that grows by 4 million 
to 5 million tires a year officials say but so far the state has 
been cool to the kings idea 
the king wants the state to spend 255 million up front to 
gather chip and ship the 30 million tires to his kingdom a group 
of islands about 3000 miles southwest of honolulu he also wants a 
guaranteed supply of old tires 
by taking the tires off the states hands the deal would lay 
a sound base for future trade and commercial development projects 
with tonga the king told gov booth gardner in a recent letter 
the king requested a meeting with the governor by months end 
but a gardner spokesman said monday he was too busy to meet anytime 
soon 
besides we want to be sure and be fair said dan youmans 
we are expecting other proposals by february on handling waste 
tires it wouldnt look right to meet with just the king 
the kings proposal and a similar request from the south pacific 
island of yap are drawing opposition from environmentalists who 
contend washingtons waste problem should not be exported to the 
third world 
but dale clark the states tire recycling coordinator at the 
department of ecology considers the proposal worth investigation 
he said the king has given assurances the tires would be burned 
only if the best pollution control technology were employed such 
technology is in use at a tire burning plant near modesto calif 
clark said 
tonga lives on tourism and banana exports as of 1983 the 
kingdom of 108000 people had 443 cars 
based on our plan to provide for future energy requirements as 
well as the present needs of tonga we would need a guaranteed 
supply of tires the king wrote 
in 1989 washington began collecting a 1 tax on every new tire 
for studies on tire disposal the fund has grown to about 2 
million but the department of ecology is still searching for ways 
to dispose of tires in an environmentally sound manner 
clark said some tires are chipped and used in highway asphalt 
others are made into truck floor mats tugboat bumpers and other 
products but the supply still overwhelms demand clark said and 
they pose a serious threat if they catch fire 
tire fires are extremely hard to fight and can burn for weeks 
their thick acrid smoke can make people sick and force 
evacuations 
an arsonist was blamed for a monthlong 1984 fire that burned 5 
million to 7 million tires in everett firefighters tried to douse 
the flames with water but the environmental protection agency made 
them stop saying the runoff was polluting a river nearby 
burning tires is an environmentally disastrous idea said 
joe thornton a toxics information specialist for greenpeace 
international in chicago 
tires are a complex stew of heavy metals chlorine and 
hydrocarbons the heavy metals arsenic lead mercury come out of 
the stack or wind up in the ash which becomes another disposal 
problem 
when burned toxic compounds such as cancercausing dioxin and 
pcbs are produced thornton said 
as has been amply demonstrated in this country the best 
technology is not good enough better equipment will not make the 
pollution problem go away he said 
let me ask you a simple question said ann leonard a 
spokeswoman for greenpeaces international waste trade project in 
washington dc 
if its environmentally safe to burn waste tires for energy 
why arent you doing it in washington ill tell you why because 
it isnt safe and people in your state wouldnt stand for it

you might call them postcards 
from the ledge 
artist nick agid carves messages into slabs of stone and mails 
them to politicians celebrities world leaders authors and fellow 
artisans 
using material left over from his sculpture work agid has 
lovingly etched more than 600 mineral missives out of onyx marble 
and granite 
it started out being a whim and it became a serious art 
project he says 
he spends about an hour chiseling a message into each polished 
stone always including a request for a reply 
the cost of mailing the four to fivepound cards is heavy up 
to 10 a throw and much more for international celebrities but 
agid doesnt mind 
the responses were so humorous it became kind of addicting to 
check the mail and see who wrote me back he said i got a 
letter from the pope and ted kennedy on the same day 
many who have gotten the rock cards including president bush 
elizabeth taylor director mel brooks author ray bradbury and 
actor vincent price have responded 
price sent his response on the inner sole of a shoe writing 
upon my sole ive never had such a heavy fan letter are you 
sure you have all your marbles 
from others iraqs saddam hussein for instance there has 
been stony silence 
rep dana rohrabacher rlos angeles known for his opposition 
to the national endowment for the arts cast stones at agids 
artistic endeavor 
the only true value something like your brick has is that 
which people will voluntarily pay for it he said thats why 
so many notalent artists end up seeking grants from the nea 
san francisco examiner columnist rob morse took the postal 
service to task for the way it handled his fivepound slab of onyx 
i still have the rock he wrote in his column it arrived 
in a plastic envelope and says damaged in shipment 
only the post office could damage a rock 
relations between agid and the postal service are indeed a bit 
rocky postal workers tend to balk when he shows up with as many as 
40 stone slabs to mail 
we were never mad at him said betty baker a clerk at the 
torrance post office its just we avoid him it takes so much 
time to mail his rocks it gets our counters real dirty 
at one point the postal service threatened to stop accepting 
agids mailings word was that one of his rocks broke a conveyor 
belt 
to smooth things over he sent a carved card to postmaster 
general anthony frank who wrote back it is always a pleasure to 
be contacted by one of our customers especially one as rocksolid 
as you are 
not wanting his yearold project to gather moss agid plans to 
put the responses hes gotten into a book 
i have brought a few laughs into the lives of the people who 
have gotten my cards he said after youve gotten a rock in 
the mail you never know what to expect from then on

news organizations appealed a decision by 
a federal judge to close jury selection at the trial of one of nine 
state lawmakers indicted in a votebuying scandal 
the move monday by us district judge falcon hawkins tightened 
the lid on coverage of the case of rep luther taylor the judge 
already had barred attorneys from discussing the case outside court 
and sealed records from the media 
hawkins said he feared prospective jurors might not answer as 
truthfully if reporters were present during questioning he also 
said open jury selection could affect cases against others charged 
in the fbi sting 
news organizations asked a federal appeals judge to stay 
hawkins ruling but he refused they then filed an emergency 
appeal before the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond 
va no hearing was immediately scheduled 
there has to be a balancing process so that any restriction on 
our right of access is as narrow as can be and still protecting the 
sixth amendment right of a fair trial said jay bender an 
attorney for the south carolina press association 
us attorney bart daniel took no position on the matter 
taylor 40 a democrat from columbia is one of nine state 
lawmakers indicted in august and september on charges of taking 
bribes in exchange for their support of a bill legalizing betting 
on horses and greyhounds 
some lawmakers were videotaped taking payoffs 
four lawmakers have pleaded guilty to bribery a fifth has 
pleaded guilty to a drug charge that resulted from the 
investigation 
taylors attorney joel collins did not ask that jury selection 
be closed but had sought the sealing of court records about taylor 
and other lawmakers 
collins had argued further disclosures about the case would make 
it impossible to find an impartial 12member jury 
seven jurors had been seated by monday night and bender said 
pretrial publicity apparently had not had a great effect on 
prospective jurors 
taylor who has served in the state house since 1983 is accused 
of accepting 4300 for supporting the betting bill if convicted 
he could get up to 120 years in prison and a 15 million fine

the things that were done in the soviet union last year were 
things only a soviet leader could do but they were things that 
weve been asking soviet leaders to do since the beginning of the 
cold war so we can only applaud john gaddis a diplomatic 
historian at ohio university on mikhail gorbachevs winning the 
nobel peace prize 
 
im glad theyre owning up to it i feel very good about 
that rula orton a utah resident whose daughter died of 
leukemia on the governments decision to compensate those who may 
have gotten cancer from radiation from openair nuclear tests

the uss midway the oldest of the 
navys 15 aircraft carriers is being dispatched to the arabian sea 
in support of operation desert shield naval sources say 
the 62000ton midway based at yokosuka japan and currently 
on maneuvers with japanese selfdefense forces will replace the 
uss independence next month the sources said on monday 
the sources who asked not to be named said they did not know 
why the world war iivintage midway was chosen for the deployment 
ahead of one of the navys newer carriers 
the ship has a limited operational capability compared to its 
larger more modern counterparts and has been marked for 
retirement for the last few years 
in addition the 64000ton ship has had problems since 1987 
when it underwent a 200 million overhaul designed chiefly to 
upgrade its ability to handle the f18 hornet attack aircraft 
the hull was redesigned with special blisters intended to 
improve stability in rough seas instead naval officials have 
said they cause the ship to porpoise in seas running more than 
five to eight feet making flight operations more difficult in such 
conditions 
us navy spokesmen declined comment on the reported deployment 
plan citing a policy against discussing the future movements or 
locations of us warships 
the naval sources said they did not know why the midway was 
chosen over newer and larger carriers for the desert shield 
deployment 
the midway built during world war ii but launched too late to 
see action has gone through several modernizations in its 45 
years to keep pace with newer flattops 
it has been based at yokosuka since 1973 the only us carrier 
based outside the united states it has had numerous assignments to 
the indian ocean and arabian sea including at least one stint 
during the 198088 iraqiran war 
it carries about 75 aircraft including f18s as6 intruder and 
a7 corsair attack bombers 
the ship reportedly will be accompanied by its usual battle 
group including the aegis missile cruiser uss bunker hill and the 
missile cruiser uss sterett 
the united states has three other carriers in the region the 
independence in the arabian sea the john f kennedy in the red sea 
and the saratoga in the eastern mediterranean 
the 80000ton independence based at san diego and sent to the 
arabian sea in july was already in the area when iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
since then its 70plus warplanes have flown regular patrols 
over the persian gulf and trained for possible action against iraq 
the independence made a twoday sortie into the persian gulf 
the first by an aircraft carrier since 1974

a number of sovietmade katyusha rockets fired 
from southern lebanon exploded in northern israel today but caused 
no damage or injury the military command said 
israeli forces returned fire to the source of the rockets an 
army communique added 
army radio said the katyushas were apparently fired by the 
fundamentalist shiite militia hezbollah or party of god from 
north of the buffer zone that israel maintains in southern lebanon 
last week a number of groundtoground katyushas were fired 
from lebanon but none reached israel

to help protect its northern border from guerrilla raids after it 
withdrew the bulk of its forces from lebanon after a threeyear 
occupation 
the zone is jointly patrolled by israeli soldiers and some 2500 
members of the south lebanon army a lebanesemilitia trained and

the highestranking south korean 
official ever to cross the armed border into north korea said today 
that he would propose that the rival countries officially recognize 
each other 
the first step toward improving bilateral relations must be 
above all else recognizing and respecting the existence of each 
other said prime minister kang youngkoon 
kang was to hold talks with his north korean counterpart yon 
hyong muk on wednesday in the second round of the highestlevel 
contacts between the rival koreas since the division of the 
peninsula in 1945 
the two met in seoul in september 
news reports said the two premiers embraced in a bear hug on 
meeting today in pyongyang the north korean capital 
we heartily welcome you here yon said 
we felt overwhelmed by a thousand emotions said kang who 
was born in the north and fled to the south as a refugee in 1945 
the 90member south korean delegation will return home on friday 
after two days of talks their agenda includes formal dinners and 
sightseeing 
in the south korean capital of seoul meanwhile more lawmakers 
joined opposition leader kim daejung in a hunger strike to demand 
democratic reforms kim leader of the party for peace and 
democracy was in the ninth day of his fast and 41 lawmakers have 
joined him in the past two days 
officials of the governing democratic liberal party indicated 
today they would make concessions on some opposition demands 
including moving up the date of local elections 
although the policymaking jobs of the prime ministers of the 
north and south are limited and their roles are largely ceremonial 
the talks hold symbolic value between two nations that view each 
other as enemies 
the border between the two koreas remains tightly sealed with 
more than 15 million troops on either side the nations fought a 
threeyear war in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was never 
signed 
south korea has recognized communist north korea as a separate 
countary but the north has steadfastly refused to recognize the 
south claiming that to do so would perpetuate division 
south korea has said hostilities will not end until both 
governments officially accept the existence of the other 
differences in ideology and system between the two parts of 
korea must no longer form a barrier dividing the people kang 
said at a welcoming ceremony at the government guest house where 
the delegation will stay 
just like the proverb saying that things begun are already 
half done lets make rapid progress and fulfill the desires of 70 
million people kang said 
in a separate move the north korean red cross proposed a 
resumption of talks on nov 15 to discuss the reunion of families 
separated by partition of the peninsula the red cross talks were 
broken off about a year ago 
an estimated 10 million people are separated from family 
members and the issue of reconciliation is emotional for both 
sides 
even as the two sides readied to meet north korean radio 
broadcast a statement threatening an end to the northsouth 
dialogue if south korea does not end its annual military exercises 
with us troops 
a demand to halt the team spirit exercises was one of three made 
by north korea in the first round of talks the north also demanded 
the release of dissidents jailed for visiting north korea and 
insisted the south halt efforts to join the united nations as a 
separate nation

nicaraguas consul a nephew of president violeta 
chamorro says he unknowingly solicited money for the contras in 
the 1980s from a drug trafficker but denies he received millions of 
dollars for cocaine shipments 
adolfo popo chamorro was accused during a trial in tulsa 
okla earlier this year of involvement in a gunsfordrugs 
scheme 
two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity have since said 
that chamorro along with octaviano cesar brother of a top aide to 
mrs chamorro are being investigated by the customs service and 
other agencies 
at a news conference monday chamorro said he met in 1984 with 
george morales who he thought at the time was a wealthy miami 
cuban sympathetic to the anticommunist nicaraguan rebels to gain 
support for the contras 
chamorro said that us officials authorized the contact and 
that he had no knowledge or involvement in drug trafficking 
but chamorro 41 abruptly ended the news conference when asked 
whether us authorities warned him that morales was under 
indictment on drug charges when the contras took cash and planes 
from him 
accusations linking chamorro with gunsfordrugs deals are 
not new in testimony before a 1987 senate committee morales said 
chamorro and octaviano cesar arranged a trade of guns and drugs in 
costa rica 
the accusations against chamorro lay dormant until testimony by 
colombian drug pilot fabio ernesto carrasco in a tulsa drug case 
seven months ago 
carrasco said he paid millions of dollars to chamorro and 
octaviano cesar to fly cocaine into florida on planes that returned 
to central america with arms 
morales is serving a 16year sentence

pittsburgh has acted to keep cigarettes out of youngsters hands 
by requiring the use of tokens in all cigarette vending machines 
while new york city moved toward banning the machines in almost all 
public places 
the token law was signed by mayor sophie masloff on monday it 
becomes effective nov 7 
in new york the city councils health committee voted 60 to 
ban cigarette machines in stores fastfood outlets and most other 
public places the proposal must still be approved by the full 
council and mayor david dinkins 
both measures are among the toughest antismoking proposals in 
the country 
we know that most smokers get hooked on the addictive quality 
of tobacco when they are young said new york city councilman 
joseph lisa chairman of the health committee 
the measure would allow cigarette machines to remain in taverns 
in hotel and motel bars and other establishments not open to 
everyone 
masloff said pittsburgh officials didnt ban the machines 
because they feared the courts would rule such action 
unconstitutional 
she said the vending machine industry has indicated it will 
challenge the new law designed to remedy the way cigarettes are 
available to practically anyone with loose change 
until a court tells the industry otherwise it will have to 
comply with the new law when it takes effect or remove their 
coinoperated machines from the city she said

a 3yearold girl whose father committed 
suicide rather than watch his family ravaged by aids has died of 
the disease a month after her mother 
the death of angela folsom on sunday left just one survivor in 
the family of jennifer folsom who made her battle with aids public 
this summer to show the disease can strike the traditional family 
in rural america 
mrs folsoms husband doug folsom committed suicide in june 
his wife said he was unable to bear watching the disease destroy 
the family 
angela had never learned how to walk and moved in with her 
grandparents after her mother died sept 3 
she was just worn down said fred kenney her uncle a lot 
of it was the transition of losing her mother and moving to another 
home 
i have mixed feelings he said mostly im glad that shes 
not in pain anymore because she had been on morphine of course we 
hate to see her go 
mrs folsom believed she contracted the disease through a blood 
transfusion during an emergency appendectomy in 1979 that was 
before blood supplies were tested for the virus 
she was diagnosed with the disease in 1988 and tests later 
found that angela also had aids another daughter 5yearold 
nicolette has not tested positive for the virus and is the sole 
surviving member of the family 
kenney said angela was hospitalized for four days last month 
after a feeding tube inserted into her stomach failed to heal 
properly in recent weeks she had received 24hour nursing care 
over the last three or four weeks she deteriorated just the 
way jennifer did kenney said 
kenney said nicolette who attended her mothers funeral is 
living with her grandparents but may move in with an aunt and 
cousin 
he said an art therapist visits nicolette twice weekly the girl 
once drew a picture of the sky with a rope hanging down to the 
house she told her mother it was god sending a rope for angela 
but shortly after her fathers suicide nicolette amended the 
caption saying it was for daddy 
she feels that she still has family kenney said im just 
hoping my parents can get through it and well go on from there

hooked on that pet fish of yours 
want to keep him in the swim of things as long as you can just 
send him to the fish doctor for a checkup 
more people are doing that these days said hugh bishop editor 
of pets supplies marketing magazine as word spreads that 
veterinarians can now treat fish with bath solutions and shots and 
even perform surgery on them 
fish are obviously something people do develop an affinity for 
and would look for some help if they develop a problem bishop 
said 
he also noted that some people pay as much as 1000 each for 
exotic fish 
john a shadduck dean of texas aampms school of veterinary 
medicine said fish studies have been added to his schools 
programs 
its part of our overall attempt to do two things diversify 
veterinary medicine and address a societal need he said 
but not everyone at the university thinks fish are best kept as 
pets 
student roger parker who works in food safety said the only 
treatment he usually gives fish is over a frying pan

for the second time in nine months a vandal painted antitax 
messages across the front of michels house of more than 35 years 
located in this illinois river city just west of downtown 
cut taxes deficit and repeal stolen pay raise were 
sprayed in green paint on the front of the home a dollar sign in 
the same green color was painted on the door 
its one thing for people to disagree with you on the issues 
of the day but to take it out on personal property its kind of 
disgusting said ray lahood chief of staff for michel 
michel was in washington at the time of the incident which 
police said happened between 1 pm saturday and 730 am sunday 
the first message appeared to be a comment on the raging deficit 
debate in congress and a proposed fiveyear 500 billion deficit 
reduction plan that michel supported 
the second apparently refers to michels support for a pay raise 
for members of congress and the executive branch approved last 
december 
no one was arrested in the incident and police had no suspects

days 
michel is unopposed in his bid for reelection to a 18th term in

a man who won the right to order an 
abortion for his comatose wife cannot sue the hospital and two 
antiabortion activists for damages a judge has ruled 
state supreme court justice harry hunter on monday dismissed the 
10 million suit filed by martin klein who sought the abortion 
after doctors told him it might help his wifes chances for 
recovery 
the judge also found that kleins suit against north shore 
university hospital was clearly retaliatory and said the 
hospital was entitled to have its legal fees reimbursed 
hunter set a hearing for nov 7 to determine the amount 
kleins lawyer jay dankner said an appeal was likely if klein 
is penalized at that hearing 
the suit filed in nassau county in june 1989 said the hospital 
and activists john short and john broderick caused emotional 
distress and cost klein more than 50000 in legal fees in 
court battles over whether the abortion could be performed 
but hunter ruled monday that the hospital acted properly in 
refusing to allow the abortion unless klein was appointed his 
wifes legal guardian by a judge 
the judge also found that short and brodericks actions did 
not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct 
in fact hunter wrote they effectively protected nancy 
kleins interests 
i feel vindicated because the court agreed with us that any 
time one defends life he is doing the right thing short said 
mrs klein who was about four months pregnant was injured and 
left comatose in a car accident in december 1988 
klein went to court in january seeking guardianship but 
broderick and short challenged him losing each time but appealing 
all the way to the us supreme court the high court refused to 
hear the case 
mrs klein 34 eventually emerged from the coma and lives at a 
rehabilitation center in oyster bay dankner said she is able to 
communicate and makes frequent trips home to be with her husband 
and daughter he said

president bush and gov terry branstad went jogging under the stars 
this morning 
the predawn outing caught some white house aides by surprise 
they scrambled to arrange the standard motorcade of staff and media 
to accompany the president 
but bush left without reporters shortly after 6 am and was 
well into his run by the time the press caught up with him at the 
des moines water works park he called out a greeting and continued 
running 
it was dark when he began and dark when he finished there was 
just a sliver of moonlight but the sky was clear and full of 
bright stars 
bush was in iowa to raise campaign funds for branstad and other 
republicans

as soldiers and their war machines mass 
across the desert in saudi arabia poised for battle with iraq the 
people of baghdad seem to merely shrug and go about their business 
restaurants on the banks of the tigris river are full until at 
least 9 pm serving their speciality of baked fish 
after dinner people retire to bars which are open a couple of 
hours longer streets lights keep the city aglow through the night 
theres little indication that the people of this city of 45 
million feel threatened by the possibility of war over iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
some say its fatalism or perhaps a sense of invicibility 
its a strange psychological buildup where many just cant 
perceive that anyone can attack baghdad an asian diplomat said 
on condition of anonymity there is either a total 
noncomprehension of the seriousness of the situation or many 
iraqis just dont care 
on an iraqi airways flight from amman jordan iraqi children 
clapped and chanted watan watan homeland homeland as 
the boeing 737 touched down at baghdads saddam hussein 
international airport 
do you see a war fear asked an iraqi businessman returning 
from amman the only city still connecting baghdad with the rest of 
the world following the un air and sea blockade in retaliation 
for the invasion of kuwait 
we are prepared for war but not afraid of it he said 
in downtown baghdad another iraqi pointed to the window pane in 
his office look at this he said during the war with iran 
we used to tape them so that splinters dont come but now there is 
no tape 
baghdad residents proudly tell how they lived through eight 
years of war with iran many dont seem to sense similar hardship 
or danger in the face of the arsenal at the disposal of the 
usled multinational forces camped in saudi arabia and patrolling 
the persian gulf and red sea 
you may call it arab sense of fatalism said an iraqi who 
like most people here spoke on condition of anonymity 
theyre used to the atmosphere of crisis but maybe they are 
underestimating the real power of the soldiers sitting across the 
border he said at least i know that if a war breaks out it 
will not be one of the weekend skirmishes it will be serious but 
arent we prepared 
iraqs army newspaper alqadissiya today discounted the 
possiblity of war before christmas saying president bush was not 
likely to allow american soldiers to come home in coffins during 
the holiday season 
there is little visible civil defense preparedness in baghdad 
where txis fill the streets by the hundreds very few soldiers are 
seen except to check a passing vehicle occasionally 
on sunday there was a wedding party at the sheraton hotel 
complete with a westernstyle band and dancing the women many 
with glittering jewelry and brightly colored silk and synthetic 
dresses swirled slowly around the floor with men in suits and 
ties 
despite the calm theres still the sense of unease that has 
been a hallmark of baghdad for years 
spontaneous laughter is rarely heard no one seems to joke 
there are no foreign newspapers books or magazines facsimile and 
telex machines are forbidden overseas telephone calls must be 
placed through operators at the local exchange 
the twochannel televison is full of reports of support for 
president saddam hussein and programs on how to grow more 
vegetables and raise poultry 
food markets are open and doing steady business but there are 
few takers at shops selling shoes and clothing 
in the bazaar shops still have stocks of canned food including 
beef corn and peas fruit mostly apples and oranges is much 
scarcer pepsi cola seems to be everywhere 
lifesaving drugs have disappeared from pharmacies since the 
blockade was imposed and the government has rationed nine items 
rice sugar wheat cooking oil tea soap laundry detergent 
dried beans and powdered milk 
each iraqi can purchase a monthly allotment that includes 9 
pounds of wheat 3 pounds each of sugar rice and cooking oil one 
bar of soap and 6 pounds of powdered milk 
arab bread flat and about the size of a big pancake is limited 
to three pieces per person a day at government cooperatives 
the food shortages are affecting no doubt but it is not 
biting yet one iraqi said we are getting used to the idea of 
eating less than the body needs at the same time no one is dying 
of hunger and there is no fighting over food

here are excerpts from the text of the 
citation issued in english by the swedish academy of sciences for 
the 1990 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences the prize went 
to americans harry markowitz merton miller and william sharpe for 
their work in the theory of financial economics 
equals 
financial markets serve a key purpose in a modern market economy 
by allocating productive resources among various areas of 
production it is to a large extent through financial markets that 
saving in different sectors of the economy is transferred to 
companys for investments in buildings and machines financial 
markets also reflect companys expected prospects and risks which 
implies that risks can be spread and that savers and investors can 
acquire valuable information for their investment decisions 
the first pioneering contribution in the field of financial 
economics was made in the 1950s by harry markowitz who developed a 
theory for households and companys allocation of financial assets 
under uncertainty the socalled theory of portfolio choice this 
theory analyzes how wealth can be optimally invested in assets that 
differ in regard to their expected return and risk and thereby 
also how risks can be reduced 
a second significant contribution to the theory of financial 
economics occurred during the 1960s when a number of researchers 
among whom william sharpe was the leading figure used markowitzs 
portfolio theory as a basis for developing a theory of price 
formation for financial assets the socalled capital asset pricing 
model or capm 
a third pioneering contribution to financial economics concerns 
the theory of corporate finance and the evaluation of companys on 
markets the most important achievements in this field were made by 
merton miller initially in collaboration with franco modigliani 
who received the alfred nobel memorial prize in economic sciences 
in 1985 mainly for other contributions this theory explains the 
relation or lack of one between companys capital asset structure 
and dividend policy on one hand and their market value on the 
other

defense secretary richard cheney opened talks 
today with his soviet counterpart on cooperation in the persian 
gulf crisis and the longterm course of economic and political 
reforms in the soviet union 
cheney and us ambassador jack matlock flying on an air force 
boeing 707 were welcomed at sheremyetevo airport by the defense 
minister marshal dmitri yazov and a soviet military band 
i look forward over the next few days to have the opportunity 
to visit with members of the soviet armed forces and to exchange 
views with marshal yazov and other soviet officials about important 
world issues that face both our two nations at the present time 
cheney said on arrival 
during the fourday visit he is to meet with president mikhail 
s gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze he will 
also inspect an elite airborne unit an air defense command post 
and a factory that produces mig29 jet fighters 
yazov visited similar military posts during a trip to the united 
states a year ago 
cheney speaking with reporters on the flight from london said 
he would ask gorbachev and his aides to explain what they are 
talking about in their longterm plans for economic and political 
reform 
the defense secretary a longtime hardliner toward the soviet 
union said he had reached no conclusions on whether gorbachevs 
reforms would transform the country 
but he praised the announcement monday that gorbachev had won 
the nobel peace prize saying i think it is appropriate 
cheney also told reporters on the plane he had no specific 
requests of the soviets in the standoff with iraq 
theyve got to make their own decisions he said 
the soviet union has not joined the multinational force but has 
supported its deployment and the embargo 
shevardnadze on monday told soviet lawmakers that the kremlin 
had no plans for participation in a military operation and 
assured them that any such deployment would require their approval 
cheney said the united stats was prepared for a long haul 
in the gulf and that troops would remain deployed there for as long 
as necessary 
he rejected the notion of a quick strike or any deadline for 
economic sanctions to succeed in forcing iraq to end its 
10weekold occupation of kuwait 
no one should make the mistake of assuming this is the kind of 
operation which will be over in a very short period of time 
cheney told reporters monday at a news conference in london 
the united states is prepared for the long haul if that is 
what it takes to get the job done he said 
in london cheney met with british defense secretary tom king 
and prime minister margaret thatcher 
from moscow cheney will continue to paris for the conclusion of 
his 10day mission

the galerie semaan crossing and motorists honked horns in 
jubilation as they drove through 
several cabinet ministers today compared the planned dismantling 
of the green line to the removal of the berlin wall 
the unification of the wartorn lebanese capital is the next 
step following saturdays end to aouns 11month mutiny aouns 
troops were crushed in a syrianled assault 
france granted aoun asylum saturday and french president

honor

french to turn him over 
the army posted an armored personnel carrier and 12 soldiers 
one equipped with tear gas canisters on a checkpoint about 300 
feet from the embassy in east beirut 
french diplomats said the measure amounted to a siege the 
french news agency agence francepresse quoted diplomats as saying 
large numbers of troops surrounded the embassy and closed all 
approaches 
reporters on the scene said the small checkpoint made no move to 
stop people from leaving or entering the embassy or block traffic 
in its vicinity 
presidential spokeswoman may kahhaleh said the ckeckpoint was 
set up to prevent antiaoun demonstrations near the embassy 
its purely a security measure to protect the embassy not to 
blockade it ms kahaleh said 
french ambassador rene ala met president elias hrawi twice 
monday to discuss the impasse over aoun 
civilians started returning to aouns former enclave in the 
christian area to repair damage caused during the lebanesesyrian

the lebanese armys military police were trying to keep the 
situation under control and protect civilians said a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified in line with regulations 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem said the government 
now has enough power to enforce implementation of last years 
peace pact which calls for disbanding all militias 
i hope that the government will not be obliged to resort to 
force to implement this he said 
he said dalloul and defense minister albert mansour were asked 
to set the mechanism for disbanding the various militias he 
did not elaborate 
aoun had rejected the peace plan agreed to last year that 
distributed power equally between moslems and christians he 
refused to accept the november election of hrawi by members of 
parliament and rebelled 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon it has 40000 troops 
in the country deployed in predominantly moslem regions 
aouns main objection to the peace plan was that it failed to 
include a timetable for a syrian withdrawal

in the first round of the local elections sept 30 less than 
the required 40 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in 
municipalities of more than 10000 residents on sunday there was

conclusive sept 30 more than 80 percent of the mayors and 
twothirds of the new council members chosen in those communities 
ran as independents

seen as reflecting discontent with the parties now in power and 
hungarys worsening economic situation 
in larger communities the main opposition liberal party the 
alliance of free democrats and the more radical league of young 
democrats made gains sunday but the centerright governing 
coalition led by the hungarian democratic forum failed to win wide 
support

democrats 142 by the young democrats and 289 by a free democrat

nelson mandela today welcomed the 
abolition of a basic law of south african apartheid but said the 
main issue toward ending segregation is allowing the black majority 
to vote 
the south african black leader spoke at a news conference on the 
first stop of a threeweek asian tour he was greeted monday in 
india with the pomp usually reserved for heads of state 
mondays end to a 37yearold law that segregated south african 
public facilities was a step forward mandela said but until 
equal voting rights are achieved any other change will remain 
peripheral mandela said 
mandela told a rally of 20000 people monday that the 
blackagainstblack violence in his homeland emanates from the 
war psychosis of living under apartheid 
mandela warned the clashes could undermine efforts to begin 
negotiations with the white minority government on ending the 
system of racial segregation 
about 800 people have been killed since august in fighting 
between followers of mandelas african national congress and the 
rival inkatha movement of zulu chief mangosuthu buthelezi 
the latest flareups were in the black townships around 
johannesburg and in the eastern province of natal the rivalry has 
claimed about 5000 lives since 1986 
he said the violence promotes white privileges and domination 
it engenders differences over a common humanity it is calculated 
to weaken the anc and abort the process of achieving a peaceful 
resolution of the conflict created and maintained by apartheid 
he said 
mandelas asian tour began in india where he said the worldwide 
movement against apartheid was conceived 
in 1954 india became the first country to sever diplomatic 
relations with south africa and to impose trade and travel 
restrictions 
mandela paid tribute to mohandas k gandhi who began developing 
his strategy of nonviolent resistance during his 21 years in south 
africa 
gandhi then a young indian lawyer founded the natal indian 
congress in 1894 to press for the rights of indians descended from 
indentured servants brought to work the sugarcane fields he left 
south africa in 1914 and led indias campaign for independence from 
britain 
mandela said the antiapartheid movement was based on the 
gandhian philosophy 
mandela was released from prison in february after 27 years 
internment for plotting the overthrow of the government he was 
elected the ancs deputy president 
indian leaders pledged monday to keep up pressure on the 
government of president fw de klerk until it adopted irrevocable 
steps toward dismantling apartheid 
prime minister vp singh gave mandela a check for 800000 and 
said more money was being set aside for aid to his movement news

abdallah hsein a bearded auto mechanic is not 
afraid of an iraqi chemical attack god he says will decide if he 
lives or dies 
yet like most of the 5000 arabs in the south jerusalem village 
of beit tsafafa he stood in line to get his gas mask monday the 
first day of nationwide distribution of the protective kits 
handing out the masks to palestinians points up the 
contradictions the israeli army faces in dealing with arabs in 
jerusalem 
the government considers the residents of beit tsafafa israeli 
citizens but many see themselves as enemies of the jewish state 
some youngsters receiving the masks in the arab village said theyd 
been teargassed by the army for stoning soldiers 
the government decided earlier this month to hand out the masks 
to israels 47 million citizens in case iraqi president saddam 
hussein makes good on his threats to attack israel with chemical 
weapons 
israel today began training palestinian doctors in the occupied 
territories on how to prepare for a chemical attack officials of 
the israeli military government said 
lt col shmuel ovenboy spokesman for the military government 
said the training was launched because israel is responsible for 
the residents under its administration 
masks are also being purchased for the 17 million palestinians 
in the territories the army says although the government has not 
announced plans for distributing them there yet 
last week the army tested its distribution network for gas 
masks in three small jewish towns on monday it opened some 400 
stations throughout israel hoping to distribute two million masks 
by the end of the week 
residents of beit tsafafa trickled into a community cewnter to 
be among the first arabs to get the masks 
a halfdozen paramilitary border police armed with m16 assault 
rifles and clubs were on guard a sign that not all is peaceful in 
beit tsafafa 
some houses halfhidden amid dusty olive trees flew black 
flags from rooftops in mourning for the 19 arabs killed by police 
on the sacred temple mount in jerusalem on oct 8 
the killing wont go without revenge said hsein the 
mechanic who lined up for a mask i dont think any relative of 
those harmed in the attack will be satisfied by getting a gas 
mask 
for hsein getting the mask is proving our right as arabs who 
are living in israel and paying taxes 
the arabs of beit tsafafa are an acute double loyalty case 
until israel captured the arab sector of jerusalem in 1967 the 
border that divided the city divided the village one quarter was 
israeli the rest jordanian 
today many of the villagers support saddam the village has 
lost two people in the nearly threeyear palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule 
saddam o hero strike with chemicals a cluster of children 
defiantly sang into the microphone of an israel army radio reporter 
outside the gas mask distribution center a boy waved a toy pistol 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip unlike in arab 
sectors of jerusalem palestinians will have to buy the gas masks 
rabiha alayan a smiling darkhaired secretary who lined up for 
masks said she was not afraid of a chemical attack if it comes 
and somebody remains on the earth after that she said it 
may change the situation in the area make things better 
mrs alayan came to the center only because of her three 
children 
dozens of children and adults were trying on the masks and 
listening to arab instructors as uniformed army officials handed 
out boxes with protective kits 
hsein was unimpressed i think these masks will not be good 
against saddams chemicals he said even if saddam attacks 
with chemical arms im not afraid there is god and he decides if 
i live or die

the foundering campaign of pierre rinfret 
threatens the republican party with more than another big loss to 
democrat mario cuomo in the new york governors race 
some republican leaders say there is a chance albeit slim that 
gop defections and voter apathy could allow conservative party 
candidate herbert london to outpoll rinfret on election day 
beyond the psychological blow of a thirdplace finish for the 
republicans such an outcome would have practical political 
consequences the gop would lose its no 2 ballot spot row b to 
the conservatives for at least the next four years 
election experts maintain that higher ballot spots attract more 
votes 
it would be absolutely outrageous if the republican party were 
to drop to row c said republican state sen roy goodman 
i think its slight but i think that the possibility of voter 
apathy coupled with some of these defections does pose a 
threat goodman said 
gop leaders also are concerned about the impact on crucial state 
senate races if rinfrets stumbling campaign causes rankandfile 
republicans to stay home on nov 6 
republicans control the state senate 3226 with three vacancies 
a democratic majority in the senate likely would give the party 
complete control over the redrawing of congressional and 
legislative districts next year 
robert haggerty the senate gops chief political strategist 
said party loyalty should protect the gop ballot status but he 
said the remote possibility that london could best rinfret was 
something weve got an eye on 
haggerty said that to protect the gops ballot spot and gop 
senate incumbents at least 400000 would be spent on a 
getoutthevote campaign 
a september poll by the marist college institute for public 
opinion found that 60 percent of those surveyed favored cuomo while 
less than 15 percent backed rinfret london was at 4 percent 
however marist pollster lee miringoff said london may be 
picking up strength because of republican voter dissatisfaction 
with rinfret 
its unlikely republicans will come in third but the only 
thing that keeps them in the running at this point is the strength 
of the party line miringoff said 
were the conservatives to claim the second spot on the ballot 
they would be able to fill several hundred patronage jobs on boards 
of elections at the state and county levels 
london joked about that prospect 
there probably arent enough conservatives to fill all those 
jobs he said 
there are more than 100000 enrolled conservatives in new york 
and about 39 million democrats and 26 million republicans 
the gop defections to london include us housing secretary jack 
kemp and lewis lehrman the gops unsuccessful candidate for 
governor against cuomo in 1982 
rinfret was a politically unknown economist when desperate party 
leaders recruited him to run after several prominent party members 
declined to challenge cuomo 
last month rinfret said his campaign was broke and threatened 
to quit the race because party leaders hadnt supported him 
politically or financially 
rinfret has riled gop regulars with a series of outspoken 
remarks 
he called kemp a lackey for governor cuomo and said state 
senate majority leader ralph marino was in bed with cuomo on 
raising state taxes and spending goodman was labeled one of the 
most destructive people in the state by rinfret rinfret called 
other republicans who refused to run against cuomo gutless 
wonders 
bizarre behavior said richard rosenbaum a member of the 
republican national committee 
goodman suggested rinfret needed a rest 
london has been quick to take advantage of rinfrets problems 
it looks like something produced by saturday night live he 
said of rinfrets campaign the republican party is quite 
obviously in desperate shape

a half dozen demonstrators opposed to us 
military involvement in the persian gulf poured a quart of oil onto 
a patio in front of the american petroleum institute today to show 
support for a marine who refused to be sent to saudi arabia 
the protesters read a message from the 22yearold marine cpl 
jeffrey paterson who is confined to his base in hawaii awaiting a 
courtmartial 
patersons message urged other americans to join him in saying 
hell no we wont go we wont fight for texaco 
two counterdemonstrators also showed up 
david almasi who said he worked in a building next door came 
to the lunchtime rally with a handmade sign asking why did jeff 
paterson join the marines to surf or the free paycheck 
his companion leslie carbone carried a marine corps flag 
paterson supporters said demonstrations als were planned on his 
behalf today in san francisco houston seattle honolulu new 
york orlando fla and australia 
the protest came just hours after president bush on a campaign 
trip in iowa was interrupted by three young men who urged him to 
bring our troops home 
the demonstrators here who were outnumbered by reporters at one 
point poured the quart of 30weight motor oil after facing toward 
the 9th floor offices of institute and shouting antiwar slogans 
we are here at api because api is the lobbying arm of the oil 
industry in the united states and they are asking these young guys 
to go and die for the oil industry said clark kissinger a 
member of the national council of the organization refuse amp resist 
bill wordham a spokesman for api said the organization would 
have no comment 
cynthia briggs also a member of refuse amp resist read the 
message from paterson in which he said 
there are no guarantees that anything we do will make any 
difference at all maybe the best thing to learn from the 
military is that the best defense is a good offense its time that 
we take the offensive 
paterson from hollister calif is apparently the first marine 
to file conscientious objector status to avoid combat duty in the 
gulf he has been confined to his base awaiting trial since a 
federal judge ordered him removed from a brig

a group of archaeologists is searching 
a wooded area minutes from downtown for evidence that spanish 
explorer hernando desoto visited chattanooga 450 years ago 
every weekend members of the chattanooga regional 
anthropological association head across the tennessee river from 
downtown and sift through the soil at moccasin bend for spanish 
artifacts 
theyre looking for proof that desoto visited indians there in 
1540 while searching for gold silver and jewels in a threeyear 
expedition across the southeastern united states 
historians know that the explorer ventured into tennessee and 
that spaniards made contact with local indians but they are not 
sure whether the two events coincided 
he either came through the sphere of influence of chattanooga 
just to the east or he marched into it and made contact and perhaps 
stayed as long as a month in its towns dealing with its chieftains 
and extorting corn and other provisions for the army said major 
mccollough association president 
chattanooga obviously was one of the great focuses of later 
spanish trade and by implication as much as anything some of the 
earliest contacts the difficulties are that desoto himself only 
brought a small inventory of goods to present 
the archaeologists with thig at hampton place a wooded area on moccasin 
bend that 
was the site of one of several mouse creek indian villages that 
once dotted the banks of the tennessee river in southeast 
tennessee 
the first evidence of spanish contact at moccasin bend was found 
in 1915 by an archaeologist named clarence moore who spent a year 
digging at sites along the tennessee river between paducah ky 
and knoxville 
in the 1970s vandals and grave robbers seeking indian artifacts 
plundered the area across the river from chattanoogas business 
district leaving craters that still scar the site 
that prompted the creation of the anthropological association in 
1982 the group eventually found enough traces of pottery stone 
tools and arrow points to confirm the villages existence and 
configuration 
evidence shows hampton place contained a plaza houses trophy 
poles and a burial area all surrounded by a stockade well in view 
of the river mccollough said 
we knew even from the little bit that was known that it was a 
big and important historical complex that nobody had ever taken a 
serious look at or tried to define mccollough said 
in 1986 the 960acre moccasin bend site was designated a 
national historic landmark last year the state bought nearby 
williams island and declared it a protected state archaeological 
area 
the association has uncovered about 50 archaeological sites at 
the two locations including the buried remains of indian houses 
that have been dated to 1540 and 1530 
both houses yielded spanish artifacts and mccollough thinks the 
recent discovery of another buried house in the moccasin bend 
village could produce even mre 
but even if the national geographic project which will run 
through next spring does not find proof of desotos visit 
mccollough said it wont be a failure 
its so important so unusual mccollough said of the 
moccasin bend site so basically were just working to have it 
understood and protected for the short run hopefully so its real 
value is understood and it has a chance to survive for good

brain cancer has increased by up to 500 
percent among elderly americans a trend that an expert at the 
national cancer institute calls alarming because the disease is 
almost always fatal 
it once was considered that brain tumors reached a peak rate 
among people in their 30s and then would rapidly decline in the 
older population but it now appears that the incidence continues 
to increase with age said nigel h greig a national institute 
on aging researcher i think it is alarming 
in a study to be published wednesday in the journal of the 
national cancer institute greig and three coauthors report that 
the rate of brain cancer appears to have increased by up to sixfold 
for elderly age groups in 1985 compared to the rates measured from 
1973 to 1974 
for persons aged 75 to 79 the rate increased 187 percent the 
study finds for those aged 80 to 84 the rate went up by 394 
percent and the rate of increase was 501 percent for those aged 85 
and older 
primary brain cancer rates showed little change in 1985 among 
younger us population groups said greig 
in virtually all other age groups the incidence rates were 
approximately the same as in 1974 he said but these groups 
the elderly had a dramatic increase it is a large rise over a 
10to15year period 
brain cancer is relatively rare in the population as a whole 
representing only about 15 percent of the total new cancers 
diagnosed annually each year there are about 15000 brain cancer 
patients in all age groups 
incidence of all types of cancer among all us population 
groups rose 107 percent during the study period greig said 
the study measured only primary brain tumors cancers that 
started in the brain and were not spread there from tumors 
elsewhere in the body the most common primary brain tumors among 
the elderly were glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma two 
extremely dangerous forms of cancer 
it the brain tumor increase is alarming from the point of 
view that it is a lethal disease with a dismal prognosis said 
greig it is also alarming because treatment is not particularly 
good right now and its alarming that with the treatment that 
there is the survival time of the elderly is poorer than for the 
young patient 
half of all patients are dead of such tumors within 10 months 
he said 
improved diagnostic techniques may explain some of the increase 
in brain cancers found among the elderly greig said since the use 
of xray computed tomography or cat scan became widespread in the 
late 1970s brain tumors are more easily detected precise 
diagnosis before cat scans depended upon invasive techniques such 
as intercranial biopsies that were usually not performed on the 
elderly he said 
stanley i rapoport a coauthor in the study said the increase 
may also come from a greater interest in the health of the elderly 
since the 1970s 
people then essentially gave up on the elderly he said 
they didnt spend much time evaluating their mental 
dysfunction 
now with a greater interest in alzheimers disease said 
rapoport doctors tend to seek a precise diagnosis for brain 
disease symptoms among the elderly 
but greig and rapoport both said they believe at least part of 
the detected increase in brain cancer is not a result of sharper 
diagnostics 
we feel that there is a true increase and were are trying to 
determine just what that is said greig 
as to the cause rapoport said there is a possibility that it 
is environmental factors to which we are all exposed but we dont 
know that yet 
other coauthors in the study were lynn g ries of the national 
cancer institute and rosemary yancik of the national institutes of 
health 
the national institute on aging and the national cancer 
institute are both part of the national institutes of health

make news and make it before noon or at least by 1 pm 
says schenker by midafternoon everyone is editing videotape 
raise as much money as possible before jan 15 the financial 
disclosure deadline thats when reporters write their stories 
and you have to have raised enough money by then to demonstrate to 
everyone that youre a serious candidate fleischer says

strategy is deciding whether to have buttons or bumper stickers 
things not to do 
waste reporters time come up with quotable quotes and 
count the number of words in them says schenker you can speak 
about three words a second and 180 words a minute for television 
15 to 40 words is quotable 
look at the camera look at the interviewer television 
captures the interaction between people says schenker and if 
you look at the camera you might not be looking at the right 
one 
overextend yourself look at yourself in the mirror every 
morning and repeat i cant do everything advises messinger 
messinger also told the candidates that before getting started 
they should go out and shake hands with some strangers 
if you cant do that you shouldnt run she said

cuba has informed us diplomats that it is 
lowering from 55 to 45 the minimum age for cuban men to visit 
relatives in the united states the requirement for women was 
reduced from 50 to 40 years officials said tuesday 
us officials said the cuban move to increase traffic between 
the two countries may have been prompted by cubas desire to 
increase hard currency holdings alternatively the officials said 
cuba may be hoping that large numbers of those who leave will never 
return to the island thereby easing housing and other shortages 
we could be faced with a legal mariel said one official 
referring to the boat lift 10 years ago that brought an estimated 
125000 cubans without documents to florida 
the official added that us consular officials will have to 
issue visas on the basis of whether they believe applicants are 
going to remain in the united states 
if we think hes an intending immigrant we wouldnt issue a 
visa the official said 
there was no immediate comment from cubas diplomatic mission 
here 
the us officials asking not to be identified said the 
liberalized travel rules most likely have an economic motivation 
because of the steady decline in the cuban economy 
reductions in the delivery of oil and other goods by the soviet 
union to cuba has forced the government to take draconian austerity 
measures cubas ability to import has been severely restricted by 
low levels of hard currency holdings 
regular air service between the united states and cuba was 
suspended three decades ago but there are three l1011 
humanitarian flights a week between havana and miami each 
carrying a maximum of 316 passengers they permit elderly cubans to 
visit their us relatives and also allow cubanamericans to visit 
family members on the island 
in the latter category cuba has increased the number 
cubanamericans permitted to travel to cuba each year from 2500 to 
5000 the officials said 
cubans visiting the united states are permitted by their 
government to return with a maximum of 500 they are required to 
exchange their dollars for pesos at the official rate 
immigration has been a sore point in uscuban relations for 
years under a 1987 agreement between the two countries cuba 
claimed the united states committed itself to accept 20000 
emigrants a year from cuba 
us officials denied that any such commitment was made 
pointing out that immigration levels are based on whether a 
wouldbe emigrant has close relatives in the united states who are 
us citizens 
many cuban immigrants have never become us citizens thereby 
reducing the number of cubans still on the island who would qualify 
for permission to emigrate us officials said about 3500 cubans 
have been emigrating annually to the united states former 
political prisoners are treated as a separate category an average 
of 3000 have been admitted annually as refugees

a defiant israel on tuesday rejected appeals by 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd to find a way to cooperate 
with a un inquiry into the temple mount killings 
however jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said he was willing to 
meet with a un factfinding team if it comes to israel to look 
into the fatal police shootings of at least 19 palestinians on oct 
8 
i think that i am secure enough in our intentions and with 
the situation in jerusalem that whoever comes here i can receive 
them and answer them kollek told israel radio not to do this 
doesnt portray strength it portrays weakness 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
shamir was cool to kolleks idea a mission that comes to israel 
should see the government and not mayors he said 
hurd met separately tuesday with shamir and foreign minister 
david levy urging them to find a way to compromise on the un 
inquiry 
pazner said shamir refused he quoted the prime minister as 
saying this resolution deals with the question of jerusalem 
which is our capital and we dont see any reason for the united 
nations to investigate here 
government officials said hurd in his meeting with levy 
suggested that israel separate the un security council 
condemnation of the temple mount shootings from the call for an 
investigation 
the british foreign secretary said israel could reject the 
criticism but agree to see a un factfinding team according to 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
hurd who plans to meet with palestinian leaders on wednesday 
refused to tell reporters about his meetings with shamir and levy 
levy told reporters that the un resolution on the inquiry 
places demands that israel cannot accept under any 
circumstances 
he added the basis of this un delegation was a serious 
indictment against israel before the facts were checked 
israel has been under increasing pressure to accept the un 
inquiry into the shootings at the temple mount known to arabs as 
haram alsharif more than 140 palestinians were wounded in 
addition to the deaths 
president bush made it clear monday that he wants israel to 
cooperate with the united nations we want to see that un 
resolution fully implemented bush said 
the israeli cabinet decision sunday to reject the un 
resolution came despite an appeal by us secretary of state james 
a baker iii baker said that rejecting the inquiry would detract 
from international efforts to solve the persian gulf crisis 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar says he has not 
yet decided if he will send a factfinding team to israel 
several israeli newspapers published editorials tuesday urging 
the government to allow the un investigatation 
the daily yedioth ahronoth noted that the government allowed a 
visit by hurd although he and his people were the architects of 
the security council resolution against us 
levy said the unanimous security council decision ignored the 
fact that police fired on the temple mount because palestinians had 
stoned jews worshiping at the nearby western wall judaisms 
holiest site 
palestinians have maintained that the stoning was provoked by 
rumors that an extremist jewish group was marching on the temple 
mount mosques to symbolize israeli control 
israel has rejected any move that would call into question its 
sovereignty over all of jerusalem including the arab eastern 
sector captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the annexation has not been accepted by the united nations or by 
most western countries including the united states 
seymour reich chairman of the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations told a news conference here he was 
assured by shamir that israels own investigation of the killings 
would be completed next week 
it very well may be this report may be made available to the 
united nations and hopefully it can be utilized by the united 
nations and may satisfy the needs of the security council reich 
said 
the government has appointed a threeman independent panel to 
investigate the shootings

the united states raised the ante in the war 
against terrorism tuesday announcing that rewards up to a possible 
4 million will now be paid to obtain information on major 
terrorist operations 
secretary of state james a baker iii who announced the 
increase also launched a radio and television campaign featuring 
actors charlton heston charlie sheen and charles bronson 
encouraging the public to help develop information leading to the 
arrest or conviction of terrorists 
under the new program the 2 million in reward money previously 
provided by the federal government will be bolstered by donations 
of 1 million each from the air transport association representing 
the us airline industry and the airline pilots association 
representing 42000 commercial pilots 
the 2 million contributed by the airlines and pilots is 
earmarked for rewards for information involving terrorist attacks 
on us civil aviation 
the expanded rewards campaign comes amid increasing concerns 
that iraq may launch or inspire terrorist attacks against western 
targets in retaliation against the united nations economic blockade 
ordered after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
obviously we are quite concerned about the threats that have 
emanated from baghdad baker said we will be very alert to 
the possibility that there will be an expansion of terrorism 
worldwide 
such acts as the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland and last weeks assassination of the speaker 
of the egyptian parliament baker said are meant to seize us 
with horror to bring daily life to a standstill to hold entire 
nations hostage 
even as we recoil in horror at the carnage there are ways 
that governments and citizens can work together to ensure that the 
warped psychology of the terrorist does not dominate our lives or 
distort our policies baker said 
every government and every citizen has a stake in bringing 
terrorists to justice he said adding that the rewards program 
can play a key role 
baker disclosed that 500000 in rewards were paid out last year 
for information about terrorists and their operations 
he declined to give details saying they are classified to 
protect the informants 
we can also relocate people who provide helpful information 
and thats been done he said 
the television and radio commercials have been produced in six 
languages english french german spanish arabic and greek each 
encourages the sending of information concerning terrorism and asks 
the question are you the next hero 
state department officials said they are negotiating with us 
radio and television networks to broadcast the commercials free of 
charge and that at least one television network thus far has shown 
interest they did not identify the network the officials said the 
us information agency and us diplomatic missions overseas would 
make efforts to have the spots shown in other countries 
persons not wishing to approach a us embassy or consulate are 
urged to write heroes box 96781 washington dc 200906781

three americans who gave investors 
stockholders and corporate directors a better understanding of the 
intricate financial markets won the nobel memorial prize in 
economics tuesday 
harry f markowitz of the city university of new york merton 
miller of the university of chicago and william sharpe of stanford 
university will share the prize worth about 700000 
since the prize in economics was first awarded by the swedish 
academy of sciences in 1969 18 of the 30 winners have been 
americans 
there has been a very powerful and rich development of finance 
economy as a scientific subject and that was a main reason for 
giving them the prize said academy committee member bengt 
naslund 
the academy said financial markets serve a key purpose in a 
modern market economy by allocating resources to various production 
areas 
its important that these markets function efficiently that 
they can really only do if we have a proper understanding of 
them naslund said 
therefore he said markowitz sharpe and miller made an 
essential contribution which concerns us all 
miller 67 said he thought it was a crank call when committee 
chairman assar lindbeck called him early tuesday with the news 
i picked up the phone and you dont hear anything and 
suddenly i hear a voice with a swedish accent and my heart stopped 
a bit he said 
lindbeck said miller and sharpe were really stunned by the 
news but recovered enough to ask about the exchange rate for 
kronor 
the academy deayed announcing the prize for about 45 minutes 
while trying to reach markowitz in japan where he begins teaching 
a course wednesday at tokyo university but reporters found him 
first 
id thought it was never going to happen the 63yearold 
markowitz said 
markowitz developed a theory in the 1950s explaining how 
households and companies choose shares and reduce the risks 
involved the socalled theory of portfolio choice 
his theory analyzes how wealth can be optimally invested in 
assets which differ in regard to their expected return and risk 
and thereby also how risks can be reduced the academy said 
markowitz published his pioneer works in 1952 and 1959 sharpe 
and miller drew on his theories 
my work follows harry markowitz said sharpe reached in 
arizona he was my mentor i owe him a huge debt 
sharpe 56 developed the capital asset pricing model in the 
1960s it is considered the backbone of modern price theory for 
financial markets 
the model helps in calculating capital costs associated with 
investments and takeovers regulating public utilities and deciding 
court cases involving expropriated firms whose shares are not 
listed on stock exchanges it is also used in empirical analysis to 
arrange statistical data systematically and efficiently 
miller showed what factors determine a companys choices in 
accruing debt and distributing assets 
he underscored the important relationship between a company 
and that same capital market which the other two prizewinners 
analyzed naslund said 
millers theory is based on the assumption that stockholders 
have access to the same capital market as firms as a result 
corporate managers saw that the best way to safeguard the interests 
of stockholders was to maximize the firms net wealth 
miller initially collaborated with 1985 economics prizewinner 
franco modigliani of the united states 
our work was known as the modiglianimiller propositions of 
corporate finance miller said he then won it the prize for 
his contributions with me but also for his other work in 
economics 
the economics prize was instituted in 1968 by swedens central 
bank to complement the five prizes established in the will of 
dynamite inventor alfred nobel nobels original prizes in physics 
chemistry medicine peace and literature have been awarded since 
1901 
the nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced 
wednesday 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was awarded the peace 
prize on monday mexican poet and essayist octavio paz won the 
prize in literature and americans joseph e murray and e donnall 
thomas won the prize in medicine 
the prizes are presented dec 10 the anniversary of nobels 
death in 1896

a private research group asked the internal 
revenue service on tuesday to investigate the taxexempt status of 
the national merit scholarship corp contending it discriminates 
against women and minorities 
the national center for fair amp open testing known as fairtest 
said only those students who are the highest scorers on the 
preliminary scholastic aptitude testnational merit scholarship 
qualifying test are eligible to compete for the prestigious and 
financiallyvaluable awards 
and it said those tests are biased against nonwhite and 
female students 
national merit officials said they were unaware of the letter 
and did not immediately respond further internal revenue service 
officials said the matter was confidential and refused to comment 
in a letter to irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr fairtest 
officials said the internal revenue service has previously 
determined that institutions which fail to follow racially 
nondiscriminatory policies are not to be considered charitable 
this policy requires among other things that schools not 
discriminate on the basis of race in their scholarship programs 
national merits exclusive reliance on scores from a biased 
exam violates this fundamental policy of nondiscrimination 
therefore national merit should not be subsidized by federal 
money through tax exemption said the letter 
fairtest a cambridge mass research organization estimated 
that minority students who make up a quarter of high school 
graduates receive a much smaller proportion of the national merit 
awards national merit declines to make public an ethnic breakdown 
of scholarship winners 
fairtest said it also has found that nearly twothirds of the 
semifinalists are boys 
thus rather than selecting from among the brightest and best 
collegebound students the program picks finalists from a pool 
of outstanding testtakers by eliminating 995 percent of all 
applicants solely on the basis of their score on a discriminatory 
test the organizations letter said 
talented women and minorities many at the top of their class 
are thereby eliminated from the competition by a single test score 
which even the testmakers say should never be used in isolation 
said the letter 
if the scholarship process were fair young women who receive 
better grades than young men in both high school and college and 
make up 54 percent of the qualifying test takers would earn at 
least that proportion of the awards or 44 million more than they 
currently receive said the letter 
it was signed by fairtest executive director cinthia schuman and 
by sarah stockwell the organizations university testing 
coordinator

led by baby boomers americans are giving more 
time and money to charitable causes a gallup poll said tuesday 
the average household contributed 734 or 2 percent of income 
in 1989 an increase of 20 percent after inflation compared to 
1987 the survey said 
over the same period the number of adults doing volunteer work 
grew 23 percent from 80 million to 934 million 
if these encouraging trends continue we truly can predict a 
renaissance of philanthropy in america said virginia a 
hodgkinson vice president of independent sector which 
commissioned the survey 
about 65 percent of donations an average of 477 went to 
religious organizations or causes among others 60 went to human 
services 56 to education 46 to health 28 to youth development 
and 19 to arts culture and humanities 
nine percent of families donated 5 percent or more of their 
household income the poll said 
gallup questioned 2727 adults over the age of 18 from march to 
may this year it carried out a similar poll in 1988 covering 1987 
charitable activities 
the results indicated that 71 million households or 75 percent 
of the total contributed to charity in 1989 up from 65 million 
or 71 percent in 1987 
among respondents aged 35 to 44 86 percent of households gave 
to charity up from 77 percent in 1987 people doing volunteer work 
grew from 45 percent to 62 percent in the 2534 age group and from 
54 percent to 64 percent in the 3544 age group 
the dramatic increases in donating time and money among the 
baby boom generation is good news for today and may suggest even 
better news for the future as this very large population group 
assumes community responsibility said independent sector 
president brian oconnell 
independent sector is a coalition of corporate and voluntary 
organizations that promote volunteerism and notforprofit 
initiatives 
the survey found that 61 percent of black families contributed 
to charities up from 51 percent in 1987 and that the percentage 
of black volunteers rose from 28 percent to 38 percent 
the average american adult did 22 hours of volunteer work a 
week the poll said the largest group of volunteers 177 percent 
helped religious organizations followed by 101 percent in 
education and 97 percent in youth development 
fiftyeight percent of families who dont attend religious 
services contributed to charity compared to 88 percent for 
families who go to services weekly 
the survey also found that lowerincome families are 
comparatively more generous than the rich 
contributing families with incomes under 10000 annually gave 
55 percent of their incomes while the rate was 17 percent for 
those in the 5000060000 income bracket and 29 percent for 
those making 75000 to 100000 
in comparison to lowerincome families and in contrast to 
their disposable income most wealthy americans have to be 
characterized as stingy oconnell said 
the surveys margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent

michel aoun 
president elias hrawi pledged to reunify the nation and end its 
15year civil war he said he would work from the bombedout 
presidential palace where aoun had his headquarters even if he 
has to put up a tent 
aoun spent a fourth day in the french embassy in east beirut 
where he fled saturday after being defeated in an eighthour 
syrianled blitz the assault which left 160 people dead ended 
the christian generals 11month mutiny 
france promptly granted aoun asylum but the lebanese government 
refuses to allow him to leave the country and wants to try him on a 
variety of charges including the theft of state funds 
on tuesday the government set up a military checkpoint near the 
embassy but said the measure was designed to prevent antiaoun 
demonstrators from storming the building 
france and lebanon do not intend to permit a crisis to develop 
between them french ambassador rene ala told reporters after 
meeting hrawi in moslem west beirut it was his third meeting with 
the lebanese president in 24 hours

move to stop people from getting into or out of the embassy or 
block traffic in the vicinity 
aoun began his mutiny in november 1989 after rejecting an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to end lebanons civil war which has 
killed an estimated 150000 people he called hrawi like himself a 
maronite catholic a syrian puppet and refused to recognize his 
government 
the peace plan provides for the traditionally dominant 
christians to share power with the moslem majority aoun rejected 
the plan because there was no timetable for the withdrawal of 
syrian troops 
bulldozers meanwhile continued to remove mines along the green 
line tuesday a day after authorities opened a key intersection to 
traffic 
several lebanese compared the dismantling of the green line a 
series of earth mounds that have split beirut into moslem and 
christian sections since 1975 to the removal of the berlin wall 
theres a ray of hope now moslem housewife jinan sukkar 
said 
berlin has been united and has gotten rid of the wall that had 
divided it for many years agriculture minister mohsen dalloul 
was quoted as saying now its beirut being united with the green 
line ceasing to exist 
hrawi told a delegation representing the christian population in 
aouns former enclave that very soon ill be in the palace i 
wont wait for reconstruction works ill erect a tent there and 
receive people 
he said that hostile acts by some prosyrian leftist 
militias that infiltrated into aouns former territory after his 
forces collapsed would be eliminated soon 
ill reunify the nation hrawi pledged 
in parts of christian east beirut and in aouns former 
stronghold people spoke of alleged looting by the syrians and 
their militia allies motorists were taking detours to avoid syrian 
checkpoints in streets where posters of aoun had been replaced by 
those of president hafez assad of syria 
as hrawi spoke tuesday syrianbacked christian militiamen led 
by elie hobeika were seen patrolling the streets of suburban 
hadath southeast of beirut checking identity cards and searching 
houses along with syrian soldiers for aoun loyalists 
last night hobeikas men searched the house for my two 
brothers who were soldiers serving under aoun said a native of 
hadath who identified herself only as georgette 
i told them that i havent seen them since the attack on 
saturday they didnt beat me or anything they only searched the 
house and left georgette said 
i wonder why didnt aoun surrender to hrawis army it would 
have been much better than having the syrians and their allies 
humiliating us she said 
syria which has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate considers the country its strategic backyard 
the fall of aoun has strengthened its hold on the country 
also tuesday parliament reelected hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem as speaker for a fouryear term

contrary to many doctors fears the survival of 
elderly hospitalized patients improved during the 1980s under the 
governments system of limiting medicare payments a study says 
but the rate at which medicare patients were sent home in 
unstable conditions such as with rapid heartbeats or confusion 
jumped from about 10 percent to about 15 percent said the study of 
more than 14000 patients 
unstable patients had a greater likelihood of dying the chance 
was about 16 percent within 90 days compared with about a 10 
percent chance for patients discharged in stable condition the 
study reported 
the good news is that over time theres better care delivered 
by doctors and nurses during hospitalization and the new payment 
system didnt interrupt that said dr katherine l kahn who 
headed the study for the rand corp a nonprofit research group 
based in santa monica calif 
however associated with the introduction of the new payment 
system and probably caused by it there was an increase in 
patients discharged with instability which somewhat reduced 
the gains in survival overall she said 
the findings were published in wednesdays journal of the 
american medical association 
the government footed the entire 39 million cost of the study 
of medicares socalled prospective pricing system introduced 
as a costsaving strategy in 1983 
under prospective pricing the government limits payment for 
hospitalization of medicare patients to a flat rate per admission 
calculated for each of 470 groups of illnesses before prospective 
pricing the government paid whatever costs medicare patients ran 
up while hospitalized 
the new system has slowed the upward spiral of the cost of 
medicare which covers americans over age 65 but it has raised 
fears that care would be compromised through shortened hospital 
stays and the substitution of cheaper services and procedures 
a 19member rand research team compared 198182 patient records 
before prospective pricing to 198586 records after 
prospective pricing at 297 hospitals 
the researchers found discharges were quicker the mean length 
of stay dropped from 144 days to 110 days a difference of 34 
days 
but the death rate overall also dropped from 165 percent to 
154 percent in the 30 days after hospital discharge for patients 
with any of the five conditions studied they were congestive heart 
failure heart attack pneumonia stroke or hip fracture 
under the new pricing system there also was a slight decline in 
the number of patients dead by 180 days but the figure would have 
declined even further had it not been for deaths due to instability 
and other problems at discharge researchers said 
the researchers also reported that the proportion of patients 
receiving poor or very poor care declined from 25 percent to 12 
percent but remained a worrisome issue 
the study is the most comprehensive yet evaluating the impact of 
prospective pricing on the quality of care other researchers said 
but bruce c vladeck president of the united hospital fund of 
new york and a member of the prospective payment assessment 
commission a congressional agency that evaluates medicare pricing 
said he was not terribly surprised at the findings 
other less sophisticated efforts to try to measure the 
quality effects of the system have produced similar results 
vladeck said in a telephone interview he added that the findings 
were nonetheless reassuring 
charles dougherty director of the center for hepolicy and 
ethics at creighton university said that even though there is 
some real good news here the increase in discharges of patients 
in unstable medical condition is disturbing 
people are leaving hospitals who in years previously would 
have warranted admission to a hospital he said in a telephone 
interview from omaha neb

groups 
the armys supreme commander gen sunthorn khongsomphong said 
in a television interview monday that the situation in thailand is 
very fragile 
he said the military will try to prevent the situation from 
becoming violent and from affecting the peoples normal way of 
life 
premier chatichai choonhavan left late monday for official 
visits to britain and switzerland where he hoped to encourage

and demanding its resignation 
later sunday police stopped a small group of other students who 
threatened to set themselves on fire in front of the prime 
ministers offices if the government did not resign 
tanawots act shocked the public selfimmolation as a form of 
protest has been unheard of in thailand in recent years 
tanawot remained in critical condition tuesday with burns 
covering 90 percent of his body his chances of survival were slim 
said the acting commander at the hospital police maj gen pisoot 
pintuyotin 
the students federation of thailand the main student umbrella 
group has also demanded that the government resign but has 
denounced the suicide attempt saying it did not represent the 
student movement

protesters belonged to a group infiltrated by the littleknown 
revolutionary council apparently a promilitary group 
the thai newspaper the nation quoted unidentified government 
sources tuesday as saying police were seeking to question two 
leaders of the council suspected of being behind the suicide 
attempt

hearts have hardened in the violent struggle 
over the holy land and neither palestinians nor israelis show much 
pity for the others victims 
after 19 palestinians were shot dead by police on the sacred 
temple mount last week an israeli worker in a fastfood restaurant 
told a customer i wish a hundred had been killed 
after the same incident a 58yearold palestinian said i 
wish hitler was alive so he can finish the job and make them all 
into soap 
and he is what many israelis would call a good arab having 
worked for the israeli government for 18 years and learned fluent 
hebrew 
these are spurofthemoment remarks but they are indicative of 
the harsh atmosphere of daily life in jerusalem 
psychologists say the comments are the result of a decadesold 
ethnic conflict that has intensified since the december 1987 start 
of the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation 
in situations of prolonged conflict the gap between the 
adversary communities keeps growing and each side dehumanizes the 
other said ariel merari an expert on political violence at tel 
aviv university 
signs of such dehumanization abound israelis have been known to 
refer to palestinians as dogs or cockroaches palestinians 
have termed israelis animals or nazis 
in the early years of the israeli occupation an armslength 
coexistence developed as arabs flocked into israel looking for 
jobs and israelis poured into the west bank and gaza strip to 
picnic and sightsee 
but today palestinians see israelis as the soldiers who open 
fire on teenage stonethrowers and stop palestinian drivers at 
roadblocks or as indifferent military bureaucrats 
most israelis see palestinians only as the terrorists planting 
bombs on jerusalems ben yehuda mall or as faceless figures 
sweeping the streets of tel aviv 
until now the main expression of palestinian hatred has been 
stones and firebombs but after the bloodbath on the temple mount 
the proplo leaders of the uprising threatened to escalate the 
conflict 
this stage requires the use of weapons arson stabbings and 
destroying anything we can reach their leaflet said 
if compassion is lacking excuses are not 
the temple mount clash began with arabs throwing rocks down on 
jewish worshipers at thewwestern wall also known as the wailing 
wall injuring 28 people most of them slightly to israelis it 
was a desecration so outrageous that whatever happened afterward 
seemed almost secondary 
police opened fire in response to the stoning 
in july 1989 when an arab grabbed the wheel of an israeli bus 
and plunged it into a ravine killing 17 people palestinians 
excused him by saying he was avenging the beatings of his family 
and friends by soldiers 
political leaders on both sides use history to justify their 
actions 
palestinians bring up deir yassin the village near jerusalem 
where jewish militiamen massacred more than 250 people in 1948 
israelis cite palestinian guerrilla attacks in which hundreds of 
israeli civilians have been killed 
both sides often refuse to acknowledge each others suffering 
many palestinians belittle the holocaust the memory of which 
helps shape the prickly uncompromising israeli character israelis 
show little awareness of the constant humiliation and harassment 
palestinians are subjected to under occupation 
there are however many exceptions 
israeli peace activists brave the mockery and threats of 
violence by the militant right to demonstrate their sympathy for 
the palestinians moderate palestinians risk the wrath of 
hardliners by trying to find common ground with israelis 
dr michael stark a jerusalem obstetrician felt compelled to 
tell a patients palestinian husband how terrible he felt about the 
temple mount killings 
im not justifying the people who threw stones but i believe 
that the police response was out of all proportion and im ashamed 
that this happened stark said 
said kenaan a proplo businessman from the west bank city of 
nablus said he and other moderates tried unsuccessfully to 
dissuade militants from calling for the killing of israeli soldiers 
and jewish settlers 
kenaan said he is undeterred some of us still believe its 
best to stick to nonviolence he said

mayor bill boner won little sympathy in 
his hometown when he and aspiring country singer traci peel 
discussed their romance before a national television audience on 
the donahue talk show 
im thoroughly disgusted with the way the mayor and his wife 
handled themselves rj hill an engineering consultant said 
after watching the syndicated show monday boner and peel should 
have defended themselves before the people of nashville rather than 
to a national audience 
the relationship between boner 45 and peel 34 made national 
headlines this summer while boner was living with his third wife 
betty boner married peel on oct 1 three days after the divorce 
was final 
you are very close to giving the finger to the city tv host 
phil donahue said during the taping of the show thursday in new 
york youre a distracted mayor you were an outofthecloset 
adulterer 
boner said he has accomplished much during his threeyear term 
ive brought moremoney into nashville than anybody else 
boner said we lived up to our commitments we have a totally 
integrated solidwaste management system 
peel told donahue that her comment published in the nashville 
banner that peels passion could last for seven hours at a time was 
made in jest in a conversation she thought was off the record the 
banner has published statements that it stands by its story 
at one point peel sang rocky top accompanied by boner on 
the harmonica 
students in tommy henleys sociology class at maplewood high 
school were left with disdain 
this is embarrassing tometrias mullins said they already 
think were hicks 
they should leave his personal life alone and get on the main 
issues like the landfill and education said student raymond 
broughton 
phone calls poured into the nashville scene a weekly newspaper 
edited by bruce dobie who appeared on the talk show with boner and 
peel and wlacam talk show host les jameson 
theyre saying we need to let this boner thing rest but 
others are saying this guys a disgrace they want to know how 
we can recall him dobie said 
the show resulted in a number of calls to the mayors office 
said boner spokesman rick runyeon 
we have received a number of calls and there has been probably 
an equal balance between positive and negative runyeon said 
weve received a lot of calls from out of city and out of state 
and those tend to be more positive than the local calls 
after taping donahue last week boner released a statement 
declaring his personal life offlimits to reporters

child welfare officials said tuesday they 
were investigating the case of a 4yearold girl who was left alone 
with a bad cold and got help by randomly dialing a wisconsin health 
department 
this would be considered a child neglect case said patricia 
watters division chief for the montgomery county department of 
child welfare services last year we had about 500 cases of 
neglect reported and about 5 percent of those were unattended 
children 
the girl whose name was not released began dialing random 
telephone numbers to try to find her mother monday morning she 
reached the walworth county public health line about 930 am 
edt 
i was kind of shaking at first receptionist sara weeks who 
answered the phone said tuesday we were really concerned at 
first that she had been abandoned in her house 
during the 2 hours the girl was on the phone ms weeks and 
nurse jane hildeick alternated talking with her as authorities 
traced the call 
we picked up on her cues ms weeks said when we wrote 
down washington we screamed 
ms weeks said she was on the phone when police arrived at the 
apartment 
i was on the phone when the officer came to the door and i 
could hear him through the door she added mother and daughter 
were reunited a short time later at the police station in silver 
spring md 
ms watters said the problem of unattended children is 
increasing 
one real problem we are dealing with is that people cannot 
afford regular day care we are seeing more of that she said 
she added that maryland law says no child under the age of 8 can 
be left alone or confined unless there is a reliable person at 
least 13 years of age left in charge 
she said she understood that the mother identified by police as 
27yearold luvisca deligny had gone to the bank to run an errand 
and had left the child with her two roommates who went to work 
thats why we are conducting the investigation ms watters 
said we are trying to discover if this is a pattern or one 
instance where someone who normally is supposed to be there 
isnt 
police charged the mother with leaving a child unattended a 
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to 500 and a 30day jail 
term 
ms deligny said she took the day off to care for her sick child 
and had left to run an errand 
im still not sure she was on the phone that long she said 
ill wait to see the phone bill to determine if its true 
walworth county in wisconsin is a farming area east of madison 
and about 60 miles north of chicago

the vegetable harvest is down about 15 percent 
this year more bad news for consumers already suffering from 
shortages of meat eggs cheese and sugar soviet media reported 
tuesday 
the communist party newspaper pravda blamed the vegetable 
shortfall on heavy rain a manpower shortage and lack of 
transportation 
consumer dissatisfaction has eroded public support for president 
mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms he unveiled a new economic 
plan on tuesday 
under a headline asking what will we eat in winter pravda 
said 98 million tons of vegetables had been collected across the 
country as of oct 8 15 million tons less than at this time last 
year 
soviet prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov has voiced particular 
concern about potatoes a key winter food as of oct 11 moscow 
had stockpiled only 13 percent of the potatoes the city is expected 
to need to get through the winter 
at this time last year the capitals stockpiles of potatoes 
were nearly six times larger than they are now the newspaper 
moskovsky komsomolets reported 
pravda carried short dispatches from its correspondents around 
the country describing the harvest in many areas the problem is 
not the quantity of vegetables growing in the fields but lack of 
manpower fuel transportation and storage facilities to get the 
food to market it said 
in the russian province of stavropol where gorbachev spent his 
childhood less than half the vegetables had been picked by oct 1 
plans called for 20000 workers and 900 trucks to take part in the 
harvest there but only about onequarter of those people and half 
the trucks are working pravda said 
in the rostov region of southeastern russia there is a 
tremendous shortage of trucks and what few are available often run 
out of gas the newspaper quoted a regional official as saying 
similar problems plague the bumper soviet grain harvest the 
us department of agriculture has estimated the soviet crop at 235 
million metric tons nearly a record but experts estimate 20 
percent to 30 percent will be lost because of poor transportation 
and spoilage 
there was no bread in moscow stores for two weeks in september 
but it is now readily available shortages of other goods such as 
eggs and cheese have worsened sugar is rationed and people with 
ration coupons have difficulty finding any

secretary of state james a baker iii declared 
on tuesday that a partial solution to the persian gulf crisis 
short of total iraqi withdrawal from kuwait is unacceptable to the 
bush administration 
referring to persistent hints of compromise from baghdad baker 
said president saddam hussein evidently was interested in a 
negotiated arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from 
his unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor 
baker rejected that notion outright its a case from our 
standpoint of not wanting to succumb to the siren song of a 
partial solution to this crisis 
the hints emanated from baghdad after the aug 2 invasion and 
culminated sunday with a report by a soviet news agency that saddam 
might be prepared to pull out from most of kuwait in exchange for 
keeping several strategic islands in the persian gulf 
the report followed a highlevel visit to iraq by evgeny 
primakov the leading soviet expert on the middle east and persian 
gulf baker cautioned however that an overture may not have been 
made to the soviet official and that moscow has remained as solid 
as the united states on the issue of no partial solution 
determined to tighten the economic screws on iraq baker said 
the un security council should consider adopting resolutions 
demanding iraq pay reparations in the rape of kuwait which is 
still continuing and be held responsible for war crimes 
baker also said us officials were quite concerned about 
iraqi threats to unleash terrorism against the west in retaliation 
for the threemonth economic blockade of the country 
president bush campaigning in des moines for iowas republican 
governor terry branstad responded to a challenge by three youthful 
protesters of us policy in the gulf by saying theyve got it 
all wrong 
bush went on what is happening is we see in kuwait 
unprecedented acts of brutality inflicted by iraq iraqi aggression 
will not be allowed to stand saddam hussein will be held 
accountable and the legitimate government of kuwait will be 
restored 
baker took questions from reporters at a state department 
ceremony designed to heighten public interest in the us campaign 
against terrorism 
on another subject he urged israel to reverse its decision 
barring a un mission to investigate a riot oct 8 on the hallowed 
temple mount in which 19 palestinian arabs were shot to death by 
israeli police 
it is only that way israel will be able to make its case to 
the security council baker said 
in a gesture to the israeli government baker condemned the 
flinging of stones bottles and other missives onto jewish 
worshipers at the western wall that preceded the shootings 
we dont think there is any excuse for that either baker 
said 
a senior israeli diplomat said here tuesday that it would be 
naive to consider the un investigators as factfinders 
whats the point of sending an investigator after youve made 
the verdict already that israel is to be condemned oded eran 
the deputy israeli ambassador said referring to the security 
councils unanimous adoption friday night of a resolution 
condemning israel 
he said the bush administration made no attempt to work with 
israel to limit the impact of the resolution which was drafted by 
the united states with some help from britain 
he called the affair an example of the failure of the un to 
be evenhanded and explained that the decision taken sunday by the 
israel cabinet against a un inquiry stemmed from the fear of 
the introduction of the un into the city of jerusalem which we 
have tried to avoid at all cost 
baker in another dispute with israel implicitly criticized a 
decision by an israeli cabinet committee to encourage an increase 
in the settlement of soviet jews in east jerusalem 
he said the predominantly arab sector of the city was beyond the 
green line that delineated israels boundaries before the 1967 
six day war in which jordan was stripped of east jerusalem and the 
west bank 
to pave the way for a 400 million us housing loan guarantee 
israeli foreign minister david levy assured baker two weeks ago 
that his governments policy was not to direct or settle soviet 
jews beyond the green line 
we think the united states is and should be entitled to rely 
upon assurances received from the foreign minister of israel 
baker said

the us military has a partial 
remedy for the sand and heat of the saudi desert drink water and 
lots of it 
we kind of force them to drink it they have no choice 
capt kelly marunale 30 of woodstock ill says of the 
requirement that us soldiers drink more than two gallons of water 
each day 
one of the first tasks of soldiers in the desert every morning 
is to collect a box of six bottles of water a days supply the 
rule holds despite the easing in temperatures down at least 15 
degrees from the summer highs of 120 degrees 
at the height of summer there were reports that us soldiers 
in saudi arabia were required to drink six gallons of water a day 
that made an impression on 10yearold hannah bergstrem of 
loveland colo who wrote to an officer saying i wouldnt like 
to be in saudi arabia drinking six gallons of water a day but i 
guess somebody has to do it 
even the estimated two gallons each us soldier is required to 
drink daily looms large when the water must be trucked in for some 
200000 troops 
the expense and logistics of distributing the water bottled 
water must be purchased has prompted the military to begin using 
water taken from oasis wells and processed from the sea 
those plastic bottles are just a logistical nightmare said 
col dan grigson public affairs officer for the armys 101st 
airborne division so we hope to wean soldiers off the bottle 
repeated inquiries on the number of bottles of water consumed by 
us soldiers were not answered by the armed forces however 
dehydration is one of the main problems treated by field hospitals 
as soldiers are prone to ignore their daily ration 
the average consumption of water per soldier in september ranged 
between five and 11 gallons per day including that used for 
showers and washing 
the soldiers have no great love for the chlorinated water 
produced by mixing oasis water with chemicals 
its like drinking the swimming pool said sgt joseph 
copley 25 of mansfield ohio 
because of the daily minimum requirement the water is a 
constant topic of conversation even in the midst of night 
maneuvers two soldiers were overheard discussing the subject 
i drank that water for two weeks before they started putting 
in the chlorine and i never got sick said one 
it made you ugly the other joked in answer 
no that came from eating mres said the first soldier 
referring to the military field rations called 
mealsreadytoeat 
troops get packages of flavored powder such as lemonlime or 
grape in the mres which they dump into the water but they dont 
have enough to disguise the amount they must drink sometimes they 
use cocoa 
here it is 120 degrees outside and the water is so hot they 
would rather drink hot cocoa than hot water said marunale a 
company commander with the aviation brigade of the 24th mechanized 
infantry division

president bush heckled on the campaign 
trail battled tuesday against signs of dwindling public support 
for us involvement in the middle east america will remain in 
the persian gulf not one single day longer than necessary he 
promised 
bush said us forces must stay in the gulf until iraqs saddam 
hussein withdraws his army from kuwait 
if we dont stand up against aggression around the world when 
its naked and brutal who will bush asked on a threestate 
campaign swing stretching from des moines iowa to grand rapids 
mich 
three protesters disrupted bushs speech at a political 
fundraiser before more than 1000 people in the des moines civic 
center mr president bring our troops home from saudi arabia 
one young man shouted 
stop the buildup no war for oil the trio shouted 
before being hustled away by police 
bush was loudly applauded when he responded the fight isnt 
about oil the fight is about naked aggression that will not 
stand 
two women interrupted bush at a fieldhouse rally at dupage 
college in the chicago suburb of glen ellyn addressing himself to 
the protesters bush said what we are for is peace in the middle 
east what we are also for is principle 
he appeared irritated at the disruptions im so glad we have 
free speech here but once in a while you know we ought to get on 
with our business 
the disturbances coincided with the release of a washington 
postabc news poll showing a sharp drop in support for us 
involvement in the persian gulf where more than 200000 americans 
are on duty 
the survey said 60 percent of people questioned believe the 
united states should keep troops in the region until iraq withdraws 
from kuwait five weeks ago the figure had been 75 percent 
support for bushs handling of the gulf crisis has dropped from 
78 percent in september to 64 percent in the most recent postabc 
poll 
bush said he understood the passions of the demonstrators 
i went through world war ii he said weve been through a 
couple of agonizing periods the korean war and the vietnam war so 
their views shouldnt be entirely written off 
but theyve got it wrong theyve got the facts wrong he 
said theyre looking introspectively in a bit of an 
isolationistic way you cant do that we have the responsibility 
to lead the united states does 
bush said the united states has the responsibility to lead and 
to put together this coalition that says to saddam hussein very 
simply you cannot bully your neighbor you cannot wipe out a 
member of the arab league a member of the united nations 
the president recounted stories of atrocities committed in 
occupied kuwait by iraqi forces such as babies being taken off 
incubators and patients removed from dialysis machines so the 
equipment could be moved to baghdad 
bush said the bottom line for us is iraqi aggression will not 
be allowed to stand saddam hussein will be held accountable and 
the legitimate government of kuwait will be restored 
vowing that us forces will not remain longer than necessary 
bush said i look forward to the day when every single man and 
woman serving there now with pride and beautifully trained every 
single one of them comes home but we must stay for as long as it 
takes to complete our mission 
his comments were loudly cheered 
bush campaigned in iowa fo the reelection of republican gov 
terry branstad favored in the polls and for rep tom tauke who 
is struggling to replace democratic sen tom harkin 
in illinois bush sought to boost the chances of jim edgar the 
gop candidate for governor who is in a close race with democrat 
neil hartigan 
bushs last stop for the day was michigan where neither 
republican gubernatorial candidate john engler nor gop sen 
challenger bill schuette was given more than a longshot chance of 
upsetting the democratic incumbents

highflying former savings and loan owner donald 
ray dixon goes on trial wednesday on charges he used depositors 
money to finance lavish acquisitions leaving taxpayers with a 13 
billion federal bailout 
dixon 50 traveled the world for gourmet parties and acquired 
such trinkets as a 17th century castle door baccarat crystal 
remington sculptures a silverstudded saddle and a posh house in 
solana beach calif just north of san diego 
the government says those luxuries as well as payments to 
prostitutes and political campaigns were financed from the vaults 
at vernon savings amp loan association which collapsed under the 
weight of dixons excess in 1987 and was taken over by the 
government 
a dozen other vernon executives and associates have preceded 
dixon in court 10 have been convicted and a guilty verdict against 
two others was set aside because the jury discussed dixons 
indictment 
perhaps when my day in court comes if theyll listen theyll 
find out what really happened and the blame can be properly 
assessed and properly assigned dixon said in july when he was 
arraigned on a 38count indictment 
the indictment charged him with conspiracy misapplication of 
funds making false statements and other crimes 
jury selection was to begin wednesday in federal court 
testimony is expected to begin monday and continue three to four 
weeks if convicted on all counts dixon could be sentenced to up 
to 190 years in prison and fined as much as 95 million 
an extralarge panel of 75 to 80 potential jurors was called 
because of publicity in the case said jean hiller court 
coordinator for us district judge joe a fish 
assistant us attorney david jarvis of dallas said 40 to 50 
prosecution witnesses could testify included on that list is a 
convicted madam who has confirmed that she supplied prostitutes 
for vernon executives when they were in san diego 
defense and prosecution attorneys declined to discuss the case 
this week citing a instructions from fish 
until the recent notoriety given neal bush and silverado savings 
and loan in colorado or charles keating and lincoln savings and 
loan in california dixon and vernon were at or near the top of the 
list of abuses cited in the industry 
dixons trial is an effort to bring to justice people who 
break the law who use savings and loan associations as personal 
piggy banks and who may have thought they could just walk away 
free and let the american taxpayer shoulder the cost of their 
greed said timothy ryan office of thrift supervision director 
in washington 
vernon had a luxury yacht and a fleet of five planes worth 6 
million the sampl also paid the 22000 tab for dixons gastronomic 
tour of european restaurants the government said 
dixon also is charged with illegal contributions to such 
politicians as former house speaker jim wright and jack kemp a 
former republican congressman from new york who is now secretary of 
the department of housing and urban development 
recipients of those funds did not know they came from illegal 
sources prosecutors have said 
when regulators closed vernon it was the largest thrift bailout 
in history and it remains among the most expensive most of the 
expensive acquisitions have been sold at auction since the 
government takeover 
when regulators closed vernon they renamed it monfort savings 
association in december 1988 monfort was one of five insolvent 
thrifts combined to create first gibraltar bank the largest 
savings and loan in texas 
vernon also has resulted in the stiffest sentence to date for an 
sampl officer former chairman woody f lemons was sentenced to 30 
years in prison earlier this year

a senate committee on tuesday cleared the way 
for a national park service study on the feasibility of making 
permanent a pedestrian bridge to ellis island and the statue of 
liberty 
the senate appropriations committee approved the study proposal 
from sen frank lautenberg dnj as part of the 1991 interior 
appropriations bill 
the measure aimed at easing access to ellis island still faces 
approval by the full senate 
the foot bridge which connects liberty state park in new jersey 
with ellis island has been used by construction workers 
rehabilitating the immigration center it was slated to be phased 
out in 1992 however new jersey lawmakers upset at the 6 
perperson cost of getting to the monuments by ferry have suggested 
the bridge be retained 
they include gov jim florio and rep frank j guarini dnj 
whose district includes liberty state park a departure point for 
the ferry 
opponents include the national parks service and circle 
linestatue of liberty inc which operates the ferry service the 
company is considering a fare increase to 8 a person according to 
recent congressional testimony 
ellis island is part of our national heritage said 
lautenberg affordable access must be available to all americans 
wishing to visit the island

police are preparing the nations most costly 
security operation ever to keep terrorists away when japan crowns a 
new emperor for the first time in more than 60 years 
the government has decided on a security budget of 415 
million police and finance ministry officials said tuesday that 
is more than double the cost of policing emperor hirohitos funeral 
early last year 
japans largest radical left group the chukakuha through its 
official organ advance has threatened to disrupt next months 
coronationrelated ceremonies its attacks are generally aimed at 
property not people 
authorities refused to comment on what kind of security was 
planned 
about 32000 police officers were deployed in tokyo for 
hirohitos funeral in a security operation that cost the government 
184 million 
in the weeks before the funeral police often dressed in full 
riot gear conducted random inspections of automobiles and searched 
strategically located buildings frogmen were called out to secure 
rivers and bay areas in tokyo manholes near the palace were 
checked and sealed 
a spokesman for japans largest opposition party the 
socialists called the funeral an example of excessive 
security 
little of that kind of police presence is visible in tokyo yet 
although some checkpoints have been set up on major streets 
emperor akihito assumed the throne immediately after his father 
died in january 1989 but the formal enthronement had to be delayed 
for a yearlong mourning period 
the event will include a state coronation ceremony and parade 
nov 12 the daijosai or great food offering ritual will be 
conducted according to the customs of japans native religion of 
shinto the night of nov 22 
vice president dan quayle and prince charles heir to the 
british throne are among the dignitaries scheduled to attend the 
coronation 
before the funeral police said tight security was needed to 
protect the representatives of 163 countries including president 
bush french president francois mitterrand and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
but their steamroller approach was widely criticized as 
violating residents human rights and also because it did not stop 
leftist radicals from setting off a bomb along the funeral 
procession route 
the blast which sent mud and debris across the road but injured 
no one went off about 20 minutes before the procession passed by 
japans radical left has little support among the general 
public but remains visible by frequently using violence to 
publicize its aims 
the chukakuha or middle core faction has a membership 
estimated in the thousands the group whose members wear helmets 
and bandanas to cover their faces has a wellknown heavily 
guarded headquarters in northern tokyo 
before hirohitos funeral the chukakuha claimed it had mortars 
able to launch projectiles as far as a few miles 
so far this year radicals have claimed responsibility for 53 
incidents 40 involving imperial targets such as shrines or 
buildings used by palace employees

president bush signed a bill tuesday 
expanding the powers of the securities and exchange commission to 
intervene during stock market emergencies and to monitor major wall 
street players 
bush said the measure would improve the stability of americas 
vital securities markets and the protection of tens of millions of 
investors 
the white house announced bushs action during a gop campaign 
stop in the chicago suburb of glen ellyn 
the measure will allow the commission to regulate program 
trading during times of extreme market turbulence program trading 
is the use of computers to execute scores even hundreds of 
separate trades all at once frequently in combination with trades 
in financial futures markets at the same time 
the bill also expands the authority of the sec chairman to shut 
down the securities markets with presidential permission in times 
of market emergency previously only the president could order a 
trading halt 
other provisions 
require large securities traders to report their market 
positions to the commission 
mandate coordinated clearance and settlement of stocks options 
and futures contracts between the sec and the commodity futures 
trading commission 
require the treasury department federal reserve board the 
cftc and sec to report annually to congress on their efforts to 
protect the integrity of the markets 
give the sec authority to assess the financial health of the 
parent holding companies of brokerdealers 
while hailing the bill bush said part of it was still 
troubling 
the final language of the bill gives the sec only carefully 
limited and narrow authority to control trading practices and is an 
improvement over earlier versions of the legislation bush said 
however it is still important that this authority be 
carefully and judiciously exercised to prevent any interference 
with technological innovations in financial markets that can 
enhance market liquidity the president added 
we must be careful not to damage the vitality of americas 
markets at the same time that we protect market stability

kuwaits governmentinexile on tuesday ruled out conceding 
one inch of territory to iraq in any settlement and the united 
states said it would not accept partial solutions to the persian 
gulf crisis 
the comments followed hints that iraq might withdraw from kuwait 
if it is allowed to retain three key areas two islands 
controlling iraqs access to the gulf and part of an oil field 
but iraq took a firm position tuesday with the newspaper of 
saddam husseins ruling party saying we will not give it 
kuwait up even if we fight for it 1000 years 
japans government meanwhile introduced a proposal in 
parliament that would permit japanese troops to join the usled 
multinational force in the gulfthe plan envisions the 
establishment of a noncombat force of civilians and soldiers to 
participate behind the lines 
japans constitution forbids sending troops overseas 
gis in saudi arabia got a surprise visitor tuesday comedian 
steve martin martin signed autographs and climbed aboard a tank 
during a uso stop 
martin was told not perform because of concern by us 
commanders that americanstyle humor could offend the saudis 
kuwaits crown prince and prime minister told a news conference 
that iraqs 11week occupation of his emirate will never force us 
to make any concession 
we will never give up any part of our country not even one 
inch sheik saad alabdullah alsabah said in jiddah saudi 
arabia 
kuwaitis fleeing into saudi arabia said the iraqis were setting 
up fences that separate most of kuwait from the disputed oil field 
of rumailah but iraq repeatedly has denied speculation that it 
would withdraw in return for territorial concessions 
secretary of state james a baker iii said washington also would 
not agree to concessions 
we are unwilling to engage in a search for partial 
solutions baker said 
he said saddam evidently was interested in a negotiated 
arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from his 
unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor 
president bush on the campaign trail in iowa encountered signs 
of dwindling public support for us involvement in the gulf 
america will remain in the persian gulf not one single day longer 
than necessary he promised 
bush was loudly applauded when he responded to three protesters 
the fight isnt about oil the fight is about naked aggression 
that will not stand 
the united states has massed nearly 200000 troops in the 
persian gulf region since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 the 
united nations has imposed a land sea and air embargo on iraq 
jordans king hussein who has worked to try to find a peaceful 
solution to the crisis said in remarks published tuesday that war 
may be imminent 
hussein told the new york times that the outbreak of war would 
be partly the fault of bush and other western leaders who he said 
failed to respond promptly to saddams early indications he was 
willing to withdraw 
also tuesday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev dispatched 
an envoy to the west to seek a peaceful end to the crisis a soviet 
spokesman said yevgeny primakov recently back from talks with 
saddam in baghdad would visit rome and paris then meet bush in 
washington 
the soviet leadership believes that if there is a smallest 
chance to settle the conflict peacefully that chance should be used 
to the ultimate gorbachev spokesman vitaly ignatenko said in 
moscow 
tass reported that saddam had hinted to primakov he might be 
prepared to withdraw iraqi troops from kuwait in exchange for the 
two islands and the rumailah oil field that straddles the 
iraqkuwait border 
saddam had accused the kuwaitis of drawing more than their share 
of oil from the field 
plo chief yasser arafat has also said saddam was showing 
flexibility but iraq said tuesday its position remained firm 
althawra the newspaper of the ruling arab baath socialist 
party said control of kuwait is our final decision a decision 
that all iraq defends and guards by 6 million fighters 
iraqs army newspaper alqadissiya discounted the possiblity 
of war before christmas saying that bush was not likely to allow 
american soldiers to come home in coffins during the holiday 
season 
in other developments tuesday 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi said libya would mobilize atn soldiers 
if needed in the gulf crisis the nations 
official news agency reported 
gadhafi however did not say which side the troops would fight 
on o 
least a millior what would prompt the mobilization the dispatch by libyas 
jana news agency said he made the remark in a speech monday 
honduras said it will send a military force to saudi arabia to 
join the multinational force argentina was the first latin 
american nation to pledge military personnel to the force

for the major part of his career blakey did his drumming for 
the jazz messengers the band that came together under his 
leadership in the early 1950s 
dizzy gillespie the giant of bebop once described blakey as 
the volcano of bebop drummers he was considered in the top 
echelon that included such drummers as max roach and buddy rich 
in a television film about blakeys career a jazz messengers 
alumnus pianist walter davis said i think no one in jazz has 
brought more great musicians to music that art blakey 
the 1981 newport jazz festival gave over an evening to the 
blakey legacy in which the drummer was joined by the players who 
had been with his band during the previous quareer century 
blakey denied being a teacher saying that as a selftaught 
musician i dont know anything myself 
but another time he said when i take these 18yearold kids 
out on tour it makes most of the pros feel like cutting their 
wrists theyre going to take the music farther than it has 
been 
among the musicians who got a start with blakeys band have been 
horn players wynton marsalis freddie hubbard clifford brown and 
chuck mangione saxophonists jackie mclean wayne shorter and 
johnny griffin pianists keith jarrett and walter davis 
blakey was born in pittsburgh in 1919 escaping the steel mills 
as a 15yearold by playing piano at a nightclub then a 
14yearold hotshot named erroll garner showed up and i was told 
to go to the drums by the club owner blakey recalled 
the young blakey caught on with fletcher hendersons band and 
went on to billy eckstines big band in the mid1940s when he 
first worked with gillespie and charlie parker 
the jazz messengers band was formed in 1954 by blakey pianist 
horace silver trumpeter kenny dorham and saxophonist hank mobley 
the band toured europe and played all around the united states for 
the next three decades including a white house performance in 
1981 
blakeys jazz drummer son art jr died in 1988 at age 47

a national board may be needed to monitor 
foreign banks operating in the united states such as an italian 
institution that secretly lent several billion dollars to iraq the 
chairman of the house banking committee said tuesday 
banca nazionale del lavoro which is owned by the italian 
government and is italys secondlargest bank lent 19 billion to 
iraq through its atlanta office until august 1989 when it was 
raided by the fbi and federal reserve 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas called the scandal a case 
study in regulatory failure and said the current system of 
dividing responsibility for regulating foreign bank offices among 
federal and state agencies is inadequate 
maybe it is time we established a national screening board to 
monitor more closely foreign bank presence in the united states 
he suggested 
such a screening board could review applications for foreign 
bank entry into the united states as well as monitor these banks to 
ensure they are not engaged in foreign policy activities 
according to the conference of state bank supervisors 557 
statelicensed foreign banks with 622 billion in assets operate in 
the united states another 80 financial institutions with 33 
billion in assets are licensed by the treasury departments office 
of the comptroller of the currency 
regulators appearing before gonzalez panel said the current 
system was adequate but warned that cases like that of banca 
nazionale del lavoro are difficult to prevent 
this was a situation that involved massive fraud in which a 
large number of employees acted together to conceal the operation 
and deceive auditors and examiners said william taylor director 
of banking supervision at the federal reserve 
the physical segregation of records together with the 
concerted efforts of key employees make it extremely difficult for 
examiners to uncover this type of illicit and fraudulent 
activity he said 
some of the italian banks lending was guaranteed by the 
agriculture departments commodity credit corp because iraq 
stopped paying its debts after invading kuwait on aug 2 us 
taxpayers will be on the hook for 2 billion through the commodity 
credit corp including 347 million loaned by banca nazionale del 
lavoro taxpayers will lose another 55 million guaranteed through 
the exportimport bank of the united states 
rep charles schumer dny said the lavoro scandal was an 
inevitable result of the poorly managed and ill conceived 
agriculture department loan guarantee program 
in effect weve doled out billions of dollars of free money 
which enabled saddam hussein to build the powerful nation that 
confronts us today he said 
pietro lombardi executive vice resident in charge of the 
italian banks north american operations said the atlanta offices 
lending was conducted without the knowledge or approval of bank 
executives in new york and rome 
while the activity may have been unauthorized and improperly 
reported loans to iraq at the time were not illegal or in any 
way inconsistent with the policy of the united states he said 
the justice department is conducting a criminal investigation of 
the affair and tuesdays committee hearing was held over the 
protests of attorney general dick thornburgh who had warned it 
could hurt prosecutors efforts

comedian steve martin who 
bills himself as that wild and crazy guy was told to be tame 
and sane in a visit to us troops tuesday 
they said they didnt want us to do a show martin told 
soldiers at camp midway a base for the 24th mechanized infantry 
division 
martins subdued manner reflected concern by us commanders 
about saudi sensibilities while they are eager to have celebrities 
visit the desert shield forces they fear some americanstyle humor 
could offend the saudis 
it was the third stop of the day for martin and and his wife 
actress victoria tennant who are on a weeklong uso tour 
during his hour at the camp martin donned a helmet and goggles 
for a brief ride on an m1 tank signed autographs and a homemade 
steve martin for president poster and cracked only one joke 
relating to the gulf crisis 
i have the answer to saddam hussein if the press would just 
keep talking about his mistress his wife would kill him 
in a recent interview us army gen h norman schwarzkopf the 
overall commander of us forces in saudi arabia said the 
americans were trying in every possible way to be culturally 
sensitive without depriving our troops of what we think they 
should have 
us officials had earlier canceled troops attendance at a show 
staged by some american civilians after saudi objections to women 
revealing too much leg 
about 500 troops sitting on a sand dune littered with empty 
soft drink cans waited about three hours in 104degree heat before 
martins group arrived aboard two uh60 blackhawk helicopters 
they cheered wildly when martin and his wife climbed on the 
tank and the comedian cracked were going to put up a condo 
here 
the stars wore camouflage fatigues and red uso baseball caps 
adorned with pilots wings and souvenirs from earlier stops 
it was clear the soldiers had expected martin to do a comedy 
routine 
but after telling them we appreciate what you guys are 
doing martin said what were going to do is what they call 
grip and grin we grip your hand and grin at you its all we can 
do 
he posed for pictures greeted individual soldiers and handed 
out cards 
dont squeeze too hard he told one 
kevin mccarthy a uso executive producer said the organization 
has discussed visits with several other entertainers but gave no 
names 
he said this was martins first military tour 
its only our second day here we know its a long trip and 
were trying to pace it a little bit so we can make it the whole 
week its pretty hectic mccarthy said 
after climbing into the turret of the m1 tank and whirling 
around the camp in a cloud of sand martin told some soldiers that 
therell be more people coming mentioning boxer thomas hearns 
when a trooper asked cant you stay martin quipped ive 
got a meeting 
martin said he has generally avoided political issues 
im not here as a political person but as friend of people 
he said 
i felt guilty everybody coming out here giving up part of 
their lives for this effort i had some time off and i felt kind of 
bad just sitting there so i came

net withdrawals from the nations savings and 
loans slowed to 7 billion in may after soaring to a record 151 
billion a month earlier the government said tuesday 
depositors withdrew 32 billion from 2471 solvent sampls and 
another 38 billion from the 312 failed institutions operated 
under government control the office of thrift supervision said 
that compares with a net outflow in april of 96 billion at 
solvent institutions and 54 billion at governmentrun thrifts 
for the first five months of the year withdrawals totaled 464 
billion compared with 356 billion during the same period a year 
ago 
overall it was the 23rd outflow in 24 months while analysts 
attributed withdrawals in 1989 and earlier to lack of depositor 
confidence in sampls the recent outflow is described as a deliberate 
strategy of shrinking to meet the tough financial standards imposed 
in august 1989 by the sampl bailout law 
thrifts wrote 148 billion in new mortgages in may up from 
139 billion a month earlier but less than 164 billion a year 
earlier the sluggish economy is holding back the housing market 
according to economists 
sampls in may held 902 billion in deposits and had assets of 12 
trillion 
the thrift office is about three months behind in its reporting 
of financial data in past years deposit activity through august 
would be available by now

a cabinet minister was quoted tuesday as 
saying that western hostages held by proiranian extremists in 
lebanon are about to be freed 
agriculture minister mohsen dalloul said syrian president hafez 
assads government has achieved progress in its efforts to free 
the hostages who include six americans 
the question of the hostages is about to come to an end our 
syrian brothers are carrying out contacts and have achieved 
progress dalloul was quoted as saying by the leftist beirut 
newspaper assafir 
the daily said dalloul declined to set a specific date for the 
release or say whether the hostages would come out together or 
separately 
we should not talk about this subject so that we would not 
spoil the ongoing efforts dalloul a prosyrian shiite moslem 
was quoted as saying 
another lebanese leader close to syria abdulla alamin said 
efforts to free the hostages are not likely to be affected by the 
crushing of rebel christian gen michel aouns 11month mutiny on 
saturday 
the attack on aouns enclave cannot be linked with the issue 
of the foreign hostages here are two totally separate issues 
alamin told the associated press 
there has been speculation that syrias preoccupation with 
preparations and execution of the syrianled blitz would delay the 
anticipated release of british hostages 
media reports before the assault on aouns enclave said anglican 
church envoy terry waite and possibly british journalist john 
mccarthy would be released in a matter of days 
these reports said the move would be a result of the resumption 
of diplomatic relations between britain and iran and a subsequent 
visit to tehran by the syrian president last month 
the attack on aoun was mounted by president elias hrawis army 
and syrian troops from three directions one of which was south 
beiruts shiite moslem slums where most of the western captives 
are believed held 
militiamen of the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or 
party of god have since been clashing with a prosyrian christian 
militia in suburban hadath a christian residential district close 
to the shiite slums 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella of underground shiite 
fanatics holding most of the westerners in lebanon 
waite disappeared in moslem west beirut jan 20 1987 after 
leaving his hotel for a meeting with hostage holders he was trying 
to negotiate the release of hostages 
no group has claimed to hold waite but former irish hostage 
brian keenan who was released in august said he was held n the 
same house as waite for a while 
mccarthy was kidnapped april 17 1986 while driving to beirut 
airport to catch a flight to london 
the missing westerners include six americans four britons two 
germans and an italian the longest held is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
shiite leader hussein musawi who heads a prosyrian wing in 
hezbollah has said british hostages would be released first 
because of the improvement in britishiranian relations and that 
usled military deployment in saudi arabia had dimmed chances of 
early release for americans

the newfangled field rations scorned by us 
troops in saudi arabia must indeed be hard to swallow if even the 
armys top officer is making fun of them 
gen carl e vuono the army chief of staff drew roars of 
laughter during an address to a military conference tuesday when he 
jokingly said the rations called mealsreadytoeat or mres 
arent as bad as theyre made out to be 
theyre humorously maligned by a lot of people vuono 
understated but i want to dispel the story that has been going 
around among troops in the saudi desert that even the camels 
wandering into army camps cant stand the mres 
one such camel while observing one of our soldiers enjoying 
his delicious mre thrust his hairy face right in the soldiers lap 
and grabbed his mre 
after chewing for a few seconds so the story goes the 
camel spit the meal out in disgust and angrily chased our great 
trooper across the saudi desert 
now look thats the myth thats going around vuono said 
adding tongueincheek that he had tracked down the soldier and 
had gotten the true story of the camels reaction 
yes one camel did in fact steal that troopers mre but far 
from rejecting the meal the camel munched the mre with great 
pleasure enjoyed the hot sauce belched contentedly and gave 
our soldier a great kiss on the cheek

mikhail s gorbachev today unveiled a new plan to 
rescue the soviet economy eliminating a 500day deadline for 
switching to a market system 
the 66page blueprint delivered to committees of the soviet 
legislature and signed by the soviet president is at least the 
fourth recent plan for reviving the economy 
it is the result of a threeweek behindthescenes effort by 
gorbachev and the countrys top economists to resolve fundamental 
differences over how to move away from a centrally planned system 
that fails to provide adequate food shelter or services for the 
countrys 285 million people 
peoples lives are becoming more difficult their interest in 
labor is falling their faith in the future is crumbling the 
plan says 
the plan which gorbachev is scheduled to present to the full 
542member supreme soviet on friday sets no time limit for 
switching to a market economy but states the experience of 
applying stabilization programs in other countries shows that 
such a period can take about 1 to two years 
it would give the soviet republics a powerful voice and new 
flexibility in running the countrys economy 
the main guidelines will determine only the principal 
approaches every republic moscow and leningrad have the right to 
act as they like within the framework of these guidelines 
gorbachevs spokesman vitaly ignatenko told reporters today 
the plan calls for establishment of an interrepublic economic 
committee to oversee reforms and for republic representatives to 
be included in central executive bodies ignatenko called the 
committee a departure from the tradition of ministries in moscow 
dictating to thousands of factories farms and businesses what to 
produce where to sell it and at what price 
in 1992 the plan says only the prices of bread meat dairy 
products and a few other staples would remain fixed by the state 
that is a slower transition to free pricing than envisioned in a 
draft prepared by soviet economist stanislav shatalin which 
envisoned a 500day deadline 
under gorbachevs plan republics would have the right to 
override price increases allowed by central authorities and to 
control most of the resources on their territory 
to reduce the huge amount of money that soviets have stashed 
away in personal savings the government would accept advance 
payment for scarce and expensive goods such as cars computers 
furniture telephones housing and rural plots the goods would be 
delivered when they became available and the government would not 
pay interest on the money in the interim 
shatalins plan received stong support from reformers such as 
boris yeltsin the president of the russian federation gorbachev 
earlier said he preferred elements of the shatalin plan to those in 
another proposal offered by prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov

on the face of it the united states government 
and environmentalists may seem an unlikely alliance but allied 
they are in their opposition to the resumption of commercial 
whaling in iceland in the second of two stories ap science editor 
paul raeburn examines the efforts to blunt icelands contentions 
that its whales are not endangered 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a whale is the most beautiful animal 
i have ever seen the poet wh auden wrote during a visit to 
iceland in 1936 to see it torn to pieces with steam winches and 
cranes is enough to make one a vegetarian for life 
that kind of revulsion has helped make the global 
savethewhales campaign one of the most dramatic successes of the 
environmental movement an international moratorium on commercial 
whaling was instituted in 1986 and environmentalists now are 
pushing for a permanent ban on all whaling 
we would certainly be against whaling until we could 
definitely show it would not affect the whale stocks says 
kevin chu if there is any doubt we want to err on the side of 
conservation 
thats tough talk and it doesnt come from an 
environmentalist chu is a foreign affairs officer in the us 
state departments bureau of oceans and international environmental 
and scientific affairs 
asked to describe the us position on whaling chu says the 
united states is against it 
the perhaps unusual consensus among the government and 
environmental groups is fueled by two things concern that whales 
are in danger of extinction and the kind of sentiments evoked by 
auden 
the government takes a strong antiwhaling stance because the 
only voices we hear are the voices of the environmentalists chu 
said 
iceland one of the three major whaling nations along with 
norway and japan argues strenuously that the whales it wants to 
hunt are not endangered and that it should be allowed to resume 
commercial whaling 
but even if scientists eventually agree the populations are 
indeed not endangered the campaign to save the whales is unlikely 
to die 
politically it comes down to a relatively simple thing 
said william evans the us representative to the international 
whaling commission there are a number of countries and 
scientists that believe there is not a justification or 
need for any country to continue to harvest these animals 
im completely of the mindset that we have to protect oceans 
for our own survival and the whales are a component of this 
ecosystem said sally shoup of greenpeace we have to stop this 
devastation of the other creatures on the planet if we want to 
protect ourselves 
i think whales are special she said i think they are 
intelligent creatures i think icelanders can understand that as 
well 
the savethewhales campaign began in 1972 when the landmark 
un conference on the environment in a 530 vote passed a 
resolution calling for a 10year moratorium on whaling whalers 
killed 46000 whales that year 
the united states immediately proposed the moratorium to the 
whaling commission which rejected it but the us continued to 
push in 1982 the commission finally approved a moratorium 
beginning in 1986 
what we were going to do was take five years of no whaling 
said evans the us representative to the commission well we 
havent had five years of no whaling because iceland invented 
scientific whaling 
a clause in the international whaling convention allows the 
killing of whales for scientific purposes iceland exploited it 
you have the same boats and the same people and you take the 
same whales and you sell it to the same people and you call it 
scientific whaling said roger payne a noted whale expert and 
president of the long term research institute in lincoln mass 
its a joke 
johann sigurjonsson senior whale specialist at icelands marine 
research institute vigorously disagreed those who have been 
following what were doing understand the seriousness of what were 
doing he said 
in 1985 the last year of its commercial whaling operation 
iceland killed 344 whales it caught 116 in 1986 and the number 
declined to 68 in 1989 this year iceland shut down its whaling 
operation entirely but it continues to press vigorously for a 
resumption of commercial killing of fin sei and minke whales 
congress has passed several laws that allow the united states to 
impose economic sanctions against countries that violate whaling 
commission regulations 
icelands critics have argued that the scientific whaling is 
merely commercial whaling under another name and have pressed the 
united states to impose sanctions the united states might be 
reluctant to do so however because iceland is the site of a 
strategic nato base 
payne said the methods used to estimate whale populations are 
highly imprecise and that the icelandic scientific research has 
shown us nothing we didnt know before 
it could take as long as 100 years to know how many whales can 
be captured without reducing the size of a given whale population 
he said 
the international whaling commission has stopped releasing 
estimates 
the nyses composite index fell 220 to 16364 
at the american stock exchange the market value index slipped 
295 to 29032

weary of being portrayed as environmental 
outlaws for killing whales icelanders are fighting back in the 
first of two stories detailing the whaling controversy ap science 
editor paul raeburn examines icelands efforts to overturn an 
international moratorium on commercial whaling and protect a way of 
life 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a 1989 icelandic television 
documentary entitled survival in the high north icelanders 
talk about the difficulty of making a living on what they call 
the border of the habitable world 
a villager who hunted minke whales until a moratorium on 
commercial whaling says in apparent puzzlement it seems to be 
incredibly important to stop catching a few minke whales here every 
year but it doesnt seem so important to the world that it is 
being destroyed by nuclear pollution and that people are being 
killed all over the planet 
the villagers lament is heard often in a land where whaling has 
been a way of life for centuries this year for the first time 
since the 1940s iceland abandoned whaling part of a carefully 
plotted campaign to overturn the moratorium 
iceland one of the three major whaling nations along with 
norway and japan wants to kill whales again 
the whaling industry means to iceland what the auto industry 
means to the us said guthni bragasson spokesman for icelands 
foreign affairs ministry whaling is a small part of the overall 
economy but an important one but a more telling reason might be 
icelands very different point of view about the relationship 
between people and natural resources many people outside iceland 
view whales as magnificent creatures worthy of protection many 
icelanders view them as just another ocean resource 
when the moratorium on commercial whaling began in 1986 the aim 
was to give scientists time to determine whether they could set 
quotas that would allow whaling without endangering the mammals 
survival 
iceland immediately exploited a whaling commission loophole by 
beginning a program of scientific whaling arguing that it 
couldnt assess the status of its whale populations without killing 
and examining a number of whales 
that prompted greenpeace to launch a boycott of icelandic fish 
products picket lines appeared outside restaurants in the united 
states operated by burger king wendys and long john silvers 
which purchased icelandic fish 
the greenpeace campaign was very effective said gudmundur 
hermannsson a reporter who covers whaling for morgunbladid 
icelands largest daily newspaper i have a feeling that if there 
hadnt been this pressure from greenpeace iceland this year would 
have announced a new scientific whaling program 
at the international whaling commissions meeting in july 
iceland presented evidence that its whales arent endangered 
setting the stage for a showdown at the next meeting to be held in 
may in reykjavik icelands capital 
if they dont accept some whaling theyre not following the 
scientific evidence said jakob jakobsson director of the 
countrys marine research institute 
if they are protecting whales because they are nice then why 
do minnesotans shoot deer and why does the royal family hunt fox 
and why does the king of sweden come here to shoot reindeer which 
he doesnt even eat 
jakobsson is eager to press the point to anyone who will listen 
he sees his country as david fighting the greenpeace goliath 
there was no way we could compete with greenpeace in the 
media bragasson said indeed greenpeace was honored in august 
by the better world society for using the media and other methods 
of communication in the most creative and innovative ways 
are the icelanders environmental outlaws as greenpeace calls 
them why do they continue whaling in the face of widespread 
international condemnation 
our main point is that these are exploitable animals said 
johann sigurjonsson the senior whale specialist at the marine 
research institute nobody in iceland wants to wipe out the 
whales nobody wants to wipe out any species 
icelands population of 250000 spread thinly along the coast 
of a largely uninhabitable volcanic island the size of virginia 
has depended almost entirely on the sea for survival since the 
country was settled by norsemen and celts in the 9th century 
icelanders had been hunting whales for 600 years before herman 
melville chronicled capt ahabs fateful pursuit of moby dick in 
the 19th century an illustration in the 13th century icelandic 
book of law called the jonsbok shows a whale being flensed or 
having its blubber peeled off 
icelands fisheries now account for about 75 percent of its 
exports providing vital foreign exchange for a nation that must 
import nearly all of its manufactured goods before the whaling 
moratorium whale products made up about 2 percent of icelands 
exports sigurjonsson said 
iceland takes pride in its careful stewardship of its marine 
resources and that might be the one point on which iceland and 
greenpeace agree 
greenpeace has said repeatedly that iceland does have one of 
the bettermanaged fisheries in the world said sally shoup a 
greenpeace whale specialist in washington 
we want to have the responsibility for management of our 
resources because we are the party that will be hurt if the 
resources are overexploited sigurjonsson said people have 
been saying ok if we are not allowed to take care of the whales 
in our waters what will be next 
in 1916 icelands parliament the althing banned most whaling 
because of concerns about the depletion of whale stocks 
whaling resumed briefly in 1935 until it was interrupted by 
world war ii the present whaling operation began in 1948 in whale 
fjord a deep gorge on icelands eastern coast north of reykjavik 
the whaling station consists of a halfdozen redroofed yellow 
brick buildings on a hillside overlooking a broad concrete pier 
whales are hoisted up a wide metal ramp onto the pier where they 
are cut up and processed 
the station was nearly deserted during this summers whaling 
season the first summer since 1948 that the fjord hadnt resounded 
with the rumble of winches and cables and the shouts of whaling 
men 
the action this year was in the netherlands at the whaling 
commissions meeting there sigurjonsson and other icelandic 
officials argued that the whales they want to hunt are not 
endangered in icelandic waters 
the whales in question are fin whales sei whales and small 
whales called minke whales which are hunted by 50 or 60 families 
in iceland but not by the operation at the whaling station

minke whales topped the agenda this year the minke population 
around iceland east greenland and jan mayen a small island 
northeast of iceland is estimated at 28000 sigurjonsson said 
for 40 years icelanders have killed 200 to 300 minke whales a 
year sigurjonsson has concluded that the effect on the population 
has been negligible and would not drive minke whales to extinction 
the data on fin whales will be addressed by the whaling 
commission next year sigurjonsson estimates 11500 fin whales are 
in the east greenlandiceland stock the annual catch of 230 to 240 
fin whales could resume without damage to the stocks he said 
less is known about sei whale stocks but the killing of 60 to 
70 animals per year appears not to have substantial impact on the 
stock sigurjonsson said but i stress that we have not 
completed our study on that 
these numbers have been derived in part from icelands 
scientific whaling program greenpeace and other critics have 
contend the killing of whales is not necessary to estimate 
populations scientific whaling is nothing more than commercial 
whaling by another name they say 
thats a very unfair statement sigurjonsson said we 
believe that lethal research is necessary for certain types of 
investigations 
fin whales for example dwell not in coastal waters but 
offshore its pretty rough out there sigurjonsson said if 
you want to know the age distribution and particularly age at 
maturity and the fecundity rate the quickest way is to sample 
iceland will make a pitch for resumption of minke and fin 
whaling next spring with the completion of studies on the fin 
whales if the international whaling commission doesnt allow 
iceland to resume whaling the country is threatening to withdraw 
from the commission then it no longer would be bound by the 
moratorium 
but even if icelands efforts to prove its whales are not 
endangered ultimately succeed its not likely that international 
opposition would dissolve 
sigurjonsson has acknowledged the widespread belief outside 
iceland that because whales are so intelligent and highly 
developed they have the same right as human beings to live without 
being harvested 
that view is held by one of icelands most important trading 
partners and on this issue one of its most formidable opponents 
the united states government

in an order worth at least 11 billion and potentially a record 22 
billion or more 
the deal announced monday includes boeings new 777 model the

probe in november 1986

united airlines has ordered as many as 128 new 
boeing airplanes a deal potentially worth a record 22 billion 
in hopes they will help it reach more destinations more frequently 
and more efficiently 
the agreement includes firm orders for 34 boeing model 777s and 
30 boeing 747400s with a total value of about 11 billion 
in addition united has the option to purchase an additional 34 
model 777s and 30 model 747400s if all those options were 
exercised the total value of the purchase would swell to at least 
22 billion and make it the largest order in history 
assembly on the 777s is to start in late 1992 as they are 
delivered united said they will replace the companys dc10 
planes on domestic routes and provide expansion capacity 
delivery of the 747400s would start in 1994 a number of 
747400s from a previous order are expected before that and will be 
used for continued expansion of uniteds international market 
stephen wolf chairman of chicagobased ual corp uniteds 
parent company said the company would more than double its service 
to europe in 1991 by adding destinations 
for united customers wolf said the order means more service 
to more destinations in the worlds newest most modern and 
efficient aircraft 
for our shareholders it means more revenue growth to be 
reflected in increased shareholder value 
in short it will ensure that this company is positioned to 
compete aggressively around the world wolf said 
the announcement of the deal on monday was followed by the us 
department of transportation decision to give the airline authority 
to operate a nonstop chicagotokyo route 
the aircraft deal includes boeings new 777 model the 
firstever order for that plane and represented a significant coup 
for boeing over its leading competitors mcdonnell douglas corp 
and airbus industrie of europe 
it also came a week after a protracted employee effort to buy 
united failed and seemed to signify an attempt by one of the 
nations leading airlines to refocus attention on its longterm 
competitive position 
wolf declined to discuss plans for financing the order but he 
said it wouldnt affect employee contract negotiations 
we dont intend to ask them to make concessions to pay for the 
fleet he said we anticipate raises 
wolf said the expansion provides a sense of security for 
uniteds 74000 employees

aircraft is 168 billion made in april 1989 by an irelandbased 
aircraft leasing company gpa group ltd it ordered a total of 308

a 21 percent decline in earlyoctober sales of 
north americanmade vehicles doesnt give much of a clue about the 
state of the auto industry analysts say 
during the oct 110 period this year general motors corps 
car sales soared 159 percent from a year earlier ford motor co 
sales sank 238 percent and chrysler corp sales gained 26 percent 
from last year 
theres almost no way of reading the numbers said auto 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman brothers in new york 
were going to need to get a sense of where this market is 
another couple of 10day reporting periods 
the 10 major companies making cars and trucks in the united 
states said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 30096 
compared with a rate of 30734 during the same time last year 
car sales spurred by the big gm increase rose 19 percent 
while truck sales dropped 95 percent 
car sales by the big three dropped 15 percent while sales of 
domestically made cars with japanese nameplates rose 426 percent 
gm ford and chrysler had 894 percent of the domestic car market 
in early october 
the companies together have been battling a slumping sale rate 
ever since the 1989 model year technically ended sept 30 1989 
during the last quarter of 1989 the sales rate fell to its lowest 
levels of the year 
car and truck sales rates tend to drop in early october mainly 
because of the deals offered in september as the model year closes 
out gm was particularly aggressive with incentives in september 
1989 making cars and trucks more attractive to consumers who had 
planned on buying later in the year 
consequently gms earlyoctober combined car and truck sales 
pace last year was particularly low a yeartoyear comparison 
showed a 133 percent rise in gms earlyoctober sales fords car 
and truck sales fell 213 percent in early october and chryslers 
dropped 108 percent 
that bucks a trend of gm and ford being down slightly and 
chryslers down more 
theres a lot of noise in the numbers said ford sales 
analyst joel pitcoff 
for the year through oct 10 domestic car and truck sales were 
down 46 percent with car sales falling 51 percent and truck 
sales off 37 percent gms sales were down 5 percent fords were 
off 91 percent and chryslers declined 146 percent 
sales figures are being affected by a wide variety of things a 
slump in the general economy declining consumer confidence rising 
gasoline prices big incentives on 1990 model cars and little ones 
on 91 versions and purchases by fleets including rental car 
companies and large corporations 
chrysler which recently returned to the fleet business has 
shown increases in its car sales during the last two periods 
the company said its combined car and truck sales for early 
october were 108 percent lower than last year with car sales 
rising 26 percent and truck sales dropping 26 percent 
ford said its early october car sales fell 238 percent and 
truck sales were down 172 percent combining for a 213 percent 
decline in vehicle sales 
gm said its vehicle sales were up 133 percent over last year 
in addition to the 159 percent increase in car sales gms light 
truck sales were up 73 percent

a settlement between the state and 12 major 
automakers will provide up to 100 million in refunds to consumers 
under the states lemon law 
the settlement announced monday was believed to be the largest 
such refund ever by automakers and could set a precedent for other 
states officials said 
within the next month automakers will place advertisements 
detailing the details of the refund plan in major new york 
newspapers the ads will run for six weeks and consumers have 4 
months to respond 
the settlement covers all new york residents who bought or 
leased new cars after aug 2 1986 and who were forced to pay for 
repairs that should have been covered by warranty 
the repair must have been made after the manufacturers basic 
warranty expired normally duringthe first 12 months or 12000 
miles whichever came first but before the first 24 months or 
18000 miles or whichever came first 
the states lemon law requires manufacturers and their 
dealers to make repairs under their warranty at no cost to the 
customer for a period of two years or 18000 miles whichever 
comes first 
state attorney general robert abrams said monday that the 
settlement was the result of a longfought effort of four years 
to get the auto manufacturers to agree on the terms 
the car makers who entered into the agreement are chrysler 
ford general motors honda hyundai isuzu mazda mitsubishi 
nissan subaru toyota and volvo each company also paid the state 
10000 in costs for a total of 120000 but they did not admit 
wrongdoing in signing the settlement 
car makers such as mercedesbenz were not included in the 
settlement because their warranty programs are broader than the 
states lemon law abrams said

three american pioneers in financial 
economics and corporate finance won the 1990 nobel prize in 
economics today 
it was the seventh time in 10 years the award given by the 
swedish academy of sciences has gone to americans 
harry markowitz of the city university of new york was cited for 
developing the theory of portfolio choice the academy said 
merton miller of the university of chicago was honored for his 
fundamental contributions to the theory of corporate finance 
william sharpe of stanford university won for his contributions 
to the theory of price formation for financial assets the 
socalled capital asset pricing model the academy said 
the three will divide the 700000 prize 
since 1969 when the prize was first awarded 18 of the 30 
winners of the economics prize have been americans 
the announcement of the prize was delayed for more than 45 
minutes while the academy tried unsuccessfully to reach markowitz 
who was in japan 
miller and sharpe the laureates the academy reached by 
telephone were really stunned said professor assar lindbeck 
of the swedish academy of sciences 
he said they asked about the exchange rate between the dollar 
and the kronor 
we wanted to give the prize for pioneer work innovators 
said lindbeck he said financial markets has been one of the 
hottest areas for economic research in the past 10 years 
most of the prizewinners work was done in the 1950s and 1960s 
their theories began to be used in the early 1970s he said 
each of them the winners gave one building block to the 
financial market theory lindbeck said the theory would have 
been incomplete if one of them had been missing together they 
created a complete picture of theory for the financial market which 
has had great importance in research and education 
most previous prizes have been awarded for broader areas of 
research lindbeck said the working of financial markets is a 
specialized field 
financial markets serve a key purpose in a modern market 
economy by allocating productive resources among various areas of 
production the academy said 
to a large extent it is through financial markets that savings 
in different sectors of the economy are transferred to firms for 
investments in buildings and machines the academy said 
it also said financial markets reflect firms expected 
prospects and risks which implies that risks can be spread and 
that savers and investors can acquire valuable information for 
their investment decisions 
markowitz 63 a native of chicago made the first pioneering 
contribution in the field of financial economics in the 1950s 
the academy said 
he developed a theory for households and companys allocation 
of financial assets under uncertainty the socalled theory of 
portfolio choice 
the theory analyzes how wealth can best be invested in assets 
that differ in their expected return and risk it therefore helps 
reduce risk 
miller 67 a native of boston made the most important 
achievements in the theory of corporate finance and the evaluation 
of companys on markets said the academy 
miller initially collaborated with 1985 economics prizewinner 
franco modigliani of the united states 
the theory explains the relation or lack of relation between 
companys capital asset structure and dividend policy on one hand 
and their market value on the other 
im delighted to accept it and im still in a state of 
shock miller said in a radio interview this morning 
our work was always known as the modiglianimiller 
propositions of corporate finance he said he then won it for 
his contributions with me but also for his other work in economics 
theyve already recognized the work once and now im getting 
the other half he said 
sharpe 56 a native of cambridge mass was the leading figure 
among several researchers in the 1960s who used markowitzs 
portfolio theory as a basis for developing a theory of price 
formation for financial assets the academy said that was the 
socalled capital asset pricing model 
the economics prize is the only nobel award established to 
complement the five prizes that dynamiteinventor alfred nobel 
created in his will at the end of last century it was instituted 
in 1968 by swedens central bank 
nobels original prizes in physics chemistry medicine peace 
and literature have been awarded since 1901 
the economics prize is awarded by the same body that awards 
nobels physics and chemistry prizes it follows the same 
guidelines including nobels wish that the prize shall be awarded 
to those who have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind 
the nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced 
wednesday 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was awarded the peace 
prize on monday 
the prizes are presented dec 10 the anniversary of nobels 
death in 1896 the peace prize is given in oslo and the others in 
stockholm

texas and north dakota which each lost three oklahoma and 
michigan which each dropped two and colorado which dropped one

index of drilling activity since 1940 the count represents the 
number of rigs actively exploring for oil not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
louisiana showed the most gains for the week with an additional 
five rigs operating there kansas and wyoming each added three rigs 
for the week new mexico increased by two rigs while pennsylvania 
added one

resorts international inc has taken 
a step toward selling its three hotels and one casino in the 
bahamas but the company says no sale is imminent 
the casino company announced monday the hiring of salomon 
brothers investment firm to help sell its paradise island 
properties because of its experience selling hotel and resort 
properties said resorts spokesman andy brimmer 
that includes the sale last year of more than 500000 rooms in 
the us hotel industry brimmer said 
resorts officials told the state casino control commission in 
august that they expect to sell the properties by december 1991 
two months before the casino companys license comes up for 
renewal 
resorts anticipates the sale would generate between 250 million 
and 300 million 
prior to their august approval of a debtforequity plan to take 
resorts out of bankruptcy state casino commissioners said the 
paradise island sale was crucial to the success of resorts 
restructuring 
resorts also retained salomon brothers last year as bankruptcy 
advisors 
brimmer said a sale was not imminent and that the december 1991 
target remains viable although the latest possible sale date would 
be within four years 
i do think that they plan to sell it in a fairly timely 
manner brimmer said monday theyre not going to make any rash 
decisions 
he discounted the prospect of trying to sell a casino company 
when gaming revenues are flat and indications are that the country 
may be heading into a recession 
its being sold on a global basis its nt affected by local 
economic problems brimmer said this is the crown jewel 
resorts atlantic city property merv griffins resorts casino 
hotel recorded a profit of 27 million on gross revenue of 592 
million for the quarter ending june 30 the latest period for which 
figures were available 
overall resorts international posted net earnings of 803000 
on revenues of 1091 million for the second quarter 
like the rest of the atlantic city gaming industry resorts 
casino hotel has lost business as a result of the recession and the 
april opening of the trump taj mahal casino resort 
last month resorts posted gross gaming revenues of 179 
million a 129 percent decline from the 205 million recorded in 
september 1989 
salomon brothers director charles masson said he would not 
comment on a price for the bahamian properties but shared brimmers 
optimism that a sale would occur 
clearly its in the companys best interest to sell the 
property as soon as possible masson said the environment for 
selling these types of properties is obviously not the best

federal officials have begun an 
investigation of the student loan marketing association office in 
lawrence kan to determine if it bought worthless loans to 
inflate assets and boost the companys stock price an fbi 
spokesman said 
max geiman spokesman in the fbis kansas city office said 
monday that agents with the education departments inspector 
generals office in kansas city and the fbi started a joint 
criminal investigation three weeks ago 
he said it began after two former employees filed a lawsuit 
alleging fraud within the loan servicing and purchasing procedures 
of the association commonly called sallie mae 
the purpose is to determine if there has in fact been any 
violation of any criminal laws geiman said 
he said the investigation could be lengthy given the complexity 
of sallie mae which holds 18 billion in student loans making it 
the nations largest purchaser of governmentbacked student loans 
the lawrence operation is one of five sallie mae loan servicing 
centers 
gisela vallandigham a spokesman at sallie maes headquarters in 
washington dc denied the allegations and declined to comment on 
the investigation 
geiman said the investigation is the result of the lawsuit filed 
in us district court in kansas city kan by diana crossfield 
and brenda albright former managers at sallie maes lawrence 
office 
ms crossfield was once the secondhighest ranking manager at 
the center she and ms albright allege they were forced to resign 
last year after telling top management about irregularities in 
sallie maes methods 
the two allege that sallie mae bought large numbers of void and 
canceled student loans from banks and employees were instructed to 
log those loans into the ledger even though the student borrowers 
clearly owed nothing 
they say that loans that had lost their federal guarantees were 
purchased and put on the books even though they stood to cost 
sallie mae money if the borrower defaulted 
further they contend sallie mae told students their accounts 
were delinquent when they were current in an attempt to collect 
more money 
their complaint does not indicate how large the problem was or 
whether the alleged practices were common outside the lawrence 
servicing center 
ms crossfield and ms albright said they discovered the 
problems during internal auditing ordered by management 
worried that recognition of those problems would result in lost 
revenue that would devalue sallie maes stock those supervisors 
allegedly stopped the investigation and forced out the two women 
besides sallie mae the lawsuit names nine individuals as 
defendants including edward fox and lawrence a hough the past 
and present presidents of sallie mae respectively 
the lawsuit alleges securities fraud as well as wire and mail 
fraud in a civil complaint brought under the racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations act the suit also alleges equal pay 
violations in which female supervisors were paid less than their 
male counterparts 
sallie mae denies allegations contained in the suit saying it 
has investigated the claims and finds no merit bankers who 
allegedly sold the bad paper also deny selling sallie mae void and 
canceled loans 
ms crossfield and ms albright filed suit for wrongful 
dismissal on sept 14 sallie mae has not responded to the 
complaint in court filings 
reports on the suit prompted federal investigators to approach 
the women for further information the two have declined to speak 
publicly about the allegations in their lawsuit 
student loans are guaranteed and subsidized by the federal 
government banks originate the loans but then sell them to a 
secondary lender such as sallie mae 
typically a bank sends a twoparty check to the students 
school before reselling the loan with the students signature on 
the check financial aid officers then cash them to pay tuition and 
fee if a student fails to enroll or doesnt qualify for the loan 
for some reason the loan is canceled

university of chicago economist merton miller said he initially 
thought it was a crank call when he was told he had won the 1990 
nobel memorial prize in economic science today 
im delighted to accept it and im still in a state of 
shock miller said this morning 
miller was one of three us economists to win the 1990 nobel 
prize in economics he will share the 700000 prize with harry 
markowitz of the city university of new york and william sharpe of 
stanford university 
markowitz 63 a chicago native cited for developing the theory 
of portfolio choice said he gave up any hopes of winning the nobel 
prize nine years ago when yale university professor james tobin was 
honored for work on another facet of portfolio theory 
id thought it was never going to happen markowitz said 
after news that he had won the 1990 prize reached him in tokyo 
where he starts teaching a class at tokyo university on wednesday 
there was a prize given to james tobin also in portfolio 
theory but applied more to economics and less to business 
administration than mine 
i figured thats it theyve given the prize for portfolio 
theory 
markowitzs portfolio theory analyzes how wealth can be best 
invested in assets that differ in their expected return and risk 
the theory involves use of computers and data bases and is used by 
large institutional investors in the united states markowitz said 
miller of the university of chicagos graduate school of 
business was honored for his fundamental contributions to the 
theory of corporate finance 
the swedish academy of sciences said the 67yearold miller made 
the most important achievements in the theory of corporate finance 
and the evaluation of firms on markets 
in a telephone interview the boston native said he got the news 
in an earlymorning phone call and thought it was a crank call at 
first when he didnt hear anything on the line 
but he said his heart kind of stopped a bit when he heard 
the news from the accented voice on the other end of the phone 
he worked initially in collaboration with 1985 economics 
prizewinner franco modigliani of the united states 
the corporatefinance theory explains the relation or lack of 
one among firms capital asset structure and dividend policy on 
the one hand and their market value on the other 
our work was always known as the modiglianimiller 
propositions of corporate finance miller said he then won it 
for his contributions with me but also for his other work in 
economics 
theyve already recognized the work once and now im getting 
the other half 
sharpe 56 a native of cambridge mass won for his 
contributions to the theory of price formation for financial 
assets the socalled capital asset pricing model the academy 
said 
since 1969 when the prize was first awarded 18 of the 30 
winners of the economics prize have been americans

continental airlines said it will postpone an 8 
percent fare increase that was scheduled to begin today and 
announced a thanksgiving holiday deal for companion flights 
dave messing a spokesman for the houstonbased airline said 
continental has delayed its fare increase until oct 23 in hopes 
that competitors also will postpone increases 
the higher fares will be continentals third increase since the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait that caused record increases in the 
cost of jet fuel 
since the start of the mideast crisis the spot price for jet 
fuel has jumped from about 57 cents a gallon to 142 a gallon 
according to aviation daily 
while other carriers have considered such a move only 
sistercarrier eastern has announced a similar increase 
in addition continental said it is offering halfprice 
companion fares for travel on offpeak days around the thanksgiving 
holiday 
tickets must be reserved and purchased this week 
under the offer travelers purchasing a roundtrip maxaver 
fare for travel on us mainland routes leaving nov 14 15 18 
19 20 22 and 23 can take along a companion at half price 
return travel is permitted nov 22 and 23 or nov 27dec 13 
we can make this offer because business travel normally slacks 
off for the entire thanksgiving week and holiday travel tends to 
be concentrated on just a few days a spokesman said that 
gives us the opportunity to make more discount seats available 
during the offpeak days

in the first public test of prosecutors 
evidence against michael milken three government witnesses failed 
to definitively link the junkbond financier to a key stock 
manipulation charge 
at a special hearing on unproven allegations against milken 
former drexel burnham lambert inc trader peter gardiner claimed 
monday his exboss without a doubt manipulated wickes cos 
stock in april 1986 but he offered no direct evidence 
testifying with immunity gardiner also said he was told milken 
had authorized an order that drexel workers throw out documents 
after learning speculator ivan boesky was cooperating with the 
governments securities fraud probe that november 
but gardiner and two other government witnesses failed to state 
directly that milken told boesky or ordered someone to tell 
boesky to buy large blocks of wickes in an illegal bid to drive 
up the price as the government has charged 
milken 44 was first linked to wrongdoing with boesky almost 
four years ago he pleaded guilty in april to six counts of 
conspiracy and fraud but the special presentencing hearing is the 
first time the governments voluminous case involving dozens of 
witnesses has been aired in a courtroom 
the hearing is to give us district judge kimba wood more 
information about milkens professional character before 
sentencing the exhead of drexels beverly hills calif junk 
bond division faces up to 28 years in prison 
wood said it was unclear from gardiners testimony that milken 
directly ordered a manipulation she said milkens statements as 
quoted by gardiner were fairly ambiguous 
assistant us attorney john carroll said milken was the only 
person there who could authorize these transactions and that 
despite the lack of a direct link to boesky the april 23 activity 
stemmed from his leadership position and his admitted illegal 
relationship with boesky 
but the judge said i cant just assume because he did 
something in one context that he did it here 
boeskys information led federal investigators to milken one of 
the most successful financiers of the 1980s and the biggest figure 
to fall in the prosecution of wall street corruption 
the hearing in manhattan federal court scheduled to last two 
weeks continued today with further testimony on wickes the first 
of three transactions to be discussed testimony was to resume 
thursday 
prosecutors questioning former drexel corporate finance 
executive joseph harch sought to show drexel was motivated to help 
wickes retire the preferred stock to keep the clients business for 
lucrative financings 
but harch said wickes chairman sanford sigoloff never asked 
drexel to buy wickes stock to help retire the issue harch also 
said he was never told by milken to buy the stock 
at issue is the purchase of 19 million shares of wickes stock 
by boesky late on april 23 1986 which helped the price close 
above 6lsqb and meet a provision allowing the company to retire an 
expensive issue of preferred stock 
gardiner testified milken asked traders to obtain socalled 
unsolicited orders from customers to buy wickes violating drexel 
policy for trading in securities of clients then he said milken 
told him peter wickes 6lsqb 6lsqb 
he looked at me and there was no question he was directing me 
to find buyers of wickes stock one thing i am sure of is 
that wickes was manipulated that day at milkens direction without 
a doubt he said 
gardiner offered no evidence he had anything to do with getting 
boesky to buy wickes stock for drexel he said his customers didnt 
buy any wickes another former drexel trader cary maultasch last 
week also failed to link milken to boesky on wickes as did 
exboesky trader michael davidoff 
gardiner contradicted testimony by maultasch that gardiner told 
him to ask boeskys trading company to buy wickes gardiner said he 
couldnt recall doing that 
he said milken asked him to call cary and ask him to find out 
how many wickes we had bought the government alleges boesky made 
the purchases secretly for drexel 
gardiner also said he believed milken had approved an order to 
junkbond department workers to discard documents on the day 
boeskys plea deal with the government was announced on nov 14 
1986 
after boeskys plea was announced gardiner said former junk 
bond executive alan rosenthal told traders to clean out your 
desks get rid of anything that isnt nailed down and dont 
throw it in the company garbage he said that he had talked to 
mike 
on the alleged document destruction gardiner conceded milkens 
name often was used by other junkbond workers even when milken 
himself had not approved an order

a federal judge on tuesday acquitted three former 
midlevel sundstrand corp executives of wrongdoing in a scheme by 
the aerospace contractor to defraud the pentagon 
the verdicts ended the only prosecution of individuals so far in 
connection with sundstrands admitted fraud for which the rockford 
company paid the government nearly 200 million in a record 
settlement for such offenses 
us district judge prentice h marshall said he was satisfied 
the three defendants had done no wrong but he said he was 
perplexed by the lack of other indictments given sundstrands 
1988 admission of corporate guilt 
why those who directed that behavior were not prosecuted 
baffles me marshall said 
assistant us attorney keith syfert declined to comment 
immediately after the bench trial ended 
the defendants were ray john chapel jr former director of 
business planning ralph g hamann former sundstrand section 
manager for government contracts and joseph j mccarthy former 
vice president for finance and administration 
marshall found the men innocent of conspiracy to lie to the 
government and of concealing the alleged conspiracy he acquitted 
them last week on charges of lying to the government the trial 
began sept 10 
mccarthy said there was no fraud at sundstrand 
in my opinion sundstrand paid 200 million for nothing he 
said 
he said that sundstrand was extorted by a government threat 
of racketeering charges and that the companys leaders made a 
decision that dumped it all on me 
hamann said the verdict makes me wonder what in hell we were 
doing here it just boggles my mind 
in 1988 sundstrand pleaded guilty to five counts of criminal 
fraud admitting it had overbilled the pentagon from may 1980 
through august 1985 
sundstrand which sells the navy and air force generators and 
parts admitted billing the government for such expenses as 
babysitting golf movies and snow plowing for executives 
sundstrand paid the government 199 million in fines and 
penalties the largest such payment ever and was suspended for 
nearly four months as a defense contractor

share for the julyseptember quarter compared with 313 million 
or 53 cents per share a year earlier

several new hasbro toys enjoyed strong sales including dolls based 
on the pop musical group new kids on the block and world wrestling

sales in new product lines was replacing volume thats going away 
on other products 
domestically new kids world wrestling federation cabbage 
patch dolls all performed well he said but we needed those 
to perform well to basically have a flat domestic business from 
what we did a year ago

companys earnings slump from earlier in the year for the first 
nine months of 1990 hasbro reported profits of 613 million or

jeanpierre van rossem was considered a 
guru of belgiums stock market a selfproclaimed financial whiz 
who reportedly managed 7 billion from international investors last 
year alone 
he also loved to flaunt his own wealth which he once put at 
300 million there was the fleet of red ferraris he hauled to news 
conferences the prestigious formula one racing team he sponsored 
but van rossems empire became unglued over the summer the 
apparent victim of a deal gone bad and overextension 
van rossem 45 recently spent a month and a half in jail 
including his honeymoon on charges of forgery and writing bad 
checks the french photo company kis accused him of not having 
enough money to cover a check for 54 million for a 12 percent 
stake in the company 
i finally fell on my face he said at a news conference over 
the summer called to announce that his company moneytron was 
broke 
moneytron has yet to file for bankruptcy and earlier this 
month van rossem said was negotiating to sell the company to an 
unnamed banking consortium in singapore 
in his heyday van rossem boasted he knew a system to beat the 
stock exchange and futures market and his moneytron forecasting 
system caught on among investors last year he managed 7 billion 
from international investors according to the financial times of 
london 
its not clear exactly how van rossem ran into his financial 
problems he blames much of his woes on gobetweens of an unnamed 
us broker who he says failed to repay 362 million from a 
futures deal he said about 200 million of that money belonged to 
clients 
today van rossem says he lives off the profits from the 
clothing shop owned by his new wife rachidi in fact she had to 
put up the shop as collateral to pay the wedding bill he said 
despite his personal misforutnes van rossem remains an expert 
in the media game said hans verstraeten a communications 
professor at the brussels university 
his hulking figure unaffected by 45 days of prison food 
recently adorned the pages of britains financial times his 
rasping insolent voice is still in demand with talk show hosts a 
recent magazine interview with him was advertised in advance in 
major newspapers 
in a small country like this not a lot has to happen before 
you stand out said verstraeten 
he is the rebel who worked his way up and still mocks the 
rich added guy mortier editor of the magazine humo which 
featured van rossem on its cover recently maybe people will tire 
of him but i think he still has a long way to go 
van rossem doesnt exactly cut the figure of a smooth operator 
he is grossly overweight his gray straggly hair droops onto 
his chest he smokes nonstop and in heated discussions his usual 
style of conversing white spittle forms in the corners of his 
mouth 
as a guest on a popular television talk show recently van 
rossem assailed an earlier guest the mayor of a north sea resort 
who wants to keep working class visitors out of his tony town for 
making racist and criminal remarks about the working man 
in 1989 when he owned the onyx formula one racing team van 
rossem called one racing organizer a nazi and another a 
shark 
born into a catholic family whose bourgeois lifestyle he said he 
despised van rossem became a marxist as a student 
with his capitalist ventures in shambles he now calls himself 
an anarchist 
van rossem said literature is his next domain he wants to 
fill the void in modern literature in belgium and the 
netherlands with a thriller penned in prison 
his novel the state in a state of decomposition was 
released earlier this month 
he also wrote a crude poem recently about his father describing 
him as having a mouth full of vinegar and slime he and his 
father are no longer on good terms 
on his tombstone he said he would like to have inscribed here 
lies van rossem he made loads of money for others but didnt keep 
a cent for himself

grain and soybean futures prices closed modestly 
lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade as harvest pressure 
prevailed over the mixed effects of a congressional compromise on a 
new crop program 
house and senate negotiators approved the triple base 
program which will result in more soybean acreage and fewer corn 
and wheat acreage planted next year than would otherwise be the 
case 
the news initially prompted heavy selling of soybeans for 
delivery in the fall of 1991 and buying of newcrop corn and wheat 
but prices closed lower across the board in reaction to 
forecasts for continued good harvesting weather in the midwest and 
a government report that showed 40 percent of the soybean harvest 
and 32 percent of the corn harvest complete as of sunday 
the harvest is going along nicely and that weighed down the 
market in general said victor lespinasse an assistant vice 
president in the graintrading division of dean witter reynolds 
inc 
at the close wheat futures were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 260 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 226 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cent lower with december at 118 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 9 cents lower with november at 610 a

edward j debartolo corp one of campeau corps 
largest creditors said tuesday it will not extend an agreement 
that prevented it from seizing assets of the beleaguered campeau 
without notice 
under the agreement debartolo could not call in 480 million in 
loans to campeau without giving nine days notice debartolo had 
extended the agreement several times over the past year but 
allowed it to expire tuesday 
campeau spokesman richard wertheim said debartolos decision 
meant a similar agreement with two olympia amp york developments ltd 
subsidiaries involving a 260 million loan from those firms was 
also suspended 
wertheim said it was too soon to tell if youngstown ohiobased 
debartolo would move on any campeau assets mainly campeaus 
federated department stores inc 
however even if they did try to seize campeau assets most are 
tied up in chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings now under way in 
the united states wertheim said 
campeaus allied stores corp is also going through the chapter 
11 process 
were continuing to talk said wertheim he edward j 
debartolo has talked about various options i hope well continue 
talking and see where it goes from there 
campeau borrowed 480 million from debartolo to help finance the 
67 billion buyout of federated in 1988 the buyout failed a year 
ago after campeau was unable to make interest payments on junk 
bonds used to finance the federated and allied deals 
after federated filed for protection from its creditors 
liability for the loan fell to campeau which had struck the loan 
agreement with debartolo 
wertheim has said campeau corps strategy is to reorganize the 
us operations under the chapter 11 process sell off a 
substantial portion of the companys real estate holdings in canada 
and reach an agreement on restructuring the debt with the principal 
lenders including debartolo and olympia amp york

european community nations remained divided 
tuesday over a subsidy reduction plan designed to end a deadlock 
with the united states in talks to liberalize world trade 
officials said the ec agriculture ministers could not back a 
compromise under which the ec commission would devise compensation 
measures aimed at offering a future to the communitys farmers 
sources said the compromise was rejected as too vague france 
and west germany were the strongest opponents to both the 
compromise and a 30 percent cut in subsidies while britain the 
member most favoring free trade supported the subsidy cuts 
the issue is key to the success of the uruguay round of talks to 
liberalize world trade held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the talks are scheduled to end in 
december 
the united states wants an elimination or drastic reduction in 
subsidies saying they give an unfair advantage to farmers in ec 
member nations but most ec states find as much as a 30 percent cut 
too drastic arguing the subsidies are needed to help their farmers 
compete 
the 30 percent cut would apply to such products as cereals 
rice sugar and livestock over the period 19861996 but not to 
subsidies for exports of ec farm goods 
on monday the ec missed a gatt deadline to submit a formal 
proposal on subsidies while the united states issued a proposal 
calling for 90 percent cuts in export subsidies and 75 percent cuts 
in subsidies to farmers over 10 years starting in 1991 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said in washington 
monday the united states simply concluded that in the next 10 
years we may well not be able to get all the way 
but lets go as far as we can he added 
agricultural subsidies cost the industrialized world an 
estimated 250 billion a year with just over half of that spent by 
the ec

in thirdquarter profits as problem loans mounted putting 
increasing pressure on the nations largest banking company to 
restructure and rebuild its capital base 
separately manufacturers hanover trust co and first interstate 
bancorp reported a return to profitability while no 12ranked 
wells fargo amp co said profits rose 6 percent 
citicorps net income for the quarter ended sept 30 totaled 
221 million or 56 cents a share down from 358 million or 99 
cents a share a year earlier 
analysts had expected earnings in the 70 centashare range but 
rick mueller a vice president with chicagobased duff amp phelps 
noted that despite the worsethanexpected earnings analysts are 
worried about other issues 
what sparked concern was a 34 percent increase in problem loans 
excluding debt to lessdeveloped countries which grew to 565 
billion from 454 billion in the previous quarter 
thats up significantly mueller said though analysts had 
expected an increase in citicorps nonperforming assets mueller

what they will have to do to take care of it 
with capital levels below industry norms citicorp has been 
pressed to restructure in recent months commercial businesses in 
the banks global finance unit have been under review 
but analysts anticipate a larger companywide restructuring to 
take place involving significant cutbacks in personnel asset 
sales a possible stock issuance and trimming of the dividend 
surprisingly the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
44 cents a share the announcement comes at a time when other major 
banks have been forced to scale cut payouts to shareholders to 
rebuild capital

billion down 11 percent from 819 billion a year earlier 
interest expense amounted to 548 billion down 13 percent from 
632 billion in the yearago quarter 
citicorp noted in a statement that it continued to be 
proactive in recognizing loan losses and has been building its 
corporate reserve position to provide for possible further 
deterioration 
the bank said that because the domestic real estate market has 
not yet stabilized continued writeoffs and cost to carry will 
extended into 1991 citicorp said nonperforming domestic 
commercial real estate loans totaled 218 billion up from 117 
billion in the third quarter of 1989

lufthansa said tuesday it has 
withdrawn its application to acquire a 26 percent stake in the 
former east german state airline interflug 
lufthansa which is 51 percentowned by the german government 
said in a short statement that a changed situation exists since 
german unification on oct 3 
it said because the bonn government now owns the assets and 
shareholdings of the former east german state the fact that both 
lufthansa and interflug are controlled by one major shareholder 
opens creative maneuvering room that must be considered 
the statement provided no further elaboration a spokesman at 
the companys headquarters said only that the changed political 
situation in germany leaves all the options open regarding 
interflugs future 
he declined to comment on whether lufthansa currently is 
negotiating with government officials in bonn over business links 
with interflug 
lufthansa and the federal cartel office have been at odds over 
the airlines intention to expand broadly into eastern germany 
the office in a preliminary opinion recently informed 
lufthansa of its reservations about the planned cooperation with 
interflug on antitrust grounds lufthansa dominates its domestic 
market 
berlinbased interflug serves what is now eastern germany and is 
in dire need of a complete overhaul of its fleet which consists 
mainly of aging soviet airliners interflug recently was reported 
by the hamburgbased weekly news magazine der spiegel to be on the 
verge of bankruptcy 
the german government is said to be eager to sell off at least 
part of interflug into private hands quickly

environmentalists say they were heartened by 
the approval early tuesday by a housesenate conference committee 
of a 408 billion farm bill that enhances agricultural 
conservation 
its now an environmental statute ken cook of the center 
for resource economics said of the farm bill weve made it one 
where it wasnt before 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee and the conference committee said the package was a 
mark of how environmental awareness is changing in this country 
the committee which has been working on the legislation for 
weeks completed the bill after a 14hour marathon of negotiations 
that ended tuesday at 345 am edt 
the major disappointment for environmental groups watching the 
lengthy negotiations was the omission of a ban on the export of 
pesticides that are outlawed or unregistered in the united states 
they showed who they work for bill mcnichol of the national 
coalition against misuse of pesticides said of the conferees 
they had to make a choice between the economic interests of the 
chemical companies and the safety of consumers 
it was an important provision that will be enacted someday 
soon said kathryn hohmann of the sierra club but we look at 
the other provisions in the bill and we see some gigantic 
strides 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday he does not 
like everything in the bill and would have written it differently 
but in the end it is a respectable work product that 
balances well innumerable sensitive often divergent interests 
he said in a statement 
agriculture undersecretary richard crowder predicted president 
bush would be satisfied with the bill 
leahy had made the pesticide export ban a personal crusade but 
pulled it from the negotiating table when conference members tried 
to water down stringent language he had designed 
the proposal had been intended to stop pesticides that are not 
used in the united states because of health concerns from showing 
up on the american dinner table as residue on imported food 
but chemical companies lobbied hard against the plan saying 
they would lose billions of dollars in overseas business and be 
forced to close manufacturing plants in the united states wiping 
out hundreds of jobs 
the national agricultural chemical association pointed out that 
many pesticides manufactured here are unregistered because they are 
directed at pests that exist only in other countries 
leahy said he would introduce his plan as separate legislation 
next session 
sen richard lugar rind the ranking republican on the senate 
agriculture committee called the overall farm bill an excellent 
marriage of environmental and business concerns 
it gives the american farmer a great deal of flexibility and 
freedom to plant he said it clearly is oriented to make us 
more competitive 
some of the planting flexibility in the bill was forced on the 
committee by the need to cut the federal budget by 500 billion 
over the next five years including 136 billion from agriculture 
you cross your fingers and hope that giving them flexibility 
will make up for the loss of support said de la garza 
the bulk of the bills budget savings would be achieved by 
requiring farmers of rice feed grains wheat and cotton to reduce 
the acreage protected by the governments support system by 15 
percent in each of the five years of the measure 
this socalled triplebase plan allows farmers flexibility 
to plant those commodities experimental crops industrial crops 
or products not already in substantial supply however they would 
not be subsidized by the taxpayers 
the government sends the farmer a check known as a deficiency 
payment when the market price falls below the 
governmentestablished target price 
the conferees agreed to calculate those payments on a 12month 
basis starting in 1994 instead of the current five months used 
for most crops since current calculations are based on the months 
immediately after harvest when market prices are lowest the 
government expects to save money by averaging the entire year 
the conference committee also agreed to allow winter wheat 
farmers who already are planting their crop to choose between the 
triple base or the 12month deficiency payment for 1991 
despite the decreases in subsidies these changes would create 
the bill still provides 8 billion to 10 billion in support to 
farmers said leahy 
other savings would come from 
setting marketing loans for soybeans at 502 a bushel with a 2 
percent service charge 
putting a 1 percent service charge on loans for sugar peanuts 
tobacco and honey 
requiring reduction of 15 percent of acreage for the 1991 wheat 
crop and 75 percent of the corn crop 
other significant provisions include 
a 1010 per hundredweight minimum support price on dairy 
products with a 5cent assessment per hundredweight this year 
rising to 11cents in later years 
a limit of 100000 on deficiency payments and 150000 on 
marketing loans that can be received by a single farmer 
continuation of the crop insurance program 
forestry provisions designed to save millions of trees on 
private forest land 
incentives to farmers who participate in programs to improve 
water quality around their farms and underground 
strengthening of penalties against draining wetlands for crop 
production 
procedures by which farmers could drain wetlands in the middle 
of their planting area if they create new wetlands on easements on 
their property 
requirements that records be kept on pesticides that are being 
used

alaska has surged ahead of texas as the 
nations leading oil producer topping the 2 million 
barrelsperday mark for the first time since prudhoe bay began its 
decline in 1988 state officials said monday 
texas with a daily output of 17 million barrels of crude is 
now the nations number 2 producer 
the numbers got our attention said chuck logsdon chief 
petroleum economist with the department of revenue 
last summer alaskas crude oil production dropped to a low of 
16 million barrels a day 
every 100000barreladay increase in crude output on an 
annualized basis produces another 200 million in revenue for the 
state at current prices he said 
nearly every oil field in the state has increased production 
during the past month said dudley platt petroleum economist with 
the department of revenue 
higher oil prices make people do crazy things platt said 
a week ago a half million dollars was too much to spend on a 
well this week theyll spend a million to get it done in a
