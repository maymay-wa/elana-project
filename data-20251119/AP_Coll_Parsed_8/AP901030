a civilian army employee who was handcuffed and 
removed from his office for threatening to go public says many army 
helicopters lack equipment that would protect them from iraqi 
heatseeking missiles 
a colleague says the man was a scapegoat in a coverup of 
problems in army aircraft safety 
army officials said they suspected calvin j weber of the army 
aviation systems command here had planned to disclose sensitive 
information about equipment vulnerability 
weber said many of the approximately 95 vietnamera huey 
helicopters used by american forces in operation desert shield lack 
modern equipment designed to fool heatseeking missles 
he said he suspected that only about a third of the more modern 
blackhawk helicopters had uptodate antimissile gear and some 
cobra attack helicopters also lack the equipment 
it would cost about 40000 to add the antimissile device to 
each huey weber said the devices either disperse the exhaust of 
the helicopters engine making detection by a heatseeking 
missile more difficult or provide a decoy heat source that 
confuses a missiles guidance system he said 
missile systems have advanced but the army has trodded and 
plodded and was lax in taking care of equipment with the latest 
protection available weber told a reporter for the st louis 
postdispatch last week he said he began warning defense 
department officials of the potential danger two years ago 
weber 48 was handcuffed and carried from his job at the army 
aviation systems command when he refused to leave and was charged 
with disorderly conduct and two other misdemeanors he faces a 
court date nov 16 
the army said the veteran of 16 years working for the army was 
to be fired as of wednesday after colleagues removed his personal 
belongings from his desk 
army officials citing privacy regulations have refused to 
discuss details of webers case 
dick mooy a senior engineer with the aviation command who is 
helping weber in an effort to keep his job said the command is 
despotic and interested only in itself 
mooy said he had worked for the army as a civilian for 22 years 
working mostly with army helicopters and other aircraft he said he 
had known weber for years and described him as an expert on 
helicopter survivability 
mooy said he agreed with webers contention that many of the 
army helicopters sent to saudi arabia in operation desert shield 
lacked the full range of equipment needed to thwart heatseeking 
missiles 
both engineers said the army had accused weber of keeping 1500 
worth of army helicopter screws at his house mooy said a 
supervisor had not objected to webers having them 
mooy added that army mohawk surveillance airplanes including 
some in saudi arabia might be a danger to themselves 
he said an infrared suppressor for that aircraft was prone to 
come apart and damage the planes rudder 
i call this as an engineer a big coverup in the army 
mooy said cal tried for years to go through channels but it 
came to a dead end

a federal judge tuesday dismissed a 
16yearold lawsuit on desegregation of louisiana colleges and 
universities siding with the state over the us justice 
department 
the judge cited a recent appeals court ruling that colleges in 
mississippi were not intentionally segregated he said that ruling 
was binding and controlling in the louisiana case 
the justice department which filed the louisiana lawsuit in 
1974 was the only party still contending the state is running a 
segregated higher education system 
amy casner a justice department spokeswoman said agency 
officials would have to review the ruling before commenting on 
whether they will appeal 
in the mississippi case a threejudge panel of the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals ruled last month that mississippi which 
has an open admissions policy offered real freedom of choice 
for students to pick their schools and no longer was intentionally 
running a desegregated system 
louisiana also has an open admissions policy but enrollment at 
historically black southern university and grambling state 
university remain almost all black blacks are in the minority at 
louisiana state and seven other of the states 17 colleges and 
universities 
us district judge charles schwartz in a twoparagraph order 
said the appeals court ruling in the mississippi case left him with 
no disputed material facts left to resolve 
state and federal authorities thought they had settled the case 
in 1981 with a consent decree in which the state agreed to pour 
hundreds of millions of dollars into grambling and southern to 
improve buildings equipment and programs and to make the two 
schools more attractive to whites 
by 1988 black leaders and the justice department concluded the 
consent decree had failed a threejudge panel led by schwartz 
agreed the system was still segregated and issued its own sweeping 
desegregation plan 
that plan called for a single governing board to replace four 
boards that oversee the louisiana schools 
gov buddy roemer had long embraced the singleboard idea but 
his administration appealed the plan on grounds that louisianas 
colleges and universities are not segregated those appeals were 
pending when schwartz dismissed the lawsuit

former district of columbia police chief 
maurice turner said tuesday that mayor marion barry was the target 
of several undercover drug operations when turner was police chief 
up to now only one investigation of barry the one that led to 
his arrest conviction and sixmonths prison sentence had been 
revealed 
i was aware of the rumors and innuendos surrounding the 
mayor turner now a republican mayoral candidate said during a 
campaign forum on wjlatv there were several aggressive grand 
juries that were seated and there were stings that didnt 
materialize 
in other news about barrys case the judge at his trial was 
quoted as telling a law school audience in cambridge mass he 
thought the case against barry was overwhelming on 10 of the 14 
counts and believed that four jurors were determined to acquit 
barry no matter what the evidence 
those four obviously did not tell the truth when they said 
they would approach the case without bias said us district judge 
thomas penfield jackson in a speech at harvard law school 
according to a dispatch from cambridge in wednesday editions of the 
washington post 
i am quite sure that neither race nor politics played any 
part in the case said jackson 
many of the mayors supporters have accused government 
prosecutors of targeting black officials like barry in corruption 
investigations barry and turner are black jackson is white 
turner declined to provide details on the sting operations 
against barry which he first mentioned in response to a question 
about whether he would have approved such a tactic against his 
thenboss 
the stings were field operations and i dont want to go into 
it turner said i do approve of sting operations though 
turner who served 32 years on the police force with the last 
eight as chief added that he would not have sacrificed my career 
for someone using drugs 
the former chief declined to say whether the operations were 
coordinated with federal officials or whether his department was 
acting alone 
the federal investigation that led to barrys arrest in 
cooperation with city police began in december 1988 when officials 
started looking into why city police called off an undercover drug 
purchase at a hotel after discovering that barry was in the 
suspects room 
turner was police chief then a hotel manager testified later 
that he the manager blocked the undercover purchase because he 
feared the publicity that would result if the mayor were involved 
barry was arrested jan 18 this year after fbi agents made a 
secret videotape of him smoking crack cocaine in the hotel room of 
one of barrys former girlfriends who had cooperated with 
investigators 
the mayor was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charge and acquitted of another after a twomonth trial this 
summer the jury failed to agree on a dozen other charges 
including the possession charge stemming from barrys arrest 
last friday barry was sentenced to six months in prison 
turner a former democrat is considered a long shot to win next 
tuesdays mayoral election against democrat sharon pratt dixon 
democrats outnumber republicans by a 91 margin in the nations 
capital

for the first time in five months 
all three of nasas space shuttles have been cleared for flight 
with atlantis due to lift off next week and columbia in december 
columbia was found to be free of dangerous hydrogen leaks during 
an elaborate fueling test tuesday the spaceship has been grounded 
since may 
obviously we have had some problems weve had to work said 
shuttle director bob crippen that perhaps took us longer than 
some people thought it would but it was a tough set of problems we 
were working 
atlantis also crippled by hydrogen leaks over the summer 
passed a fueling test last week the shuttle is scheduled to lift 
off nov 9 with a satellite that reportedly will spy on iraq 
the tests gave a lift to nasa which has sent up only one 
shuttle discovery since april discovery earlier this month sent 
a probe on a mission to explore the sun 
launching space shuttles and reputation they are tied 
together said launch director bob sieck safely and 
successfully carrying out these missions which is our goal is 
only going to help the reputation and our cause to keep the program 
going 
during tuesdays threehour test columbias external tank was 
filled with more than 385000 gallons of liquid hydrogen a small 
amount of hydrogen escaped into the engine compartment but was well 
within allowable limits 
it was nasas most extensive fueling test of a shuttle ten tv 
cameras and 17 sensors were mounted in columbias engine 
compartment to detect leaks 
nasa had tried four times to launch columbia with the 150 
million astro observatory 
fuel lines and other parts were replaced and numerous joints 
tightened officials believe workers accidentally damaged 
components in columbia while searching for contamination after the 
shuttles last flight in january 
columbia could be launched in early december if atlantis goes up 
on time crippen said that will allow nasa to finish the year with 
six shuttle missions three fewer than planned

william french smith helped guide ronald 
reagan from hollywood to the white house and then drastically 
revised federal policy on crime civil rights and corporate mergers 
during his tenure as attorney general 
born aug 26 1917 in wilton nh to an aristocratic yankee 
family smith pursued an impeccable establishment career in 
corporate law deviating from his heritage only in his adoption of 
los angeles as his home 
he died of cancer monday in los angeles he was 73 
indeed there was little in his background personality and 
early public appearances to foreshadow the sweeping changes he 
would make when he took office as the nations 74th attorney 
general in january 1981 
a specialist in corporate relations with labor smith was 
managing partner of the prestigious los angeles law firm of gibson 
dunn amp crutcher when reagan named him attorney general 
smith had been with the firm since he began his career in 1946 
during that time he had become reagans personal attorney and 
helped guide the investments that turned the actor into a 
millionaire 
he also had become a key behindthescenes political adviser as 
reagan sought first the california governorship and then the 
presidency he served as the informal chairman of a group of 
california millionaires known as the kitchen cabinet who saw 
reagan socially boosted his political fortunes and helped pick his 
first cabinet 
but at his confirmation hearings the publicityshy smith 
responded to virtually every question by saying he would have to 
study the matter 
early in his tenure he confided that it was not until shortly 
before taking office that he realized the immigration and 
naturalization service was part of the department of justice he 
noticed it on the ins seal as he crossed the border when returning 
from a short trip to mexico 
and a magazine story early in his tenure at justice quoted an 
administration official as calling him a somnambulist or 
sleepwalker a description that rankled him 
but if he started slower than his predecessors smith altered 
more department policies more sharply than any attorney general in 
a generation 
among the changes in which he played a key role were 
the appointment of the first woman sandra day oconnor to the 
supreme court 
bringing the fbi for the first time into drug enforcement a 
move previous administrations had considered but shield away from 
legislation overturning a 100yearold ban on military aid to 
civilian law enforcement he brought the military into tracking 
planes and ships smuggling cocaine and marijuana from south 
america 
advocating the most extensive immigration law revisions in 
three decades though he left office before congress finished 
acting on them 
the relaxation of rules against corporate mergers which had 
not been changed in 15 years this helped set off a wave of 
mergers 
a halt to the justice departments advocacy of mandatory busing 
to desegregate schools and of hiring and promotion goals to remedy 
job discrimination in this he changed policies advocated by four 
previous administrations of both parties but was unable to 
convince the supreme court to overturn the legal precedents 
supporting those remedies 
a presidential order instituted unprecedented lifetime 
censorship for the writings and speeches of former government 
officials with access to the most sensitive intelligence and a 
major broadening of the use of the polygraph machine in leak 
investigations congress however stepped in to block immediate 
implementation of the order 
the merger policies of his antitrust division infuriated 
consumers and liberal democrats 
black groups and womens organizations were outraged over his 
civil rights policies they prevailed in congress over his 
opposition to toughening the voting rights act and in court over 
his unprecedented effort to give tax exemptions to racially 
discriminatory private schools 
he also drew a mixture of praise and criticism for being the 
first attorney general to view his job as an international one he 
took four major foreign trips to 14 countries including an 
unprecedented roundtheworld tour to encourage foreign officials 
to help stop drugsmuggling 
drug enforcement officials hailed these efforts but the 
roundtheworld jaunt with his wife jean along at government 
expense cost more than 600000 and was criticized as extravagant 
his later trips used smaller planes and a reduced entourage 
although his wife still accompanied him 
smiths personal finances and patrician style also drew attacks 
career department attorneys many of them opposed to his 
policies jeered his establishment of a second private dining room 
at the justice department and his regular appearances on the 
washington social circuit 
in 1982 democrats including sen edward m kennedy of 
massachusetts criticized his investment in two oil and gas tax 
shelters and his acceptance of a 50000 severance payment when he 
left the board of directors of the earle m jorgensen steel co to 
become attorney general 
smith defused that controversy by agreeing to return the 50000 
and limit his tax deductions in the two ventures to the amount of 
his cash investment 
smith seemed surprised at these criticisms for he was 
unaccustomed to public scrutiny of his personal life 
he was born into wealth his father who died when smith was 6 
years old owned the mexican telephone and telegraph company and 
battled the revolutionary pancho villa one ancestor arrived in 
this country aboard the mayflower another uriah oakes was the 
fourth president of harvard which has educated a smith in every 
generation 
he graduated with highest honors from the university of 
california at berkeley in 1939 received his law degree from 
harvard in 1942 and spent four years as a navy lieutenant during 
world war ii he then joined gibson dunn amp crutcher 
it was to that firm and private life that he returned when he 
announced his surprise resignation in january 1984 asserting that 
he had completed much of what he wanted to do smith said he also 
wanted to resume his behindthescenes work on behalf of reagan 
who was then seeking reelection to the presidency

republicans marked democratic rep jolene 
unsoeld for defeat as soon as she squeaked into congress in the 
closest us house race of 1988 
now unsoelds political future appears tied to an issue that 
didnt even exist two years ago 
unsoeld was a staunch supporter of gun control as a state 
legislator but as a freshman member of congress shes championed 
the views of the national rifle association 
the apparent aboutface has become the hottest campaign issue in 
her race against conservative republican bob williams a longtime 
advocate of gun owners rights 
she has managed to raise the whole issue of integrity and 
whats wrong with congress williams says they go back there 
and suddenly they become different people theyre not one of us 
sarah brady chairwoman of the handgun control inc lobby group 
in washington dc said unsoeld sold her political soul to the 
assaultweapons lobby in the hope it will get her reelected 
unsoeld who won her seat by 618 votes in the closest house race 
i 1988 stoutly defends her pronra position calling gun 
ownership a constitutional issue in the legislature she says she 
viewed it as a crime issue 
i am extremely outraged at my opponents deliberate 
misrepresentation of my position and suggestion that my views or 
actions can be influenced by money or threats unsoeld has said 
because some people thought they knew what my position was on gun 
control they found it painful to discover otherwise 
the most scathing attacks have come from her longtime allies 
liberal democrats the common cause citizens lobby guncontrol 
groups and the media 
one political cartoonist drew unsoeld as a machine guntoting 
rambo and the seattle times editorialized against her 
unconscionable sellout 
her highprofile switch touched off an ad war between the nra 
and bradys group the former portrays her as an american heroine 
the latter as a defender of the arsenals used by crack dealers 
mass murderers and hate groups 
state democratic leaders admit the change in position will hurt 
unsoeld 
what its going to cost her i dont know said state party 
chairwoman karen marchioro 
even before the guncontrol question heated up unsoeld was 
under fire from timber industry advocates who objected to her 
support for protecting the oldgrowth forest habitat of the 
endangered spotted owl 
an oct 2425 poll conducted for the national republican 
congressional committee showed the race a dead heat with unsoeld 
favored by 36 percent of those surveyed and williams by 40 percent 
and 25 percent undecided the survey had a 57 percentage point 
margin of error 
the guncontrol issue surfaced this fall when unsoeld championed 
an amendment protecting the domestic manufacture of assault weapons 
similar to the foreignmade uzi and ak47 
the amendment considered the major gun vote of the year passed 
the house 257172 earlier this month the crime bill to which it 
was attached passed a day later 
a transcript of the house rules committee shows that unsoeld 
requested permission sept 12 for a vote on the amendment 
according to a letter on file with the federal election commission 
she received a 4950 contribution from the nra the same day 
the timing was extraordinarily bad says democratic state 
sen phil talmadge 
unsoeld is swamping williams in finances her contributions 
including those from political action committees come to about 
825000 compared with about 472000 for williams 
williams an accountant has been endorsed by gun owners of 
america which says it represents 100000 of the most progun 
households in the nation 
that group says its not impressed with mrs unsoelds support 
for a minor amendment

drinking alcohol while using cocaine makes the 
body produce a third substance that may yield a greater high but 
may also raise the risk of death by overdose scientists say 
the research together with a preliminary finding that drinking 
boosts the risk of a fatal cocaine overdose about 20fold in people 
with severe coronary heart disease may help explain the puzzling 
overdose deaths in people with surprisingly little of the drug in 
their blood at autopsy 
new studies show that this third substance manufactured in the 
liver from cocaine and alcohol can mimic some actions of cocaine 
in the brain drinking is frequently combined with cocaine use 
according to the national institute on drug abuse 
researchers spoke in telephone interviews about studies that 
were presented monday at the annual meeting of the society for 
neuroscience in st louis 
the substance is a close chemical cousin of cocaine called 
cocaethylene further studies of it may give leads for medications 
to treat cocaine addiction by blocking cocaines effects said 
study coauthor deborah mash a neuropharmacologist at the 
university of miami school of medicine 
scientists found that cocaethylene affects a braincell 
communication system thought to produce the euphoria that leads to 
cocaine addiction she said 
prior research suggests that cocaine produces its high by 
intervening in this system in which brain cells signal each other 
with a chemical called dopamine after a dose of dopamine reaches 
its target cell it is supposed to be brought back to its original 
home by molecules called transporters but cocaine blocks this 
mechanism by binding to transporters keeping the signal turned 
on and producing a sense of pleasure scientists say 
the new work shows that cocaethylene also binds to the 
transporters suggesting it may boost cocaines effect mash said 
in addition she said it appears less able than cocaine to 
moderate the euphoria through a second brain communication system 
another possible role of cocaethylene deals with cocaine 
overdose deaths in people with severe coronary artery disease 
the overdose study found no elevated risk for people with 
moderate or mild coronary disease said coauthor dr james 
ruttenber of the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
the study included about 240 cases of fatal cocaine overdose and 
a comparable number of deaths from other causes in people who had 
taken cocaine ruttenber said 
mash said cocaethylene might play a role in the elevated risk 
because it can cling to brain cell sites that are supposed to 
attract a braincommunication substance called acetylcholine 
this may interfere with the brains control of the heart pumping 
rhythm she said if the heart is already affected by heart 
disease the result could be sudden death she suggested 
ruttenber said that less than 20 percent of overdose deaths in 
the study involved severe heart disease and that it is not clear 
whether cocaethylene contributed to the elevated risk 
but if it did he said it may also play a role in the more 
common puzzle of overdose deaths in people with surprisingly little 
cocaine in their blood 
about 40 percent of overdose deaths in the study fit that 
category and it has been noticed before he said 
for cocaine users he said such cases suggests that even if 
they are careful about the quantities of cocaine they use they 
still may not be able to ward off a fatal overdose 
michael kuhar a nida neuroscientist who did not participate in 
the studies said the suggested roles for cocaethylene are 
plausible it is a new entity we dont know much about he 
said

thousands of hindu holy men and their 
followers broke through police barricades tuesday and stormed 
toward the moslem mosque they want to replace with a hindu temple 
many were beaten back by police who fired tear gas and lashed 
out with irontipped bamboo canes dozens were injured hindu holy 
men screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted the police with 
stones 
about 200 people overran police lines in the narrow lanes and 
were halted at the foot of the hill just 600 feet from the mosque 
the religious dispute has made the name of this hindu holy town 
a battle cry in moslemhindu riots that have left more than 100 
dead across india in the past week 
the dispute threatens to topple the government of prime minister 
vp singh a rightwing hindu party withdrew its support for singh 
last week when his government tried to deter plans to build new 
hindu temple where the mosque now stands 
ayodhya had been under aroundtheclock curfew since friday in 
an effort to keep hindu fundamentalists from carrying out their vow 
to begin construction of the temple tuesday 
roads leading to the 16th century mosque were blocked but about 
5000 people emerged from hiding places in fields around ayodhya 
before sunrise and stormed a bridge leading into the town 
police arrested between 100 and 200 people and rained blows with 
their bamboo canes on fallen members of the crowd the 600 
policemen on the milelong bridge eventually turned back the crowd 
inside ayodhya a town of about 40000 people reporters saw 
some members of the state police force lift barricades and let 
hindu holy men run into the lanes leading to the mosque the 
infiltrators were halted short of the mosque by federal 
paramilitary police 
on monday a group of about 80 hindu holy men in ayodhya threw 
stones at police and set a bus on fire when authorities attempted 
to arrest a local hindu priest a police inspector said 
the inspector who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was 
an isolated incident and did not cause any lasting tension 
but within an hour of the skirmish authorities banned entry 
into ayodhya and canceled passes issued to reporters 
despite the efforts to deter them and the presence of 20000 
police and paramilitary troops in town the hindu fundamentalists 
vowed to start the temple construction program as scheduled 
in new delhi on monday the world hindu council had claimed 
10000 supporters had slipped through police cordons and roadblocks 
around ayodhya 
the exact time for the start of construction has not been 
announced 
in new delhi prime minister singh offered to resign if the 
hindu fundamentalist bharatiya janata party which supports the 
temple construction program would accept a legal verdict on the 
dispute 
singhs national front coalition was relegated to a minority in 
parliament last week after bharatiya janata withdrew its support to 
the government singh has maintained he still holds a parliamentary 
majority and is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence on nov 7 
the government has vowed to block the temple construction and 
said a court of law should decide who the site belongs to 
the fundamentalists claim the mosque stands atop the very spot 
where rama one of the most worshipped hindu gods was born and 
therefore is a religious matter not a legal one 
moslems a minority in officially secular but predominantly 
hindu india fear the displacement of one mosque could jeopardize 
hundreds of other islamic sites across the country 
on friday the government of uttar pradesh state imposed an 
aroundtheclock curfew in ayodhya in an effort to keep temple 
advocates from reaching the disputed hilltop trains to the area 
were halted and roads blocked by police and paramilitary troops 
moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million people of 
whom 82 percent are hindu in uttar pradesh state where the 
government is allied with singh moslems account for about 30 
percent of the 120 million people

forget that picture of cleancut 
minnesota politics this year its alleged skinnydipping with 
teenage girls and financial impropriety 
the troubles of republicans jon grunseth rep arlan stangeland 
and sen dave durenberger have turned the states lake wobegonlike 
image into minnesota mud 
political sleaze has found a new home 
the tragedies of this year would be extraordinary in any age 
but theyre a culmination of what i see as a general level of 
conduct which is not nearly as good as we think it is former st 
paul mayor george latimer said monday i think it will be 
followed by a lot of serious reappraisal 
grunseth quit the governors race sunday amid allegations he 
swam nude with teenage girls nine years ago and had an 
extramarital affair during both of his marriages 
stangeland used his congressional credit card to pay for more 
than 400 longdistance telephone calls to and from a womans home 
and office 
and the senate in july found that durenberger had engaged in 
unethical financial conduct 
thats not all there have been 
sexual harassment allegations against democratic gov rudy 
perpichs former chief of staff 
the indictment of a close perpich political associate in 
connection with an sampls failure 
the resignation of a popular state representative as head of 
the powerful minnesota house appropriations committee after 
pleading guilty to charges stemming from his solicitation of males 
for sex 
accusations that another state representative diverted about 
93000 of clients money to his own use while acting as their 
financial planner he resigned and pleaded guilty to four counts of 
felony theft 
grunseth denied the nudeswimming allegations the former 
perpich aide maintains his innocence and the sampl case has yet to be 
resolved stangeland says even the latenight phone calls were 
businessrelated 
but the goodgovernment image of minnesota is gone 
the scandals and the negative tone of the 1990 governors race 
will lead to greater scrutiny of potential candidates predicts 
dj leary a democratic political analyst 
parties will be extraordinarily careful about doing the 
fingernail test in future elections leary said they 
candidates may have to bring some proven credentials in some 
other field if not in government where both the public and 
private self has been under scrutiny for a number of years 
even before the nudeswimming allegations against grunseth 
minnesota voters were complaining about the negative tone of the 
1990 governors race 
perpich had traveled the state distributing court documents 
pertaining to grunseths divorce disputes with his first wife and 
perpich surrogates had criticized grunseth for some tardy property 
tax payments 
grunseth accused perpich of orchestrating the skinnydipping 
allegations and called the governor the supreme liar although 
he offered no proof to back his claim 
i keep hoping that weve hit bottom but i dont see any signs 
of it said latimer negative campaigning works and it works 
in minnesota the question becomes how effective can negativism be 
and not bring the wrath of voters against a candidate who uses 
them 
observers of the minnesota political scene disagree about what 
it the years events mean 
i think minnesota is still the kind of state it has been and 
the fact there was such an outpouring of objection to grunseth is 
an indication of the virtue of the state rather than the 
opposite said former republican gov elmer l andersen 
minnesota voters expect honesty and dedication from their public 
servants and they react pretty vigorously to any departure from 
it andersen said i dont think minnesota is changing much 
unfortunately there have been a number of incidents 
latimer a democrat looks at it differently 
minnesota residents have been living off our past reputation 
and increasingly the evidence does not support that reputation 
he said 
theres been a tendency to overstate minnesota as a 
goodgovernment state with innocent hardworking 
nottoosophisticated people who are honest loyal and brave 
latimer said 
its a little smug to say we are so good were still shocked 
by the bad he said for years weve been saying that but the 
simple fact is what happened to dave durenberger is not just 
extraordinary for the state of minnesota its extraordinary in the 
us senate 
we are not as good as we pretend to be as we should be as we 
ought to be in our level of public conduct latimer said

advocates for the poor are hailing a series of 
new benefits in medicaid and other programs that congress included 
with the tax increases and spending cuts in the deficitreduction 
bill 
thousands of families will be aided by the expanded programs 
under which the government will foot doctors bills for more 
lowincome families and for mammograms performed on older women 
large portions of the billions of dollars of new spending will 
be spent on families who work but who remain needy 
the common theme that connects a lot of this is that it is 
aimed at lowand moderateincome families said robert 
greenstein executive director of the center for budget and policy 
priorities a washingtonbased advocacy group for the poor 
one of the most dramatic increases is for medicaid which helps 
lowincome americans pay their medical expenses it will allow the 
program for the first time to cover all children below age 19 whose 
families are below the poverty level 
currently poor children younger than age 6 are covered most of 
those covered above that age belong to families on welfare leaving 
out those in families who earn just enough not to qualify for 
welfare 
the change would be phased in gradually initially adding only 
7yearolds to the program and progressing to children one year 
older each year 
the eventual effect is expected to be enormous officials 
believe 704000 additional children will receive medicaid benefits 
by 1995 costing the government 560 million during the next five 
years 
its a terrific step forward said marian wright edelman 
president of the childrens defense fund 
lawmakers also decided to expand medicaids coverage of the 
elderly poor 
the government will spend 580 million over the next five years 
to help senior citizens receive care in their own homes adult 
daycare centers or group homes 
it will also put up 387 million to pay the monthly medicare 
premium for doctors expenses an outofpocket cost for most 
medicare recipients for many of the poorest elderly 
in a separate 100 million effort the government will provide 
athome care for retarded people 
overall the deficitreduction bill envisions additional 
medicaid spending of 23 billion through 1995 
but since the bill also contains savings of 29 billion over 
the next five years there would be a net reduction in medicaid of 
600 million the savings come largely from requiring drug 
companies to lower their prices for medicaid recipients and by 
savings on insurance costs 
the deficitreduction bill also included 
a 22 billion childcare package containing tax credits and 
grants with most of the money directed to the working poor 
new restrictions on private firms that sell health insurance 
policies to the elderly an industry that has been accused of 
frequent abuses 
21 billion in new spending under medicare which provides 
money for medical costs of elderly and handicapped the chief new 
help for them allows coverage for mammograms or breast xrays 
until now the program only provided reimbursements for women 
having mammograms if disease was suspected overall the growth of 
medicare is being reduced by 44 billion 
740 million in new social security spending a major change is 
the easing of the conditions under which a widow or widower can 
receive disability benefits cuts in other parts of social security 
yield a net savings in the program of 85 million

religious faith in eastern europe remains 
strong despite years of official repression under communist 
regimes according to polling data gathered by the gallup 
organization 
gordon heald the londonbased director of gallups 
international arm told the associated press his studies indicate 
that religious belief in czechoslovakia hungary and the soviet 
republic of lithuania closely parallels that of western europe and 
the nordic countries 
fewer people go to church in the former communist countries 
where religious activity was often punished than attend services 
in western europe but the percentage of people who describe 
themselves as religious is quite comparable heald said 
in a continuing study of peoples values the pollster reported 
he has found a striking difference between east and west in the 
trust that citizens place in various institutions 
personal interviews with 1000 randomly selected lithuanians 
showed they place their highest confidence in the church the 
lithuanian legislature that has led a drive for independence from 
soviet rule and in the lithuanian news media 
in hungary where the press and broadcasters are perceived as 
having taken a leading role in bringing down the communist regime 
the media hold the highest confidence rating of all institutions 
checked heald said the church with 67 percent of respondents 
giving it their vote of confidence ranked 5 percentage points 
below the media but 5 points above the government the army 
parliament police and communist party lagged behind the 
government 
the courts police military and the kgb secret police rank with 
the soviet communist party and private cooperative businesses at 
the bottom of the confidence scale in lithuania heald reported 
previous gallup studies have shown that the armed forces police 
and the legal system are among the most highly respected 
institutions in the united states canada and europe 
the polling specialist presented his findings about the status 
of religion in eastern europe to a symposium last week at 
georgetown university 
in an interview with the associated press he explained the 
samples taken so far show that 45 percent of ethnic lithuanians 49 
percent of czechoslovaks and 56 percent of hungarians still 
consider themselves religious the predominant religion in all 
three areas is roman catholicism healds tables show 62 percent of 
western europeans but only 46 percent of scandinavians consider 
themselves religious 
surveys in the united states show 81 percent of americans 
consider themselves religious 
although the number of selfdescribed nonreligious people was 
somewhat higher in the formerly communist countries of hungary and 
czechoslovakia than in western europe the number of convinced 
atheists in lithuania was between 2 and 4 percent compared to 5 
percent in all of western europe and 10 percent in france alone 
heald found 
public opinion polling is still relatively new to the soviet 
union and findings often are unscientific heald said he has had 
particular difficulty gathering reliable data in the russian 
republic but that his lithuanian polling operation has worked well 
marxist doctrine denounced religion as an opiate of the 
masses and thousands of clergy were executed or imprisoned 
during the stalin years proselytizing was officially forbidden 
and churchgoers were subject to intimidation by secret police in 
the soviet union and several soviet bloc countries thousands of 
churches were destroyed or converted to other uses and are only now 
being returned to church authorities 
although the russian orthodox church continued to operate at 
severely reduced levels roman catholic clergy in lithuania 
czechoslovakia and elsewhere went underground to continue 
practicing their religion clandestinely 
the rev michael j lavelle president of john carroll 
university and a frequent traveler to czechoslovakia told the 
symposium that the underground church cut off from mainstream 
theology for 40 years has emerged from the communist period with 
outdated theology and a very avant garde religious practice 
masses have been said on dining room tables with the priest 
wearing no vestment the jesuit priest said lay people have 
been bringing the sacraments to other people in direct violation 
of canon law 
people did what they had to do he said but he added 
tensions are likely to arise now as those who preserved their 
religion in secret confront new ideas and the obligations imposed 
by the official church hierarchy 
lavelle acknowledged that most people in czechoslovakia have 
been baptized as christians but he called them de facto 
atheists 
they know little about the religion into which they were 
baptized he said the major task of the church now is to 
evangelize the vast majority of people who have not received any 
type of religious instruction since 1950

farmers complain about the rising cost of 
fertilizers and pesticides and say theyd like the government to 
do more research to reduce their need 
at the same time however theyre reluctant to give up the 
chemicals that have done so much to increase crop yields despite 
the warnings of longterm environmental damage 
enter john colburn of houston and his soil doctor 
colburns prescription application computerized equipment is 
being eyed by experts at the environmental protection agency as a 
good way to reduce ground water pollution caused by excessive 
fertilization 
the 1990 farm bill requires the agriculture department to teach 
farmers and agrichemical dealers how to use chemicals in prudent 
economical and environmentally sound ways 
dr lloyd murdock a soil specialist at the university of 
kentucky who works as an extension agent for usda said colburns 
instrument looked pretty good for conserving chemical 
fertilizers 
murdock conducted a oneyear test using the instrument on a 
farmers corn field near the university 
colburn president of crop technology inc said his idea 
originally was to save farmers money but his equipment addresses 
environmental issues too 
the machinery costs about 13000 but it can pay for itself in 
two years through the 20 to 25 an acre a farmer saves in 
fertilizers he said 
the problem has been with farmers who apply fertilizer in 
quantities large enough to account for runoff from heavy rains 
since not every part of a farmers land is equally productive the 
grower also usually measures his chemicals for the least productive 
areas without accounting for any residual nitrates still there from 
the last planting 
these practices can lead to a lot of unnecessary nitrates in the 
soil and eventually into groundwater 
the epa says 10 micrograms of nitrate per liter of water is 
considered the limit for the most vulnerable humans babies for 
example 
meanwhile some crops grow best with 22 to 24 micrograms of 
nitrates per liter 
colburns equipment which he calls the soil doctor uses two 
computers to regulate the amount of fertilizer applied it can be 
installed on the farmers existing equipment 
simply put a prober on the front of the tractor tests the soil 
as the farmer drives along telling a computer in the cab how much 
fertilizer to release out the back of the vehicle 
colburn said his system has been under development since 1984 
and tested extensively in the midwest about 40 have been sold for 
use this year he said 
its being used exclusively for corn at this time because corn 
is the highest nitrateconsuming crop colburn said 
farmers dont always like computers he said but this is 
fairly well appreciated once a farmer gets behind the wheel 
terry behymer of sterling ill said he has saved money and 
increased corn yield with the invention last year he won state 
honors for corn growing with 2095 bushels per acre and this year 
is doing even better with 2495 bushels an acre 
behymers 700acre farm grows corn wheat soybeans and alfalfa 
he said colburns equipment is suitable only for the corn but it 
has enabled him to measure the amount of nitrate appropriate for 
each area in his field 
he said the nitrates in the soil vary depending on which crop 
was grown last on the particular acreage 
behymer said he wanted something that would tell him how much 
nitrate already as in the soil before he applied more 
murdock said the nitrate level detected by the soil doctor 
compared favorably with more conventional testing he said he was 
optimistic about the equipments value to agriculture

president bushs most ambitious space proposal 
colonizing the moon and sending a manned expedition to mars are 
casualties to the deficitcutting bill approved by congress 
lawmakers were sympathetic to the goals in the 30year project 
as it eliminated the 37 million that the administration had asked 
for early studies 
it is implicit in the conduct of the nations civil space 
program that such human exploration of our solar system is 
inevitable the budget cutters said they added that 
consideration of the plan was deferred due to budget 
constraints 
in its budget bill congress also trimmed more than a 
halfbillion dollars from the space station program even as it 
increased the national aeronautics and space administrations total 
budget by 13 percent over last year 
instead of the 24 billion that bush sought the station 
program will get 19 billion 
overall the president had proposed spending 151 billion for 
nasa an increase of 24 percent over last year congress cut that 
amount to 138 billion still considerably more than the 122 
billion of 1990 
the legislators cautioned that nasa wont continue to get such 
increases in the future and ordered the agency to develop the 
station in useful phases or risk losing the 38 billion project 
altogether 
the committees on appropriations have warned since the outset 
of this program that future budget costraints would render it 
virtually impossible to design test and build the space station 
envisioned in 1984 said a report accompanying the budget bill 
the station was proposed by thenpresident reagan who estimated 
its cost to completion at 8 billion 
it is essential that the agency recognize that the budget 
crisis is only beginning the report said in the future it 
said nasa can expect annual spending growth of only 8 or 10 
percent and the amount spent on the space station should not rise 
above that 
nasa had envisioned using 30 or so shuttle flights to assemble 
the station in orbit beginning midway in the decade but congress 
said that is unrealistic given the low launch rate of recent years 
lawmakers also cut 210 million from research and technology 
leaving 285 million the same as last year it trimmed 24 million 
from the 119 million requested for the national aerospace plane 
the fourhourstotokyo craft promised by reagan and 40 million 
from science projects 
nasas request for 539 million to design the next generation 
of rockets was cut by 30 million congress earmarked 105 million 
of the remainder for shuttlec in which a cargo carrier would 
be launched in the same manner as the shuttle is now 
congress deleted all 15 million requested to build a huge water 
tank in which astronauts would practice assembling the space 
station and cut 125 million from the 44 billion requested for 
space shuttle operations 
an additional 25 million was cut from life sciences research 
but congress specifically set aside 121 million for the search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence nasa maintains huge listening 
posts to detect radio signals from outer space 
there was one significant addition congress tacked another 30 
million to the 294 million bush had requested for operating and 
upgrading the hubble space telescope 
the president had made his budget proposals early in the year 
before the telescope was launched since then however the 15 
billion instrument has proved to be fuzzyeyed due to a mistake in 
construction the new money will provide corrective lenses on a 
replacement instrument that will be attached to the telescope in 
1993 by astronauts

at a military camp in this mindanao 
island town defense secretary fidel ramos exhorted troops to 
defend the government against coups but troops had another 
question is he campaigning for president 
it is a question increasingly asked as the end of president 
corazon aquinos term in office june 1992 draws nearer 
regardless of whether he is seeking the office ramos has 
emerged in public opinion surveys as a leading choice to succeed 
mrs aquino whom he has kept in office through seven military 
uprisings in four years 
at this camp overlooking the pacific soldiers pulled aside 
reporters traveling with ramos to ask is he really running 
the 60yearold west point graduate avoids committing himself 
when asked about his possible presidential aspirations 
let me do my job as secretary of defense as long as i can 
until we have stability ramos told a local official in this 
seaside provincial capital 640 miles southeast of manila after 
that its up to the people 
but ramos almost weekly trips to military camps throughout this 
archipelago nation and meetings with local officials have been 
widely interpreted as subtle early campaigning 
unlike most of the nearly 10 political figures believed to have 
presidential ambitions ramos has no political party to back him 
but his position as defense chief enables him to travel nationwide 
using government resources and to gain access to the news media 
whenever he wants 
during his visits to the provinces ramos carefully avoids any 
criticism of the aquino administration which he served as military 
chief of staff before becoming defense secretary in january 1988 
but his declarations of support contain an equally subtle 
message that mrs aquino and by extension philippine democracy 
survive politically thanks to ramos 
i assure you that the president will be able to serve up to 
the last day of her term in june 1992 ramos told officials here 
i still come out with a record for the defense department she 
can be proud of 
ramos has carefully cultivated an image as the savior of 
democracy since he derailed an alleged coup plot by then defense 
secretary juan ponce enrile in november 1986 
critics in the military claim ramos son of a former foreign 
minister and cousin of the late president ferdinand marcos was 
part of the conspiracy to topple mrs aquino and then switched 
sides at the last minute 
ramos denies the charge 
it is unclear where ramos stands on a range of national issues 
apart from defense and security during provincial visits ramos a 
parachutist scuba diver and inveterate jogger projects an image 
of a vigorous leader in contrast to an incumbent president who is 
increasingly seen as passive and indecisive 
during a recent 36hour tour of five southern cities ramos 
attended nine public functions in three cities during the first 
day the last function ended at midnight 
five hours later ramos was jogging with troops at davaos camp 
catitipan later he visited two more provincial cities before 
returning to manila where he addressed a civic group in the 
evening 
ramos also promotes an image as a strong anticommunist and 
staunch opponent of those seen as sympathetic to the left 
sen wigberto tanada and all these leftists should see 
this ramos said as he left a wake in davao for two militiamen 
slain by communist rebels tanada is a prominent human rights 
lawyer 
in dumaguete local officials told ramos that a court there had 
recently handed down the first conviction of a major communist 
official on rebellion charges since mrs aquino took office 
thats very good ramos beamed whats the name of the 
judge 
during his stops ramos is warmly received by local officials 
many of whom rarely see national leaders 
when he arrived in dumaguete 400 miles southeast of manila 
ramos was welcomed by mayor agustin perdices and negros oriental 
gov emilio macias who wore tshirts saying negros is for 
ramos 
but local reporters said that the day before the same two 
officials were wearing tshirts supporting presidential aspirant 
eduardo cojuangco when his brother came to town

taxpayers will have to spend millions or 
even billions of dollars more on savings and loan bailouts 
because congress adjourned without providing more money for the 
cleanup analysts and officials say 
by the time legislators return in january the borrowing 
authority of the bailout agency the resolution trust corp could 
be exhausted even then approval of more money is far from 
certain 
congress refusal to act is going to cost us additional money 
were going to have to slow up the resolution of failed thrifts 
rtc chairman l william seidman said in a telephone interview 
monday 
but congress did triple the amount of money for justice 
department investigations and prosecutions of sampl fraud the crime 
bill passed last weekend included 160 million for justice 
department sampl investigations in this fiscal year more than three 
times the 50 million allocated last year 
the rtc already has postponed seeking acquirers for 18 large 
sampls said agency spokesman steven katsanos the agency has spent 
or committed to spend 43 billion of the 50 billion authorized in 
last years sampl bailout he said 
that means the 18 institutions and more than 300 other insolvent 
or nearinsolvent sampls likely will continue to run losses funding 
themselves with highinterest deposits 
that in turn weakens healthy competitors by forcing them to 
raise their deposit rates raising the specter of additional 
failures 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady had asked congress for 40 
billion more to cover losses through september 1991 a measure to 
provide 10 billion enough to cover sampl losses through february 
died in a procedural snarl early sunday morning 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said speaker thomas foley and other house leaders sought 
to avoid a roll call vote on the issue in the end because of 
house rules a single objection from rep frank annunzio dill 
was enough to block action 
seidman estimated the cost of a threemonth delay at 250 
million to 300 million the congressional budget office put it at 
300 million to 400 million while bert ely a private analyst in 
alexandria va estimated it at 2 billion to 25 billion 
the added cost although spread over the life of the bailout 
program will make it even harder for the government to meet the 
500 billion deficitreduction goal in the fiveyear program 
adopted over the weekend 
the sunday morning snafu left bush administration officials and 
democrats blaming each other for the expected consequences 
gonzalez said bradys refusal to testify in support of the 
administrations request created an unfortunate atmosphere for 
approval of more money 
but desiree tuckersorini deputy assistant secretary of the 
treasury said the need for action and the consequences for 
failing to act were spelled out in great detail over a period of 
months by the treasury secretary and others 
gonzalez pledged speedy action by his committee when congress 
returns 
the amount of money available for sampl fraud investigations has 
been the subject of bitter partisan wrangling 
congress authorized 75 million last fiscal year but only 
appropriated 50 million when the bush administration turned down 
an extra 25 million 
since 1988 federal prosecutors have obtained 338 convictions in 
major sampl fraud cases attorney general dick thornburgh has 
predicted it could take another five years to clean up the growing 
caseload of fraud left in the wake of the widespread collapse of 
sampls 
the crime bill approved by congress contains a number of 
provisions to help sampl prosecutors 
one would offer rewards of up to 50000 for information leading 
to the prosecution of sampl fraud whistleblowers also would shre in 
a percentage of any embezzled sampl money that was recovered as a 
result of information they provided to help trade the funds 
the crime bill also authorizes courtapproved wiretaps of 
suspected sampl crooks and expands the number of crimes for which the 
justice department can seek forfeiture of assets in civil actions

states should have a national education 
index to measure student achievement and pinpoint failing schools 
or ineffective local leaders a top educator says 
with a benchmark to measure education progress states would 
have license to place failing schools on probation remove 
principals or school boards or even close ineffective schools 
ernest boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said monday 
local school control is crucial but its insufficient in the 
end students must be served and if a school for whatever reason 
does not provide an effective education state officials have both 
a legal and moral obligation to intervene boyer told a fortune 
magazine seminar of about 300 businessmen government leaders and 
educators 
as an extension of the education index idea william jerry 
hume head of american foods inc of san francisco suggested 
creating an employability skills scale for potential employees 
this matrix would define the job applicants academic skill 
level on a onetofive scale for reading computation writing 
problemsolving and critical reasoning and scientific reasoning 
hme said 
such a scale would define the individuals skill level on a 
basic intermediate and advanced level for organizational 
effectiveness and leadership social and teamwork skills 
motivation and selfdevelopment listening and oral communication 
and learning skills he said 
as a businessman i would like to have standards for the 
united states which define educational outcomes for this country 
that are superior to outcomes attained by students in countries 
with which we compete said hume 
as a businessman i would like to have a student transcript 
that shows a students accomplishments vs national standards 
boyer insisted the nation is more than ready for a national 
policy in education after years of vigorously defending local 
school control the nation is now supporting indeed almost 
demanding national leadership in education while still 
maintaining vitality at the local level 
its time to go beyond goals important as they are and 
begin to talk more precisely about education standards and how 
progress toward national objectives can be measured 
state must have clearly defined goals an assessment procedure 
requiring annual progress reports from schools and clearly defined 
methods of intervention in case a school is failing boyer said 
besides accountability and intervention the foundation 
president said the index also should include 
school completion rates of students in every state this 
category would include a look at each students proficiency in 
english and mathematics performance on general knowledge tests and 
whether a state gives priority to writing 
the condition of teaching states would be judged on whether 
they have a plan for attracting outstanding students into teaching 
special strategies to attract teachers in math and science and 
requirements for training that include sabbaticals fellowships and 
teacher institutes teacher salaries also would be considered 
the schools climate as it relates to the quality of buildings 
classrooms and laboratories as well as class size 
financial support of schools states perstudent expenditures 
and other costs would be compared regionally so that costofliving 
can be considered equity in school finance would be a key 
consideration 
how schools are governed states must have clearly defined 
goals as well as intervention methods in case of a failing school

thousands of homeless and hungry americans 
are getting their daily meals from restaurants and caterers instead 
of trash cans 
at least 40 cities across the nation have launched programs to 
put leftovers to use according to share our strength a washington 
group that is waging a campaign to fight food waste 
prepared food left at the end of the day at deli counters 
banquets restaurants and executive dining rooms is picked up and 
distributed to shelters and soup kitchens 
whats the point of throwing away all this wonderful food when 
you could feed it to hunger relief agencies in your city asked 
jennifer hadley coordinator of the campaign these people are 
hungry and its better to get food served from a catering company 
than to pick it out of a trash can 
the beauty of it is our country is concentrating a lot on 
environmental issues and recycling and this applies to food as 
well 
the programs must adhere to strict health guidelines no table 
scraps are allowed nor foods that are good candidates for 
contamination such as mayonnaise or seafoodbased salads 
if i couldnt take it out of my refrigerator at home and feed 
it to my granddaughter im not going to give it to somebody 
else said jo anna l debolt who runs the richmond program that 
was modeled on programs in norfolk and atlanta 
and if im not sure the agency is going to serve it in a 
timely manner or have it refrigerated correctly or frozen 
correctly then im not going to be able to give it to them 
caterers and some of the larger hotels with convention center 
business had so much in leftovers that they were embarrassed said 
rob johnson project director of the atlanta community food bank 
program 
we have about 150 donors of food that include restaurants 
caterers hotels corporate cafeterias schools and hospitals 
said johnson whose atlantas table was launched in 1987 we are 
now averaging about 30000 pounds of food each month 
during its first month of operation in september the central 
virginia food bank distributed more than 7000 pounds of food or 
about 7000 meals to nine organizations through virginias table 
most of that came from the deli counters at 20 richmondarea 
grocery stores ms debolt said cooked chicken breasts rolls of 
salami bologna fettucine and crepes have been donated she said 
for restaurateurs and caterers afraid of being sued if someone 
gets sick ms hadley said all 50 states have adopted good 
samaritan laws that offer varying degrees of protection to those 
who donate food in good faith 
not once in the 10 years since the laws have been implemented 
has there been one suit it has a great track record she said 
while virginias table picks up and delivers donated food the 
dc central kitchen in washington goes a step further people are 
trained in the art of cooking they prepare meals from leftover 
food 
instead of being a crutch it ends up being a bridge for them 
from one part of the community into another one ms debolt said

the senate is begrudgingly allowing gen 
michael dugan relieved as air force chief of staff for his public 
comments on the persian gulf to delay his retirement until jan 1 
and boost his pension by more than 17000 a year 
over the weekend the senate armed services committee and the 
full senate approved president bushs nomination of dugan to retire 
in the grade of full general 
however in a report accompanying the panels recommendation and 
released monday the committee questioned the extraordinary 
treatment of dugan 
defense secretary dick cheney fired dugan 53 as the air 
forces top officer on sept 17 after dugan told reporters about 
contingency plans to unleash massive air raids on iraq and target 
saddam hussein personally 
under current law dugan would have been demoted two pay grades 
to major general 90 days after his firing and would have been 
retired on dec 17 with benefits based on the lower rank however 
bush nominated him to retire at fourstar rank on jan 1 
the primary reason for allowing gen dugan to retire on jan 
1 1991 is to permit him to take advantage of the increase in the 
basic pay for the grade of general upon which his retired pay would 
be calculated the committee said 
a fourstar generals basic annual pay goes from 78199 to 
97814 on jan 1 and retirement as a full general on that day 
will mean an increase in dugans pension of 17625 over what he 
would have received in retirement in 1990 as a major general 
earlier when dugans firing was announced pentagon officials 
estimated his pension at 60000 in the fourstar rank if he 
retired then 
although the committee acknowledged dugans 32 years of 
distinguished services it strongly disagreed with cheneys 
decision to keep dugan on active duty beyond the 90 days 
dugan remains at the pentagon as a special assistant to air 
force secretary donald rice he is overseeing studies on the future 
needs for pilots and navigators as well as the officer evaluation 
system 
the committee is concerned not only about the circumvention of 
the generous 90day transition period but the effect that such a 
favored decision for one senior officer could have on the 
perception of all other military personnel of the fairness and 
integrity of the personnel system the senate panel said 
some other generals are being retired before jan 1 and are not 
eligible for the higher retired pay the committee said

a congessional staff report conducted for sen 
jesse helms questions the governments longheld contention that no 
americans who fought in the vietnam war are still being held 
captive in southeast asia 
the interim report released monday contends that the pentagon 
adopted its position about missing americans and then discredited 
evidence to the contrary 
information uncovered during this inquiry provides enough 
corroboration to cast doubt upon the veracity of the us 
governments conclusion said the report by the republican staff 
of the senate foreign relations committee 
the government has contended there is no evidence that american 
prisoners are still alive in southeast asia or that any were left 
behind alive after us prisoners returned in 1973 
but the staff said classified declassified and unclassified 
information all confirm one startling fact that the defense 
department in april 1974 concluded beyond a doubt that several 
hundred living american pows remained in captivity in southeast 
asia 
the information also does not rule out the likelihood that 
americans are still being held the report said 
a pentagon spokesman lt cmdr ken satterfield said the 
department had not received the new report and had no comment 
the report said defense intelligence discredited often in 
error livesighting reports about us personnel from hundreds of 
thousands of refugees fleeing vietnam cambodia and laos during the 
1970s and 1980s 
it also contended that some witnesses may have been intimidated 
and that information was dismissed on technicalities 
since the fall of saigon in 1975 the defense intelligence 
agency has received nearly 12000 reports on missing americans 
most of them from indochinese refugees none has panned out thus 
far the pentagon has said 
the report disagrees with the findings of a house select 
committee which concluded a year after the war ended that there 
were no pows being held however that panel said a small number of 
deserters or civilians might have voluntarily stayed behind 
sen jesse helms rnc ranking gop member on the foreign 
relations committee and a critic of the improving relations between 
the united states and vietnam asked the panels minority staff to 
conduct the study 
the government considers 2103 personnel missing since us 
forces withdrew from southeast asia nearly 20 years ago more than 
55000 americans died in the war 
the number of military personnel missing in action could be 
higher because the defense departments files on various covert 
actions during the war have not been opened and those who took part 
were never identified the report said 
the release of the report comes nearly two weeks after vietnam 
promised to increase cooperation with the united states on an 
accounting of american servicemen still missing 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach who met with 
president bushs special envoy for the mia issue said both sides 
agreed to accelerate their efforts to locate missing americans 
in a letter accompanying the report helms said thachs visit 
was inappropriate at a time when the administration was unwilling 
to address the issue of living americans being held captive in 
southeast asia

a woman blasted republican gubernatorial 
candidate clayton williams after being sexually assaulted by a man 
who repeated williams joke about rape 
chris ausland had quoted clayton williams during the attack 
telling me that if it was inevitable i should just relax and enjoy 
it the 31yearold woman said monday of the march assault 
williams made the rape remark during a cattle roundup at his 
ranch when he likened bad weather to rape he later apologized for 
the comment 
ausland 34 was sentenced monday in state district court to 50 
years in prison in a plea bargain agreement on several charges 
the woman trembling as she spoke talked with reporters on the 
condition her identity not be revealed 
any candidate who jokes about rape shows a gross insensitivity 
towards women and is not likely to take a stand in promoting 
victims rights she said 
speaking from personal experience rape is anything but a joke 
and at no point mr williams was i able to relax and enjoy it 
she added 
she said she did not blame williams for the attack but said i 
just blame clayton williams for voicing the attitude that is 
outdated and is wrong and is hurtful 
gordon hensley a spokesman for the williams campaign said 
williams had apologized for the remark and that the republicans 
anticrime proposals are stronger than those of his democratic 
opponent ann richards

president bush unveiling a harsh partisan 
political attack a week before the election says he will travel 
the country telling voters to blame democrats for the nations 
troubles 
with the republican party stumbling toward election day and his 
own public approval ratings in a nosedive bush on monday launched 
an allout attack on democrats in congress 
the democrats he said were interested in only two things 
taxing and spending 
in a speech heavily geared toward repairing the damage the gop 
has suffered because of public discontent with the budget quagmire 
and the weakening economy bush said he had to pay ransom to 
the democraticrun congress in the form of higher taxes in order to 
get spending cuts 
we stopped them cold from passing even higher taxes he 
claimed 
trying out his new speech at an oklahoma city fundraiser for 
gubernatorial candidate bill price bush called for election of 
more republicans 
the president suffered many defections by house and senate 
republicans who voted against his position in the recent budget 
battle and criticized him for abandoning his no new taxes 
pledge 
the problem is this democratic congress that protects its 
perks and privileges and turns its back on the american dream 
bush said 
he was to make a similar address today in washington to a 
partisan crowd gathered by the republican national committee and 
take a crosscountry political swing later in the week 
the president blamed the democrats for everything from being 
soft on crime to playing class warfare with the budget 
negotiations to passing feelgood proclamations instead of 
addressing real problems 
america doesnt need a liberal house of lords america needs a 
responsible congress america needs a republican congress he 
said 
the democrats who unsuccessfully tried to pass a stiff surtax 
on millionaires have seized on the budget turmoil to paint 
republicans as defenders of the rich 
im used to that kind of demagoguery and so im out here now 
on the campaign trail laying it to rest bush said ive got to 
get that in focus because theyve been getting away with this 
taxtherich class warfare kind of garbage that they always 
resurrect at election time 
im taking that message all across this country we are 
for the working people of this country he said 
continuing to try and distance himself from the taxraising 
portion of the new budget package that he has promised to sign 
bush said 
i cannot join the liberal democrats in an orgy of 
selfcongratulation 
i think people know that this congress is controlled by the 
taxers by the liberal democrats 
he said republicans saved americans from a democratic plot to 
raise taxes on working people in the guise of soaking the rich 
in the budget negotiations bush ultimately agreed to raise the 
tax rate on the highest income brackets to 31 percent from 28 
percent now the package also diminishes the ability of highincome 
taxpayers to take itemized deductions 
bush earlier monday claimed to take no notice of public opinion 
polls saying he has slid to a 48 percent approval rating 
he said at the oklahoma event that he had tried his best to work 
with congress and do the job people elected him to do 
ive tried very hard only to have a parade of liberal 
democrats march to the microphone in the house of representatives 
to blame me for their failure he contended 
in a homestretch effort to swing votes for republicans bush 
leaves thursday for massachusetts florida and ohio 
he then travels to minnesota iowa california and texas before 
returning to washington on tuesday election day

the prospects of legal citizenship for 
thousands of illegal irish immigrants are about to improve 
immigration reform legislation awaiting president bushs 
signature will provide thousands of extra residency visas to 
ireland an estimated 100000 irish immigrants live illegally in 
the united states and tens of thousands more are hoping to leave 
their economically strapped country 
its just a fact of life that a lot of young and skilled 
people are going to leave ireland anyway sean minihane a 
lobbyist for the irish immigration reform movement said monday 
why not from the standpoint of the us shouldnt they be 
allowed to come in 
the visas would be available to those living in ireland or 
illegal aliens living in the united states 
the change in us policy toward irish immigration is contained 
in the first comprehensive immigration reform bill in 25 years the 
bill passed by congress this weekend would substantially boost 
the number of immigrants allowed into the united states each year 
especially those with job skills 
bush supports the legislation white house spokeswoman alixe 
glen said the bill could be signed into law as early as this week 
for the irish the bill could provide more than 80000 permanent 
residency visas by the turn of the century thats roughly double 
the number of irish visas granted throughout the 1980s 
existing immigration law has cut off the supply of visas granted 
to ireland at well below the actual demand the current formulas 
favor visa applicants who have recentimmigrant relatives already 
living in the united states countries such as cambodia vietnam 
and mexico 
irish illegal aliens are concentrated in the boston and new york 
metropolitan areas other pockets of irish residents include 
chicago hartford conn philadelphia and san francisco 
irish advocates celebrating passage of the immigration bill told 
of the hardships brought on by illegal status immigrants unable 
attend a family funeral in ireland for fear they would be forced to 
stay skilled professionals forced to tend bar because they could 
not enter the job market tenants unable to challenge a rent 
increase because the landlord threatened to turn them in 
in ireland the education system is turning out skilled 
graduates to an economy with 17 percent unemployment 
by most economic forecasts we will be stuck with the problem 
of emigration until the next decade said an irish embassy 
official who asked not to be identified we are providing new 
jobs but not at a fast enough rate the official said the irish 
government is delighted with the bill 
for the next three years ireland would be the only country with 
a guaranteed number of visas 16000 per year for a total of 
48000 
starting in 1995 up to 7700 irish would receive visas annually 
under a diversity provision of the bill designed to offset the 
unfairness of past immigration formulas in addition irish could 
apply under the traditional categories of family ties and 
employment the maximum allowable total for any country is 20000 
those numbers compare to the roughly 3000 to 5000 irish visas 
issued per year in the early 1980s for the past five years the 
number has averaged 5000 to 7500

in a commitment to curb global warming the 
12nation european community has pledged to limit its output of 
carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2000 to the 1990 level 
the move monday by ec ministers was seen as an attempt to 
pressure the united states into a adopting a similar pledge at a 
major international conference on the issue 
next week negotiations open in geneva on a convention aimed at 
curbing the release of carbon dioxide and other manmade gases that 
are causing a gradual increase in global temperature with 
potentially catastrophic environmental implications 
plans call for the drafting of a convention that would to be 
ready for signing in 1992 
the united states has yet to issue a proposal on how it plans 
curb its carbon dioxide emissions produced largely through the 
burning of fossil fuels 
a divided european community would have been an excuse for the 
americans not to proceed any further said a european community 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
scientists believe that if nothing is done to curb them 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heattrapping gases could 
boost global temperatures 54 degrees by the end of the next 
century the fastest rise in 10000 years 
they call the phenomenon the greenhouse effect and say that if 
unchecked it could cause sea levels to rise and deserts to spread 
about 500 scientists convened in geneva on monday for a 10day 
un conference on global warming 
a conferenceending meeting of about 80 ministers is expected to 
draw several heads of government including british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and french premier michel rocard 
the united states has sent a lowerlevel delegation 
the ecs position to maintain its overall output of carbon 
dioxide at 1990 levels in 2000 matches a pledge by japan 
in the european community these emissions come largely from 
coalfired power plants and traffic and grow at a rate of between 2 
percent and 4 percent a year officials said the 1990 level is 
almost 3 billion tons 
the ec executive commission will work out quotas for each member 
nations by the end of this year the communitys richest members 
such as belgium luxembourg the netherlands germany france and 
denmark will have to compensate for those members less able to do 
so officials said 
the latter include britain which has a disproportionately large 
number of coalfired power plants and the communitys poorer 
southern nations 
the ec states agreed on a general commitment to save energy 
promote public transportation and encourage use of alternative 
energy sources

a federal law going into effect next month 
clamps new controls on companies that sometimes charge telephone 
users at airports hotels and other public places two or three 
times what they normally pay for longdistance calls 
as of nov 17 the socalled alternative operator service 
companies will be required to clearly identify themselves during 
calls provide rates and billing procedures on demand stop 
charging for unanswered calls and allow some access to the 
interstate longdistance company that callers wish to use 
the federal communications commission which already had 
instituted many of these rules but had found widespread lack of 
compliance also will be required to begin monitoring the rates 
these companies charge if the commission finds the rates unjust 
it could order them rolled back 
the fcc also is empowered to establish rates for the entire 
industry in about two years 
the operator service companies handle dialo calls such as 
collect persontoperson and charge card calls made by the 
traveling public 
these companies contract with the owners of phones at hotels 
universities airports hospitals and other public places to handle 
their longdistance service and then lease lines on carriers such 
as atampt mci and us sprint 
callers often are unaware when they dial a phone away from home 
that theyre using one of the operator companies many callers have 
complained of excessive charges and billings from cities theyve 
never visited 
the fcc says it receives more complaints about operator services 
companies than any other telephone issue about 150 a month

iraqi president saddam hussein says his talks 
with a soviet envoy were useful but that the results will not 
necessarily become known publicly 
in an interview with cable news network correspondents in 
baghdad aired monday night saddam also reiterated his 
determination to maintain control of kuwait 
meetings are always useful saddam said of his discussions 
with yevgeny m primakov middle east adviser to soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
primakov has been reported as saying his discussions with saddam 
produced little movement but gorbachev has said there were signs 
of flexibility on saddams part 
saddam called his discussions with primakov wideranging and 
very useful but said the first statements would have to come 
from primakov 
not everything that was agreed will come out in the open 
saddam said 
as he has in the past saddam said his troops have no intention 
of leaving kuwait which they occupied on aug 2 and any fighting 
he said would be the result of what he called aggression by the 
united states britain or israel 
saddam also insisted again that the arab nations problems be 
resolved as a whole not piecemeal and linked resolution of the 
palestinian issue to the kuwait crisis 
the iraqi leader said he hoped war would not break out and if 
the americans were to opt away from war then they will establish a 
strong position for itself and humanity 
but he said iraq and iran were the only armies with wide 
experience in fighting wars in the persian gulf region 
saddam appeared relaxed and smiled on occasion during the cnn 
interview he wore a civilian coat and tie at one point he was 
asked if he would enjoy fishing with president bush a sport both 
men are fond of 
i have no objection to looking into this proposition saddam 
said but he said he would like a meeting with bush only if it 
meant a substantive discussion

the food and drug administration wants to ban 
the use of 111 ingredients in nonprescription diet drug products 
including one it says presents a safety hazard 
that ingredient is guar gum which is extracted from plant 
matter three months ago fda told the distributor of one brand of 
diet tablet cal ban 3000 that contains guar gum to stop 
distributing the tablets because it had received 17 reports of 
users suffering from obstruction of the esophagus 
aside from those tablets the agency did not give brand names of 
products affected 
the action does not affect guar gum use in small amounts in 
foods where it poses no health hazard foods such as cheese salad 
dressings and ice cream the agency said 
the agency said the 111 ingredients had not been proven 
effective in diet products the ban includes alcohol corn syrup 
dextrose kelp pineapple enzymes rice polishings saccharin 
salt sodium bicarbonate vitamin c and wheat germ 
fda said it had given manufacturers opportunities to prove the 
ingredients were effective but that it had received no significant 
information 
the proposed ban is being published in todays federal register 
along with another proposed ruling tht calls for a warning on 
general overthecounter drugs containing water soluble gums like 
guar gum 
products containing such substances including guar gum 
psyllium and the like would have to carry labels warning users to 
take them with adequate fluid and to avoid them if the user had 
ever had difficulty swallowing

the national endowment for the arts has 
quietly dropped a controversial requirement that grant recipients 
sign a nonobscenity pledge now that congress has voted to scrap 
explicit restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal 
subsidies 
the pledge instituted by endowment chairman john e frohnmayer 
late last year has spawned three federal lawsuits charging that it 
violated the constitutions freespeech guarantees 
at last count 16 artists and arts institutions refused to sign 
the pledge and forfeited more than 318000 in endowment grants 
last year 
the endowment made no formal announcement of mondays action 
but agency officials confirmed that the pledge had been withdrawn 
and would not be required as a condition of receiving grants for 
the 1991 fiscal year which began oct 1 
shortly before it adjourned last weekend congress junked the 
obscenity ban it imposed on the arts endowment a year ago and voted 
instead to leave judgments of obscenity to the courts 
the proposed new law awaiting president bushs signature would 
require the endowment to recoup its grant money from any recipient 
who is later convicted of violating obscenity laws 
the bill omits any explicit obscenity restrictions saying only 
that obscenity lacks artistic merit is not protected speech under 
the constitution and shall not be funded by the endowment

the eighth game of the world chess championship 
was adjourned until tonight with experts saying a series of 
seemingly bad moves by titleholder garry kasparov had given anatoly 
karpov the edge 
play resumes at 530 pm when kasparovs 41st move is to be 
unsealed 
the players are tied 33 in points a player gets one point 
for a victory a half point for a tie the first player to reach 
12 points wins the championship each player has won one game the 
other games ended in draws 
kasparov appeared to have the advantage most of the time monday 
but experts said he left karpov in a better position by the time 
the game was adjourned 
everyone was shocked and staring in complete amazement 
international master alex fishbein said of the turnaround karpov 
was brilliant in defense extraordinary his tactics were very 
strong in time pressure and his nerves were very good this is a 
devastating blow to kasparov 
others said kasparov could still salvage a draw 
karpov was under severe time pressure after 27 moves he had 
only five minutes left for his next 13 moves while kasparov had 33 
minutes to go each player is allotted 2 hours to make his first 
40 moves 
its unbelievable how bad kasparov played in the time scramble 
and how well karpov played said grandmaster michael wilder at 
one point it looked as though he kasparov was making completely 
random moves 
the first 12 games are being played in new york and the 
remainder will be played in lyon france 
the winner will get 17 million the loser 13 million

there are big tippers and then there 
are those who leave 25000 even though they might not know it 
just ask keith thomlinson a bartender at the greenhouse inn and 
restaurant in middletown he found an instant lottery ticket among 
his tips last week when he scratched off the numbers he had won 
25000 
it sat there for almost two days until i scrubbed it off 
thomlinson 42 said monday i was just shocked 
the ticket came from russell clark of newport a regular at the 
greenhouse who often leaves an instant lottery ticket with a dollar 
or two as a tip at area restaurants and bars he said he often 
leaves candy or flowers too 
its just something i do he said 
thomlinson gave 1800 to clark and 5000 to his mother and 
father 
shes going to pay bills thomlinson said dads retired 
they dont have a real big pension 
clark 60 a lab technician in newport said he probably would 
use his 1800 to buy more lottery tickets for his friends in the 
restaurants 
he has an informal agreement with the waiters and bartenders 
that if they win more than 600 he gets a cut clark said that in 
the 10 years he had been handing out tickets a waitress once won

despite their distaste for arne carlson 
members of minnesotas conservative republican party say they may 
have no choice but to back him as their replacement nominee for 
governor this close to the election 
carlson the state auditor is considered too liberal by some 
republicans to replace jon grunseth who dropped out sunday after 
being accused of philandering and swimming nude with teenage 
girls grunseth denied the allegations 
carlson a republican who favors abortion rights had jumped 
into the race last week as a writein candidate as pressure mounted 
on grunseth to step down 
carlson said he is confident party leaders will conclude that he 
should be on the ballot to face democratic gov rudy perpich on 
nov 6 
the partys 14member executive committee meets tonight to 
discuss whether it even has the authority to name a successor to 
grunseth 
todays star tribune reported eight members of the executive 
committee said they either will support carlson or are leaning that 
way 
others said having carlson as the partys choice is inevitable 
i think we do have to be realistic and realize that its too 
late to force another candidate on the ballot said evie axdahl 
a committee member i feel thats the only choice at this point 
and i think thats unfortunate 
secretary of state joan growe said if the party does not reach a 
decision the law calls for the runnerup in the primary carlson 
to go on the ballot 
state gop chairwoman barb sykora said she has concluded that 
the only sensible option is the option that looks like we are 
legally bound to support arne carlson to the best of our ability 
and beat rudy perpich 
growe the states chief election office said republicans have 
until 5 pm friday to get a new candidate on the ballot 
but she urged gop leaders to decide as quickly as possible to 
allow more time to print an estimated 2 million ballots 
another complication involved grunseths running mate who did 
not file papers withdrawing from the race for lieutenant governor 
as far as were concerned she is the republican candidate for 
lieutenant governor said elam baer executive director of the 
grunseth campaign 
but growe said her office has concluded clark no longer is a 
candidate because of grunseths withdrawal 
since state law requires you to be a team there no longer is 
a team she said

soviet cosmonauts working in open space for 
nearly four hours failed today in an attempt to repair a 
malfunctioning hatch aboard the mir space station the official 
tass news agency said 
cosmonauts gennady manakov and gennady strekalov who have been 
in space for nearly three months left the spacecraft at 45 minutes 
past midnight to work on the door which failed to close properly 
during a spacewalk in july 
they did not manage to correct the hatch malfunction tass 
said 
the malfunctioning hatch is on kvant2 a module containing 
photographic and technical equipment attached to the mir space 
station 
during a spacewalk in july mirs previous tenants anatoly 
solovyov and alexander balandin apparently were unable to close 
the hatch after they entered the airlock and had to enter the 
spacecraft through another port officials said at the time 
they were reported by soviet to have come dangerously close to 
running out of oxygen 
tass said that todays malfunction presented no danger to 
manakov and strekalov 
this was just ordinary maintainance work in space not some 
extraordinary situation tass quoted mission control specialists 
as saying 
todays spacewalk had originally been scheduled for oct 19 but 
was postponed after strekalov caught a cold while working out on an 
onboard running track 
the soviet unions manned space program which for decades has 
been a source of national pride has been plagued in the past two 
years by docking equipment failures mistakes by cosmonauts and 
budget cuts

the dollar was firmer at higher levels in calm 
european trading today after a longawaited move by the us 
federal reserve to ease interest rates 
traders said the onequarter percentage point easing in the 
federal funds rate was a relief to the market 
the dollar is still in a downtrend but it is retracing its 
steps one trader in milan said 
gold prices were mixed 
david deitch senior dealer at nomura bank international in 
london said the dollars rise was triggered by a combination of 
factors increasing tension in the persian gulf helped the dollar 
as did hints by us treasury secretary nicholas brady that third 
quarter gross national product gnp data to be released today will 
show faster than expected growth 
but deitch added underlying economic concerns havent faded 
and the market will continue to take any rallies by the dollar as 
just another opportunity to sell 
there has been some temporary demand for the dollar but it is 
much less likely that the dollar will hold these levels for long 
he said 
market attention was likely to focus on the release of the new 
gnp data brady hinted that it could be as high as 24 percent 
rather than the expected 1 percent 
but dealers warned that if the number proves closer to market 
forecasts the dollar could fall heavily 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 12900 yen up 165 yen from

chinese premier li peng has announced a special 
national conference to plan economic strategy newspapers said 
today in another sign top communist officials are unable to reach 
agreement among themselves 
the official china daily quoted li as saying a longawaited 
meeting of the communist partys central committee will be held 
only after the national planning conference he said both meetings 
will be held before years end 
the 195member central committee which sets policy was to have 
met shortly after the asian games ended in beijing on oct 7 to 
approve the economys next fiveyear plan the current plan ends in 
december 
foreign diplomats say the meeting has not convened because 
divisions are so great that no draft plan is sure of winning 
approval 
conservatives are said to be pressing for continued strong 
central controls while opponents argue that the economy is healthy 
enough to resume a marketoriented reform program put on hold two 
years ago 
the debate goes deeper than economic issues because the 
participants stances reflect conflicting ideological convictions 
and visions of how china will enter the 21st century 
for example the leading figure among the central planners 
85yearold chen yun regards reform as an effort to improve 
efficiency with the economy remaining largely stateowned and 
directed 
many younger economists however say state ownership is the 
problem and that reforms should lead to privatization 
the lowerlevel planning conference may be an attempt to work 
out a compromise li said only that it would plan next years 
economic program 
the china daily quoted him as saying that quite a lot of time 
for preparation and discussion is needed before the central 
committee meeting can be held he predicted that no major changes 
would be made in chinas development program not just during the 
next five years but the entire decade 
the newspaper said li made the comments monday when meeting with 
a group of foreign ambassadors he may have been seeking to dispel 
the impression that the leadership has been paralyzed over the 
issue 
li did not say who would attend the conference but the session 
was likely to include provincial and major city leaders as well as 
central government officials a similar meeting was held in 
september but mainly highlighted differences of opinion without 
reaching any solutions according to foreign diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in a separate report the china daily quoted a senior official 
from the peoples construction bank of china as saying the 
2yearold policy of strictly controlling loans will continue next 
year ruling out a return to fast growth 
some of the strongest pressure to resume free market reforms 
comes from provincial authorities during the mid1980s under lis 
predecessor premier zhao ziyang provinces were given substantial 
power to retain profits from local industries and approve imports 
exports and loans 
the central government lost revenue but remained responsible for 
major infrastructure investment and price subsidies resulting in 
annual state deficits shortly after becoming premier in 1988 li 
began a strict austerity program that has cut state spending and 
partially reined in the provinces 
reforms have been under an ideological cloud since june 1989 
when the conservatives crushed a massive popular movement for 
democratic change 
nonetheless debate recently has resumed on steps such as 
privatizing housing selling stock in state companies and reducing 
state price subsidies 
vice premier tian jiyun announced saturday that grain prices 
will be adjusted over the next five years to reduce subsidies the 
state buys grain from farmers and sells it to urban residents at a 
loss

the owner of a car wash says a 35ton 
boulder sitting on his property is bad for business and wants the 
city to pay more than 3000 in rent for the space the unwanted 
rock takes up 
the city put the boulder on the car wash site during street 
improvements pioneer carwash owner malcolm macintosh said the 
rock was there when he bought the business 
macintosh said he began asking the city to get rid of the rock 
soon after he took over the business about two years ago he 
offered it as a gift for use as a landscaping ornament in a park 
but the city didnt budge on the offer 
all i ever wanted them to do is move it so i can use the 
land macintosh said its costing me money because if i have a 
car here washing and a car here vacuuming no one can get around 
his lawsuit in small claims court seeks two years rent at 120 
a month plus interest for payments he says are overdue for a total 
of 308522 
city manager ce swackhammer said he is researching macintoshs 
claim but hasnt found any documents on the rock in city files he 
said he also is trying to find past owners of the car wash 
macintosh said he began billing the city for back rent in june 
he said he arrived at the amount by comparing rates at local 
storage yards for an item of that size he added a bit for the 
inconvenience to his business

the republican candidate for arkansas 
attorney general says all campaign mudslinging isnt protected by 
the constitution 
asa hutchinson of fort smith filed a defamation lawsuit against 
his democratic rival lt gov winston bryant on monday claiming 
some television ads and public statements misrepresent the facts 
the ads claim hutchinson received illegal campaign contributions 
in a failed 1986 run for the us senate hutchinsons lawsuit 
said it also said bryant accused hutchinson of engaging in 
criminal conduct during a speech 
bryant of malvern scoffed at the suit calling it a desperate 
move by a floundering campaign 
this is really nothing more than a lastditch desperate 
attempt by my opponent bryant said hes falling in the polls 
his campaign is falling apart 
bryant said his public statements and campaign advertisements 
are supported by documentation 
although this lawsuit is unusual in a political campaign the 
attack ads of mr bryant go beyond routine campaign rhetoric 
hutchinson said this lawsuit is important to reverse the trend 
toward mudslinging campaigns that are based upon distortion and 
outright lies 
the suit seeking unspecified damages claims that bryants 
television advertisements used deliberate or reckless falsehoods as 
a political tool according to the suit bryant approved the ads 
with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the alleged false 
statements 
the ads accuse hutchinson of accepting illegal campaign 
contributions from the national republican senatorial committee 
during his unsuccessful 1986 campaign the suit said 
hutchinson said the suit is bolstered by a 1989 us supreme 
court decision in a libel trial filed by an ohio judicial candidate 
against a newspaper in the case hartehanks inc vs connaughton 
the high court upheld a 200000 award against the newspaper 
ruling that speech used for political ends does not automatically 
bring it under the protection mantle of the constitution

the city imposed a curfew and organized patrols 
by residents toting fire extinguishers while free cable tv was 
offered to keep firebugs home tonight during devils night 
detroits prehalloween arson spree 
the measures are part of an effort by detroit to remake its 
lawless image and end the annual outbreak of fires that has become 
a national embarrassment 
devils night is actually three nights of vandalism beginning 
two nights before halloween and peaking one night before 
mayor coleman a young last week unveiled a my heart is with 
detroit campaign urging residents to take pride in their city 
and step up antiarson patrols 
more than 35000 residents and city workers have volunteered to 
keep an eye out for arsonists young said rewards of up to 1500 
have been offered for information leading to the conviction of 
arsonists 
volunteers wearing redandwhite my heart is with detroit 
tshirts and caps began walking the streets monday night some 
carrying fire extinguishers to put out small blazes 
until the 1970s devils night featured typical halloween tricks 
such as egg tossing covering homes and yards with toilet paper and 
burning piles of leaves 
then came larger fires set in garages trash bins or abandoned 
homes bringing flames that sometimes spread to occupied houses 
the worst devils night came in 1984 when 810 fires were set 
during the threeday period last year there were 223 fires 
between oct 29 and oct 31 115 of them on the night before 
halloween 
the annual rampage has left families homeless and gutted dozens 
of buildings bringing bad publicity for detroit 
rowena williams 64 a retired chrysler corp worker who posted 
a my heart is with detroit sign in her front yard said she 
dreads the halloween season 
i dont even put on the lights youre too scared williams 
said as she stood behind security bars at her front door i dont 
open my door for trickortreaters i wish i could but its too 
dangerous 
the southeast michigan cable association this year decided to 
unscramble tv signals including movie services such as hbo and 
showtime in hopes of keeping arsonists indoors 
as in the past two years young imposed a 6 pmto6 am 
curfew for people 18 and under from monday through thursday police 
arrested 379 curfew violators last year by early today more than 
113 had been arrested police said 
its really going to be up to the discretion of the officer 
police spokesman officer thomas martinelli said if a kid is 
stopped on his bike about a mile away from home and he is going 
away from his house he could be arrested 
zeev chafets a 43yearold writer born in pontiac who moved to 
israel at age 20 is in town to drum up sales for his book 
devils night and other true tales of detroit 
in the book which has been blasted by young and other 
officials chafets refers to detroit as americas first third 
world city 
chafets says in the book he met people on devils night who make 
annual trips to the city just to watch it burn he wrote that in a 
restaurant on the 70th floor of the renaissance center 
suburbanite patrons were cheering the fires as they dined 
alongside revolving glass walls 
the mayor said chafets expose doesnt help solve the problem 
were attempting to come up with a more positive image for the 
city he said its obvious that devils night has a bad 
connotation it always has then some guy writes a book about it 
and it becomes worse 
the arson trend has begun to spill over into the suburbs 
a curfew was imposed in highland park after a few buildings were 
burned in recent years were working with two shifts over the 
next three days to cut down on any problems police lt ron 
behrend said monday night 
in flint where about 140 fires were reported last year the 
fire department began last week lecturing at schools and to 
neighborhood clubs

the moldavian parliament has expelled 10 christian 
turkish deputies for urging the secession of the gagauz people from 
the republic and organizing elections tass said today 
the move came as nationalist and secessionist forces were 
reported to be pulling back from a confrontation and more talks 
were planned on resolving their ethnic conflict 
tension in southern moldavia a republic bordering romania has 
dissipated since two regiments of soviet interior ministry troops 
began arriving over the weekend to establish a buffer between 
moldavians and the gagauz minority the official news agency tass 
and the independent agency interfax reported monday 
tass said today that the moldavian parliament expelled 10 of 13 
gagauz deputies because they shunned parliamentary sessions 
ignored parliamentary laws and resolutions provoked citizens to 
violate moldavian laws and organized general elections in the 
gagauz republic 
the gagauz descendants of christians who fled religious 
persecution in turkey about 160 years ago claimed the southern 
corner of the republic last week and began holding elections for an 
autonomous government within moldavia 
numbering about 150000 in the republic of 43 million the 
gagauz said they feared rising moldavian nationalism and were angry 
over a law making moldavian the republics official language 
tass said the declaration of independence declared 
unconstitutional by the moldavian parliament had heightened ethnic 
tensions in the republic 
a state of emergency was declared in the region friday and 
soviet troops were sent to keep the peace the situation has 
improved slightly during the past 24 hours previously the 
situation was characterized as explosive tass said monday night 
the ethnic unrest was the latest to strike the soviet union and 
could further complicate president mikhail s gorbachevs hopes to 
hold the country together with a new union treaty 
interior ministry troops also have been deployed in several 
other republics to prevent ethnic violence

burmas state press has said there is 
no political future for leading dissident aung san suu kyi whom 
the military government has detained without trial for more than a 
year 
in a twopart article oct 2223 the working peoples daily 
also indicated the government would release ms suu kyi only if she 
accepted exile a copy of the article was obtained in bangkok 
today 
the articles were the clearest statement yet of the governments 
intentions toward ms suu kyi whose national league for democracy 
won the may general election by a landslide but has been blocked 
from taking office 
aung san suu kyi has no right according to the law to take 
part in the political activities of burma the article said 
ms suu kyi was put under house arrest in july 1989 and later 
barred from the election she was accused of subversion but never 
formally charged 
the decision to disqualify her from the election puts an end 
to her political career once and for all the paper said 
the daily also reprinted without comment a report from a thai 
newspaper last month in which a japanese diplomat quoted the head 
of burmas government gen saw maung as saying he would free ms 
suu kyi if she accepted exile 
a political source in burmas capital rangoon said the state 
press had stepped up attacks on ms suu kyi after authorities 
cracked down on dissident buddhist monks last week and arrested at 
least a dozen senior officials of the national league for 
democracy 
its an allout attempt to discredit the national league and 
aung san suu kyi said the source who was contacted by telephone 
from bangkok and spoke on condition of anonymity 
a recent cartoon in the working peoples daily said ms suu kyi 
had defiled the burmese race by marrying a foreigner the source 
said 
ms suu kyi the 45yearold daughter of aung san burmas 
revered independence leader is married to british academic michael 
aris 
the source said the government appeared to have succeeded in 
squelching dissent among the monks buddhist monks stopped 
ministering to soldiers last month to protest military violence 
against demonstrators the authorities responded with stern 
warnings raids on monasteries and arrests 
the source also said the government was trying to force leaders 
of opposition parties to sign a document saying they agreed to 
follow a program requiring that a new constitution be approved 
before the government steps down 
the national league for democracy had ignored the plan when it 
was announced in july instead it demanded the government convene 
the parliament chosen in the may election and negotiate a transfer 
of power 
a burmese source in rangoon said cho cho kyaw naing leader of 
one political party the antifascist peoples freedom league had 
refused to sign the agreement 
both rangoon sources dismissed news reports that myint myint 
khin a central executive committee member of the national league 
for democracy had signed the document

a french human rights group said 
today vote rigging defeated benazir bhuttos populist party in last 
weeks elections 
the international federation of human rights is the first group 
of poll watchers to echo ms bhuttos charges of fraud in voting 
for national and provincial legislatures 
the islamic democratic alliance which will form pakistans next 
government called the groups assessment ridiculous 
they must have had super vision like the the comic book 
character superman to be able to see massive fraud which dozens of 
other observers could not see said an alliance spokesman who 
insisted on anonymity 
ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party was handed a stunning 
defeat in wednesdays national parliamentary elections in 
provincial legislative polling three days later her party won 
support only in her home province of sindh 
in a statement issued by the french embassy in islamabad the 
fourmember human rights team said there was a discrepancy between 
the widespread impression of sparse voter turnout and the official 
report 
the statement also cited problems with what it said were delayed 
polling results and the absence of official vote tallies 
almost without exception international and local witnesses 
reported sparse voter turnout but officials said 456 percent of 
the electorate cast ballots wednesday nearly 3 percent more than 
in november 1988 
the parisbased human rights organization which has members in 
54 countries charged that ms bhuttos opponents altered the 
election results suggesting the intervention could have occurred 
between the polling stations and the election return offices 
ms bhutto said vote rigging was widespread in 100 of pakistans 
217 constituencies she claimed between 2 million and 4 million 
preprepared ballots were stuffed into boxes en route from polling 
stations to election return offices 
chief election commission justice naeemuddin dismissed the 
charges saying i have not received a single complaint 
but the french report claimed several polling agents were not 
given certified results following the vote count at the polling 
station instead they have only slips of papers to prove their 
count 
something very important no official paper with the results 
was given to polling agents when the voting was over the groups 
statement said 
the human rights groups report was at odds with that of the 
washingtonbased national democratic institute which said polling 
was generally open orderly and welladministered the 
institute sent 40 observers to pakistan 
a 15member team from india nepal sri lanka and bangladesh 
also concluded the voting was fair as did a threemember canadian 
team 
ms bhutto 37 was sacked as prime minister aug 6 by president 
ghulam ishaq khan who charged her party indulged in corruption 
nepotism and confrontational politics during her 20 months in 
power

troops opened fire today on hindu 
fundamentalists who broke through police lines and surged toward a 
holy site claimed by both hindus and moslems at least five people 
were killed and 20 wounded 
thirteen more people died in hindumoslem clashes in several 
cities hundreds of miles away police said at least 125 people 
have been killed in riots across india this past week most in 
clashes between hindus and moslems 
the dispute threatens to topple the government of prime minister 
vp singh who opposes the hindu campaign to replace a 
16thcentury moslem mosque 
militant members of the countrys hindu majority had said they 
would begin tearing down the mosque today and replacing it with a 
temple 
singh today repeated his offer to resign if members of his party 
in parliament feel that change of leadership will serve larger 
goals he made a similar offer monday 
about 200 hindus eventually reached the site today in ayodhya 
those who got through planted hindu religious flags on the mosque 
in victory before police drove them away 
about 10000 people who had surged past police barricades 
surrounded the perimeter of the disputed site when three hindu holy 
men urged them to halt the violence saying they had negotiated a 
peaceful sttlement with local officials but part of the crowd 
apparently did not hear the appeal and pushed toward the mosque 
setting fire to six police jeeps along the way 
police then opened fire the federal government later announced 
that five people were killed about 20 others were injured by the 
gunfire witnesses said 
hindu holy men screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted the 
police with stones at least four officers were injured 
many of the militant hindus were beaten back by police who 
fired tear gas and lashed out with irontipped bamboo canes dozens 
were injured 
the crowd initially halted about 100 yards from the mosque 
where police and paramilitary troops stood with rifles ready but 
later about 200 hindus broke through police lines and reached the 
small onestory mosque 
young men wearing orange headbands the color of the hindu 
faith climbed atop the mosque and chipped concrete from each of 
its three domes claiming this was a symbolic destruction of 
the islamic shrine 
they planted a saffron flag atop each dome before police drove 
them away jubilant crowds poured through the streets shouting 
victory to mother india 
in new delhi the governments chief spokesman ramamohan rao 
said there was no damage to the mosque 
the world hindu council which is leading the temple program 
said it would go ahead with its construction effort 
we will only rest when the temple in complete girilal 
kishore a hindu holy man and senior official of the council told 
reporters in new delhi 
ayodha a city of 40000 people had been under a 
roundtheclock curfew since friday and roads leading to the mosque 
were blocked as authorities tried to halt any attempt to tear down 
the mosque 
but people emerged from hiding places in fields around ayodhya 
before sunrise and stormed a bridge leading into the town 
about 20000 police and paramilitary troops were deployed in and 
around ayodhya 300 miles southeast of new delhi they were among 
200000 security troops on alert throughout uttar pradesh state 
about 80000 people have been arrested in the last week in the 
rural state most were made under preventive detention laws that 
allow authorities to hold people without charge when they believe 
public safety is threatened 
the detainees included top leaders of the rightwing hindu 
bharatiya janata party it has withdrawn its support for prime 
minister singh in parliament plunging india into political crisis 
singh now does not have a reliable vote bank in parliament to 
preserve his minority government which took office last december 
the mosque at issue was built on the place that many hindu 
leaders claim is the very spot where the god rama was born 
moslems who make up 12 percent of indias 880 million people 
fear that if one mosque is moved or destroyed hundreds of other 
islamic shrines across india would be in peril 
athough india is constitutionally a secular nation hindus 
comprise 82 percent of the population and have always held the 
prime ministers post

israeli security guard who was escorting a gasoline truck into 
nablus the army said 
army radio said the guard was stabbed three times in the back as 
he stood on the street a plainclothes israeli security officer who 
was passing shot the attacker to death it said the guard suffered 
moderate wounds 
the army imposed a curfew on nablus and the surrounding refugee 
camps confining some 130000 palestinians to their homes 
three masked palestinians announced through a loudspeaker that 
the slain assailant identified as 18yearold haitham jamla was a 
member of islamic jihad a moslem fundamentalist group outlawed by 
israel on monday 
the decision to ban the group apparently came after it claimed 
responsibility for the stabbing deaths of three israelis in 
jerusalem last week israel has blamed islamic jihad for dozens of 
earlier attacks on jews 
in the tel aviv suburb of bnei brak meanwhile a bomb exploded 
in a vegetable store killing one arab and wounding two as they 
tried to assemble the device police said 
chaim selzer a medic who arrived first at the scene told army 
radio that one of the wounded lost a hand in the explosion a third 
arab suffered minor injuries officials said both were taken to a 
nearby hospital 
the radio said the three arabs were employed at the store in the 
ultraorthodox suburb and slept there at night indicating that 
they were from the occupied territories 
israeli law bars palestinians from the west bank and gaza strip 
from staying in israel overnight many israeli employers sidestep 
the law however and provide primitive accommodations for 
palestinian laborers so they dont have to make the long journey 
home to the west bank or gaza every night 
after last weeks revenge attacks defense minister moshe arens 
closed off the occupied lands for four days barring palestinians 
from entering israel 
on monday he announced tougher restrictions to permanently ban 
palestinians from entering israel saying he would block all those 
with records of crime or activities in the 34monthold palestinian 
uprising 
the daily haaretz said today that about 20000 would be banned 
up from 8000 now among those banned will be palestinians held 
under emergency regulations that allow them to be jailed for up to 
a year without charges 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said on monday night that israel 
would crack down hard on arabs attacking jews 
we shall react to them whether they use stones or firebombs 
knives or other weapons he told american jewish fundraisers 
we shall not expose our citizens to danger we shall build a wall 
of steel and love around our people as we face threats 
in other violence today masked assailants shot and killed 
45yearold khalil hassan najar in the gaza strip refugee camp of 
rafah on suspicion he collaborated with israel palestinian 
reporters said 
the army said police were investigating 
the death brought to 292 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in the uprising most on suspicion of helping israel 
the death in nablus brought to 767 the number of palestinians 
killed by israelis fiftyone israelis have also died in the 
violence

a grave containing more than 100 
bodies most believed to be those of murdered teenagers has been 
found on the outskirts of rio a church worker said today 
eduardo gomes who works for the roman catholic church said 
police discovered the grave saturday in the city of nova iguacu 
there appear to be about 100 bodies in the grave and most are 
almost certainly teenagers killed by death squads he said 
the death squads which are largely made up of police officers 
are normally paid by small shopkeepers to kill petty thieves many 
victims are destitute minors 
gomes said only a few bodies had been retrieved from the grave 
thus far he said clothing and shoes found in the grave indicated 
most of the corpses were those of youngsters 
initial attempts to confirm gomes report were unsuccessful no 
one answered the telephone at police headquarters in nova iguacu 
in a report issued earlier this year the londonbased human 
rights group amnesty international said hundreds of children were 
being murdered each year in brazil 
there is a marked presence of organized actions for the 
elimination of children and adolescents with a view to cleaning up 
the streets the report said

associated press writerequals 
beijing ap china today released preliminary figures from its 
largestever census showing a population of 1133 billion 20 
million more people than the government had planned 
the census conducted in july marked the first time the 
government had conducted doortodoor surveys it is considered the 
most accurate figure ever for chinas population 
the census found 1133682501 people residing permanently in 
mainland china the nationally televised evening news and the 
official xinhua news agency reported 
the last reported population figure in late 1989 showed 1112 
billion chinese but that figure was based on previous population 
figures that chinese officials have conceded were unreliable 
an editorial to be published wednesday on the front page of the 
party newspaper the peoples daily called for greater attention 
to population control 
for china to reach its goal of a population of 125 billion by 
the year 2000 is still very difficult we must have a full 
understanding of this it said the editorial was excerpted by 
xinhua and read on the newscast 
the government had hoped to keep the population down to 1113 by 
the end of 1990 but the census showed that by mid1990 the 
population had exceeded the goal by 20 million 
the growth rate for the july 1989june 1990 period was 147 per 
1000 the census found chinas growth rate has been increasing 
steadily since 1985 when it was 1123 per 1000 
the birth rate also rose for the fourth straight year to 2098 
per 1000 in 1985 it was 178 per 1000 the census showed 
chinas population increases by more than 30 people every 
minute or about 17 million people annually according to official 
reports 
china has failed to stay within its population targets because 
of a baby boom and the governments inability to maintain its 
onechildperfamily policy especially in the countryside under 
the policy instituted in 1980 families must pay steep fines 
following the birth of a second child 
in rural china the idea that a large family means prosperity 
remains strong and some farmers have become rich enough to pay 
fines for having extra children to work on their properties 
the onechild policy also has been relaxed for some families in 
economic difficulty including those with one daughter 
further complicating matters people born during a baby boom in 
the mid1960s are now in their marriage and childbearing years 
causing a new peak in the population curve 
the census carried out over 10 days involved 7 million people 
final results will take two years to compile

back home after a turbulent 101st congress 
senators are in a political dilemma over whether to campaign as 
government outsiders or legislative insiders 
in north carolina republican sen jesse helms faces a stiff 
challenge from democratic rival harvey gantt who is telling voters 
its time for a change 
the threeterm senator was put on the defensive about his votes 
in congress as he kicked off his final week of campaigning on 
monday the senator shoved a protester at a rally in durham after 
the man questioned helms votes on the savings and loan bailout 
go to the gantt rallies if you want to waste your time but 
dont be rude the senator said pushing 25yearold marty leary 
away from a microphone 
leary said helms push wasnt very forceful 
i think he gave me a little reminder nudge that my time was 
up leary said it didnt seem like too unfriendly a push 
just two days earlier helms had been campaigning by 
speakerphone from his washington office and criticizing the 
legislation approved by congress in the lastminute rush toward 
adjournment 
the clean air act is just not fair to the taxpayers and to the 
workers of america helms said contending that the benefits 
could occur at half the bills 50 billion price 
helms comments came as gantt complained that republican 
administrations have damaged the governments image 
i basically see the government has become a dirty word to so 
many of us in recent years gantt said over the weekend 
in illinois on monday democratic sen paul simon and republican 
challenger rep lynn martin boasted about major bills that cleared 
congress with benefits for their constituents 
the budget rolls back higher us customs service fees at 
airports in rockford and waukegan ill martin said the 
transportation bill fully funds amtrak routes in illinois simon 
said 
the transportation pie has been getting relatively smaller 
but illinois once again is a clear winner in the transportation 
budget the senator said during a campaign appearance sunday 
night 
simon holds a solid lead over martin in recent polls 
forced to remain in washington until just eight days before the 
election several candidates sought to create the impression that 
they were hard at work ensuring that their state or district 
benefited in congress rush to adjourn 
some lawmakers however believe the turmoil that surrounded the 
drawnout budget fight hurt their campaigns 
republican sen rudy boschwitz held a substantial lead over 
democratic challenger paul wellstone during the summer but a 
recent poll showed the race as a dead heat 
boschwitz rushed home in the middle of last week and 
acknowledged i think the turmoil in washington is having an 
effect on my campaign 
in indiana republican sen dan coats sought to distance himself 
from president bush and the 101st congress 
i just think the president made a major mistake by thinking he 
could play the good guy play the compromiser and negotiate with 
the democrat congress coats said monday 
although his campaign filmed bushs appearance and endorsement 
earlier this year it does not plan to use the footage its 
going to make some good home movies said coats who was 
appointed to succeed vice president dan quayle in the senate 
coats said the deficitreduction plan changes a government 
course that led to peace and prosperity in the 1980s and he called 
the 101st congress a major disappointment coats maintains a 
solid lead over democratic challenger baron hill 
in oregon where republican sen mark hatfield is fighting for 
his political life democratic challenger harry lonsdale has 
accused his opponent of receiving more than 80000 from special 
interest groups in the past two days 
i think oregon voters would rather have an independent voice 
like harry lonsdale said the candidates spokesman dan walter 
hatfield who returned home often during the last month of 
congress focused on such local issues as timber industry jobs 
while launching a campaign ad that questions his opponents 
competency 
the campaign of massachusetts sen john kerry also has begun 
airing negative ads that attack republican james rappaports 
wealthy real estate background 
in an interview with the associated press kerry sought to 
portray rappaport as a candidate of reaganomics and a product of 
the last decade of republican administrations

an air force general is 
accusing police of coddling protesters opposed to the us 
military buildup in the middle east 
chicopees mayor reminded the general that the protesters have 
rights 
air force reserve brig gen frederick d walker commander of 
the 439th military airlift wing fired off letters to gov michael 
s dukakis and chicopee aldermen earlier this month calling 
periodic protests at the base gates by several dozen people 
weekly outbursts of lawlessness 
he also accused police of trying to coddle and placate the 
lawbreakers he complained that in one instance a fuel truck was 
delayed for 45 minutes while police pleaded with protesters to 
temporarily stand aside 
walker was in georgia and could not immediately be reached for 
comment today but gordon newell base public relations officer 
said the general was upset over what he considered a dangerous 
situation 
from the viewpoint of a military commander in a time of world 
tensions the refusal of the city of chicopee to maintain clear 
passage to this military installation in unacceptable walker 
said in his oct 9 letter to the governor 
westover the nations largest air force reserve base is the 
main staging area in the northeast for cargo flights to saudi 
arabia the base is in chicopee in western massachusetts near 
springfield 
the general got little sympathy from chicopee mayor joseph j 
chessey jr who called walkers conduct totally inappropriate 
for a person holding his rank and position and accused him of 
trying to muzzle dissent 
i dont personally agree with the protesters but they have 
rights and in the generals mind those rights should be denied 
chessey said monday they have a right this is america this is 
not iraq 
the mayor fired off his own letter of complaint to walkers 
superior maj gen alan g sharp asking that the air force 
bring sanity and resolution to this problem 
chessey and acting police chief joseph j wilk jr said police 
have arrested protesters who blocked access to the base and refused 
to move twentyone protesters were arrested oct 20 at two base 
gates and two others were arrested aug 27 
as far as im concerned there have been no dangerous 
situations up there wilk said and as far as im concerned 
its been a minimal inconvenience

the army is preparing to rotate fresh combat 
units to saudi arabia to relieve units that have been in the desert 
since the start of operation desert shield a senior army official 
said today 
gen gordon r sullivan the army vice chief of staff said 
however that the army had not yet been instructed to increase the 
overall number of soldiers in saudi arabia beyond the more than 
100000 already there or en route 
more than 210000 soldiers sailors and airmen are in the 
persian gulf area and secretary of defense dick cheney said monday 
that as many as 100000 more could be sent 
sullivan said in an interview that the last pieces of the 
originally planned army deployment to saudi arabia will be ashore 
within the next couple of days president bush ordered troops 
to the gulf to defend saudi arabia against a possible iraqi attack 
five days after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
theyre essentially there sullivan said of the remaining 
elements of the army deployment which is the largest operation 
since the vietnam war 
the fourstar general said no final decision have been made on a 
rotation policy for desert shield and he did not say when the 
replacement units would be sent 
cheney has said he expects a sixmonth rotation and sullivan 
said that while details wont be decided for a couple more weeks 
the army already is making arrangements 
some headquarters do know theyll be sending replacement 
units sullivan said now if you were to get down and ask the guy 
down in the infantry squad someplace if he knows the answer is 
no he doesnt they havent been alerted 
sullivan said troops from us bases in europe that are 
scheduled to be closed are likely to be used as replacements in 
saudi arabia 
for the first time in a major us military operation the army 
will rotate whole units in desert shield instead of replacing 
individual soldiers sullivan said the switch in approach is 
designed to prevent the kind of breakdown in cohesion of combat 
units that was experienced in the vietnam war he said

last weeks strike was the most extensive since president 
corazon aquino took office in february 1986 during the people 
power revolution that toppled the late president ferdinand 
marcos 
the strike which was called to demand a 42 percent increase in 
the daily minimum wage paralyzed public transportation in manila 
and other cities 
militants believed to include communist rebels burned 23 buses 
passenger jeeps and other vehicles during the labor unrest 
mrs aquino refused to grant the 150aday increase and 
instead told union leaders to refer their demand to a 
governmentlabor wage council 
later the unions scaled down their demand to 1 a day but mrs 
aquino refused that request too she also promised to punish strike 
leaders responsible for violence

the number of cars waiting to get off 
ocracoke and hatteras islands decreased to 180 today as ferry 
operators worked around the clock to rescue tourists stranded by a 
bridge collapse last week 
at least 300 vehicles queued up at the ocracoke ferry slip 
monday but today only 50 cars were waiting to travel from 
ocracoke to the mainland and 130 were waiting for a shorter ferry 
ride from hatteras to ocracoke 
our shortterm goal is getting visitors off the island joe 
myers director of the state division of emergency management said 
at a raleigh news conference monday 
hundreds of tourists were trapped friday when a dredge slammed 
into the herbert c bonner bridge severing the only road linking 
hatteras and ocracoke islands to the mainland 
the accident also knocked out electrical power for the islands 
5650 residents power was restored to most areas by monday 
four ferries moving 150 cars every six hours are the only way 
off the islands travelers must take one ferry for the mile trip to 
ocracoke then another ferry 30 miles to the mainland the complete 
trip takes about 3 hours 
meyers said the ferries were working 24 hours a day buffy 
warner an owner of the island inn a hotel within walking distance 
of the ocracoke ferry slip said the group of tourist waiting to 
leave had been calm 
i think everybodys taking it pretty much in stride warner 
said this is a pretty good crowd of people to be stranded 
getting one lane of the bridge open should take 45 to 90 days 
depending on the weather said bill marley highway administrator 
with the north carolina department of transportation 
replacing the span will cost at least 1 million he said 
contractors should begin clearing the bridge debris from the 
oregon inlet by wednesday he said

technicians at bulgarias sole nuclear 
plant shut down two of its five reactors today because of an 
unspecified breakdown the state bta news agency reported 
the brief dispatch said the mishap occurred outside the plants 
nuclear reactor core but offered no other details 
it said the two reactors one with a capacity of 400 megawatts 
and another of 1000 megawatts were shut down as a precaution 
the breakdown occurred less than a week after international 
experts expressed concern about safety at the plant and a day after 
premier andrei lukanov pledged to shut it down if international 
safety standards could not be met 
a review by the international atomic energy agency found there 
were not enough senior operators or engineers at the plant at 
kozlodui located on the danube river in northern bulgaria 
earlier this month workers at kozlodui warned that a sixth 
reactor now under construction is flawed and could explode if 
started up 
despite a worsening energy crisis that already has resulted in 
some rationing of electricity lukanov said on monday the plant 
which provides 30 percent of the countrys electricity would be 
mothballed unless it could meet international safety standards

president bushs patience is wearing thin 
in the persian gulf crisis one lawmaker reported today after a 
white house meeting that included discussion of possible military 
action 
congressional leaders emerging from the meeting said they had 
urged the president to explore all other avenues for resolving the 
crisis and got no indication that us military action was 
imminent 
his patience is wearing thin said sen william cohen 
rmaine one of several lawmakers who met for an hour at the white 
house with the president but cohen added for the time being 
hes going to continue to pursue the course that were currently 
on 
cohen said there was no indication that were at the 
nearbreak point for moving from sanctions to military action 
against iraq 
asked if bush appeared to have a military strike on the front 
burner sen claiborne pell dri said its certainly on the 
burner and not ruled out 
theres concern on capital hill that this is somehow a 
prelude to immediate military action sen patrick leahy dvt 
said after the meeting people want to make sure that options are 
explored he said 
participants described bush as highly disturbed at reports of 
atrocities in occupied kuwait and the plight of us embassy 
personnel and other americans who have been blocked from leaving 
the lawmakers said bush sought their opinions in what leahy 
described as one of the livelier such sessions he has attended 
with the president 
nobody asked the president to rule out a military option 
leahy said but many of us told him to make sure that we dont 
use the military option out of impatience that we try the embargo 
the sanctions the united nations resoultions our allies efforts 
first and foremost 
cohen who has been outspoken in saying that bush must get 
congressional approval before undertaking hostilities said 
there obviously is a difference of opinion in terms of whether 
that power resides with the executive branch or the congressional 
branch i believe the president is doing his best to say lets 
work together and thats precisely what the thrust of the meeting 
was 
bush met with the leaders a day after he declared that he 
would have no hesitancy to using force if provoked by iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
at a picturetaking session at the beginning of the meeting 
bush brushed off a reporters question on reports that 
administration officials plan to discuss a timetable with us 
allies for a possible military offensive 
i could but im not going to comment on the story in 
todays editions of the los angeles times bush said 
the president also planned to meet with foreign policy advisers 
today 
the constitution gives congress the power to declare war 
although the president is commanderinchief of the armed forces 
bush has held regular consultations with congress on the gulf 
crisis since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait prompted him to send 
more than 200000 troops to the region 
but beyond that secretary of state james a baker iii said 
recently the administration would not promise to get congressional 
approval if a decision was made to engage in armed conflict with 
iraq 
baker was responding to calls by some lawmakers that congress be 
called back into session to approve such an escalation 
bush told reporters monday i know the authorities that a 
president has im working to try to get this matter resolved 
peacefully we have a lot of force there and theyre welltrained 
theyre highly motivated and that alone is sending an enormously 
strong signal to saddam hussein 
he noted he was consulting with congressional leaders today 
adding but history is replete with examples where the president 
has had to take action and ive done this in the past and 
certainly somebody mentioned provocation would have no 
hesitancy at all 
bush and baker both took a harder line toward iraq on monday 
while still saying they want to see a diplomatic solution if 
possible 
let no one doubt we will not rule out a possible use of force 
if iraq continues to occupy kuwait baker said in a speech in los 
angeles 
baker said saddam must realize there is a limit to the 
international communitys patience he must also realize that 
should he use chemical or biological weapons there will be the 
most severe consequences

jim bakker the former televangelist 
convicted of defrauding his followers was denied a fair trial and 
his sentence was excessive his attorneys told a federal appeals 
court today 
most of the nearly 90minute hearing before the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals focused on bakkers 45year sentence for 24 counts 
of wire fraud mail fraud and conspiracy 
alan dershowitz a harvard university law professor brought in 
for bakkers appeal said us district judge robert potter of 
charlotte nc made an incredible departure from federal 
sentencing guidelines 
he said bakker would have received a sentence of two to four 
years if the guidelines had been used he asked that bakker be 
resentenced by another judge 
we your honors will take our chances dershowitz said 
let the chips fall where they may 
deborah smith a us justice department lawyer said bakker 
would be eligible for parole after serving 10 years and could have 
received as much as 12 years without parole under the guidelines 
i dont think this is a case where there is a broad 
disparity she said 
she said the judge did not have to apply the guidelines because 
the crimes took place before november 1987 when the guidelines 
took effect 
judges j harvie wilkinson iii j dickson phillips jr and john 
d butzner jr will decide whether to uphold bakkers conviction 
and sentence the founder of the ptl television ministry is serving 
his sentence at a federal prison in rochester minn 
bakker was convicted of bilking followers of his television 
ministry out of millions of dollars three other former ptl 
officials also have been convicted for their roles in the scheme 
in a brief filed with the appeals court bakkers attorneys also 
said potter was influenced by his religious beliefs when he gave 
bakker an overly harsh sentence 
before sentencing bakker a year ago potter said the 
televangelist had no thought whatsever about his victims and 
those of us who do have a religion are ridiculed as being saps 
for moneygrubbing preachers or priests 
the lawyers also argued that potter failed to ensure that bakker 
got a fair and impartial jury because the judge refused to move the 
trial out of charlotte and refused to sequester the jury during the 
trial 
they said potter should have delayed the trial after bakker was 
hospitalized briefly at a federal prison in butner nc for a 
competency examination potter ordered the evaluation after 
bakkers attorneys said he was depressed and began hallucinating 
after leaving court the previous day 
bakker was declared fit to stand trial and the trial resumed

president bush has granted white house counsel 
c boyden gray a power denied everyone else in government 
authority to permit himself to decide issues in which he might have 
a conflict of interest 
the authority is contained in a new presidential order on ethics 
issued oct 17 white house and federal ethics officials who helped 
prepare the order expressed surprise this past week when shown that 
the document authorizes gray to exempt his own actions from 
criminal conflictofinterest laws 
nevertheless they were confident that gray who once said i 
was my own ethics officer while counsel to thenvice president 
bush would never actually use the authority gray himself declined 
to respond to a weeks worth of telephone calls 
mr gray would never grant a waiver for himself said deputy 
white house press secretary alixe glen in the event that that 
hypothetically were to ever come up the president would be the 
decider 
government employees who take official action that could affect 
their personal or family finances are subject to criminal 
penalties however a supervisor can allow an employee to 
participate in a particular case anyway by ruling in advance that 
the employees financial interest is too remote or too 
inconsequential to influence his or her decision that ruling 
waives the penalties 
ms glen said last weeks order contained minor finetuning 
only a handful of changes in five pages of rules in the ethics 
order bush issued last year for executive branch employees 
in the new version bush gave gray his authority to waive the 
conflictofinterest penalties for certain white house staffers 
neither gray nor those staffers are mentioned by name which may 
be the reason for the oversight by government lawyers who prepared 
the order for bush 
it says the counsel to the president gray can grant waivers 
to every employee hired under a specific section of federal law 
that section is the one under which gray himself was hired 
at the office of government ethics which polices executive 
branch employees general counsel gary davis said the wording of 
the new order was a technical point 
thats a quirk in the statute davis added but that would 
be the last thing he would ever do that would be political 
suicide they would never in 100 years do that 
during his eight years as counsel to vice president bush gray 
a multimillionaire served as chairman and trustee of his familys 
cable television and broadcasting company summit communications 
group inc of atlanta he also received more than 200000 in fees 
from summit during those years 
those arrangements were not barred at the office of the vice 
president where gray by his own declaration set the ethics rules 
at the time he was working sidebyside with reagan white house 
employees bound by unwritten policies that banned earning outside 
income or serving on corporate boards 
when gray moved to the white house with bush he resigned the 
corporate post and he has put large blocks of his holdings into 
two blind trusts he still retains control over more than 1 
million in assets and receives income from a family trust that also 
has more than 1 million in assets according to his 1990 financial 
disclosure statement 
the family trust contains more than 250000 in summit stock and 
more than 250000 in stock of media general a newspaper 
publishing and television broadcasting corporation gray reported 
dividends in 1989 of between 50000 and 100000 on the summit 
stock and between 15000 and 50000 on the media general stock 
also outside his blind trusts are substantial investments in real 
estate limited partnerships which are commonly used by the very 
wealthy as tax shelters 
ms glen said gray holds no current exemption from the conflict 
statute and foresees no need of one 
presidential orders such as bushs are regularly reviewed in 
advance at the justice departments office of legal counsel 
larry simms a former deputy assistant attorney general who 
served in that office during the carter and reagan administrations 
said such a drafting error ought to be pointed out 
it ought to be changed or some document put in the record to 
clarify the intent someday everyone who drafted it with an 
unstated intent will be dead simms said 
asked if an amendment or clarifying document were planned ms 
glen said its not considered necessary to amend it because it 
is evident that one cannot decide a waiver for oneself

florence and hildred newsom have gone 
through tough times and good times on their farm even through 
cancer surgery but the two elderly sisters wouldnt live anywhere 
else 
florence 75 took care of the cattle while 70yearold hildred 
cooked cleaned made the cottage cheese for their dairy route and 
delivered eggs to dozens of customers 
that was the routine the sisters followed before they had cancer 
surgery during the same week last may now they take life easier 
but not much easier 
everything came to a screeching halt when she went to the 
hospital april 30 hildred recalled 
she told the nurse down at the hospital that she knew 
something was wrong because she couldnt lift two bales at one 
time 
shortly after florence was hospitalized for colon cancer 
surgery hildred checked into the hospital for a mastectomy 
hildred was released from the hospital in may but florence 
suffered two small strokes after her surgery and was in therapy 
until july 
hildred nursed her sister back to health giving her medicine 14 
times a day and setting out a table of fruits nuts and candy to 
encourage her to eat in between meals so shed put on some pounds 
florence did her part by lifting 2pound rocks in each arm and 
rolling a hay bale back and forth its a type of therapy she 
prescribed for herself 
id roll it up and back and up and back and every 10th time 
id lift it florence said 
the two sisters never married when florence was younger she 
took care of the livestock and raked and hauled hay with a 1952 
tractor while her brother melvin who now lives in bismarck 
raised the crops 
i worked 16hour days and then came in at night and read and 
wrote florence said any white piece of paper was a 
challenge 
she published her first story in the dakota farmer when she 
was 10 and continued writing for the magazine for several years 
for the last 15 years shes written a weekly column called by the 
way for the heraldpress in harvey 
most of her columns are about nature shes a student of birds 
rocks grass she can hear a flock of geese flying over the 
farmyard long before someone with an untrained ear 
her keen interest in nature led her to become an observer for 
the national weather service she recently received a citation for 
recording barometric pressure wind direction and precipitation 
daily for 10 years 
while hildred doesnt talk about nature as much as florence she 
loves living on the farm she lived in bismarck in the late 1950s 
and 60s before returning to the farm to help care for her mother 
who was ill 
the pace has slowed for the sisters now they sold their 100 
hens a couple of weeks ago and dont milk the cow anymore 
but dont ask them to leave the farm 
people in town are telling us we shouldnt be out here 
hildred said theres a businessman in town who says he has a 
house picked out for us 
i dont want to live in town twelve years of it was enough

rep roy dyson never really stopped 
campaigning after he came within a hair of losing his house seat to 
republican wayne gilchrest in 1988 
dyson a fiveterm democrat from marylands 1st district has 
been pummelled in the last two years by questions about his ties to 
defense contractors the suicide of his chief aide and improper 
campaign financing 
most recently the hawkish dyson was criticized for being a 
conscientious objector during the vietnam war gilchrest won the 
purple heart for his service in vietnam 
but dysons tenacity has made the rematch with gilchrest a race 
that gop leaders had thought was sure to go their way this year 
too close to call 
i have no idea why dyson is doing so well said liz hamel 
spokeswoman for the national republican congressional committee 
which put dyson near the top of its hit list of vulnerable 
democratic representatives 
hes just a complete embarrassment she said hopefully 
this time the voters will realize it 
dyson campaign manager chris robinson says the democrat made a 
prodigious rehabilitation effort after political novice 
gilchrest came within 1400 votes of upsetting him two years ago 
when the campaign was over in 1988 we went right back to 
work robinson said dyson attended 70 town meetings in the 
last two years we never stopped 
dyson must not only overcome the ethical questions that have 
beset his campaign but also the antiincumbency mood that has 
settled on the district 
gilchrest a quiet likeable schoolteacher is the antithesis of 
the professional politician 
on leave from his teaching job gilchrest is waging a lowtech 
tight budget campaign he spends 18hour days shaking hands and 
addressing the issues 
hes paid 208 a week from his campaign chest 
campaign manager tony caligiuri says voters see gilchrest as 
someone they can talk with 
but other gop officials say theyre afraid that gilchrests 
diffidence sometimes to the point of shyness is a liability he 
needs to toughen his message supporters say privately adding that 
his niceguy campaign is letting dyson off too easy 
i havent liked negative campaigns per se thats not my 
style gilchrest said 
he has disavowed two television ads paid for by the independent 
free state republican fund that bitterly attack dyson 
dyson contends the group is working with gilchrest 
they are like tagteam wrestlers dyson said gilchrest is 
trying to come off as mr clean while the free state republicans 
throw mud 
gilchrests major problem is money 
dyson had collected more than 650000 in campaign contributions 
through oct 17 much of it from political action committees 
associated with organized labor agriculture and defense dyson had 
raised 177000 
dyson who sits on the house armed services committee has been 
in trouble since 1988 when his name surfaced in connection with the 
pentagon procurement scandal 
while never the subject of an investigation dyson accepted 
18000 in contributions from defense industry lobbyists later 
convicted of bribery he returned the money last year 
in may 1988 dysons top aide and political mentor tom pappas 
committed suicide the day the washington post reported that he had 
recruited single young men for dysons staff and required them to 
spend their free time socializing with him and other staff members 
in 1989 dyson was fined by the federal election commission for 
irregularities in his campaign finance reports 
then late this summer dyson revealed that he had been a 
conscientious objector during the vietnam war the announcement 
came a day after the washington post sought an interview to discuss 
his draft records 
the gilchrest camp capitalized on that revelation airing ads by 
adrian cronauer the former military disc jockey made famous by the 
movie good morning vietnam 
i want to tell you about wayne gilchrest a marine who won the 
purple heart and the bronze star in vietnam cronauer says in the 
radio ad wayne gilchrest is a man of character who answered the 
call then and now hes ready to serve his country once more 
former republican state sen porter hopkins who lost to dyson 
in 1982 rates gilchrests chances at 5050 however he said dyson 
is more in tune politically with the conservative district than the 
more moderate gilchrest 
as far as gilchrest is concerned people admire his guts 
but i detect a good number of people who think hes too liberal i 
a number of areas hopkins said

an old revolutionary scolded his countrymen 
tuesday for abandoning use of the term comrade once a common 
form of address in communist china 
some people say comrade is out of date now this is 
muddled thinking li huang said in a signed commentary in the 
peoples daily the communist party newspaper 
i still consider being called comrade the greatest honor 
in the early days of chinese communism he said the term 
comrade meant respect admiration and common aspirations 
when you encountered difficulties a comrade would give you 
faith and wisdom li said 
but in recent years the term has become increasingly rare in 
chinas large cities as people switch to using professional titles 
or simply calling miss or sir to get a shop attendants 
attention 
li contended that using professional titles reflects a return to 
the class system of old china and confused political thinking 
that we can today call each other comrade is not a simple 
thing it symbolizes the victory of the revolution and was 
exchanged for the blood of countless martyrs said li who 
described himself as a retired communist party member 
the papers editorial department said by telephone that li was 
an old cadre from jilin province but it could provide no other 
biographical information 
a man by the same name was listed in government directories as 
being a ranking party official in northeast chinas liaoning 
province from the 1950s to the 1970s but it was not known if he 
was the same li who wrote the commentary 
li railed against television and radio shows that refer to 
audience friends rather than audience comrades 
he said he called a station to ask why comrades had been 
dropped and was told that not everyone in the audience is 
necessarily a comrade and that the term carries political 
overtones 
but li countered can you say that everyone in the audience is 
a friend and to be socialist is to be political whats to 
fear in being too political

archbishop paul c marcinkus the american 
prelate linked to italys biggest postwar banking scandal said 
tuesday he was retiring and returning to the united states ending 
a fourdecade vatican career 
the 68yearold native of cicero ill who resigned from the 
post he still held as deputy governor of the vatican citystate 
said he planned to take up pastoral work in chicago 
pope john paul ii accepted the resignation after repeated 
requests from marcinkus the vatican said american bishops issued 
statements praising marcinkus and welcoming him back to the united 
states 
marcinkus was president of the vatican bank for 20 years until 
1989 when the job was eliminated under a reorganization of the 
institute of religious works the banks formal name he has 
maintained he was innocent of any wrongdoing 
during his tenure the vatican finances were clouded by scandal 
over the past decade two italian financiers with close ties to the 
vatican michele sindona and roberto calvi died under mysterious 
circumstances 
the 6foot4inch prelate acted as a bodyguard to the pope 
during his early foreign travels and seemed headed for promotion to 
cardinal when the banking scandal broke 
i have never done anything wrong marcinkus said tuesday 
adding that some day i would like to set the record straight 
but he said i dont want people to think i have sour grapes 
i want to leave here on a happy note 
warrants for the arrest of marcinkus and two lay vatican bank 
officials were issued in 1987 italian prosecutors charged them 
with being accessories to the fraudulent bankruptcy of banco 
ambrosiano italys largest private bank which collapsed in 1982 
following the disappearance of 13 billion 
but the arrests were never carried out italys constitutional 
court ruled that a vaticanitalian treaty precluded any 
interference by italian authorities in the affairs of the vatican 
an independent citystate 
the missing money was in loans made to 10 fake companies in 
latin america controlled by the vatican bank banco ambrosiano had 
loaned the money during the presidency of calvi popularlyknown as 
gods banker because of his close ties to the vatican 
calvi was found hanging from a london bridge in june 1982 
the vatican bank a major shareholder in banco ambrosiano 
agreed to pay 250 million to the italian banks creditors but 
denied any wrongdoing 
the scandal however led the vatican to bring in leading lay 
financial experts to manage the bank a move that cost marcinkus 
his post 
marcinkus had been a familar figure on the golf course of one of 
romes most exclusive clubs but lowered his public profile 
following the ambrosiano case 
the second financier sindona who also advised the vatican on 
financial matters died in march 1986 while serving a life 
sentence for ordering the death of a bank examiner investigating 
his financial affairs he died after drinking a poisoned cup of 
coffee a magistrate ruled he had committed suicide 
in a statement marcinkus said he had spent 40 years away from 
home and it was time to return 
now that i am free from administrative responsibilities i 
plan to return to the united states and make myself useful in 
whatever pastoral work i may be able to do much like many priests 
of my diocese are doing he said 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago in a statement released by 
the vatican praised marcinkus for his great dedication to the 
church and his personal integrity 
i have assured archbishop marcinkus a native son that the 
door to his home diocese will always be open to him the 
archdiocese of chicago is proud to claim him as a member of its 
presbyterate the statement said 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops said as spokesman for 
the bishops of our country i am pleased and proud to say thanks 
paul and welcome home 
in its brief announcement the vatican said the pope named 
marcinkus a consultant to the commission overseeing the vatican 
citystate essentially an honorary post that can be held while 
living elsewhere

us hostages in iraq and kuwait are suffering 
a terrible ordeal being fed inadequate diets and forced to 
sleep on verminridden floors secretary of state james a baker 
iii says 
baker shed new light on the hostages plight in a speech monday 
in los angeles a text was made available by the state department 
they are kept in the dark during the day and moved only at 
night baker said they have had their meals cut to two a day 
and many are becoming sick as they endure a terrible ordeal 
baker will embark on a weeklong visit to arab and european 
countries starting saturday state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said today the purpose will be to consult on futurnited states 
is exhausting 
every diplomatic avenue to achieve peace in the persian gulf but 
warned that military action may be taken against iraq if it 
continues to occupy kuwait 
saddam hussein must realize there is a limit to the 
international communitys patience baker said he must also 
realize that should he use chemical or biological weapons there 
will be the most severe consequences 
baker reaffirmed that the united states strongly prefers a 
peaceful solution consistent with the mandate of un security 
council resolutions 
we are exhausting every diplomatic avenue to achieve such a 
solution without further bloodshed he said 
he added let no one doubt we will not rule out a possible 
use of force if iraq continues to occupy kuwait 
later under questioning baker reaffirmed that american policy 
toward the gulf cannot be influenced by the existence of almost 
1000 american hostages in iraq and kuwait even though their lives 
may be endangered by military action 
asked about diplomatic efforts to achieve a solution other 
officials said the administration is closely monitoring efforts by 
soviet and jordanian emissaries among others to determine whether 
there is any flexibility in iraqs position 
baker said that while the international community tries to build 
on the successful ending of the cold war saddam hussein seems 
hellbent on a revival of a hot war 
baker asked what can be the longterm meaning of iraqs 
extensive chemical and biological weapons program why is the iraqi 
dictator spending billions of dollars to build weapons of mass 
destruction including a nuclear bomb and why has he turned 
baghdad into a haven for international terrorists surely not 
because he expects this aggression first against iran now 
against kuwait to be his last

nasa fueled columbia today for an 
elaborate test to determine whether the shuttle is leakfree and 
ready for an astronomy mission in december and early results 
indicated a tight spaceship 
managers are very happy with the testing so far said nasa 
spokeswoman lisa malone all the work completed here by the 
kennedy space center launch team has proved to be successful 
liquid hydrogen was pumped into columbias huge external tank 
this afternoon the engine compartment was fitted with 10 tv 
cameras and 17 sensors to pinpoint any more of the dangerous leaks 
that forced three of the shuttles four launch postponements since 
may 
a small amount of hydrogen escaped into the engine compartment 
during the test but was well within allowable limits malone said 
nevertheless nasa continued filling the tank to make sure that 
rate did not increase 
nasa officials meanwhile set nov 9 as the launch date for 
atlantis also grounded this summer by hydrogen leaks the shuttle 
was cleared for flight after a successful fueling test last week 
atlantis will carry into orbit a satellite that reportedly will 
spy on iraq the launch is scheduled for sometime between 630 pm 
and 1030 pm est the precise time will not be announced until 
nine minutes before liftoff because of the classified nature of the 
defense department mission 
a successful test on the repaired columbia would allow nasa to 
move ahead with plans for a december launch with the 150 million 
astro observatory that would enable nasa to close the year with 
six shuttle flights three fewer than planned 
ive been optimistic before and ive been disappointed so im 
trying to stay calm bascom murrah a nasa official in charge of 
columbias prelaunch operations said monday 
cameras and sensors were mounted in columbias engine 
compartment more monitoring equipment than for any other shuttle 
fueling test suspect joints were covered with plastic bags 
new hydrogen lines were installed a crushed seal was replaced 
and numerous joints were tightened to try to eliminate the leaks 
officials believe workers accidentally damaged components in the 
engine compartment while searching for contamination following the 
shuttles last flight in january

iraq said tuesday it will not hand over a british 
airways boeing 747 jetliner stranded at kuwait airport until the 
airline sends back iraqi airways engines it received for 
maintenance 
shipments like the one demanded by iraqi airways are barred 
under an embargo the united nations imposed to force iraq to 
withdraw from occupied kuwait 
apart from 15 kuwait airways planes captured by iraq the ba 
jumbo jet is the only foreign plane that has remained in iraqs 
hands since the invasion 
iraqi airways chairman noureddin saffi said the british aircraft 
cannot be released until ba releases iraqi airways engines under 
overhaul with ba 
the pilots and attendants of the british airways flight were 
trapped in kuwait when their plane was captured during the iraqi 
invasion aug 2 
but saffi said the staff is free to travel abroad 
saffis comments were contained in a letter to guenter eser 
head of the international air transport association which 
represents 200 member airlines 
the groups general assembly on monday demanded that iraq 
release immediately all passengers including those in transit 
airline employees and aircraft held as a result of the invasion

chrysler corp and the united auto 
workers union today agreed on a national contract for 63000 
workers in eight states 
uaw president owen bieber said the terms were similar to those 
of contracts with the nations two biggest automakers 
we have achieved a pattern settlement for our members here at 
chrysler bieber said after a private meeting with chrysler 
chairman lee iacocca 
bieber declined to discuss details of the pact before it is 
presented to union leaders and rankandfile members chrysler 
negotiator anthony st john also refused to disuss the contract 
there are elements in that agreement which are particularly 
helpful to chryslers case he said without elaborating 
the unions contract with chrysler expired sept 14 and an 
extension expired at midnight monday but the union urged its 
members at the no 3 automaker to stay on the job while talks 
continued through the night bieber and iacocca met this morning in 
iacoccas offices 
the uaw already had reached new contracts with general motors 
corp and ford motor co and said it hoped to take many of the same 
provisions to chrysler which was in more precarious financial 
shape and which reported a 214 million thirdquarter loss this 
week 
chrysler had said it might be unable to afford the gmford 
pattern agreement but the union wanted nothing less major issues 
that remained unresolved monday included job security health care 
and pensions 
the strategy of extending a contract then canceling the 
extension even while asking union members to report to work puzzled 
some uaw members some union workers said they were ready to strike 
if the talks dragged on 
but a source close to the bargaining who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a strike is just unthinkable the uaw last 
struck chrysler in 1985 
chrysler workers after hearing for months from their union 
leaders that they would settle for nothing less than the gmford 
agreement have been wearing buttons in past weeks reading 
pattern or pickets 
among the main features of the pattern contract are income 
guarantees for laidoff workers pension increases and no change in 
health care 
the last two items could cause chrysler the most problems 
chryslers ratio of nearly one retiree for every active worker is 
much higher than gms or fords 
consequently chryslers healthcare bill is higher than that of 
the other automakers the company said it spent about 684 million 
in health care last year 
in addition to michigan missouri and delaware chrysler has 
plants in alabama illinois indiana new york and ohio

moslem mosque on tuesday repeated his offer to resign if his party 
thought it would help contain the sectarian violence he made a 
similar offer monday 
hindu fundamentalists had said they would start construction 
tuesday on a temple to the god rama on the site occupied by the 
mosque the government said it would block any attempt to destroy 
the small onestory shrine and arrested 90000 supporters of the 
fundamentalist world hindu council in the past week 
on tuesday 10000 hindus stormed police barricades outside the 
disputed shrine police first used tear gas and bamboo canes to 
beat back the crowd 
then after several hours of clashes as the crowds pushed closer 
and closer to the mosque the police fired rifles 
reporters saw four bodies but a government spokesman in new 
delhi later said five people were killed witnesses said at least 
20 people were wounded 
sk gupta a doctor at a local hospital said 13 of the injured 
were in serious condition they have only 10 percent chances of 
survival he said 
thousands of young men wearing orange headbands the color of 
the hind faith broke through successive police cordons entered 
the small mosque pried bricks from the wall and chipped bits of 
plaster from its three domes they planted an orange flag on each 
dome before police chased them away 
many hindus said they were helped by policemen guarding the 
mosque which the fundamentalists say stands on the spot where rama 
was born most of the 20000 policemen on duty in ayodhya are 
hindus 
while the crowds rushed toward the mosque hindu holy men 
screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted police with stones 
at least four policemen were injured 
as news spread that the police barricades had been breached 
hundreds of hindus poured into the streets of ayodhya in defiance 
of the 4dayold curfew that had confined them to their homes many 
distributed candy and exploded firecrackers to shouts of jai siya 
rama victory to rama 
many policemen were seen entering the disputed shrine to pray 
the world hindu council said its success in penetrating police 
lines meant the temple project had begun 
in my 19 years of service i have never experienced such a 
sense of failure a senior government official at the site said 
on condition of anonymity it was a collapse of the 
administration 
later paramilitary troops cleared the shrine of intruders and 
threatened to open fire if any further attempts were made to breach 
the barricades 
the governments chief spokesman ramamohan rao said the mosque 
was not seriously damaged he spoke in new delhi 300 miles 
northwest of ayodhya 
in several towns hundreds of miles from ayodhya hindus and 
moslems fought street battles and police opened fire on rioting 
mobs in those incidents 25 were killed in street battles and the 
police firing while one hindu committed suicide in protest 
the army was called out in two towns in the western state of 
gujarat police in new delhi said the situation in the capital was 
tense and troops were alert for trouble 
prime minister singhs government lost its patchwork majority in 
parliament last week after the hindu bharatiya janata party 
withdrew support over the governments stand on the ayodhya 
dispute 
on tuesday singh offered to resign if his party felt that 
change of leadership will serve larger goals 
what is closest to my heart is that at this juncture the 
country be saved from communal flames singh said in a letter to 
his janata dal party president somappa rayappa bommai 
singh is scheduled to face a vote of confidence nov 7 
bharatiya janata has said it will oppose singhs continuing in 
office 
the congress party of former prime minister rajiv gandhi the 
largest group in parliament has made a similar announcement the 
congress and bharatiya janata together hold 281 seats a majority 
in the 522member parliament 
bharatiya janata says singhs policy on the dispute is aimed at 
garnering moslem votes the congress accused him of faulty 
administration that brought the hindumoslem dispute to a boil 
moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million people 
athough india is constitutionally a secular nation hindus comprise 
82 percent of the population and have always held the prime 
ministers post 
at least 900 people were killed in hindumoslem violence last 
year after the hindu group announced plans to replace the mosque 
with a temple

prime minister margaret thatcher isolated in the 
european community and sliding in opinion polls at home on tuesday 
defended her rejection of the european communitys leap toward 
monetary union 
in a rowdy parliament session opposition parties accused her of 
tantrum tactics being rude to the other leaders and 
undermining british influence at an ec summit in rome over the 
weekend 
in my view we have surrendered enough mrs thatcher told 
lawmakers what is the point of trying to get elected to 
parliament only to hand over your sterling and your powers to 
europe it is not our policy to have a single currency imposed 
on us 
the angry exchanges came when mrs thatcher reported to 
parliament on the rome meeting 
leaders of the other countries including powerful germany 
unexpectedly agreed to establish a joint central bank by jan 1 
1994 and a single currency possibly by the year 2000 
mrs thatcher argues that one currency infringes on national 
sovereignty by robbing governments of the right to set interest 
rates or run independent economic policies 
your tantrum tactics wont stop the process of change said 
neil kinnock leader of the main opposition labor party all they 
do is strand britain in some european second division 
labor also opposes a single european currency and kinnock 
directed his attacks mainly at her tactics and confrontational 
style 
paddy ashdown leader of the small centrist liberal democratic 
party the only british party that supports the idea of some kind 
of federal europe shouted at mrs thatcher you no longer speak 
for britain you speak for the past 
the divisive issue of britains role in europe has revived as 
the mrs thatcher slides deeper into trouble 
some worried legislators now say openly that mrs thatcher 
appears likely to lose the next election which must be held by 
mid1992 
two opinion polls by harris and by market and opinion research 
international published over the weekend showed labor surging to a 
16point lead over the conservatives compared with 7 to 10 points 
a month ago 
the deficit in poll ratings has persisted for 16 months and the 
economic troubles the main cause of the governments unpopularity 
show few signs of going away 
the confederation of british industry the main employers 
organization on tuesday issued its gloomiest report since britain 
plunged into recession in 1981 two years after mrs thatcher came 
to power half the 1500 companies surveyed by the organization 
reported falling orders and most said they had stopped hiring or 
were laying off staff 
mrs thatcher who has long fought lonely battles in the 
12member community attacked her neighbors particularly france 
and germany for failing to agree to cut farm subsidies while 
making commitments to grandiose plans for economic union and for 
closer political ties 
but she added when we come to negotiate on particular points 
rather than concepts or generalities i believe solutions will be 
found which will enable the community to go forward as 12

arrested after he and manila police chief col ernesto diokno 
appeared on television to discuss the strike which began last 
wednesday and was suspended friday

such attacks had not taken place during previous strikes 
on the day before the walkout unknown assailants killed the 
leader of a transport federation oscar lazaro who had refused to 
join the strike 
beltrans arrest was expected to increase tension between the 
aquino government and organized labor the government has said the 
strike was communistrun although the may first movement denies 
the claim 
beltran denied he was trying to overthrow the government and 
said his activities were a legitimate right of organized labor 
its up to them to file charges but they should have 
evidence beltran told reporters what is clear is we are 
exhausting all the avenues for a peaceful settlement of the 
issues

will resume talks next month on the future of the us military 
bases in the philippines president corazon aquino said tuesday 
speaking at a luncheon with foreign newsmen mrs aquino also 
said the philippines wanted to take over the giant clark air base 
north of manila next year

allow us military air transit and the continued use of crowe 
valley a livefire training range for us jets located at clark 
the subject will be among the matters taken up in the next round of 
talks she said 
the united states maintains clark subic bay naval base and four

1991 the philippine constitution requires a treaty to keep the 
facilities after 1991 
mrs aquino expressed hopes for a new relationship between 
the united states and the philippines not confined to the bases 
alone 
i think it is best that the philippines and the united states 
view each other not only in regard to the bases but more 
importantly on the overall relationship she said 
i for one am for retaining the friendship with the united 
states at the same time i would like for the united states 
government to realize that our goal is one of national 
sovereignty

she leaves for japan to attend the nov 12 enthronement ceremonies

pumpkin center has a convenience 
store general store and auto parts shop but nary a pumpkin patch 
henry braswell a 65yearold former pumpkin farmer said the 
walker county community hasnt had a pumpkin patch in about 45 
years pumpkins were grown in the late 1800s and early 1900s he 
said and that might have given the community its name 
braswell has another theory however 
a man who worked at his fathers lumber company wanted to start 
a baseball team and chose pumpkin center as the name of the team 
because of the numerous pumpkin patches at that time braswell 
said 
the community of 500 about 30 miles northwest of birmingham 
then took its name from the baseball team he said

american soldiers in saudi arabia are 
suffering normal morale problems but their spirits will rise when 
the pentagon announces plans in november for replacing them with 
fresh units a senior army official said tuesday 
gen gordon r sullivan the armys vice chief of staff said 
the service is taking numerous steps to improve morale including 
the possibility of leasing large cruise liners in the persian gulf 
to give soldiers a break from desert training 
its tough its not an easy mission for the more than 
100000 soldiers in saudi arabia as part of operation desert shield 
to defend the desert kingdom against a possible iraqi attack 
sullivan said in an interview in his pentagon office 
the fourstar general said the bush administration will announce 
within a couple of weeks its decision on when replacement forces 
would be sent to begin the rotation process he said the army had 
not been instructed to increase its total force in saudi arabia 
but that extra troops if needed likely would come from combat 
units at us bases in germany that are scheduled to be closed next 
year 
the army also could tap the remaining three armored divisions 
based in the united states 
on monday defense secretary dick cheney said that as many as 
100000 more forces beyond the roughly 240000 soldiers sailors 
airmen and marines already there might be sent to the gulf area 
he did not say when more forces would go 
sullivan said the full contingent of soldiers assigned to desert 
shield would be in place within a few days and a shipment of 
several hundred topoftheline m1a1 main battle tanks also is en 
route to saudi arabia from germany to replace older m1 tanks that 
are less capable of handling a chemical attack 
the biggest psychological lift for the troops some of whom have 
been in the saudi desert for two months will come when the bush 
administration announces a timetable for a rotation of fresh 
forces sullivan said 
the fourstar general said the army already has set in motion 
the arrangements for mobilizing the first fresh units from the 
united states and europe although no individual units have been 
alerted to begin moving to the gulf 
sullivan acknowledged that some soldiers are grousing about not 
knowing how long theyll be on duty in saudi arabia where living 
conditions on the front lines are harsh but he said he was 
satisfied that morale is not suffering unduly 
the troops are in pretty good shape and they are not 
experiencing what i consider to be inordinate morale problems he 
said i dont see it 
recent news reports based on interviews with soldiers and other 
servicemen in the gulf area have portrayed the troops as losing 
patience with the nagging uncertainty of when they might go home 
and whether theyll be required to fight 
earlier this month after complaining members of the armys 24th 
mechanized infantry division were quoted in the new york times the 
commanding general restricted access to reporters 
some private analysts say the tough conditions in the saudi 
desert should not be a reason for poor morale 
morale is a leadership problem said james a blackwell jr 
a former army commander of combat units and now a defense analyst 
at the center for strategic and international studies in 
washington good leaders will have good morale under the most 
distasteful and challenging circumstances 
sullivan said that rotating troops in saudi arabia is 
complicated by the fact that the army intends to replace whole 
units at a time not make piecemeal substitutions of individual 
soldiers he said this would be the first time in history the army 
has rotated whole units a strategy designed to avoid the loss of 
unit cohesion that army leaders saw during the vietnam war

the supreme court began scrutinizing a ban on 
abortion counseling at federally subsidized family planning clinics 
tuesday in arguments punctuated by pointed questions from new 
justice david h souter and fellow members 
souter voiced doubts about regulations that bar doctors and 
family planning counselors from discussing abortion even with women 
whose pregnancies are endangering their health 
you are telling us the physician cannot perform his usual 
professional responsibility souter told solicitor general 
kenneth starr the bush administrations top courtroom lawyer 
you are telling us the secretary of health and human services 
in effect may preclude professional speech 
starr conceding the ban tilts against abortion defended 
its validity 
although fueled by the continuing struggle over abortion the 
legal dispute over the regulations centers on freespeech rights 
the court must decide whether the regulations comply with a 1970 
federal law and if so whether they violate the constitution 
a decision is expected by july 
the argument is over information available to the 5 million 
lowincome women who depend on family planning clinics and similar 
health care providers 
last year some 4000 family planning clinics nationwide 
received about 140 million in federal assistance 
enforcement of the regulations issued by the reagan 
administration in 1988 has been blocked virtually everywhere by 
legal challenges 
none of the justices indicated any interest tuesday in using the 
case to alter the courts 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized 
abortion 
roe vs wade was not mentioned at all by starr or harvard law 
professor laurence tribe representing those who challenged the 
regulations 
this is strictly a first amendment argument tribe told the 
court 
four justices have criticized the 1973 ruling and the court 
last year gave states greater leeway to make abortions more 
difficult to obtain souter whose views on the issue are unknown 
is considered a pivotal vote for the future of legalized abortion 
souters comments to starr followed a series of questions in 
which the newest justice focused on a hypothetical case of a 
pregnant woman whose health is endangered by continuing her 
pregnancy 
starr said a woman if so diagnosed in a family planning clinic 
receiving federal assistance could be told about her health 
problem but should not be given any advice regarding abortion 
starr argued that the government in choosing how to spend 
taxpayer money may ban discussion of abortion as a family planning 
technique 
he said the 1988 regulations were sparked by a decision to keep 
the abortion controversy out of the family planning program 
but tribe said barring doctors from discussing all options 
betrays a basic trust between a physician and patient 
we depend upon our doctors to tell us the whole truth no 
matter who is paying the bill tribe said adding that many 
doctors believe it would be profoundly unethical to abide by 
the regulations 
justices byron r white and antonin scalia appeared skeptical 
about some points raised by tribes attack on the regulations 
justices sandra day oconnor and john paul stevens posed most of 
their questions to starr the governments lawyer justice anthony 
m kennedy also participated in the questioning but justices 
thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun listened in silence 
the family planning program was enacted in 1970 by congress as 
title x of the public health service act it pays for creating and 
operating family planning clinics 
the clinics always have been banned from using federal money to 
perform abortions but regulations until 1988 let the clinic staffs 
tell women about the abortion option and make referrals 
under the 1988 regulations a woman who visited a federally 
funded clinic and asked about abortion would have to be told the 
clinic staff does not consider abortion an appropriate method of 
family planning 
staff members then could offer help in obtaining prenatal care

israeli forces shot and killed a palestinian on 
tuesday after he stabbed a civilian security guard and another 
arab was killed during a clash in a refugee camp 
also tuesday one palestinian was killed and two were injured 
when a bomb they apparently were preparing went off in an 
ultraorthodox jewish suburb of tel aviv police said 
angry jews gathered in the market in bnei brak after the blast 
and demanded that arabs be barred from working in the community 
israels army radio reported 
the violence was the latest in a series of assaults by both 
arabs and jews following the oct 8 blood bath on the temple mount 
in jerusale police opened fire on palestinians on the mount after 
they had stoned worshipers at the western wall below twenty 
palestinians were killed and 140 wounded 
meanwhile the waqf the moslem religious council that oversees 
the holy site issued a report tuesday on the killings calling the 
incident the day of the martyrs 
the report accused israeli police and paramilitary border police 
of shooting intensively with live ammunition as if they were in 
a real war 
it blamed police for setting off the incident by firing tear gas 
at women worshipers outside a mosque without reason palestinians 
responded with stones and the police with gunfire it said 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs office responded to the waqf 
report by denouncing it as superficial onesided and 
nonobjective israel television reported 
several members of the moslem council participated in some of 
the incidents themselves and this reflects the degree of the 
reports credibility the office reportedly added 
two earlier reports released by palestinian and israeli human 
rights groups accused israeli police of indiscriminate fire on the 
mount and urged israel to seek nonlethal means of dealing with 
rioters 
a report by the israeli government last friday blamed 
palestinians stone throwers for setting off the rioting and said 
police fired live ammunition in selfdefense but it also blamed 
police commanders for being inadequately prepared 
defense minister moshe arens said meanwhile that the 
continuing violence could mean that israel will have to drop its 
1988 peace plan calling for elections among palestinians as a step 
toward negotiations 
arens told a parliamentary committee that it is difficult to 
see how free and democratic elections can be held in an 
atmosphere of violence according to his aide danny neveh 
one of the palestinian deaths tuesday came in the west bank city 
of nablus where an arab stabbed an israeli armed guard on a 
gasoline tanker truck the army said 
israel army radio said the guard was stabbed three times in the 
back and a plainclothes israeli security man who was passing shot 
the attacker to death the guard suffered moderate wounds 
three masked palestinians announced through a loudspeaker that 
the slain assailant identified as 18yearold haitham jamla was a 
member of islamic jihad a moslem fundamentalist group that was 
outlawed by israel on monday 
in neighboring tulkarem another palestinian was fatally shot by 
israeli troops as they chased a group of arab murder suspects who 
apparently refused orders to halt the army said 
three other arabs were wounded in other confrontations with 
stonethrowers that ended with a curfew on the camp 
the deaths brought to 768 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis in the 34month palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation in the territories 
an additional 292 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities 
fiftyone israelis have died in the violence 
in jerusalem meanwhile a policeman was slightly wounded when 
he was stabbed in the chest by an arab near the walled old city 
police said his assailant was arrested 
in the west bank the army demolished five palestinian homes 
including that of omar abu sirhan 19 who was arrested for the 
slaying of three israelis in jerusalem last week 
abu sirhans father lost an appeal to the israeli supreme court 
to have the home spared twentytwo members of the family lived in 
the threestory house in the village of ubbadiyeh 
israeli troops have demolished more than 300 houses in the 
34month uprising to punish antiisraeli activists the supreme 
court is known to have reversed only one army demolition order 
the four other houses demolished tuesday were in the town of 
sinjil north of jerusalem the army said a resident in each house 
was suspected of killing collaborators it said

drug traffickers threatened to execute 
seven journalists they are holding if the government launches a new 
offensive against them according to a statement sent to news 
organizations tuesday 
the statement bearing the letterhead the extraditables as 
the medellin cocaine cartel calls itself marked the first time the 
traffickers admitted holding the journalists kidnapped over the 
past two months 
the abductions are a response to the violation of our 
rights the statement said 
among the abducted reporters were francisco santos news editor 
of the countrys leading newspaper el tiempo and diana turbay 
daughter of former president julio cesar turbay 
the traffickers said they had learned of a government plot to 
kidnap family members of drug barrons presumably to swap them for 
the journalists 
if something of this nature happens our response will be 
immediate and we will execute the detained journalists the 
statement said 
in the statement the extraditables also said they would kill 
family members of officials participating in such a kidnapping 
operation 
they said they would attack political leaders who sponsor and 
support the criminal and genocidal police 
earlier this year the cartel was blamed for killing about 10 
percent of the police force in medellin colombias secondlargest 
city about 250 police officers died in the attacks 
since drug traffickers and the government declared war on each 
other in august 1989 the medellin cartel has killed about 550 
colombians in a long series of terrorist attacks authorities say 
their latest offense was kidnapping the seven journalists and 
marina montoya the sister of colombias ambassador to canada 
drug traffickers are apparently trying to force the government 
of president cesar gaviria to grant them a pardon they also want 
gaviria to end the government policy of extraditing accused drug 
traffickers to the united states 
tuesdays statement included the cartels now familiar motto 
we prefer a tomb in colombia to a jail cell in the united 
states 
three of the abducted santos montoya and turbay belong to 
families that wield tremendous political and economic power in 
colombia 
the extraditables said judicial police chief col oscar pelaez 
was responsible for all the massacres committed against innocent 
young people in the city of medellin 
they said pelaezs men killed luis gaviria a relative of the 
medellin cartels leader after torturing him for six hours in 
front of his family 
police said gaviria first cousin of cartel boss pablo escobar 
died in a shootout with security forces on oct 23 
gaviria who is not related to president gaviria had helped run 
the cartels cocaine smuggling operations as well as its terrorist 
network police said 
earlier tuesday a statement from two of the kidnapped 
journalists was read over national radio 
turbay and azucena lievano producer of tvs cripton news said 
they and four other abducted reporters were in good condition 
lievano said they needed a miracle our freedom 
the statement made no mention of santos kidnapped in a bloody 
shootout two and a half weeks after the other journalists

nelson mandela received a standing ovation in 
japans parliament on tuesday but the black south african leader 
did not get the financial aid he was seeking for his african 
national congress 
mandela said he was honored by the unusual chance for a 
foreigner who is not a head of state to address a joint 
parliamentary session 
in his 15minute speech mandela called the lifting of the state 
of emergency and other recent reforms in south africa a cause for 
optimism and encouragement but he said the anc was handicapped 
in trying to achieve an end to apartheid by its lack of resources 
the visitors gallery in the woodpaneled chamber was full as 
lawmakers listened to mandelas speech translated into japanese 
over earphones 
later mandela held a news conference at which he complained 
about japans contribution to the antiapartheid movement 
he said that of four countries he has visited on an asiapacific 
tour only japan has failed to pledge money to his african national 
congress the largest antiapartheid group in south africa 
mandela 72 said he had asked the japanese government to 
contribute 25 million to the anc to help it achieve stability and 
negotiate with the south african government for an end to 
apartheid 
the japanese government has disclosed that they have already 
spent 18 million toward assisting in improving the conditions of 
our people in south africa he said compared to aid from other 
nations the contribution of the japanese government is 
absolutely insignificant mandela said 
on monday prime minister toshiki kaifu told mandela that japan 
could not provide aid to the anc because of its policy of not 
giving assistance to political parties in other nations kaifu said 
his government would provide aid to grassroots south african 
groups however 
a foreign ministry official said japan has the political 
will to give money to the anc but has been looking for 
nongovernmental organizations through which to channel the funds 
we really have to establish some sort of framework through 
which we can expand our aid activities to the african national 
congress and we are about to start this kind of planmaking 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said 
he said japan had not been forewarned of mandelas 25 million 
request 
foreign ministry officials say they welcome recent reforms in 
south africa and suggest japan may lift some of its sanctions 
against pretoria in the area of personnel exchanges 
mandela called for all international sanctions to be retained 
until democracy is achieved we are not prepared to ask the 
international community for the removal of sanctions until we have 
the principle of one man one vote he said 
japan also bans private investment in south africa limits 
diplomatic ties to the consular level and prohibits imports of 
south african iron and steel 
asked about recent comments by japanese justice minister seiroku 
kajiyama who compared foreign prostitutes in japan to blacks in 
the united states saying both ruin the atmosphere of 
neighborhoods they enter mandela called himself an enemy of

fidel castros government has made no official 
contacts with any cuban exile groups in the united states that 
are pushing for democracy in the communist island nation a cuban 
government spokesman said tuesday 
jorge ruiz who is with the cuban interest section in 
washington dc made the comments in response to a report friday 
that quoted cuban vice president carlos rafael rodriguez as saying 
the government had opened talks with moderate cuban exiles who seek 
a peaceful change in government 
ruiz said rodriquezs comments were misinterpreted and no talks 
about government transition were in progress now not even with 
the more neutral group 
he only has words for the moderate group in terms of we 
could eventually sit down and talk to them ruiz said in a 
telephone interview 
but there wasnt even a suggestion it could happen in the near 
future the purpose of the interview the position of the 
government just meant to describe how rodriguez viewed the 
positions of the cuban exile community it was not meant to be an 
overture for possible talks ruiz said there are no official 
contacts now with any group 
obviously were ruling out any communication with most 
reactionaries he said referring to the longtime reactionaries 
and the more conservative young cubans who are pushing for 
government change now 
cuban foreign ministry spokesman hector argiles on monday denied 
the reports of contacts with any counterrevolutionary 
organization and said there has been no direct or indirect 
contacts with representatives of those organizations 
the miami herald story friday recounted an interview with 
rodriguez on havana radio in which he discussed the various exile 
groups in miami 
as rodriguez described it the three groups consist of a first 
group of reactionaries who sought castros violent downfall a 
second group of exiles interested in bringing about family 
reunification through increased travel and communication between 
the united states and cuba and a third group that wants a dialogue 
to peacefully replace castro 
in the interview rodriguez said we are increasing relations 
with the third group and then discussed the increasing travel 
between cuba and the united states 
the herald reported sunday that the rodriguez comments may have 
been misinterpreted largely because he misspoke when he 
referred to increasing relations with the third group and 
intended to refer to the second group wanting more travel and 
communications with cuba 
but the cuban government clearly stated this week that rodriguez 
was not discussing any contacts aimed at easing a transition to 
democracy in cuba 
when rodriguez comments were monitored in miami last week some 
exiles concluded that the cuban official had acknowledged the first 
formal political negotiations with exiles favoring a change of 
government in cuba

jim bakkers attorneys argued tuesday that 
the former televangelist received a 45year prison sentence for 
defrauding his followers because the judge was biased 
defense lawyers also argued at the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals that bakkers conviction on 24 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy should be overturned because of a faulty jury 
instruction 
the appeals court usually issues rulings within four to six 
months of hearing arguments 
the arguments focused on the sentence issued a year ago by us 
district judge robert potter of charlotte nc 
bakker founder of the ptl network is serving his term in a 
federal prison in rochester minn 
alan dershowitz a harvard university law professor assisting 
bakkers appeal said potter made an incredible departure from 
federal sentencing guidelines 
dershowitz said the guidelines that took effect in november 1987 
were intended to curb excessive sentences by judges like potter 
who has been dubbed maximum bob 
he said bakker would have received two to four years in prison 
had potter considered the guidelines 
dershowitz said if bakkers conviction is not overturned he 
should be resentenced by another judge 
we your honors will take our chances he said let the 
chips fall where they may 
deborah smith a us justice department lawyer who prosecuted 
the case said potter did not have to follow the guidelines because 
bakkers crimes took place before november 1987 
she said bakker will be eligible for parole after 10 years and 
could have received 12 years in prison without parole under the 
guidelines 
i dont think this is a case where there is a broad 
disparity she said 
dershowitz also said potter was influenced by his religious 
beliefs in sentencing bakker 
moments before sentencing the founder of the ptl empire potter 
said bakker had no thought whatever about his victims and those 
of us who do have a religion are ridiculed as being saps for 
moneygrubbing preachers or priests 
ms smith said those comments merely summarized the testimony 
about religious belief that pervaded the trial 
i dont think it at all reflects a personal bias on the part 
of the judge but rather a reflection of what went on in that 
courtroom she said 
in asking that the convictions be thrown out defense attorneys 
said bakker was a religious visionary who acted with good 
intentions 
they challenged an instruction to jurors that they could convict 
bakker if he deceived followers in raising money for ptl ventures 
don ervin a bakker attorney said there is a difference between 
deceiving and defrauding the followers 
you can intend to deceive but not intend to defraud ervin 
said it is not against the law in this context to deceive 
this is a very technical argument dancing on the head of a 
pin replied judge j harvie wilkinson iii who heard the case 
with judges j dickson phillips jr and john d butzner jr 
bakker was convicted for bilking followers of his television 
ministry who contributed more than 158 million three other former 
ptl officials also have been convicted

marines in the persian gulf began an 
amphibious assault training exercise tuesday that a pentagon source 
said will feature a landing of more than 10000 marines on a beach 
in oman 
the exercise scheduled to last 10 days is the second major 
marine practice of amphibious assault techniques that could be used 
in the event president bush ordered an offensive against iraqi 
forces in kuwait the first was conducted on an omani beach in 
september 
bob hall a pentagon spokesman said the exercise involves 
elements of the 4th marine expeditionary brigade and amphibious 
task group 2 which have been in the gulf as part of operation 
desert shield to defend saudi arabia against possible iraqi attack 
hall called the maneuver a routine amphibious training 
exercise designed to refamiliarize these forces with a desert 
environment he declined to specify the number of marines and 
ships involved 
a pentagon source speaking on condition he not be identified 
said 18 ships including marine corps amphibious vessels and navy 
warships will participate in the exercise which he said also will 
involve forces from allied gulf nations 
hall said 20 airplanes and 75 helicopters will be used in 
staging the beach assault 
the amphibious assault ship uss iwo jima was en route to the 
exercise area tuesday when a boiler pipe ruptured killing eight 
sailors and critically injuring two others 
hall said it had not been decided whether the 1100 marines 
aboard the iwo jima would participate in the beach assault exercise 
as planned

fulayyih alazmi peered from his 
tent one quiet starry night to behold a us marine corps tank 
clanking just beyond his goat pen 
my wife was afraid because it had no lights and she didnt 
know what it was he said through an interpreter 
i couldnt speak their language so i lit a lantern to let 
them know i was here he said inside his tent made of dark brown 
camel hide and burlap feed sacks so i dont move my herd at 
night any more 
alazmi is a bedouin one of the nomads of the saudi arabian 
desert he moves his 240 goats from pasture to pasture if the 
scrub that grows like sparse bristles on a brush can be considered 
grazing land he is guided by whim and weather without regard to 
political lines on a map 
but like other bedouin alazmi is migrating from the north to 
safer and less crowded southern lands because a 300000man force 
of american british french and arab armies has filled the sands 
with monstrous metal machines 
home on the range is now home on the firing range 
the forces gathered to counter iraqi president saddam husseins 
conquest of kuwait need room to maneuver and they also need miles 
of desert to practice firing their tanks artillery and rifles 
the military is sensitive to bedouin lifestyles and makes an 
effort to be safe but the army has killed one camel and wounded 
two others since it began live firing recently said lt col 
arnold laidig a marine officer 
the marines for example conduct sweeps with their helicopters 
to make sure no herds wander into their ranges they also patrol 
the ranges in trucks before the shells start flying over the 
tortured landscape 
it may look like crap to us but its kentucky blue grass to 
them said lt col bruce judge a marine operations and training 
officer 
safety is a paramount concern said marine capt william 
taylor a public affairs officer its like going into a farmers 
field and telling him wed like to bust some big caps in your 
backyard 
the clash of cultures is stark 
a bedouin tending his bleating livestock can see helicopters 
flitting through the skies armored columns rumbling across the 
terrain and endless convoys of military trucks on the roads 
on one night recently a patrol of three marine amphibious 
assault vehicles passed within 25 yards of a bedouin camp deep in 
the desert goats were visible through night vision goggles but 
the soldiers said they never saw the camp 
another night patrol picked up movement on its sensors but 
couldnt hear anything it turned out to be a herd of 20 camels 
passing by 
bedouin require lots of space to roam yet they say they welcome 
the troops in the desert 
i thank god the government is having people come to defend the 
kingdom alazmi said giving a visitor arabic coffee sweet tea 
and fresh dates while sitting on a rug in the shade of a tent flap 
saddam hussein should be punished he attacked people who did 
him no harm god will punish him he said 
although the bedouin life is rustic some have the luxuries of 
modern life such as mercedes benz cars and cellular telephones a 
camel can fetch 2500 at auction and thats a lot to lose to an 
errant artillery shell or a tank 
on the advice of saudi authorities another bedouin named 
abdullah rajab prepared his herd of 70 camels for a journey south 
and out of harms way 
some of the troops came and drank tea with me they were very 
nice rajab said 
as he spoke dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers from 
the british 7th desert rats armored brigade shook the ground as 
they rumbled past his livestock 
their tracks scarred a desert once trodden only by animals and 
herders 
but the military also does good deeds in the desert when hassan 
rashed alkhater of jubail the eastern saudi industrial city got 
his pickup truck stuck in the sand an army vehicle stopped to 
help 
i was waiting for 30 minutes for someone to help and a 
passing army vehicle pulled me out said alkhater who owns 150 
head of sheep and goats

the battle for the title home of the 
white squirrels is turning a little nutty 
marionville and olney ill both bill themselves as top spots 
for white squirrel spotting but marionville boasts it has far more 
than olney 
when olney central college biology instructor john stencel 
recently doubted that marionville has as many white squirrels as it 
claims squirrel supporters in this southwestern missouri community 
took offense 
i would welcome people from olney to come here to count our 
squirrels said insurance agent jim smart marionvilles leading 
white squirrel promoter 
stencel and several volunteers recently counted 127 white 
squirrels in olney down from last years 143 
marionville in 1989 claimed to be home to about 1000 of the 
white rodents or roughly half the number of people who live there 
its a lot of baloney stencel said its a publicity 
stunt theyre just trying to get attention theyve never taken a 
count so they dont have any official numbers 
the white squirrels in both towns are smaller than other 
squirrels and have white fur pink skin and pink eyes 
smart concedes the exact number of white squirrels living in the 
marionville area is not known 
no we have never taken an official count of white 
squirrels he said i would like to know how you take such a 
count its difficult to give much validity to a squirrel count

about 330000 farmers participating in the 
longterm conservation reserve program soon will be getting 16 
billion in rental payments for taking cropland from production 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday 
the payments are for the 1991 fiscal year that began oct 1 
yeutter said the departments agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service will notify county offices to begin payments 
immediately without any further delay 
during the recent budgetcutting maneuvers it appeared the 
payments would be delayed or even reduced but yeutter said full 
cash payments will be made to cover contracts signed to place 
cropland in the program during crop years 1986 through 1990 
under the program farmers agree to idle highly erodible 
cropland for 10 years in return the government helps pay the cost 
of establishing protect grass or trees and provides annual rental 
payments for the land taken from production 
the payments average nearly 50 per acre annually approximately 
339 million acres have been signed up in the program 
yeutters announcement was hailed by rep kika de la garza 
dtexas chairman of the house agriculture committee as good 
news for farmers who need to pay bills for this years operations 
and to make plans for next year 
de la garza said the conservation program continues to play a 
very important role in helping protect the environment

columbia passed an elaborate fueling 
test tuesday after months of work to fix dangerous hydrogen leaks 
and a jubilant nasa said the shuttle will be prepared for a 
december launch 
we ended up with a tight ship shuttle director bob crippen 
said as far as were concerned right now columbia is ready to 
go fly as soon just as we put it through its final launch preps 
it is the first time in five months all three spaceships are 
clear for flight atlantis was found to be free of hydrogen leaks 
during a fueling test last week it is scheduled to lift off nov 9 
with a satellite that reportedly will spy on iraq 
the next best thing to launching is passing the tanking 
test said launch director bob sieck 
sieck said nasas image is bound to improve now that the entire 
fleet is back in service discoverys flight earlier this month in 
fact started what looks to be an upward trend crippen said 
launching space shuttles and reputation they are tied 
together sieck said safely and successfully carrying out 
these missions which is our goal is only going to help the 
reputation and our cause to keep the program going 
during tuesdays threehour test columbias external tank was 
filled with more than 385000 gallons of liquid hydrogen to 
pinpoint any more of the dangerous leaks that have kept the shuttle 
grounded since may a small amount of hydrogen escaped into the 
engine compartment but was well within allowable limits 
it was nasas most extensive fueling test of a shuttle ten tv 
cameras and 17 sensors were mounted in columbias engine 
compartment the site of previous leakage 
the national aeronautics and space administration has tried four 
times to send columbia on an astronomy mission new fuel lines were 
installed following the first attempt but hydrogen later flooded 
the engine compartment 
following the last launch attempt in midseptember nasa formed 
an engineering investigative team to find the remaining leaks the 
nine investigators who worked seven days a week on the problem 
found a second crushed seal on a valve in columbias engine 
compartment and instructed workers to tighten numerous joints 
the results of all that work has paid off crippen said 
officials believe workers accidentally damaged components in 
columbias engine compartment while searching for contamination 
following the shuttles last flight in january 
i dont think the work was the problem there was just a lot 
of it crippen said any time you take your car down and do a 
complete engine overhaul sometimes when you put the thing back 
together you might anticipate a few problems 
nasa does not plan to conduct any more fueling tests on 
shuttles crippen said the agency is working to improve prelaunch 
checks of the shuttles main propulsion system so problems can be 
detected before fueling 
the leaks on columbia and atlantis were not found until the 
spaceships were fueled 
i find in this business it goes ups and downs crippen said 
well have other problems weve got to deal with theres plenty 
to work on at all times 
crippen said columbia could be launched in early december if 
preparations go well and atlantis goes up on time nasa likes to 
have at least three weeks between missions 
nasa announced tuesday that atlantis is scheduled to lift off 
sometime between 630 pm and 1030 pm est on nov 9 the 
precise time will not be announced until nine minutes before 
liftoff because of the classified nature of the defense department 
mission

the state department raised the possibility 
tuesday of opening an office in vietnam as part of the governments 
effort to obtain an accounting for the nearly 1700 missing 
american servicemen in that country 
the vietnamese rejected the idea when it was proposed earlier 
but the two sides have since agreed to an expansion of their 
cooperation on the issue 
two weeks ago during a visit by foreign minister nguyen co 
thach it was decided that a us technical team would be sent to 
hanoi to work with vietnamese military experts on improving 
procedures for locating the remains of the missing americans 
the state department said the us team could stay there for an 
indefinite period if the results justified such a presence 
the us government has never operated an office in hanoi since 
what was then north vietnam became independent in 1954

frenchmen returning from captivity in iraq said 
tuesday they were free to move around in their prison without 
bars but that americans were closely watched and not allowed to 
mix with other detainees 
denis a computer technician said that at baghdads rasheed 
hotel the anericanswere watched over much more than us 
they were only allowed to go out two hours a day he said 
we couldnt count them or approach them plainclothes police 
controlled everything 
denis 27 was one of 262 french citizens and 19 other 
foreigners who flew back into paris early tuesday after their 
release he asked that his full name not be used 
foreign ministry spokesman daniel bernard said french 
authorities will debrief the hostages held at strategic sites and 
inform allied governments what they have to say about their 
nationals held captive 
iraq has kept thousands of foreigners from leaving iraq and has 
sent hundreds of western men to strategic sites to deter an attack 
by the usdominated military forces massed in the persian gulf 
region 
about 1400 britons and 1000 americans are believed to be held 
in iraq and kuwait against their will 
two british women released with the french hostages said tuesday 
they had left behind 17 british men and two americans at a kuwaiti 
oil refinery wired with explosives 
we are concerned for the people left there wendy major said 
after arriving in london the iraqis have wired the refinery with 
explosives ready to blow up the lot if they want 
ms major 31 was taken to the camp aug 18 after being caught 
trying to escape to saudi arabia 16 days after iraq invaded kuwait 
saddam decided to release all french citizens last week in a 
move seen as an attempt to divide the international alliance 
against it 
french officials said 38 french citizens chose to remain in 
kuwait or iraq 
baghdad was a prison without bars denis said it was a 
part of my life i wont forget 
the freed hostages said the worst part was the isolation and 
lack of news 
our guards were always courteous but never gave us a bit of 
information said marc 25 who along with about 60 other 
frenchmen was shifted from one strategic site to another 
one day we were near a chemical factory another day at a 
petroleum refinery said marc who like most of the exhostages 
refused to give his last name our only links to the outside were 
the messages from our families on rfi radio france 
internationale 
some of the former hostages came from kuwait where they had 
eluded iraqi soldiers for almost three months 
claude 35 said he moved from house to house to avoid discovery 
by iraqi soldiers we never set foot outside for fear of being 
arrested he said 
he moved about with five other frenchmen usually at night so 
they wouldnt be caught 
we lived in permanent anguish without news asking ourselves 
what would happen to us the next day he said 
iraqi soldiers caught up with jacky mongin 40 on aug 19 at 
the hotel in kuwait where he worked he was taken to a university 
where he spent 10 weeks with seven britons 
often we had nothing to eat but bread rice and water he 
said it was only in the last week that our guards brought us a 
television and i found out i was going to be freed unfortunately 
my companions stayed behind 
gerard vilate of nancy a decorator and 20year resident of 
kuwait said we didnt always get enough to eat and i lost 10 
kilos 22 pounds 
at least one frenchman a 23yearold electrician named 
christophe stayed behind as a gesture of solidarity with the 
remaining hostages his family said 
we are still in shock but im not terribly surprised because 
he was always outraged by injustice his sister said 
christophes family was told by the foreign ministry monday that 
he was staying because he believed the french should not leave 
without the other hostages his sister said 
denis the computer worker said the hostages hadnt suffered 
from the global trade embargo against iraq his last dinner at the 
rasheed hotel consisted of salmon lobster and thick steak ive 
never seen such a feast he said

amnesty international on tuesday appealed for an 
impartial inquiry into killings torture and kidnappings during 
namibias war of independence 
the human rights group said it was at least the third time it 
had asked for an investigation it renewed the appeal because of 
the namibian governments oct 23 announcement it was appointing 
solomon hawala as army chief 
hawala was accused of torturing and killing prisoners in swapo 
base camps in angola during the war the amnesty statement said 
at the very least the government should ensure that those 
responsible for past human rights abuses are not placed in 
positions where they could have control or authority over 
prisoners the organization said 
namibia became independent march 21 after 75 years of south 
african rule swapo a mainly black nationalist movement that waged 
a 23year bush war won a plurality of the vote in a 
unsupervised election in november 1989 
both sides in the conflict the south african security forces 
and the south west african peoples organization were responsible 
for such abuses before namibia became independent earlier this 
year the rights organization said 
at least 350 people imprisoned by swapo in angola are still 
unaccounted for amnesty said 
around 60 people were reported missing while in the custody of 
the south african security forces but this is just the tip of 
the iceberg said an amnesty spokeswoman speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
in june this year the swapodominated namibian government set up 
an allparty parliamentary committee to study rights abuses 
but the committee is not known to have considered the matter 
in detail amnesty said 
some prisoners freed from swapo bases in angola said hundreds of 
swapo members were accused of being south african spies and many 
were tortured until they signed confessions 
swapo leaders have confirmed incidents of torture but they 
blame many of the abuses during the war on a sincedisbanded south 
africalinked paramilitary unit known as koevoet the afrikaans 
word for crowbar

bandits tuesday the islamic republic news agency reported 
the state news agency monitored in nicosia said three afghans

iran has hanged more than 1500 people most of them on alleged 
drug trafficking charges and imprisoned over 50000 socalled drug 
addicts since december 1988 
iranian opposition groups and other independent human rights 
organizations maintain the killings are a cover for liquidating 
government opponents 
other observers believe iran would have few qualms about 
admitting it was liquidating its opponents in the past irans 
staterun media have reported executions of spies and other 
opponents 
irans draconian laws call for a mandatory death sentence for 
possession of even small quantities of drugs 
according to official figures some 1 million iranians are 
involved in drug abuse but other independent sources say addicts 
number twice that figure 
united nations envoy reynaldo galindo pohl who visited iran 
earlier this month to investigate rights abuses there said he was 
satisfied with iranian due process 
iranian judicial officials have constantly called on judges 
nationwide to expedite cases as soon as possible and to pass the 
stiffest possible sentences

connecticut party candidate lowell p 
weicker jr is ahead in the polls prompting concern that democrats 
could lose their status as a major party in state politics 
a littleknown state law stipulates that to qualify as a major 
party with the ability to get state financing for primary 
elections they must get at least 20 percent of the vote in each 
gubernatorial election 
this year public opinion polls have consistently shown the 
democratic gubernatorial candidate bruce a morrison enjoying the 
support of less than 20 percent of the electorate a poll last week 
had him at 12 percent 
the republican john g rowland has been in the 2434 percent 
range 
support for weicker a former republican us senator who 
created the connecticut party for his independent bid for governor 
has fluctuated between the 30s and 40s the higher numbers coming 
in early polls 
state gop chairman richard foley would love to see the democrats 
embarrassed this year but says hes found that democrats always 
come home in most cases its easier to change a democrats 
religion than his party affiliation 
state democratic chairman john f droney jr said the 20 percent 
law should be a wakeup call to democrats who for whatever 
reasons have been toying with voting for one of the two 
republicans 
but droney said theres as much chance of bruce morrison 
falling below 20 percent as lowell weicker getting a reputation as 
a man of principle and character i just dont see it 
if weicker does win that means the connecticut party will be 
listed at the top of the ballot in 1994

the supreme court heard arguments tuesday in a 
tax case that could force georgia to refund more than 30 million 
collected from outoutstate distillers under a levy later struck 
down as unconstitutional 
the case has drawn wide attention from state and local officials 
nationwide because it addresses when states may be required to 
refund taxes collected under laws later invalidated by court 
rulings 
thirtyone states national organizations representing 
governors cities counties state legislatures and mayors have 
intervened in support of georgias position 
cases such as the one now before this court will have a major 
fiscal effect on the states virginia attorney general mary sue 
terry argued in a statement filed in behalf of 16 states 
this courts decisions will affect transfers of public funds 
running into the billions of dollars she said and the 
practical result of such redistributions will be felt primarily by 
the taxpayers and citizens who are the beneficiaries of state 
services 
morton siegel a lawyer for jim beam distilling co told the 
justices the company was denied a 24 million tax refund by 
georgia even though the state supreme court ruled that the law 
under which the taxes were collected in 1982 1983 and 1983 was 
unconstitutional 
the law levied excise taxes on alcoholic beverages imported into 
georgia at twice the rate of those manufactured in state it was 
amended by the legislature in 1985 after the supreme court struck 
down a similar scheme in hawaii as an unconstitutional infringement 
on interstate commerce 
jim beam sued georgia and a state judge ruled georgias law 
unconstitutional but the judge refused to grant a refund despite 
a state law requiring refunds of any and all taxes illegally 
assessed or collected 
two other distillers have since filed identical suits seeking a 
total of 28 million in refunds 
assistant georgia attorney general amelia baker argued that the 
distillers are not entitled to refunds because the state collected 
the taxes under a longstanding law which the state had no reason 
to believe would be invalidated before the hawaii case 
she also said requiring georgia to refund 30 million would 
create a severe financial burden and would force cuts in other 
valid government programs

us ambassador thomas r pickering says 
the security council might order the seizure of iraqs frozen 
assets in its next attempt to force baghdad from kuwait 
pickering who on thursday takes over the council as chairman 
also pledges that washington will take any steps necessary to 
protect us citizens pickering argued for the american right to 
protect its citizens overseas nearly a year ago when he defended 
the us invasion of panama 
as president bush dispatches 100000 more troops to the persian 
gulf pickering will have a golden opportunity to push the us 
diplomatic agenda in the security council 
pickering becomes chairman of the council for the month of 
november under the alphabetic rotation the body uses to determine 
its leader 
in december the ambassador of yemen the only arab council 
member and the most overtly proiraqi delegate takes over 
you can see that there will be action in the next few weeks 
or not for a long time a western diplomat said tuesday speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait the security council has 
slapped a trade embargo on iraq and occupied kuwait extended it to 
include air cargo service and given permission to naval powers in 
the gulf to halt shipping suspected of violating the embargo 
on monday the security council voted to hold iraq liable for 
human rights abuses and damages during its occupation of kuwait 
and it warned of unspecified further action if iraq defies the 
council 
pickering delivered a warning of possible independent us 
action saying it is the solemn duty of every state to protect 
its citizens 
i want to underscore one point the united states will do 
that which is necessary to meet its obligation to its own 
citizens 
when the united states invaded panama to oust gen manuel 
noriega pickering used selfdefense as one factor to support the 
intervention 
several us citizens had been menaced and attacked in the weeks 
before the december 1989 invasion and one was killed at a 
roadblock by guards 
pickering said the un charter allowed nations the right of 
individual or collective selfdefense and said a country could use 
military force against another to protect its nationals 
pickering also indicated the united nations might try to seize 
iraqi assets iraq is liable for full restitution or compensation 
for the losses and damages it has caused by its illegal invasion 
and occupation of kuwait 
we anticipate the council will address this question more 
fully in the days ahead he said 
iraqs 4 billion in overseas assets of which about 800 
million is in the united states would not go far in offsetting the 
losses other countries have suffered 
jordan alone estimates its economic losses because of the 
invasion and embargo at 2 billion 
the frozen assets would help rebuild kuwait if its government 
ever is restored after an iraqi withdrawal 
mondays resolution also invited nations to compile lists of war 
crimes committed by the iraqis against kuwaitis and other 
foreigners 
the council has been acting under chapter 7 of the charter 
which provides for security council sanctions and eventually 
collective military action against member states that threaten 
international peace and security 
the council has not yet exhausted its nonmilitary provisions 
which include interruption of economic relations and of rail sea 
air and communications links 
article 42 the next step envisioned by some members calls for 
such action by air sea or land forces as may be necessary to 
maintain or restore international peace and security including 
demonstrations blockade and other operations by air sea or land 
forces of members of the united nations

a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that 
trainers of tennessee walking horses may use lightweight 
arrangements of chains and rollers to produce the characteristic 
highstepping gait of the breed 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia unanimously upheld the agriculture 
departments regulations permitting the use of the chains called 
action devices if the assembly weighs six ounces or less the 
devices had been the object of a lawsuit by an animal protection 
group 
in june the american horse protection association obtained a 
lower court ruling that the departments regulations allowing the 
lightweight chains and rollers had been adopted in an arbitrary 
manner 
the group contended that the action devices encourage trainers 
to use illegal chemicals that cause the horses to develop sores on 
the back of the foreleg 
it argued that the devices used in conjunction with chemicals 
would cause pain that encourages the horses to walk in the 
characteristic highstepping gait of the tennessee walking horse 
but the department countered that 99 percent of horses examined 
by its veterinarians did not exhibit sores even though they wore 
the sixounce braceletlike assembly which the horse trainers say 
tries to step out of 
the appeals court held that the agriculture secretary was not 
under an express duty to prohibit any practice however safe by 
itself that might indirectly cause or perpetuate abuses already 
separately prohibited by the regulations 
if such were the duty the secretary might have to eliminate 
horse show rings entirely because they perpetuate the practice of 
soring the court said in an opinion by circuit judge abner 
mikva 
the ruling overturned an opinion by us district judge oliver 
gasch who had set aside the regulations allowing sixounce action 
devices gasch had ordered the department to consider banning them 
altogether 
gaschs order had been stayed pending the governments appeal 
mikva was joined in the ruling by circuit judges harry edwards 
and laurence silberman

centerright coalition that split over talks with the european 
community 
we have concluded that it is possible to assume the task of 
ruling said ms brundtland after telling crown prince harald 
norways acting monarch that her party was willing to form a 
minority government 
jo benkow president of parliament polled the national 
assemblys six parties then advised harald that the majority 
favored ms brundtland to succeed the conservativeled coalition 
that forced her from office a year ago 
ms brundtland would not say when the new government would take 
over but news reports said it would be ready by friday 
we are the biggest party in parliament and will follow the 
same line we have in the past which is in keeping with our 
political philosophy said ms brundtland

key issues including the environment child care economic policy 
and the distribution of wealth according to socialist tradition 
labor has only 67 seats in the 165seat parliament but ms 
brundtland said there was sufficient support from other parties to 
let her govern 
ms brundtland was asked to lead the country because a 
threeparty coalition led by conservative prime minister jan p 
syse resigned monday 
the coalition split over what policy to pursue in negotiations 
between the european economic community and the european free trade 
association about forming a joint 18nation trade bloc after 1992 
the center party backed by the countrys subsidized farmers 
had refused to remain in a coalition or support a conservative 
singleparty government because of syses support for the ec 
norway is a member of the european free trade association but 
the conservatives want to eventually join the ec 
center refused changes demanded by the ec in norwegian laws 
protecting domestic resources and industry syse resigned and said 
he could not lead a government that was divided on important 
international negotiations 
ms brundtland also supports a strong agreement with the 
community but said center was free to pursue its own 
antimembership efforts 
one newspaper described ms brundtlands return to office as 
calling mother gro to clean up in the difficult political 
situation parliament is nearly deadlocked and there is no 
constitutional provision for calling elections for three more 
years 
ms brundtland a 51yearold physician harvardeducated public 
health specialist and grandmother is known as a tough veteran 
politician she became norways youngest and first woman prime 
minister in 1981 in a term that lasted seven months 
she also led the government from may 1986 until syses coalition 
forced her to resign in october 1989 
ms brundtland is bestknown abroad as a champion of the 
environment she headed the un commission that published our 
common future a 1987 textbook of environmental concerns 
labors first test may come in dealing with a 1991 national 
budget including tax reductions for higher income families which 
the former coalition parties drafted and still favor 
that cannot be the starting point for our government said 
brundtland about the budget proposals 
center parliaments smallest party thwarted syses attempt to 
form a singleparty conservative government by declaring its 
preference for ms brundtland 
after the sept 11 1989 national election the conservativeled 
bloc controlled 84 seats and the socialists had 81 seats in 
parliament 
centers 11 votes now swing the parliamentary balance in favor

years won sundays balloting with 8167 percent of votes in the 
countrys first contested presidential election

at the polls since a wave of protests and rioting for democracy 
began sweeping subsaharan africa this year

supreme court election results remain unofficial until they are 
declared by the court an announcement expected next week the 
court appointed by houphouetboigny also hears appeals about

president bush on tuesday launched a 
blistering partisan attack on arrogant democrats in a maneuver 
designed to rally republican forces for next weeks midterm 
elections 
addressing a group of gop workers bush alternately portrayed 
democrats as clumsy bumbling uncaring toward the nations 
children unresponsive and irresponsible and an arrogant 
majority 
house majority leader richard gephardt said the country needs a 
leader who acts like a president rather than a president who 
acts like a party chairman 
when he talks about giving americans a better deal lets be 
clear about what he really means a better deal for the rich a raw 
deal for the elderly and a raw deal for the middle class said 
gephardt 
gephardt said bush seeks to take this misleading message to 
the campaign trail to elect a republican congress something which 
working families and elderly americans should deeply fear 
bush began the day on a bipartisan note briefing both 
democratic and republican leaders on his persian gulf strategy at a 
morning session at the white house but by the afternoon he was 
again beating political drums 
there are two things you should never watch being made 
sausage and laws bush said repeating an old saw as for the 
democrats in congress this year weve all been taken on a 
firstclass tour of the hot dog factory 
standing on a stage with a majority of his cabinet behind him 
bush told about 500 party workers at a hotel rally assembled by the 
republican national committee their rhetoric is wrong and their 
purpose is wrong and were not going to let them get away with 
it 
the crowd included party workers from the national committee and 
from congressional gop committees whom bush termed the faithful 
those who are standing there getting the job done day in and day 
out 
one party worker conspicuously absent was ed rollins 
cochairman of the national republican congressional campaign 
committee whom the white house has been trying so far 
unsuccessfully to have fired 
rollins memo to house republicans saying it was ok to distance 
themselves from the president on tax issues raised the presidents 
ire 
gary koops a spokesman for the gop congressional committee 
said rollins was too busy analyzing new campaign polling data to 
attend 
bushs scalding campaign speech was in keeping with the highly 
partisan tone he set on his justconcluded fourday campaign swing 
to the west 
bush was to attend a rally for a gop congressional candidate in 
the washington suburbs wednesday then begin a crosscountry trek 
thursday that will keep him on the campaign trail through election 
day 
the president called democrats an arrogant majority that uses 
its power to protect its own prerogatives its own privileges its 
own pet projects and it is time that american people say enough 
is enough no more 
he accused them of a distortion of republican motives goals 
and accomplishments and of a clumsy explanation of their 
proposal to delay tax indexing for one year 
bush apologized anew for supporting a deficitreduction package 
containing some 140 billion in new taxes over the year again 
sounding the theme that he was forced into it by democrats 
there was a ransom and that ransom was taxes he said 
but he said he reluctantly agreed to the plan because i just 
simply could not bring myself to leave americas children an 
avalanche of unpaid bills 
after condemning the fact that the democrats forced him into 
accepting the new taxes part of the plan bush said the overall 
492 billion deficitcutting package was long overdue and in my 
view it is essential

an abandoned well where death 
squads dumped their victims was discovered in a slum called 
shangrila a police official said tuesday 
an official with a special commission that investigates death 
squad activities said the grave was found saturday after police 
arrested six suspected killers the official asked not to be named 
for security reasons 
he said no bodies had yet been retrieved from the site on the 
outskirts of nova iguacu a city about 20 miles outside of rio it 
isnt clear how many victims were left there the official said 
press reports said there were about 100 bodies buried in the 
grave eduardo gomes a church worker in the region confirmed the 
press account 
most are almost certainly teenagers killed by death squads 
he said in a phone interview in which he said that clothing and 
shoes uncovered from the grave indicated most of the corpses were 
those of youngsters 
but the special commission official denied any of the victims 
had been exhumed and suggested the reports were exaggerated 
its all speculation he said 
the death squads consist largely of active and offduty police 
officers who make extra money by killing petty thieves at the 
behest of shopkeepers and others many of the victims are poor 
minors involved in the drug trade and smallscale theft 
death squads operate in many areas of rio but are notorious for 
their activities in nova iguacu and other cities of the baixada 
fluminense a sprawling lowlands area west of rio 
the ap late tuesday visited rios 54th precinct which normally 
handles investigations in the area where the grave was found 
police chief celso bezerra said the case was being handled by the 
special commission and he could not provide details 
bezerra did confirm the area where the grave is located had been 
used as a dump by death squads but he expressed skepticism that 
large numbers of bodies would be uncovered 
the ap also went to the shangrila neighborhood an impoverished 
area crisscrossed by dirt roads dotted with small bare brick 
homes no one could be found who was eager to talk about 
clandestine graveyards 
homicide investigator walter codong dos reis said the grave was 
in an extremely dangerous area he said he would only send 
detectives there if they were armed with machine guns 
residents of areas where death squads operate rarely speak to 
police or outsiders for fear of retribution codong dos reis 
said

in a novel combination government researchers 
and a major health insurer are sponsoring experiments to test the 
effectiveness of bone marrow transplants as a treatment for breast 
cancer 
the clinical trials will try to determine whether the 
complicated procedure offers hope for women with earlystage breast 
cancer who are at high risk for recurrence and women in advanced 
stages of the disease 
we want to help women with breast cancer but these therapies 
are very toxic very expensive and very difficult and you dont 
want to expose women to these therapies unless youre confident 
theres a good chance youll help them dr michael friedman 
director of cancer therapy evaluation at the national cancer 
institute said tuesday 
the procedure called autologous bone marrow transplantation is 
considered effective treatment for certain forms of leukemia and 
lymphoma and some other diseases and health insurers usually cover 
it in these cases 
but most health insurers including blue cross and blue shield 
plans dont cover the procedure for women with breast cancer 
because they consider it experimental treatment that has not been 
shown to be effective 
yet some physicians are recommending it and some patients have 
taken their insurance companies to court to force them to cover the 
procedure which can cost from 75000 to 150000 
many of our plans have had to debate the issue in court which 
we do not believe is the appropriate setting for medical 
policymaking said douglas peters senior vice president of the 
blue cross and blue shield association the nations largest 
private health insurer 
by funding some of the clinical care costs associated with the 
nci trials were able to provide access to this treatment while 
contributing to the search for a definitive answer to the question 
of whether or not it works he said 
at least 15 blue cross and blue shield plans are expected to 
participate in helping to finance the clinical trials by providing 
funds for care of patients it marks the first time a health 
insurer has joined the government in sponsoring medical 
experiments 
in an autologous bone marrow transplant some of a patients 
bone marrow is removed and stored while they undergo high doses of 
chemotherapy to kill their cancer after chemotherapy their stored 
bone marrow is put back in 
the bone marrow is the source of blood cells both the 
oxygencarrying red cells and important cells of the immune system 
that fights foreign bodies storing marrow shields it from the 
toxic effects of the chemotherapy enabling the marrow to recover 
its function when the stored marrow is returned to the body 
about 1200 women are expected to participate in the trials 
which are expected to last two to four years 
half of the women in the trials will be given conventional 
treatment and the other half will be given bone marrow transplants 
friedman said 
aside from whether the transplant is effective this may teach 
us some very valuable things friedman said 
were going to be confronted in the future with new complex 
expensive technologies he said if we learn how to evaluate 
this particular situation it may have implications as to how we 
face other scientific and economic problems

rep don sundquist a savvy fourterm 
republican from tennessee is challenging veteran michigan rep guy 
vander jagt for the chairmanship of the house gop campaign 
organization sources said tuesday 
sundquist began making a flurry of telephone calls and personal 
contacts in the final hours before congress adjourned this weekend 
to amass support for his bid to unseat vander jagt who has what 
many see as a lackluster record in the post 
but sundquists challenge also appeared to be exacerbating 
splits among house republicans who are deeply divided over how 
best to conduct themselves as the minority party in the chamber 
one republican staff source speaking only on condition of 
anonymity said the challenge is opposed by rep newt gingrich of 
georgia the no 2 gop leader in the house gingrich views 
sundquists bid just a week before the nov 6 elections as a 
damaging distraction to the campaign arm the national republican 
congressional committee 
there will be plenty of time after nov 6 for whatever 
fighting theres going to be the aide said if they do this 
now we may lose our focus before election day 
sundquist spokesman ralph perrey acknowledged that his boss had 
discussed running against vander jagt with colleagues but added he 
would make no formal announcement until after the elections 
mr sundquist has a background as a manager of campaigns a 
grassroots organizer and one who can recruit and develop 
candidates perrey said many believe those are precisely the 
skills needed at the nrcc now 
sundquist managed former sen howard bakers unsuccessful 
presidential campaign in 1979 and 1980 he said a significant 
number of people are urging him to get into the race he added 
another senior republican house source said gingrich and his 
ally rep vin weber rminn already are heavily involved in the 
operations of the nrcc which provides campaign cash advice and 
technology to republican candidates 
two sources suggested that vander jagt may be considering 
stepping down from the post which he has held for 15 years 
republicans have failed to make substantial gains in the house 
during that time and have been slipping in recent years there has 
not been a gop majority in the house since the 1950s and that is a 
source of tension for the party 
if vander jagt does so weber may consider running against 
sundquist for the campaign post one source said

boiler rooms that power the uss iwo jima and 
other navy ships are potentially hazardous workplaces but no more 
so than the factory floor of a foundry or a steel mill an engineer 
said tuesday 
a boiler pipe ruptured tuesday aboard the amphibious assault 
ship iwo jima releasing superheated steam that killed 10 sailors 
in the worst navy accident during the persian gulf crisis 
the steam plant like any other mature technology is 
dangerous for the operator said a sydney roberts a professor 
of mechanical engineering at old dominion university 
its a common industrial hazard he said an industrial 
workplace is not safe in relative terms 
lt gordon hume a spokesman for the atlantic fleet in norfolk 
agreed that any time you are working around high temperatures and 
high pressures you want to be very careful 
hume said the iwo jima would have been operating with steam 
temperatures of more than 800 degrees and pressure higher than 600 
pounds per square inch 
hume who is trained in engineering said the navy uses three 
basic methods to power its ships steam diesel and gas turbine 
diesel engines are used on the smallest naval vessels and many 
destroyers and cruisers are being built with gas turbine power 
plants much like jet engines hume said 
larger ships use steam in the iwo jima water is heated in two 
boilers to make the steam which is piped through a turbine that 
turns the propeller 
we certainly train our people extensively to combat the 
potential dangers of steam hume said 
because older technologies such as steam are well understood 
the plants can be designed with safety in mind but all the design 
in the world cannot protect the worker from human error or faulty 
equipment roberts said 
with high temperatures and high pressures you have lots of 
problems roberts said seals can fail bolts can fail several 
years ago at the nuclear power plant in surry they had a pipe 
fail 
in december 1986 steam eroded and ruptured a section of an 
elbow joint at the plant killing four workers the accident 
occurred outside the plants nuclear reactor and no radiation was 
released 
you face many of the same hazards if you work on the floor of 
the foundry or at a steel mill roberts said

the military is expanding its role in the drug war 
despite the drain of the persian gulf buildup and 500 billion in 
federal budget cuts top interdiction officials said tuesday 
army navy and coast guard officers working with civilian 
agencies to stop drugs at borders said their effort has forced 
smugglers to change routes and methods 
smugglers are shifting operations away from sea routes through 
the caribbean to overland routes through mexico said customs 
service commissioner carol hallett who heads the joint border 
interdiction committee 
we certainly believe that we have the drug traffickers on the 
run she said we know that we have made it more difficult for 
them to operate weve made it more dangerous and certainly weve 
made it more expensive 
a massive deficitcutting bill aimed at reducing government 
spending by 500 billion over the next five years has left 
drugfighting agencies untouched ms hallett said 
the us deployment to saudi arabia hasnt prevented the 
military from increasing its profile in the drug war said maj 
gen arnold schlossberg jr 
the department of defense has a lot of assets and in spite of 
the fact were in desert shield weve enhanced our operations here 
in this area and in the eastern pacific he said 
for example the navy sharply increased the number of aircraft 
days dedicated to spotting drug traffickers in the atlantic and 
caribbean region from 600 in september 1989 to 3000 last month 
said rear adm robert spane 
the amount of drugs seized in the customs services southeast 
region which includes florida was up this year by about 7 tons 
from last year to 77000 pounds as the interdiction effort goes 
farther into the caribbean ms hallett said 
the agencys southeast region also includes georgia the 
carolinas virginia and washington dc 
although the region including florida continues to account for 
about half the nations drug seizures the joint interdiction 
effort helped force about 70 percent of drug trafficking onto 
overland mexican routes ms hallett said 
the colombian drug cartels continue to operate but the 
crackdown in that nation has shifted some cocagrowing operations 
to bolivia and other nations others on the interdiction committee 
said 
schlossberg cautioned that none of the interdiction officials 
believe they have a silver bullet that will stop drug 
smuggling 
the interdiction program is only one part of a larger drug 
strategy 
our job is to keep the pressure on until programs aimed at 
decreasing drug demand can take effect said rear adm robert 
kramek commander of the coast guards seventh district

liberians are dying like flies 
because rice shipments sent by the united states and france are 
being unloaded too slowly in liberias capital a belgian official 
said tuesday 
hunger is acute and people are so undernourished that rice is 
not enough milk fish meat and cooking oil are needed said dr 
pieter rykelhykhuizen of the belgian branch of doctors without 
borders 
rykelhykhuizen who came to freetown from monrovia on monday 
night aboard a us marine helicopter said the security situation 
in monrovia was good but that remnants of does army were 
harassing relief workers 
he said doctors without borders is the only relief agency still 
operating in liberia but karen donovan a spokeswoman for catholic 
relief services said the baltimorebased agency also had people 
working there 
rykelykhuizen said other relief agencies had sent people only to 
assess the situation relief workers and not assessment teams are 
needed as people are dying like flies daily because of the food 
problem he said in an interview 
donovan said her relief agency was helping to unload us rice 
sent to the country she said there were five members of the agency 
in buchanan liberias second biggest city and one in monrovia 
the united states sent 1930 tons of rice to monrovia aboard a 
ship chartered by the french government rykelykhuizen said a barge 
hired by the un world food program to carry 600 tons of rice also 
was there 
they arrived on thursday but the food still was being unloaded 
rykelykhuizen said 
the french embassy in abidjan ivory coast said technical 
problems are slowing down the offloading 
claude demiautte the embassys shipping officer said security 
precautions were partly to blame hungry people and soldiers have 
looted most food supplies in monrovia people are trying to survive 
eating leaves 
liberia has been devastated by a 10monthold civil war in which 
three warring sides have killed more than 5000 civilians a 
breakaway rebel faction and soldiers loyal to slain president 
samuel doe have agreed to a ceasefire 
a fivenation west african army sent to stop the killing is 
fighting outside the capital against another rebel faction led by

roman catholic bishops 
delivered an unusually strong attack tuesday saying the government 
needed to give dominicans a little hope to help them through 
the economic crisis 
prices for food and gasoline have skyrocketed in recent months 
leading to long lines and shortages after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait in august the government had to cut its oil imports and 
triple oil prices blackouts leave this island country without 
electricity for up to 18 hours a day 
precise energetic and efficient measures are required to 
combat shortages of goods that should be accessible to common 
people but have disappeared from the shelves the church 
communique said 
the almost permanent darkness that covers the dominican 
territory not only irritates but turns gloomier our already 
desperate situation the statement said 
it implied that a lack of leadership was aggravating this 
caribbean nations ills 
we believe the government should begin by offering an example 
of coordination coherence honesty and discipline that compels the 
citizenry to do its share said the church communique 
a few measures like this would give citizens a little hope 
and return to the government its lost credibility it said 
the church has been generally supportive of president joaquin 
balaguers conservative administration the 84yearold blind 
leader was narrowly reelected to his second fouryear term in may 
over leftist juan bosch 
a majority of the countrys 7 million spanishspeaking people 
are roman catholic and the churchs word carries considerable

sen jesse helms accused democrat harvey 
gantt on tuesday of injecting race into the campaign while gantt 
said the comments were an insult to north carolina voters 
a gantt ad being played on black radio stations says gantt would 
be good for us on education and other issues 
he is saying one thing to the black citizens of the state and 
hes saying another to all the rest of the citizens the senator 
told about 60 people during a campaign stop 
helms says he does not object to the strategy but does object 
to gantts claims that he is sending the same message to all 
people 
dont let senator helms tell you harvey gantt is doing 
something secret and sinister gantt told an enthusiastic crowd 
of about 500 people i ask you how can harvey gantt be running a 
secret campaign on black radio stations this insults the voters of 
this state 
during his kinston appearance helms twice brought up his vote 
to sustain president bushs veto of the civil rights act which he 
said included quotas that would require the hiring of certain 
proportions of minorities 
if you want quotas to dominate and dictate whether you get a 
job or get a promotion you vote for mr gantt he said 
helms peppered his speeches with other references to blacks he 
said gantt had disappointed some blacks by applying for a 
minorityowned television station while mayor of charlotte then 
selling it for a profit 
no wonder he has a swimming pool in his backyard and a tennis 
court helms said 
asked about the federal communications commissions findings 
that gantt had done nothing wrong in the transaction helms said 
they just didnt investigate it 
helms reasserted claims that gantts campaign is being 
bankrolled by helms enemies 
its being paid for by homosexuals and lesbians he said 
they dont care all that much for harvey gantt they want to get 
this conservative voice out of the united states senate they do 
not like what i do 
helms tried to temper his opposition to homosexuality 
people can do what they want to in the privacy of their own 
homes he said but when they start marching in the street and 
say that homosexuality should be given special privileges and be 
treated as a normal lifestyle you bet i say no 
helms who was unable to personally campaign in north carolina 
for many weeks because of a long session of congress said hes 
found supporters enthusiastic since he returned and he said with a 
good turnout next tuesday election day republicans will triumph

the united states cannot allow saddam hussein to 
negotiate a limited withdrawal that would allow the iraq to keep 
some kuwaiti territory jeane kirkpatrick former us ambassador 
to the united nations said tuesday 
speaking at the 56th annual convention of the associated press 
managing editors on the first day of a fourday meeting ms 
kirkpatrick said the iraqi leader would interpret partial 
withdrawal as a victory 
saddam hussein is an aggressive man who already has used force 
and the threat of force against every one of his neighbors she 
said if he had rewards from this aggression i have no doubt 
that he would move on 
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates would be especially 
vulnerable said ms kirkpatrick a professor of political science 
at georgetown university in washington dc 
but president bush is unlikely to accept a partial withdrawal 
she said noting he has told us again and again and again he 
will not 
the persian gulf crisis precipitated by iraqs aug 2 invasion 
and annexation of its gulfrich neighbor and the mobilization of a 
usled multinational force in saudi arabia is the first test of 
the postcold war era ms kirkpatrick said 
had the invasion taken place five years ago she said it would 
have been perceived as a soviet bid for control of the persian gulf 
and the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
superpower cooperation and the weakening of communism have 
reduced it to a personal power grab and the refusal of what used 
to be the soviet bloc to support iraq in the united nations is a 
sign of the new world order she said 
ms kirkpatrick said the end of the cold war will allow the 
united states to turn its focus inward devoting its attention and 
resources to some really aching domestic problems frankly which 
i think we have not attended to as well as we could have 
isolationism from world affairs will not work she cautioned 
but neither shuld the united states act as a global policeman 
americas actions in the persian gulf go beyond selfinterest 
she said because the invasion of kuwait has global importance 
we are not that energydependent on the gulf our domestic 
resources are in fact rich and our hemispheric energy resources are 
rich we can provide our own needs she said 
she said the world is witnessing the death throes of communism 
but is unsure what form of government will now emerge in eastern 
europe 
ms kirkpatrick said she doubts communism can be revived i 
think this is a humpty dumpty which will never be put back together 
again she said

attorney general steve clark testified 
tuesday at his theft trial that he never meant to abuse a 
stateissued credit card and made honest mistakes when filling out 
expense forms 
clark appeared to choke back tears during his testimony telling 
the jury i never in my entire life meant to mislead or deceive 
or misrepresent 
clark faces one charge of felony theft by deception he is 
accused of entertaining friends girlfriends relatives and 
political supporters on his state visa card 
he testified that he accidentally recorded as guests people who 
didnt eat meals with him when he itemized bills months later but 
he said repeatedly he was given no restrictions on how to spend his 
5 million budget 
i have tried to pay all personal entertainment that is on the 
card clark said during 2 hours of testimony 
clark whose annual salary is 26500 took the stand after a 
judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the charge circuit judge 
perry whitmore said clark didnt have authority to use the credit 
card how he wished 
any use of these funds whether in little rock or in memphis 
was inappropriate for there were no appropriations by the 
legislature for that purpose whitmore said 
prosecutor chris piazza accused clark earlier in the trial of 
improperly billing taxpayers at least 844827 on his credit card 
for the meals of personal guests on 56 occasions from 1986 to 1989 
clark could get up to 20 years in prison and a 15000 fine if 
convicted 
more than 100 of 141 witnesses who testified against clark in 
the last week said they either didnt dine with clark or didnt 
discuss state business despite claims to the contrary that clark 
made on his expense forms 
the state rested its case monday with the testimony of three 
women the women said they didnt know the state paid for their 
dinners which sometimes topped 300 a meal 
clarks former fiancee carrie christie of atlanta testified 
that clark dated her popped the question and later got his 
engagement ring back during more than a dozen meals and trips paid 
for by the state in 1986 and 1987 
she said they broke off their engagement during an atlanta meal 
clarks expense forms show was held to discuss lowlevel waste 
she said the topic never came up 
in some of her most damaging testimony she said clark often 
jotted down notes on the back of his visa receipts clark has said 
his recordkeeping was sloppy and that he reconstructed his expense 
forms up to three months after the fact 
i could have spent more time i could have done a better job 
with expense records clarks said but if i had to do it again i 
would do it much different and i would do it much better 
cheryl pruett of germantown tenn testified she spent the 
night at a memphis tenn hotel with clark that records show the 
state paid for in honor of her birthday clark paid 245 with the 
visa card at a germantown restaurant she said 
karen aufdenberg of little rock testified she attended at least 
eight meals for which the state was billed including four in new 
orleans 
there are times in my job because i am divorced i would 
think an escort was appropriate because the functions were for 
couples clark said 
clark a democrat has been the arkansas attorney general since 
1979 
he said he always paid for the womens airfare and routinely 
reimbursed the state for dozens of social meals that were 
originally charged to the credit card 
clark said it was difficult for him to determine when the state 
should pay for meals for others because he often mixed business 
with pleasure 
i live eat sleep and breath politics he said that is 
the truth its not necessarily good but its the truth 
clark said publicity surrounding his state expense 
reimbursements derailed his plans to run for governor 
piazza was to crossexamine clark on wednesday

the palestine liberation organization on 
tuesday asked arab nations to drop longstanding objections to 
israels un membership 
in a private meeting of arab ambassadors palestinian and other 
arab diplomats said plo head envoy nasser alkidwa proposed the 
arabs accept israels general assembly credentials 
however the arabs would propose an amendment to the official 
membership list that reminds israel of its obligation to obey 
security council and general assembly resolutions on the middle 
east 
among these are security council resolutions attacking israels 
declaration of a unified jerusalem as its capital 
general assembly resolutions call for separate homelands for 
palestinian and jews and guarantee the right of palestinian exiles 
to go home to the new palestine 
israels un mission was informed of the proposal the issue 
is still being studied our first reaction is that any singling out 
of israel is unacceptable said israeli sources speaking on 
condition of not being further identified 
the arab ambassadors too were unable to agree immediately on the 
plo proposal one problem for them seemed to be whether voting for 
israels un membership even with those amendments would 
constitute recognition of israel 
i think they are very concerned about the implications 
themselves said one western ambassador who is an expert on the 
middle east 
the chairman of the arab group kuwaiti ambassador mohammad 
abulhasan said he would likely ask the general assembly president 
to delay consideration of the membership issue rather than take it 
up thursday as scheduled 
since 1982 the arabs have challenged israels right to sit in 
the general assembly claiming it is not a peaceloving state as 
required by the un charter 
the arabs lost every year and last year the soviet union 
abstained on the issue rather than voting with them the socialist 
bloc of countries split three ways on the issue rather than backing 
the arabs 
in 1989 the assembly voted 9537 to seat israel in 1988 the 
vote was 8539 with some nations absent or abstaining each year 
the arabs had been losing votes on the issue each year and this 
year the soviets were expected to vote in favor of israel some 
arabs said 
alkidwa characterized the plos move as a more positive 
approach the israelpalestinian issue 
this is the first major new diplomatic move by alkidwa who is 
a nephew of plo chairman yasser arafat 
veteran plo ambassadr zuhdi labib terzi retired from his 
16year posting as head of the delegation last month to become an 
adviser to arafat and alkidwa took his place 
alkidwa said the amendment to the membership report he was 
proposing would make reference to about 20 security council 
resolutions on the status of jerusalem the west bank and gaza 
observers believed that hardline arab states such as syria 
libya and iraq would be unable to support the plo proposal if it is 
viewed as amounting to some form of recognition of israel 
in 1948 the newly founded israeli government was willing to 
accept the general assembly resolutions setting up two states but 
the arab nations rejected the twostate idea and attacked israel 
the day after it declared itself a nation 
israel captured about half the land that was supposed to become 
an arab palestinian state and the other half was divided between 
jordan and egypt 
the israeli government has claimed since then that it needs to 
retain some of the occupied territory as a buffer against arab 
attacks 
in 1988 arafat became the first arab leader to endorse the 
twostate concept originally devised by the united nations

in the seventh slaying 
salcido 29 could be sentenced to die in the gas chamber at san 
quentin prison when the jury returns for the trials penalty phase

valley north of san francisco stabbing and shooting his family and 
coworkers the morning of april 14 1989 
what this means for the families is perhaps one chapter of 
this horrible nightmare will be laid to rest bumerts after the 
verdicts were read 
i cant say i was delighted by it but i wasnt shocked 
said defense attorney marteen miller one way or another i think 
this jury had its mind made up 
salcido sat quietly as the verdicts were read in san mateo 
county superior court he also was convicted of two counts of 
attempted murder and cleared of one count of attempted voluntary 
manslaughter 
the jury received the case on wednesday and deliberated 
thursday monday and most of tuesday 
firstdegree murder convictions require proof of premeditation 
and defense attorneys had urged jurors to opt for seconddegree 
murder or manslaughter 
although salcido confessed to the crimes his lawyers tried to 
save his life by portraying salcido as mentally unstable and 
incapable of planning the slayings 
during the threemonth trial the defense tried unsuccessfully 
to show that salcido had lost touch with reality and was suicidal 
when he went on the killing spree 
miller argued salcido was crazed because of a psychotic 
depression that was aggravated by a cocaineandalcohol binge just 
before the slayings 
according to testimony salcido began the killing frenzy after a 
night of barhopping when he arrived home about 5 am he was 
furious that his wife was gone 
he grabbed the couples three young girls and drove to the 
county dump where he slashed each childs throat and left the 
girls to die only one of the girls carmina then 2 survived 
telling investigators daddy cut me 
salcidos next stop was his motherinlaws home where he went 
looking for his wife and ended up fatally stabbing marian richards 
and her two daughters when he returned home salcido fatally shot 
his wife angela and headed for the gran cru winery where he 
killed his boss tracey toovey 
salcido also went to the home of his coworker ken butti and 
shot at butti and his wife terri before fleeing he hit butti in 
the shoulder 
salcido confessed to the crimes when he was arrested near his 
birthplace in western mexico four days after the killings he told 
investigators he was angry at his wife because she had hidden the 
fact that their oldest daughter was fathered by another man 
the taped confession was key evidence for the prosecution 
prosecutor bumerts scoffed at the defense contention that 
salcido was suicidal saying the killer stepped over bodies to 
bandage his finger which he cut while stabbing a victim to death 
miller the defense attorney argued that salcido was legally 
incapable of firstdegree murder defense witnesses testified 
salcido suffered from psychotic depression and was under stress 
because of mounting financial and legal problems 
heavy drinking and drug use sparked the violence pushing 
salcido to kill blindly miller maintained 
but the defense suffered a setback when several witnesses denied 
having told investigators that salcido appeared drunk in the hours 
before the slayings 
lawyers sparred over the amount of cocaine salcido ingested 
before the killings bumerts said cocaine wasnt a factor in the 
killings while miller contended the drug contributed to the 
violence toxicologists failed to resolve the dispute 
the trial was moved to san mateo county south of san francisco 
because of heavy pretrial news coverage in sonoma county where 
the crimes were committed 
the jury handed down firstdegree murder verdicts for fatally 
shooting his wife and slashing the throats of daughters sofia 4 
and teresa 22 months he was found guilty of attempted murder in 
the attack on daughter carmina now 4 who has been adopted by a 
wealthy couple 
he was also convicted of firstdegree murder for fatally 
stabbing his motherinlaw marian richards 47 and her daughter 
ruth 12 and shooting his 35eyarold boss toovey to death the 
seconddegree conviction came in the slashing death of marie 
richards 8 
salcido also was found guilty of attempted murder in the attack 
on butti but was cleared of a similar charge for shooting at 
buttis wife who was not wounded

students at smith college occupied a 
building for a fifth day tuesday vowing to remain until 
administrators come up with plans to enlarge a center for minority 
organizations 
we are not in this to get arrested were in there because 
weve been pushed to do it said vivian chiang a senior and 
chairwoman of the asianamerican students association at the 
exclusive womens college 
for eight years our pleas and our demands have been ignored 
she said 
school authorities said they recognize that the mwangi cultural 
center in lilly hall is too small and are working on a redesign 
plan to accommodate other cultural organizations at the college 
the protesters said only the black student alliance and 
nosotras a hispanic group have offices in the center and that 
administrators have been promising more space since 1983 
the protesters many of them of asian descent have occupied the 
main administration building since friday about 20 students sleep 
in the halls at night and as many as 60 students have occupied the 
building during the day some leaving from time to time to attend 
classes chiang said 
business goes on as usual around the protesters and 
administrators said they do not plan to call in police unless the 
protest becomes disruptive 
we havent ruled out the possibility of arrest but we would 
only do that as a last resort said school spokeswoman debra 
bradley we hope that we can reach some kind of compromise 
about two dozen students sat silently for an hour tuesday in the 
office of college president mary maples dunn leaving when the 
office closed at 530 pm 
dunn called the students determined young people but said 
they were too impatient she said space would probably be available 
by next september 
about 17 percent of the schools 2600 students are nonwhite 
school officials said 
kamina henderson vice chairwoman of the black student alliance 
said her group supports the sitin but noted members dont want 
changes to affect the offices they already have

a general wants state 
police to keep antiwar protesters away from entrances to the 
nations largest air force reserve base but state and local 
officials dont think that is necessary 
brig gen frederick d walker commander of the 439th military 
airlift wing asked gov michael s dukakis to send state police to 
handle the protesters they have gathered outside the gates weekly 
since aug 27 to protest the us deployment in the persian gulf 
westover air force base is the main staging area in the 
northeast for cargo flights to saudi arabia 
in an oct 9 letter to dukakis walker contended that chicopee 
police had coddled and placated the demonstrators who are 
opposing the us military buildup in the middle east precipitated 
by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
a huge fuel truck inbound to the base was delayed by the 
chicopee police for 45 minutes while a city policeman pleaded with 
the protesters to temporarily stand aside to let the fuel truck 
pass he wrote this is an outrage 
state police have observed the weekly demonstrations since 
walker made his complaint but did not observe any violations of 
the law said jeff grossman a spokesman for the state department 
of public safety 
it does not appear that any state police assistance to 
chicopee police is necessary grossman said 
chicopee mayor joseph j chessey said the general had 
overreacted and his complaint might serve only to attract more 
protesters 
i dont personally agree with the protesters but they have 
rights and in the generals mind those rights should be denied 
chessey said this is america this is not iraq 
the protest drew two people monday but on other occasions 
several dozen people have shown up chessey said 
twentyone protesters were arrested oct 20 for blocking two 
base gates two protesters were arrested aug 27 
walker was in georgia and efforts to reach him for comment were 
unsuccessful tuesday 
police chief joseph j wilk jr said he orders arrests only when 
the protesters block both lanes and refuse to allow traffic to pass 
into the base 
as far as im concerned there have been no dangerous 
situations up there wilk said and as far as im concerned 
its been a minimal inconvenience

curtis d gerald was denied a fair trial gerald had been sentenced

the roman catholic bishop of tonga 
said tuesday the aids epidemic was part of the lethal rubbish of 
western society and suggested that distributing condoms would 
spread the disease 
bishop patelisio finau told delegates at a conference of the 
south pacific commission the regional development agency that 
condoms probably had done more to spread permissiveness in society 
than any other factor 
a whole generation has grown up thinking we can do what we 
like as long as we are wearing a little bit of rubber he said 
do we have to be satisfied with giving our people the lethal 
rubbish of western society and sit back and see them become addicts 
of the consumer society with just a bit of rubber between 
themselves and death 
finau said safe sex was a road to death the aids 
epidemic proves what the church has said about proper sexual 
conduct he said 
aids is the topic of this years meeting of the south pacific 
commission which brings together representatives of the 22 island 
countries of the south pacific 
since 1985 the islands have reported 214 people testing 
positive for the virus that causes aids 47 of the carriers have 
died 
fijis health minister dr apenisa kuruisaqila made a plea for 
tolerance we must make known to our community and religious 
educators that our concern must not be just for the hereafter but 
for the here and now he said 
we have to communicate with our young people even if its 
by means of sexually explicit language if so we can avoid the 
specter of parents asking why our young people have been allowed to 
die when it could have been prevented kuruisaqila said

intense media scrutiny of political candidates is 
beneficial so long as journalists practice fairness to the max 
former san antonio mayor henry cisneros said tuesday 
i suspect what were in for is a future where this kind of 
scrutiny becomes the order of the day said cisneros whose 
personal life has undergone media scrutiny 
but while openness is important it has a price cisneros said 
at the 56th annual convention of the associated press managing 
editors 
there will be no heroes because there are no perfect 
people he said adding that the media will scare some people 
off 
cisneros who appears poised for a political comeback 
complained that he was treated unfairly by the media near the end 
of his eightyear tenure as mayor of texas thirdlargest city 
after announcing in 1988 that he would decline to seek a third 
term in 1989 reports surfaced that he had an extramarital affair 
cisneros said he left politics because of financial pressures 
exacerbated by his sons ill health 
he said a misconception persists that reports of the affair 
drove him out of office 
cisneros said he thought he was leaving office to take care of 
private problems outside the glare of publicity but found that the 
opposite happened 
although cisneros and his wife made joint public appearances 
recently there remains widespread public speculation about his 
private life 
despite his concern about the coverage cisneros said 
revelations about candidates private lives have allowed voters to 
choose between real people not cardboard pasteup people

iraq claimed its agents in kuwait seized a 
secret document that shows the cia and kuwaiti intelligence were 
plotting against iraq prior to saddam husseins invasion of the 
emirate 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz sent a copy of the purported 
document to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and 
requested that it be circulated in the security council which is 
considering the gulf crisis 
the document undated and labeled top secret and private is 
alleged to be a letter from the head of kuwaits state security 
department to the minister of the interior concerning a meeting at 
central intelligence agency headquarters in november 1989 
iraq claims it found the document in kuwaiti government files 
aziz asserted the document clearly and unequivocally confirms 
the connivance between the us central intelligence agency and the 
intelligence services of the former kuwaiti government in plotting 
against iraqs national security territorial integrity and 
national economy 
cia spokesman peter earnest after seeing a faxed copy of the 
letter said its contents are total fabrications and without 
foundation 
he said no secret meeting took place between kuwaiti officials 
and cia director william webster although the deputy 
directorgeneral of kuwaiti state security paid a courtesy call on 
webster in november 1989 
there was nothing discussed at that meeting concerning 
kuwaits relations with iraq or any other countries earnest

private meeting on nov 14 1989 
the letter says both sides agreed it was important to take 
advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in iraq in order 
to put pressure on that countrys government to delineate our 
common border 
the letter says the cia had suggested appropriate means of 
pressure on iraq the united states was willing to provide 
information on shiite moslem extremist groups in kuwait and would 
train 128 bodyguards for members of kuwaits royal family the 
alleged letter states

a writein candidate arne carlson 
was named the republican candidate for governor tuesday after the 
winner of the gop primary election quit the race because of 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
despite reservations about carlsons moderate stands on social 
issues the partys 14member executive committee voted unanimously 
to unite behind the threeterm state auditor said party chairman 
bob weinholzer 
he will face threeterm democratic gov rudy perpich 
republican nominee jon grunseth who defeated carlson in the 
sept 11 primary withdrew from the race on sunday amid allegations 
that he had an extramarital affair and encouraged teenage girls to 
swim nude with him in 1981 
grunseth denied the poolparty claims and said the affair ended 
before he married his second wife in 1984 
while grunseth was mired in controversy carlson started a 
writein campaign aug 22 
weinholzer said the party decided it lacks an appropriate 
committee to select a replacement and therefore under state law 
decided to choose the primary runnerup to take on threeterm 
democratic gov rudy perpich 
state law allows a party to replace a candidate who drops out 
weinholzer said the minnesota supreme court will decide who 
should be carlsons running mate 
weinholzer said sharon clark grunseths running mate had 
refused to step aside as the gop lieutenant governor nominee 
without a court fight carlsons running mate is joanell dyrstad 
we are awaiting the decision of the supreme court as to who 
will be on the ballot and will be proud to have either of them on 
the ballot for lieutenant governor weinholzer said 
earlier tuesday weinholzer said party headquarters has been 
inundated with calls from people urging the gop to back carlson as 
the best candidate to defeat perpich 
he said carlson has got an organization thats up and running 
right now 
hes got his phone banks going volunteers all over the place 
good sums of money hes got all the requirements to run a campaign 
in the week we have left 
however carlson a moderate on social issues and an abortion 
rights advocate has clashed publicly with members of the partys 
strong conservative antiabortion faction 
secretary of state joan growe the states chief election 
officer said the gop had until 5 pm friday to get a new 
candidate on an estimated 2 million supplemental ballots for the 
governors race 
perpich acknowledged tuesday that a headtohead contest with 
carlson would be tougher than the threeway race that existed until 
grunseth withdrew 
the conditions that were last week well anyone could win 
that one he said 
perpich said the situation had changed since primary night when 
he sounded relieved that he would be facing grunseth instead of 
carlson for instance he said tat in the interim he has regained 
the allegiance of teachers and other organizations he had feared 
could support carlson 
i think its going to be a tidal wave perpich said of his 
partys chances but who knows it could change in three days

since crimes of the heart opened in new york 
a decade ago playwright beth henley has had a hard time coming up 
with another play as good as her pulitzer prizewinner 
the latest abundance which arrived tuesday at 
offbroadways manhattan theater club certainly isnt it is a 
sprawling unfocused saga as rambling and wideopen as the spaces 
it celebrates in the wild west of the 1860s 
like crimes of the heart the play is a story of female 
friendship but the similarities end there 
henley tells the story of two mailorder brides bess and macon 
who arrive in the wyoming territory to find themselves engaged to 
two of the most umpromising men west of the mississippi 
both women make do with what they get and survive more or less 
bess ends up with the brother of her intended after her fiance 
chokes to death on a piece of corn bread macon marries a grizzled 
oneeyed widower whose farming fortunes rise and fall with the 
weather 
bess is the timid one macon the free spirit but in the end 
the mousey woman has the more exciting life bess is captured by 
indians lives for five years as a squaw and then finds fame and 
fortune on the lecture circuit recounting her adventures with 
savages macon after her husband deserts her finds a pathetic 
life working in a carnival show 
the play is a story of dreams deferred and dreams transferred 
from woman to woman but its far from a poignant affecting tale 
theres a nasty edge to the characters a whining sameness about 
bess and a greedy grasping that permeates macon they dont make 
for characters you can root for over the 25year span of the play 
the playwright has even more trouble with their husbands jack 
flan bess man seems psychotic and in the end a toady kowtowing 
to her success the farmer who marries macon is more eccentric than 
interesting an unappealing buffoon 
director ron lagomarsino lets the play wander but thats easy to 
do since the production spins on double turntables that keep 
revolving to show the inside and outside of two log cabins the 
effect is headacheproducing 
the performers exude quirkiness particularly amanda plummer 
who has made a career out of eccentric stage behavior tess harper

five central american foreign 
ministers appealed tuesday to leftist guerrillas to suspend their 
attacks and renew peace talks with el salvadors rightist 
government 
in a statement issued at the close of a twoday meeting here 
the ministers expressed hope that a ceasefire can be agreed upon 
in the next round of el salvador peace talks scheduled to start 
nov 4 in mexico 
previous unsponsored negotiations between president alfredo 
cristianis government and rebels of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front have ended in deadlock 
the statement expressed hope that as the dialogue proceeds a 
ceasefire will be called in el salvador preventing the resurgence 
of violence and fighting which has been victimizing the civilian 
population 
in recent weeks the guerrillas have launched a number of 
attacks aimed at military targets that have caused civilian 
casualties more than 73000 people have been killed in el salvador 
since the civil war began in 1979 according to human rights 
groups 
the guerrillas have refused to lay down their arms until the 
cristiani government agrees to a series of political reforms 
including cuts in the armed forces and prosecution of officers for 
human rights violations 
the cristiani government insists that a ceasefire be agreed 
upon first 
earlier this month congress approved legislation halving the 
85 million in military aid the salvadoran government receives 
annually from the united states the cut starts in fiscal year 
1991 
but according to the bills aimed at pressing for progress in 
the negotiations us aid will be restored if the guerrillas 
launch any major attacks and eliminated if the government refuses 
to negotiate further 
central america should spare no efforts to seek peace in el 
salvador the statement said it was signed by manuel pacas 
castro of el salvador mario carias zapata of honduras enrique 
dreyfus of nicaragua bernd niehaus of costa rica and ariel rivera 
of guatemala 
the foreign ministers also tackled the issue of demilitarizing 
the central american region 
a special security commission of defense chiefs will meet here 
nov 1415 to exchange ideas and plans on reducing central american 
armed forces the statement said 
costa rica abolished its army in 1948 and has relied on a 
police force for secuity ever since 
the other four countries have military forces far beyond their 
security needs and civilian politicians are pressing to reduce 
their size and influence in politics 
regional accords helped defuse the ussupported contra war in 
nicaragua efforts also are being made to negotiate an end to the 
leftist rebel insurrection in guatemala 
the five presidents are scheduled to meet dec 1516 in costa 
rica for further talks

the defunct mustang ranch bordello remained in 
government hands after a federal judge on tuesday denied the 
owners request to sell the property to a group of private 
investors 
the ruling by a federal bankruptcy judge clears the way for the 
internal revenue service to auction off the ranch to pay off its 
owners back taxes 
lawyers for the owners joe and sally conforte sought 
permission from a federal bankruptcy judge to immediately sell the 
440acre ranch that once was americas bestknown legal bordello 
the irs opposed a private sale saying the property would bring 
a higher price later an irs auction is scheduled for nov 1314 
earlier this month storey county commissioners revoked the 
mustangs permit to operate as a brothel which means it cant 
reopen as a legal house of prostitution no matter who gets title 
austin cooper one of the confortes lawyers said they had a 
buyer willing to immediately put down 500000 and pay a balance of 
16 million within three years 
he argued the property is depreciating rapidly and taxpayers 
would receive more from the sale if it went through immediately on 
the confortes terms 
the irs said the couple no longer had claim to the property the 
105room ranch operated as a legal brothel for 35 years 
we felt the auction was not properly advertised to maximize 
the number of bidders who might be interested said dierdre 
pagni an irs manager 
the mustang closed sept 18 when it was forced into liquidation 
under chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy code for three days 
bankruptcy trustees sought to reopen the bordello to recoup about 
13 million in federal taxes owed by the confortes who did not 
attend tuesdays hearing 
the irs seized and padlocked the ranch sept 21 when the 
trustees efforts were hampered by cash flow and other problems 
rollin thorley representing the irs said the government will 
sell the property for a minimum of 18 million 
the ranch will be divided for auction into real estate a 
trailer park and personal property

police acquired the aborted fetus 
of a 13yearold girl so dna tests could be performed to determine 
whether her uncle got her pregnant during an alleged rape a 
prosecutors spokesman said tuesday 
the effort to test the genetic tissue of an aborted fetus 
apparently breaks new ground in the prosecution of rape cases said 
tom krampitz executive director of the texas district and county 
attorneys association 
as far as i know its the first time that anybody has used 
that to corroborate the testimony of the victim he said 
ryland hayden 33 of corpus christi is charged with aggravated 
sexual assault after his neice reported he raped her aug 9 
the girl told authorities she was in a bed at her grandmothers 
corpus christi house when she was awakened by someone smothering 
her a criminal complaint said she said hayden forced her to have 
sexual intercourse after threatening to kill her if she cried out 
the girl discovered she was pregnant after returning home to 
houston and had an abortion court affidavits said 
a genetics laboratory has isolated the dna from samples taken 
from the fetus and the girls blood a sample of haydens blood 
will be used for comparison with the fetus and the girls blood 
this test once performed can exclude up to 99 percent of the 
male population as having been responsible for the pregnancy 
police sgt phil cunningham said in an affidavit 
his affidavit was used in obtaining a search warrant needed to 
take a blood sample from hayden 
genetic fingerprinting usually is employed to allow scientists 
to extract the unique biological code from tiny specks of evidence 
such as semen blood or hair roots 
if the codes match the scientists can testify about the 
significance if they fail to match the information can exonerate 
a suspect

the best way to discover my talk show is to 
be an unwary latenight viewer who tunes in not quite sure of 
whats happening 
it sure looks like a talk show there are couches at 
conversational angles theres a cast of regulars and there are 
celebrity guests but theres something vaguely screwy about the 
show something just slightly out of whack 
weve been saturated by talk shows said executive producer 
andrew alexander who also was a developer of sctv the 
acclaimed comedy series it seems logical now that everybody 
should have their own talk show 
our host for my talk show is homemaker jennifer bass she 
originates the live show from the living room of her home in derby 
wis the studio audience sits on bleachers in her garage 
jennifer began her talk show career at derby junior college 
where she was host of coed to coed after graduation she 
married her high school sweetheart but he left to search for his 
identity 
then her best friend and next door neighbor angela davenport 
urged her to do my talk show it aired on a cable access 
channel where it was seen by a visiting tv executive who put the 
show into national syndication 
the biography of angela jennifers cohost says she rebelled 
against her upbringing and joined the hells angels along the 
way angela saw much of america and learned to strip and reassemble 
a harleydavidson in 20 minutes 
other regulars include jennifers semiworthless brotherinlaw 
marty dissler whose trailer is parked in her driveway and anne 
marie snelling the local dinner theaters leading lady and head of 
the chamber of commerce 
ms bass introduces her guests usually two or three local 
celebrities and the celebrity guest who talks of a current 
hollywood project or a hobby or personal cause it sure looks like 
a talk show 
but something just doesnt feel right maybe it was the 
segment with derbys newly voted bachelor of the year who 
seems terribly insecure and slightly afraid of women 
maybe it was the eccentric neighbor who bursts into the room in 
his undershorts giggling hysterically and shouting that hes 
dreaming that hes appearing on national television in his 
underwear 
as it turns out ah but you saw this one coming eh the 
syndicated my talk show is really one of the cleverest 
situation comedies on tv it airs late at a night in more than 100 
markets or about 90 percent of the country 
its the spiritual heir to fernwood 2nite and america 
2nite the late 70s wildly alienated sometimes offensive 
parodies of latenight talk shows that were summer replacements for 
mary hartman mary hartman 
martin mull and fred willard played a glib egotistical talk 
show host and his utterly stupid second bananna their talk show 
interviewed other characters usually grotesques of hollywood 
stereotypes 
the difference with my talk show is that it actually is a 
talk show the celebrity guest is being interviewed by fictional 
characters who are working out their lives on a talk show 
literally living up there 
jennifer bass actually is an actress named cynthia stevenson 
stephanie hodge plays angela and david packer is marty the 
brotherinlaw 
those functional characters are constantly imploding into the 
interviews said alexander theres a certain structure to it 
but the questions are real 
the celebrities seem to enjoy it said staff writer debra 
mcgrath an alumnus of the second city improvisational troupe who 
plays anne marie snelling and who cocreated the show with linda 
kash 
they envisioned a talk show where the regulars were more wrapped 
up in their own lives than in celebrities a guest would have to 
come on and deal with whatever was going on in their lives 
mcgrath said 
a running gag in my talk show is its low budget as when 
robert goulet did the show and there was no money to pay the 
royalties if he sang if ever i would leave you 
but we do have a list of public domain songs mcgrath said 
lapsing helplessly into character robert goulet sang the bear 
went over the mountain and the itsy bitsy spider with such 
conviction

sometime in the future when bad news wanes and 
investors have renewed confidence and shirts on their backs a new 
stockmarket leader may emerge smallcompany stocks 
you might never guess that at the moment because prices of 
these same stocks have taken a far worse beating than the big blue 
chips that make up some of the better known market averages 
the dow jones industrial average which reflects those larger 
stocks has fallen about 17 percent from its high but the value 
line composite viewed as a proxy for smaller stocks has fallen 35 
percent 
the downturn for many smaller stocks has even quickened in the 
past few weeks some in fact have lost half their market value 
even as earnings continue to grow 
as a result some conservative longterm investors are loading 
up on such shares or advising clients to consider them reasoning 
that growing companies might regain favor before blue chips 
business week magazine quotes investment sage john templeton 
who owns one of the prime longterm investment records as saying 
that in 50 years he has never seen shares of emerging growth 
companies so grossly undervalued 
les dimenstein a broker with the lanyi division of ladenburg 
thalmann has seen some of his picks nosedive when no one is 
buying we should be buying he says confident that people soon 
will recognize good values and earnings 
wright investors service which generally deals in blue chips 
commented this week that extraordinary values and opportunities 
are being created in the smallcapitalization sector 
wrights thesis is that institutional and other large traders 
have been seeking security in the socalled index stocks those 
that make up the dow jones industrial average and the standard amp 
poors 500stock index 
as a consequence the popular bigstock averages have remained 
very much higher than smallerstock indexes in fact investors who 
pulled money from smaller stocks may have simply transferred funds 
to bigger ones 
while the bias toward largecapitalization stocks has gained 
momentum this year it is nothing new since mid1983 the annual 
return for the sampp 500 has averaged 13 percent the value line 
index a mere 2 percent 
such results would appear to contradict a popular contention of 
some market researchers that considered as a whole stocks with 
small capitalizations are likely to outperform larger stocks they 
call it the smallcompany premium 
seemingly logical reasons are offered to explain this concept 
smaller companies are difficult to research and there are just too 
many of them their small float or shares available may be 
insufficient for big investors 
less wellknown than the world of big companies the universe of 
smallcap stocks may include sleepers wellmanaged fastgrowing 
companies with firstclass products companies destined someday to 
become large enterprises 
many are entrepreneurial perhaps still owned by the founder 
with a management team zealously pursuing a vision living for the 
company rather than living off it as so often happens in larger 
bureaucratic concerns 
eventually so goes the concept some of these companies will 
grow to a size that attracts the big investors the money will poor 
in the companys priceearnings ratio will rise and the early 
investors will profit 
since 1983 of course the smallcompany premium hasnt been 
noticeable bigger stocks have grown faster than the small ones 
and more recently the shares of small companies have dropped more 
sharply than those of giants 
still say those who believe in the smallcap premium it is far 
from dead and that from somewhere in that universe tomorrows 
leaders will emerge no trend or fad continues ad infinitum

in germany ricky morrows plight is the stuff of 
passionate demonstrations and letterwriting campaigns 
but in dallas where he is awaiting the start thursday of his 
third murder trial for a killing he admits to committing most 
people dont even know his name 
morrow is being tried on capital murder charges in the january 
1982 death of a security guard he says the shooting occurred 
accidentally while he was trying to rob first texas savings and 
loan 
im not innocent of a crime im innocent of capital murder 
he says from his jail cell in dallas under texas law a killing 
during the commission of a felony can bring the death penalty 
we are trying to do everything on our side to save ricky 
says eva marie kaifenheim of munich germany who has orchestrated 
a letterwriting campaign that has resulted in more than 200 notes 
to members of the us news media officials and diplomats the 
letters accuse prosecutors of acting improperly in morrows case 
ms kaifenheim said she learned of the case through the human 
rights organization amnesty international which employs her sister 
and other family members 
last year more than 500 demonstrators marched through the 
bavarian capital bearing placards saying life for ricky 
morrow ms kaifenheim said 
there are a lot of people here in munich aware of what is 
going on in dallas she said 
morrows initial november 1983 capital murder conviction in the 
death of mark frazier was overturned by the texas court of criminal 
appeals in march 1988 because of an improper question posed to 
prospective jurors a second trial ended in a mistrial in july 
1989 
it was a complete accident something i never intended to 
happen morrow said of the shooting i was drunk i was on 
psychiatric medication i had just been released from a hospital 
seven days before 
in my own mind i do not think that it would be any more wrong 
for me to die than it was for him he should be living today 
and would be living today had i not gone out and got drunk and 
decided to rob a bank but i did and it happened 
but he questions the zeal with which he is being prosecuted 
noting that dallas county prosecutors have never lost a capital 
case since the death penalty was reinstituted in 1976 
theres a reason they have never lost one morrow said 
they will do anything 
theyre spending millions and millions of dollars just to get 
a notch on their belt thats what capital cases in dallas county 
are all about 
chief assistant district attorney norman kinne confirms that his 
office has won all 49 capital murder cases tried since 1976 
morrow 39 of houston and ms kaifenheim contend the district 
attorneys office has resorted to perjured testimony intimidation 
of potential witnesses and other unethical acts to ensure the death 
penalty 
ms kaifenheim rattles off the names of wrongfully convicted 
inmates randall dale adams and lenell geter who were freed by the 
courts amid allegations of misconduct by dallas county prosecutors 
morrow said prosecutors refused a plea bargain that would have 
kept him behind bars without possibility for parole until the age 
of 70 
assistant district attorney dan hagood who is prosecuting 
morrow declined to respond to the allegations 
i cant talk about a pending case ethically you are not 
supposed to he said but he confirmed his office has received 
letters from the germans 
morrows attorney keith jagmin also declined to discuss the 
trial which started in july with jury selection 
ms kaifenheim said she obtained the name of morrow who then 
was on texas death row and that of another death row inmate in 
1987 from her sister antonie who works with amnesty 
international 
the human rights organization unconditionally opposes the death 
penalty said alli miller amnesty international usas director of 
programs against the death penalty 
amnesty members in one country are asked to adopt another 
country in this instance germany has adopted the united 
states and protests us death penalty cases ms miller said 
but the action undertaken by ms kaifenheim was at her own 
behest not the groups she said amnesty international does not 
become involved with capital cases until the defendant has been 
sentenced 
after obtaining morrows name and address ms kaifenheim sent 
him a letter and a fruitcake for christmas in 1987 
ricky wrote me saying he was very happy for the cake but even 
happier by the letter she said in a telephone interview from 
munich conducted in german 
she had also sent some other inmate the same thing and he 
never responded i did respond because it was something you dont 
get in prison and i was moved by it morrow said 
that initial contact sparked a correspondence that has 
intensified over the years ms kaifenheim said that during a bleak 
period a year or so ago when morrow tried to take his own life she 
wrote him daily to boost his spirits 
she plans on coming to dallas when the trial begins 
i will be in court each day she said 
morrow said ms kaifenheims concern renewed his interest in 
fighting for what he calls a fair trial 
her primary concern is the same as mine that i get a fair 
trial and thats all im asking for he said

lalo a bomb maker with one 
arm pressed a whittled foilsheathed plug through a tube wired to 
a flashlight battery and tiny bulb the bulb went on 
boom lalo said softly there goes your foot 
the switch is designed to be buried and activated by a soldiers 
footstep it is one of dozens of devices leftist rebels have 
improvised to make up for a shortage of commercial weaponry 
lalo whose left arm was blown off by a mine makes explosives 
from various mixtures of nitrogenrich fertilizer ground charcoal 
from the guarumo tree powdered aluminum ammonia sulfur and 
sawdust for shrapnel lalo uses nails glass even stones 
he and his assistant jorge fashion their mines and mortar 
shells on this extinct volcano 15 miles north of san salvador with 
the rudimentary tools of a traveling tinker 
everything we make is a copy of industrially manufactured 
weapons lalo said 
five years ago he lost his arm to the explosion of a homemade 
mine he was digging up for relocation 
every amorer makes two mistakes he told an interviewer 
stripping wire with his teeth the first when he gets into this 
line of work the second when he gets creamed 
details of government casualties are classified but foreign 
military attaches say homemade mines wounded more soldiers than 
rifle fire in the 1980s 
the most common guerrilla mine is the quitapie literally 
foottaker it is designed to maim rather than kill and its 
components cost about 2 
congress voted in october to halve us military aid to el 
salvador originally set at 85 million for the year 
while defense minister rene emilo ponce lamented the effect on 
logistics and operations lalo and his colleagues were making bombs 
of what seemed little more than chewing gum baling wire sticks 
and spit 
more than 1 billion in us military aid in the 1980s swelled 
the armed forces from 12000 to 56000 men and gave them 
sophisticated weapons including jet fighterbombers helicopters 
and artillery 
rebel ranks are believed to have about 7000 fulltime 
combatants and roughly the same number of militia fighters 
they have received some arms mainly assault rifles and 
ammunition from cuba and nicaragua since the civil war began in 
late 1979 but generally rely on the black market and their own 
ingenuity 
included in the arsenal are 35pound bombs made from refillable 
tanks of the propane gas salvadoran workers use as cooking fuel a 
dozen such bombs launched like mortar rounds from barrelsized 
pipes were among projectiles that rained on the main air force 
base in an attack oct 17 
guerrilla arms makers are scavengers who utilize what the enemy 
throws away or inadvertently bestows 
bomb casings are made from ration cans discarded by army 
patrols lalo has extracted as much as 200 pounds of tritonal high 
explosive from ussupplied 500 lb bombs that did not explode 
when dropped on the slopes of guazapa 
like lalo and his arms makers guerrilla doctors also 
demonstrate great ingenuity 
in 198283 the rebels on guazapa were decimated by a malaria 
epidemic pharmaceutical quinine was almost impossible to obtain 
because of government offensives 
the doctors extracted the alkaloid from the bark of the cinchona 
tree mixed it with cornmeal and sugar and pressed it into pills 
by early 1984 the disease was under control 
agusto one of the doctors recalled operating with a razor 
blade and tweezers for lack of surgical implements he learned to 
modify a disposable syringe for tracheotomies and used the severed 
fingers of rubber gloves to drain wounds of pus and blood 
ive done several amputations with the saw blade of a swiss 
army knife he said 
folk medicine based on herbs sap roots and bark is a mainstay 
during the early 1980s when their positions on and around 
guazapa were less stable and lines of supply more tenuous rebels 
recruited the local bootlegger to distill cane liquor into 
hospitalgrade alcohol

fear that politicians are manipulating the throne 
for their own ends has arisen again more than 40 years after 
allied occupation forces rewrote the constitution to prevent it 
this time the warnings come from within japans own society as 
the nation prepares for the coronation nov 12 of emperor akihito 
the first monarch to be enthroned under that constitution 
i am very worried that the palace is being used for political 
purposes just as the military used the late emperor showa 
hirohito before the war minoru hamao a former imperial 
chamberlain said in an interview 
hamao who directed the education of the akihito and his sons 
for 20 years said conservatives who would return to the old 
imperial system are a minority within the governing liberal 
democratic party and lack public support 
he added however that there was increasing evidence of 
attempts by politicians to align themselves with the emperor 
because they feel that will get them prestige and votes 
the chrysanthemum throne has been politically important 
throughout japanese history but has had little to do with 
daytoday policy 
it was used as a justification for their own power by feudal 
samurai leaders political reformers at the turn of the century and 
militarists in the years leading up to world war ii 
today the liberal democrats who have governed since their 
conservative party was formed in 1955 use a logo similar to the 
imperial chrysanthemum 
according to hamao links between the palace and party were 
relatively weak until yasuhiro nakasone prime minister in the 
mid1980s tried to strengthen his control of the imperial 
household agency that manages palace affairs 
the imperial household agency is officially under the 
supervision of the prime ministers office and since nakasone they 
have used their control over personnel appointments to gain 
power hamao said 
he expressed particular concern about politicians being involved 
in an enthronement rite called the daijosai or great food offering 
ritual 
it is very inappropriate for the prime minister and other 
government leaders to attend the daijosai because of its religious 
nature hamao said having the politicians there is an 
imposition and not in line with the constitution 
hamao said the palace could not have kept politicians off the 
guest list which was strongly influenced by the prime ministers 
office 
prime minister toshiki kaifus government has acknowledged the 
religious nature of the daijosai in which a new emperor has his 
first communion with the gods of shinto japans state religion 
until the war ended 
it also has described the rite as an ancient tradition and 
denied that state funding violates constitutional bans on 
government support of religious activities 
in hamaos view the decision to follow prewar precedent for 
akihitos coronation is an attempt to free the government and 
liberal democrats from constitutional constraints on political 
manipulation of the throne 
if politicians are allowed to ignore those restraints for the 
coronation he said they may seek to use the emperor in pursuing 
their goals 
sadao yamahana a legislator and and senior member of japans 
largest opposition party the socialists said he believed the 
handling of the coronation reflected a desire by conservatives to 
restore some degree of the thrones old status 
yamahana said members of his party would not take part in the 
daijosai a rite that is intended to make the emperor closer to a 
god 
the japan federation of bar associations several teachers 
unions and the national christian council of japan have announced 
their opposition to state support for the daijosai 
in the constitution written by the usled occupation 
authorities who ran japans government for seven years after the 
surrender in 1945 the emperor is defined as the symbol of the 
state and the unity of the people 
this largely ceremonial figure was to replace a sovereign called 
sacred and inviolable in the imperial charter of 1889 
most japanese support the monarchy as it is in the 
constitution but because of memories of the war we also have 
rather complex feelings toward it yamahana said 
about 2500 dignitaries including vice president dan quayle and 
prince charles of britain areend the main 
coronation ceremony 
while yamahana acknowledged the need to guard against possible 
attacks by leftist radic expected to attals he also said extreme security 
could be 
a means of expanding police powers 
police are planning what can only be seen as excessive 
security and in this way too though subtly they are saying that 
the emperor is not a regular person he is like a god that needs 
special treatment he said 
before the war yamahana said the police and government used 
such thinking to justify silencing dissent he added that his 
father a social activist was arrested dozens of times in the 
emperors name 
radicals have declared they will use whatever means available to 
disrupt the enthronement including violence tokyo police are 
believed to be planning japans largest security operation 
possibly involvin 
the strategy of extending a contract then canceling the 
extension even while asking union members to report to work puzzled 
some uaw members who said they were ready to strike if the talks 
continued to drag 
but a source close to the bargaining who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a strike is just unthinkable the uaw last 
struck chrysler in 1985 
chrysler workers after hearing for months from their union 
leaders that they would settle for nothing less than the gmford 
agreement have been wearing buttons in past weeks reading 
pattern or picket 
among the main features of the pattern contract are income 
guarantees for laidoff workers pension increases and no change in 
health care 
the last two items could cause chrysler the most problems 
chryslers ratio of nearly one retiree for every active worker is 
much higher than gms or fords 
consequently chryslers healthcare bill is higher than that of 
the other automakers the company said it spent about 684 million 
in health care last year 
in addition to michigan missouri and delaware chrysler has 
plants in alabama illinois indiana new york and ohio

editors note he was a farmer storyteller and sometime oil 
field worker more than that hugh mcdaniel was an institution in 
the heart of louisiana where cajun french blends happily with 
southern drawls and when he died the high and the low turned out 
for a wake that lasted around the clock 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he was no mover or shaker he never 
held public office and didnt have a lot of money yet 400 people 
made their way to the deep woods of central louisiana to attend the 
wake of the man they all knew as mr hugh 
they came to pay their respects to hugh mcdaniel vegetable 
farmer and story teller who died at age 73 
news of the wake had been broadcast throughout the day on kvpi 
radio in ville platte in both french and english since this part 
of the country represents the marriage bed of the catholiccajun 
and protestant cultures 
illiterates mingled with university professors welfare 
recipients chatted easily with a couple of oil millionaires all 
had been charmed by hugh mcdaniel farmer and storyteller 
bo goodman for example he doesnt own a car he hitched a 
ride 
and william leece owner of an oil field service company a 
business in a frenzy due to the crisis in iraq he locked his 
office for the day to attend 
maude king came she lives so far back in the woods that even in 
the 1960s some residents didnt have electricity 
the wake lasted 24 hours with the kitchen of the friendship 
baptist church working around the clock concocting steamy gumbo 
coffee thick enough to float a spoon and enough deserts to make a 
fat man weep 
plates of cajun sausage boudin were complemented by the 
protestants traditional chicken and dumplings 
as a drizzling rain fell constantly this autumn day inside the 
church one pew was filled with the naquin family cousins of 
mcdaniel who conversed and prayed in french 
a cousin from another branch of the family leaned over the pew 
to speak to the naquins howre yall he drawle 
many sat all night in the church 
the later services were conducted by four ministers including 
two baptists a church of christ lay preacher and a catholic 
priest organized religion is casual here 
hugh mcdaniel symbolized that casualness the son of a 
frenchspeaking catholic mother he went to the baptist church as 
a youngster simply because that church was closest to the farm 
those were the days of mud roads and few autos and time away from 
the farm could mean a lost crop and a bare cupboard 
and typical of the 1920s he spoke mostly french until he went 
to school where teachers whipped those who didnt speak english 
such attitudes nearly killed the cajun culture which was revived 
in the 1960s now french is taught in elementary school 
hugh mcdaniel was not typical in other ways this man who grew 
vegetables and fruit on a few acres along dun beef creek just north 
of pine prairie 
he was the kind of man that most of us as youngsters want to 
emulate but wind up in middleage realizing with some selfpity 
that we never made it 
mr hugh gloried in his god his family his fellow man and the 
soil in that order 
people were naturally drawn to the warmth of a man who never met 
a stranger 
over decades wordofmouth sent the message through several 
parishes there was a man in the woods growing anything that could 
sprout they came to buy discovering he was a storyteller 
customers sat under the pecan trees and listened they left as 
friends 
he made the headlines of a local newspaper when he grafted a 
domestic peach tree with a wild tree developing a new strain of 
the fruit 
county agents and agriculture professors from the university of 
southwestern louisiana heard of his delicious peaches they 
listened to accounts of how he grew crops that couldnt be 
sustained in that part of the country where the frost came early 
the experts traveled to the farm to see for themselves to see 
if he could grow satsuma oranges this far north could he really 
grow kiwis that couldnt be done in this climate surely he 
couldnt produce vidalia onions which were grown successfully only 
in a few georgia counties 
ah but he did all that the professors also sat under the 
trees sipping iced tea and listening to mr hughs stories 
he had little desire for material possessions but dutifully 
worked the oil fields at times for the money that would give his 
four children benefit of college educations 
the farming wouldnt sustain those expenses because mr hugh 
wouldnt charge enough on top of that he gave away as much as he 
sold traveling the roads with food for the sick and the 
outofwork 
the millionaire leece met the farmer in the oil fields totally 
disarmed by a grimy oilspattered employee who treated the owner 
like a fellow employee wanting to chat during breaks 
leece found that he missed those chats and was drawn to the farm 
once mr hughs college funding duties were over 
with time on his hands mr hugh contributed columns to the 
ville platte gazette sometimes featuring jean pierre with a cajun 
dialect a simple mans view of the world a bit of local history 
a humorous account of a personal experience 
so hes gone taking with him the wellchronicled stories of 
his wonder dogs revlon and rich well hear no more of friend 
calabas or jokes about the ole woman his cherished wife 
eudole now 73 spring wont bring another column of gods grace at 
planting time 
but not to mourn mr hugh would be the first to say that 
mankind is like the soil in a way sprouting other storytellers 
maybe they are out there now maybe his columns have inspired other 
simple folk to take up the pen 
as for the farm well jean pierre said it all in one of his 
columns 
i believe when god made the world he paused here at dun beef 
cove and gave it a few extra strokes just for me i believe he 
expects me to dress and keep it and realize that i am only a tenant 
here for a short time and that i must pass this farm on to those 
who come after me just a little better than i found it

editors note he first took to the piano at the age of 2 
started seriously studying at 6 and now this son of a piano 
teacher is the talk of the music world meet evgeny kissin a young 
russian on the move 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the day he turned 19 pianist evgeny kissin 
listened to some tapes of his american recital debut telephoned 
his father in moscow and sat down at a piano to happily rip out 
some ragtime 
it was somewhat out of character for this serious young russian 
who rarely smiles on stage even while taking bows to thunderous 
applause but he has reason to celebrate these days 
since he made his american debut with the new york philharmonic 
on sept 20 critics have been raving saying kissin is the kind of 
exciting expressive pianist who rarely comes along 
that triumphant debut was followed with a recital at carnegie 
hall on sept 30 and another recital in chicago on oct 7 
the music cognoscenti were eager to hear kissin live knowing of 
him mainly through his recordings and word of mouth 
the live at carnegie hall record chopin liszt schumann 
and prokofiev plus four encores was rushed into a nov 20 
release as a twocd set by rca victor 
kissin whose nickname is genya has recital debuts early next 
year in amsterdam paris and milan he will play with the boston 
symphony at tanglewood next summer and when he returns next fall 
hes scheduled in toronto dallas los angeles san francisco 
montreal boston and new york he already is booked for spring 1992 
by the chicago symphony and the philadelphia orchestra 
it isnt always possible to tell whether a piano hotshot 
playing partly by youthful instinct will stay on top in adulthood 
or fade away one knowledgeable longtime observer of the classical 
music scene said that when one has as much talent as kissin a big 
career is confidently forecast 
harold schonberg writing in the new york times said 
musicians in generaltend to sound alike products of an 
assembly line age playing without charm or any apparent affection 
for the music under their fingers mr kissin has evolved his own 
style and it is a style that looks back to a period when a 
controlled sonority a singing line power without banging tempo 
modification and poetry were what the great slavic romantic 
pianists represented 
i never tried to make a special style in my playing kissin 
says i want to understand what did the composer intend 
basically my teachers virtue is to develop what nature has 
given me and never to dictate or enforce her own stylistic views 
she helps to guide and not let me go to extremes 
he has had the same teacher anna pavlovna kantor since he 
started at 6 at moscows gnessin school for gifted children 
actually he took his first shot at playing the piano at age 2 
kissin doesnt smile on stage he says because i am inside of 
the music i am trying to be inside before i come on stage because 
it is necessary sometimes after i still feel inside the music 
sometimes on stage hell play something a bit differently than 
ever before 
this is not really experimenting this is an inspiration that 
comes he says if you really feel that you are totally in the 
music and the mood is right for that itll just come out 
naturally if youre trying to do something different very often 
it would come out artificially 
it is like discovering something like looking at a painting 
and all of a sudden seeing an aspect you never saw before and 
trying to bring out that beauty 
as well as listening to recordings by arthur rubinstein and 
soviet pianists kissin listened to van cliburn in 1958 when 
cliburn won the tchaikovsky competition in moscow kissin says 
my mother was very young cliburn was really an idol for her and 
for people her age so his records were in our house 
kissin hasnt needed to enter competitions he made his debut at 
10 gave his first solo recital at 11 and performed two chopin 
concerti with the moscow state philharmonic at 12 
he intends to add to the composers whose music he plays i 
will play beethoven i hope ravel and debussy mussorgsky more 
schumann and brahms 
and kissins world contains more than piano im interested in 
literature history politics geography russian and the world 
glasnost should be good for artists i think politics makes a 
difference some artists have got the possibility to return like 
rostropovich and kremer and davidovich and ashkenazy soviet 
artists can move freer i think it is normal that artists need new 
impressions and i think the feeling of freedom is in the 
playing 
kissin mentions seven gifted soviet pianists about his age who 
probably will be able to play in america now that cultural 
relations have been reestablished between the two countries 
he was very nervous walking onto the carnegie hall stage kissin 
says but not because of the recent cold war when i was a little 
boy it was my dream to play in carnegie hall but i didnt think 
too much about politics carnegie was a special name for me like a 
legend 
it was for me a new step in my fortune i was nervous like 
never before 
he hadnt been as nervous before playing with the new york 
philharmonic it is easier when you have an orchestra 
success is not going to his head adulation is nice when it is 
from the heart he says sometimes it is not very 
intelligent 
besides not all his performances have been glamorous i 
played in east berlin when i was 13 on my first trip abroad my 
first performance was in an opera house the next morning i played 
an upright piano very bad at a shipyard for the workers 
they liked it they gave me a beautiful chess set 
he shakes his head no when asked whether he has a girlfriend 
the art demands sacrifices he says 
later he says he was kidding i hope to have a normal life i 
think for an artist its necessary to have somebody to help and 
share

in her biography call me anna patty duke 
tells how john and ethel ross took over her career as a child 
introduced her to alcohol and pills and subjected her to sexual and 
emotional abuse 
still duke says they had good intentions 
i cant look at these people and say theyre blackhearted 
villains says duke who plays herself as an adult in the film 
version of her biography to be shown on abc on sunday their 
intentions were good but they got lost 
under the rosses tutelage duke became a star of the miracle 
worker on broadway and at 14 became the youngest person to win an 
oscar for the movie version of the story of helen keller duke went 
on to star in the television series the patty duke show 
in the movie and in her 1987 biography duke tells how she 
became manicdepressive after the rosses separated her from her 
family as a child changed her name to patty and told her anna 
marie is dead 
bizarre though it may be duke says she included the rosses 
in the dedication of the book which she cowrote with kenneth 
turan both of the rosses died several years before the book was 
published 
my intention in the book and the movie is to suggest very 
strongly that these people had disturbed psyches of their own 
rather than malicious intent she says i was abused by both of 
them he drank and she drank and took pills 
they never thought this kid would be on broadway or win an 
oscar i think the fear of losing me affected them i think because 
of that fear they ended up driving me away 
even after leaving the rosses duke continued to suffer mood 
swings and depression until she was diagnosed as a manicdepressive

i couldnt use my usual system of acting she says i had 
tremendous help from gil cates the director and producer who also 
had his problems directing me he said how can i tell you i dont 
think she would have behaved that way what it all boiled down to

will people believe this outrageous behavior it was very 
real outofcontrol behavior

she says she did not know how people would react to publication 
of her biography in 1987 
i mean when you say good morning i had an illness you dont 
know if youll work again she says but it shows you can be 
cured 
in the beginning i didnt think it could be transferred to the 
screen then i began to see a very important very valuable avenue 
to reach people i wouldnt be living up to my own goal of helping 
people if i didnt take advantage of television 
the movie presented some legal problems for abc which had to 
decide who among the characters is and is not a public figure and

despite its success in new york in 1928 
machinal an expressionistic drama written by sophie treadwell 
has been one of broadways lost plays 
there were occasional productions over the years including one 
offbroadway in 1960 and a script published in an anthology by 
women playwrights in 1982 but the play and its feminist author 
remained unknown to most theatergoers for some 60 years 
unknown that is until michael greif a quiet bespectacled 
director with a shy smile and harpo marx hair resurrected it this 
fall at the new york shakespeare festival public theater he turned 
machinal pronounced mockenahl into a big hit with the 
public extending the plays soldout run until the end of november 
to accommodate the ticket demand 
the play is based loosely on the sensational 1927 murder trial 
of ruth synder the first woman executed in the electric chair she 
and her lover were convicted of killing synders husband 
treadwell a wellknown journalist of her day who once obtained 
an exclusive interview with pancho villa embellishes on the 
reallife story for theatrical effect her heroine called helen 
jones is dehumanized by a stifling job a greedy grasping mother 
a loveless marriage and finally an illfated love affair she is 
societys victim trapped by a gritty dark and oppressive 
environment 
the 31yearold greif is part of a major change this season at 
the public theater where producer joseph papp has staged his own 
inhouse cultural revolution joanne akalaitis earth mother of the 
avantgarde theater troupe mabou mines was named his artistic 
associate 
and papp has allowed three young directors to produce their own 
programs of plays at public this year on budgets of 300000 for 
each director besides greif the directors chosen were george c 
wolfe author of the colored museum and spunk and david 
greenspan who directed kates diary at the public last year 
greif first directed machinal last year in an old framing 
warehouse on west 16th street for a theater company called naked 
angels papp saw the production liked it and wondered if greif 
wanted to come to the public theater 
he asked me what is a very oftenasked question at a directing 
interview which is if you could choose a season of plays what 
would you choose greif recalls 
machinal immediately came to mind the other two took a 
little longer to find 
i ended up choosing the two plays i was most burning to do 
apart from machinal greif says 
he picked tony kushners a bright room called day which is 
set in germany during the 1930s the play which already has been 
done in california london and chicago is about a kind of heroism 
greif says performances begin in december 
the third offering casanova by constance congdon was seen 
by greif in a reading at new dramatists the playwright is still 
working on the play which naturally is about the worlds most 
celebrated lover it opens next spring 
having his own season of shows is quite a heady experience for a 
stagestruck kid from brooklyn brighton beach to be exact 
greifs father was an optician his mother worked parttime as 
an auditor for a life insurance company 
their son went to the theater a lot instead of going to high 
school hed sneak off to matinees usually musicals 
the musical form was actually a form where american directors 
did the most interesting and experimental work greif says 
he directed in high school putting together what he calls 
very idealistic very crude original musicals 
he studied acting and directing at northwestern university in 
illinois but ended up in california for more courses on directing 
with beckett guru alan schneider at the university of california at 
san diego 
greif also worked as an assistant to director des mcanuff who 
was just starting up a new theater program at the nearby la jolla 
playhouse 
he assisted mcanuff on the directors regional theater 
productions of big river a musical version of the adventures 
of huckleberry finn that eventually made it to broadway 
i supported myself for a couple of years directing big river 
tours greif says including the japanese and australian 
productions 
machinal was brought to greifs attention three or four 
years ago by jodie markell who plays the leading role the two 
went to school together at northwestern and always had talked of 
working together 
the play requires an ensemble that is willing to really be a 
part of a fabric a great whole and be comfortable in working in a 
stylized way greif says the production works because it keeps 
a fine line between a completely stylized approach and also a very 
human approach it dances back and forth 
does he have any more lost plays waiting to be discovered 
they are still lost greif laughs id like to uncover 
more but im too busy thats the joy of being an unemployed 
director you have more time to find them

john sheppard church music hyperion the sixteen 
directed by harry christophers 
orlando gibbons the cries of london adda the ensemble 
william byrd and the instruments of the occasional byrd graham 
oreilly conducting 
the golden age of english cathedral music asv winchester 
cathedral choir martin neary conducting 
 
john sheppard seems to have begun his musical career in oxford 
in the 1540s and disappeared from the scene in london around 1560 
the dates of his birth and death are unknown 
it is always unfortunate when there are no firm dates of birth 
and death for a composer since it is then impossible to have 
anniversary celebrations for him peter phillips drily observes 
in the notes to the tallis scholars recording 
sheppards music was a late addition to the early music revival 
simply because the tenor parts of most of his composition had been 
lost and werent restored until the 1970s in any case composers 
are less in need of contrived anniversary concerts than of decent 
performances of their music and here sheppard is well served 
there is little to choose between the two recordings three cuts 
are duplicated and four singers appear on both discs 
the tallis scholars sound is warmer and more intimate while the 
larger ensemble of the sixteen sings with a churchly grandness 
if one must choose the nod goes to the sixteen because of the 
inclusion of one of sheppards loveliest compositions in pace in 
idipsum in very peace will i lie down the music blossoms 
confidently and gloriously from a bud of plainchant a small 
masterpiece of simplicity 
unlike sheppard orlando gibbons was never forgotten in his 
native england at least some of his music notably the majestic 
see see the word is incarnate has been continuously in the 
english cathedrals repertoire for more than three centuries 
that anthem is among the high points of the new french recording 
by the ensemble william byrd and its viol consort the occasional 
byrd its the best gibbons recording now available splendidly 
performed generously annotated and spanning the range of the 
composers output 
most striking is a puckish performance of the cries of 
london seven minutes of elizabethan sales pitches such as will 
ye buy my dish of eels and hard onions hard 
the winchester cathedral choirs 1983 collection recently 
reissued on a compact disc features a consort of viols and perhaps 
the best of the boychoir recordings of gibbons muchloved this 
is the record of john gibbons see see william byrds

generation bawdy rap release it and a grinding ballad 
the question of u 
its a record collections worth of styles on one disc all four 
tunes are terrific and they make more disappointing what follows 
funk technofunk lite funk teenybopper funk formula filler 
funk most of all forgettable funk 
princes mistake may have been to rely heavily on guest 
performers three of the weakest songs among the records 17 cuts 
were performed by the time another features singer mavis staples 
who sounds good but gets stuck with a numbing tune music from 
graffiti bridge is to accompany princes upcoming new movie and 
the guest performances make it sound like a tepid soundtrack album 
prince saves his best compositions to sing himself and there 
are a few gems down the stretch the broadwaytinged graffiti 
bridge the steamy joy in repetition and the 
psychedelicagospel hybrid still would stand all time 
a parental advisory sticker adorns the cover but most of the 
sexual references are pretty lame and tame by princes standards 
hes actually more interesting when he turns pious on a couple of 
cuts 
prince fares best when hes taking chances by testing different 
genres safe in his funk rut hes duller than a bass drum track

a week after telling mutual funds to do a 
better job of explaining the risk in high risk junk bonds federal 
regulators now want mutual funds to do whatever it takes to 
eliminate any suggestions they are insured by the government 
in a letter to all 3500 investment companies registered with 
the securities and exchange commission sec officials stated a new 
gettough policy that calls on funds to change their names if 
necessary to protect investors from even inadvertent confusion 
funds that currently have names using such terms as 
guaranteed or insured in conjunction with words such as united 
states or us government should take immediate action to 
remove those words from their names said the letter signed by 
sec enforcement division director william r mclucas and gene a 
gohlke acting director of the investment management division 
it was the second time this month the sec has urged changes in 
the mutual fund industry last week the sec asked junk bond mutual 
funds to better explain the risks involved in such investments 
the latest letter said funds should refrain from using terms 
implying government protection in their titles and warned that 
sanctions might be imposed against any fund that continues to use 
terms in its name or that advertises its securities in such a 
way 
the oct 25 letter made public by the sec monday stated that 
even mutual funds that invest a majority of their assets in us 
government securities which are guaranteed are not themselves 
guaranteed or insured by the government 
recently there have been some advertisements that play up 
names of the funds with government guaranteed something or 
other gohlke said in a telephone interview were concerned 
the names of the funds may give the unsophisticated investor the 
idea that the us government is guaranteeing the fund shares 
themselves which is not the case 
he said there were at least 20 or 30 funds using the offending 
terms in some form that the sec considers possibly misleading but 
he declined to identify any by name 
l erick kanter a spokesman from the investment company 
institute a washingtonbased trade association for 2900 mutual 
funds said the group had no immediate comment on the sec letter 
but a preliminary check of the icis rolls turned up only about 
18 funds investing in treasury bonds or other government securities 
that used the term guaranteed in their name he said adding 
that ammounted to well under 10 percent of the associations 
member funds 
the letter warning about implied government protection said 
funds seeking to register with such titles could expect sec 
roadblocks delaying or preventing their sale to the public 
asked if the letter stemmed from problems encountered in the 
savings and loan debacle gohlke replied i cant say no but 
weve had this concern for some time 
some thrift customers lost their life savings when they bought 
securities such as junk bonds sold at savings and loans which 
later failed they wrongly assumed their investment was insured by 
the government like thrift deposits were 
gohlke said the sec had set no deadline for compliance on the 
government protection but warned that they should take immediate 
action

american telephone amp telegraph co faces a big 
new challenge to its popular universal phonecredit card but the 
longdistance giant immediately dismissed the entry from american 
express as a repackaging of old ideas 
american expresss new connect plus package of services 
announced monday enables customers to easily charge calls using 
the mci and sprint longdistance companies with it cardholders 
can make longdistance calls by punching in their account number 
customers can get 10 percent discounts on most mci and sprint calls 
made using the american express card 
the program fully available to sprint users thursday and mci 
users jan 1 is the latest response by a financial services firm 
to american telephone amp telegraph cos unexpectedly successful 
entry into the credit card business last march 
since atampt began offering visa and mastercard services to 
customers with a 10 percent discount on all charged long distance 
calls the long distance phone giant says it has opened about 36 
million universal accounts and distributed about 6 million cards 
with 70 million longdistance customers atampts entry into the 
highly competitive and profitable credit card industry has raised 
fears among us banks and financial companies that they could lose 
business by adding the convenience of longdistance calling to 
existing services these firms are hoping to simply retain 
customers observers say 
atampts the bogey man here for everyone said david 
robertson vice president of the nilson report a creditcard 
industry newsletter published in santa monica calif new entries 
like american expresss are a way to increase value of existing 
cards and maintain customers 
in june citibank the nations largest creditcard issuer 
enlisted mci to help launch a competitor to atampts card the cards 
allow users to charge longdistance telephone calls via visa or 
mastercard 
american express trying to differentiate itself said a key 
advantage of connect plus is that full details about mci and 
sprint long distance phone calls such as date and number called 
show up on the cardholders monthly bill 
billings for visa and mastercard programs show total phone 
charges as a oneline item but mci subsequently sends callers 
separate bills that itemize calls 
athome calls that appear on atampts universal card bill are 
charged at a calling card rate as opposed to lower directdial 
rates although the 10 percent discount narrows the difference 
an atampt spokesman dismissed american express cost advantage 
saying the cards annual fee swallows savings for calls made at 
home charter membership in the universal card is free 
we dont see whats being offered by mci and sprint as 
anything new said the spokesman bruce reid this looks like a 
repackaging of old ideas 
while american express aides declined to discuss sales goals 
industry expert robertson said he expects that 20 percent to 25 
percent of the companys 26 million subscribers will sign up as 
members of the new program 
american express is backing its new service with a direct mail 
campaign via the monthly newsletter sent to all cardmembers 
american express also will make selective mailings to customers 
deemed likely to sign up 
the company may consider broader advertising of connect plus 
later said norma arnold senior vice president of membership 
marketing at american express travel related services co 
robertson said american express is likely to woo cardholders to 
the service because of its success as a directmail marketer and 
its high percentage of corporate card customers who make a 
disproportionately large number of the nations long distance 
calls 
however the new entry should intensify overall competition in 
the card business 
theres going to be a shakeout alright you have consolidation 
going on even as we speak said bruce brittain president of 
brittain associates inc an atlantabased research and consulting 
firm specializing in financial services some of the regional and 
local issuers arund the country are getting out of business

an accountant pressured to give too rosy a 
picture of company finances or ignore the boss big spending may 
feel there is nowhere to turn for advice 
but there is say counselors operating a nationwide ethics 
hotline for the national association of accountants 
there is often a thin line between whats appropriate and 
whats inappropriate said counselor howard siers we dont 
tell them what to do we talk through their problem we are kind of 
a sounding board for them 
siers a retired auditor from tucson ariz helps field phone 
calls to 18006ethics which is intended for naa members only 
with 100000 members nationwide the group is a professional 
organization for corporate staff accountants 
robert sweeney an accounting professor at memphis state 
university said he fields 15 to 20 calls a month to the hotline 
there are so many people out there who have these ethical 
problems and they dont have anyone to talk to he said having 
someone to reason it out with you is such a relief 
hotline counselors keep no permanent records of the calls they 
handle nor do they ask a caller his name or the name of his 
company sweeney said monday 
the idea is to help accountants decide on their personal 
actions not to report the questionable ethics of their companies 
sometimes people will say that it looks like the only recourse 
they have is resigning sweeney said 
a common dilemma for accountants seeking advice is being 
pressured to smooth the books thereby making the company 
appear more profitable than it really is he said 
the boss will want to delay recording expenses so the 
financial statement for a period looks better sweeney said 
an accountant faced with breaking the law generally has little 
trouble figuring out his options siers said but grey areas 
involving ethics can be tough 
the boss personal expense claims when apparently excessive can 
cause such problems 
an accountant has an obligation to review such claims with 
the person he or she reports to but do you take it to a higher 
level said siers a retired general auditor for the ei du pont 
de nemours amp co 
siers said he has handled some 40 calls since the hotline opened 
last spring many of those calls he said have come from employees 
of smaller companies who have no colleagues they can speak with 
openly 
the callers are often upset when they phone but then calm down 
after talking for awhile siers said 
you can sense that they know then what theyre going to do

the united auto workers union 
hoping to avoid wildcat strikes at chrysler corp plants told its 
members monday to report to work as usual even if it cancels a 
onceextended contract 
the union and the no 3 automaker continued to bargain early 
tuesday on a new national labor contract involving 63000 hourly 
and salaried workers in eight states after a midnight contract 
extension cancellation had passed 
everything is under control at the present time uaw local 
1183 president richard mcdonaugh jr at chryslers newark del 
assembly plant said monday afternoon theyre dissatisfied with 
the lengthy period of time the extension has been 
the current contract negotiated in 1988 was extended past its 
original sept 14 expiration while the uaw bargained separately 
with general motors corp and ford motor co new threeyear 
contracts are in place at those companies 
the union gave chrysler notice friday that the contract 
extension would expire at midnight monday 
during bargaining sunday uaw president owen bieber reportedly 
rose from his chair and shouted at anthony st john chryslers 
vice president for employee relations 
if you want a strike youll get it bieber reportedly told 
st john chryslers chief bargainer the detroit news reported the 
outburst in monday editions attributed to an unidentified union 
negotiator 
chrysler meanwhile said it lost 214 million during the third 
quarter most of the loss was attributed to onemonth retooling 
shutdowns at two minivan plants which make some of the companys 
most profitable vehicles and to cash rebates and lowinterest 
financing deals used to attract buyers 
the blow was softened by record profits reported by its 
financial subsidiary chrysler financial corp which handles 
consumer car loans earned 83 million in the third quarter 
despite the lifting of the contract extension union leaders 
told members to report to work until notified otherwise the uaw 
scheduled a meeting thursday in detroit of its 200member national 
chrysler bargaining council 
at that time a tentative agreement or a report on the status 
of the negotiations will be presented a union statement said 
however the bargaining council also may discuss strike strategy 
union spokesman bob barbee said 
well back our international officers as long as we can but 
if they dont give us something were out of here said phil 
portwood a uaw member at local 110 in st louis home of one of 
the two minivan plants 
he said his local already had made strike signs and developed 
picket schedules were ready to go portwood said 
the uaw last struck chrysler in october 1985 for 12 days 
major provisions of a new contract remained unresolved monday 
including job security healthcare provisions and retiree 
benefits 
the uaw is pressing chrysler to sign a contract similar to the 
gm and ford agreements chrysler officers have said the company may 
not be able to afford certain provisions of the pattern agrement 
last week in canada chryslers wholly owned subsidiary agreed 
to follow a pattern for canadian auto workers that was set at ford 
and gm subsidiaries 
when bargaining began in midjuly chrysler also said it needed 
help from the uaw to cut healthcare expenses which cost the 
company about 684 million last year the pattern agreement has no 
change in healthcare provisions 
in addition to michigan missouri and delaware chrysler has 
plants in alabama illinois indiana new york and ohio

the us economy grew at a 
strongerthanexpected 18 percent annual rate in the third 
quarter the government said today continuing the longest 
peacetime expansion in us history 
the commerce department said the growth in the gross national 
product the nations total output of goods and services 
improved over a barely perceptible 04 percent annual rate during 
the second quarter 
the figures indicate the economy evaded the beginning of a 
recession but that isnt certain because the gnp report will be 
revised twice in november and again in december as more 
information becomes available 
nevertheless commerce undersecretary michael r darby told a 
news conference this release contradicts those who believe we 
are in a recession or are about to enter one we expect the economy 
to continue to expand at a modest pace for the remainder of the 
year and in 1991 
in another report the government said sales of new homes 
slumped 6 percent in september the ninth decline in the past 12 
months and the worst drop in half a year 
much of the improvement in the economy resulted from a 36 
percent increase in consumer spending purchases of automobiles 
rose 34 billion compared to a 61 billion decline in the second 
quarter the commerce department said 
in advance of the report a consensus of economists had expected 
a growth rate of 08 percent from july through september 
but many analysts believe the economy has weakened in recent 
weeks and is slipping into a recession generally described as at 
least two quarters of negative growth 
some economists say a recession actually began in the third 
quarter but others point to signs of continued growth from july 
through september 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said monday that while some 
parts of the economy are in bad shape were in a period of 
slower growth but not a recession 
the department also said that a gnp measure of inflation rose to 
41 percent in the third quarter it was the first gnp report since 
the persian gulf oilprice shock pushed up the price of many 
consumer goods 
gnp inflation had slowed to 39 percent in the second quarter 
from 64 percent in the first 
in addition to consumer spending the department said 
thirdquarter economic growth was fueled by a 74 percent increase 
in business investment 
on the other hand that activity was partially offset by a 17 
billion decline in inventories and a 79 billion merchandise trade 
deficit 
housing construction was off 154 percent and federal government 
spending was down 03 percent 
secondquarter growth originally was reported to have been 12 
percent at an annual rate it remained unchanged in the first 
revision but was revised sharply downward to just 04 percent in 
the second firstquarter growth was 17 percent 
the economy grew 25 percent for all of last year although it 
slowed to a meager 03 percent rate in the fourth quarter it had 
expanded 45 percent in 1988 
the total gnp the broadest measure of the nations economic 
activity was growing at an annual rate of 417 trillion in the 
third quarterwhen adjusted for inflation that was a gain of 185 
billion over the second quarter 
in this months survey of 52 economists by blue chip economic 
indicators a consensus said the gnp is now expected to contract 
on an annualized basis in both the fourth quarter of 1990 and the 
first quarter of 1991 providing us with the generally accepted 
definition of a recession 
fourth quarter gnp is expected to fall at an annualized rate 
of 06 percent wrote robert j eggert the sedona ariz 
publications editor the expected contraction in the first 
quarter of 1991 gnp is put at 01 percent 
for all of 1990 the consensus forecast of the blue chip 
economists calls for growth of 10 percent the economy grew 25 
percent last year slowing from a 45 percent pace in 1988 
higher oil prices resulting from fears of a military conflict 
in the persian gulf the higher taxes and reduced spending that 
will come with adoption of a budgetdeficit reduction plan and 
sharp declines in both consumer and business confidence were 
cited for the weakening economic forecast eggert said 
the conference board a new york research group reported last 
friday that consumer confidence in the economy plunged in october 
to the lowest level since the 198182 recession it said its index 
tumbled more than 24 points the biggest onemonth drop in the 
20history of the survey 
since the last recession the economy has grown for 95 months 
through september surpassing the previous peacetime growth record 
of 58 months between 1975 and 1980 the current over all record was 
106 months from 1961 to 1969 which included the vietnam war

grain and soybean futures prices were slightly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade in a 
modest rebound from recent losses 
soybeans were leading the grain markets higher following an 
agriculture department announcement late monday of a large sale of 
us and foreign soybeans to unknown destinations 
the announcement sparked speculation of renewed demand for us 
grains analysts said 
the early gains were limited by perceptions that indian summer 
weather in the nations midsection is pushing the corn and soybean 
harvest along and helping the newly planted winter wheat crop 
in a weekly report released late monday the usda said 72 
percent of the us soybean crop and 64 percent of the corn crop 
had been harvested as of sunday 
the agency said 86 percent of the winter wheat crop was planted 
as of sunday 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 1 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 262 a bushel corn 
was cent to 1 cents higher with december at 229 a bushel 
oats were cent to 1 cent higher with december at 120 a bushel 
soybeans were cent to 3 cents higher with november at 593 a 
bushel 
cattle futures were higher and pork futures were lower in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent to 17 cent higher with december at 
7747 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 25 cent 
higher with november at 8732 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent to 
23 cent lower with december at 5122 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 55 cent to 117 cents lower with february at 5990

german businesses expect continued growth 
next year despite rising oil prices and pressure on exports the 
national chamber of commerce said tuesday 
more than 90 percent of the 17000 german businesses surveyed 
said they expect 1991 to be as good as this year while 39 percent 
predicted business will be better only 9 percent expect the 
economy to be worse the survey shows 
franz schoser managing director of germanys association of 
chambers of commerce predicted the countrys growth rate next year 
will be between 2 and 3 percent 
the chamber said businesses are optimistic about the expected 
benefits of removing european community trade barriers in 1993 as 
well as greater access to eastern europe 
the optimism persists despite less demand for exports in the 
united states and japan where prices for german products have 
risen along with the value of the german mark thats because 
germany exports about 70 percent of its products to other ec 
countries where growth prospects for next year are positive 
higher interest rates on borrowed investment funds have also 
failed to dampen the projections the survey says despite the 
extra burden of revitalizing the economy of former east germany 
the survey the first that includes responses from a majority of 
chambers in former east germany indicates that after several 
months of difficulty many businesses in the new states expect 
tangible improvements by the second half of 1991 schoser told 
reporters 
about 85 percent of businesses surveyed plan investments equal 
to or greater than in 1990 reasons for the higher investments 
include more stringent environmental requirements and the prospects 
of rebuilding former east germany 
up to 27 percent of the businesses also plan to expand hiring as 
early as this fall

reported a net loss of 270 million francs or 53 million for the 
first half of 1990 down from a profit of 71 million francs or 
137 million a year ago 
in a legal filing monday the stateowned group said the poor 
showing in its consolidated accounts partly reflected the weakness 
of the dollar and the soft north american market for its consumer 
electronics unit 
financial costs of recent acquisitions a decline in income from

will be about 26 million tons less than planned 
the shortfall prompted the czechoslovak government earlier this 
month to raise prices for fuel oil and gasoline by more than 30 
percent 
czechoslovakia will pay for the oil with equipment and consumer 
goods to be chosen by soviet oilmen tass said part of the 
supplies will be paid for in hard currency the news agency 
reported 
the soviet union has been the main supplier of oil to eastern 
europe for years usually at prices far below the world market 
however beginning jan 1 the soviet government is demanding 
payment at prices approaching the market level

international business machines corp on tuesday 
unveiled several new highend personal computers and workstations 
that indicate the computer giant intends to keep its machines in 
the performance lead 
ibm also announced a new version of its operating system for 
personal computers which could intensify ibms tussle with 
software giant microsoft corp over which system will take the 
lead 
ibm says its two new highend models of its personal system2 
line are up to 2 times faster than the previous top machine 
both new ps2 models use intel corps most powerful 
microprocessor the 486 ibm already offered a ps2 with the 486 
chip but it uses a less speedy version of the microprocessor than 
that offered as an option on the two new models 
one of the new ps2 models is designed to be used as a file 
server or a central data base for a network of desktop 
computers this machine the model 95 will cost from 14145 to 
17745 depending on the version 
the computer which sits on the floor rather than the desktop 
is ibms answer to a powerful file server introduced last year by 
compaq computer corp some industry analysts say the ibm machine 
can link 25 to 35 desktop machines in a typical application said 
spokesman kevin clark 
the other new ps2 the model 90 is aimed at applications that 
require a great deal of computing power such as computeraided 
design financial modeling and graphicsintensive programs 
the desktop machine will cost 12495 to 16695 depending on 
the version 
the new ps2s also include new graphics technology that ibm says 
provides sharper graphics and will make them appear on the screen 
much more quickly than the technology it replaces 
peter burris an analyst at the research firm international data 
corp called the new ps2s a solid product but he said 
the pricing remains ibmlike meaning not cheap 
he said ibm like several other computer makers is interested 
in learning as much as it can about that area between highend pcs 
and lowend midrange computers 
as personal computers grow more powerful they are blurring the 
line with midrange machines or minicomputers however analysts 
say minicomputers typically come with better support services from 
the maker and software more closely tied to the users needs 
ibm based in suburban armonk also announced new workstations 
that offer better performance than the previous topend models of 
its risc system6000 line burris said 
ibm disclosed the new machines to customers and analysts but 
said it would not talk to reporters until a news conference 
wednesday 
burris said the workstations which are aimed primarily at 
scientific and engineering users offer knockout performance 
one of the new models the powerserver 550 is about 38 percent 
faster than the lines previous topend file server burris said 
burris said the new models which use ibmdeveloped 
microprocessors and are priced at 135000 to 137000 offer more 
performance for the money than competing workstations from sun 
microsystems inc the leading workstation seller 
ibm also announced a new version of its operatng system for the 
ps2s that takes up less computer memory an operating system is 
the base layer of software that controls a computers internal 
functions 
the new version of operating system2 should allow more computer 
users to convert to this operating system which is more 
userfriendly than the dos operating system it was designed to 
replace ibm says 
previously many computer users had to make costly upgrades to 
their machines memory before they could use os2 which was 
designed in conjunction with microsoft 
the base version of the new operating system will cost 340 
os2 introduced by ibm and microsoft in 1987 has failed to 
gain widespread popularity in part because it requires a greater 
level of memory than many computers have analysts say 
in addition os2 competes with a software product called 
windows developed by microsoft which provides many of the same 
easeofuse features for the dos operating system the competition 
between os2 and windows has caused friction between ibm and 
microsoft according to industry reports

losses in normally profitable overseas operations 
contributed largely tuesday to a 787 percent drop in ford motor 
cos thirdquarter earnings 
the decline at the no 2 automaker was much steeper than wall 
street analysts had expected 
ford said it made 1017 million or 22 cents a share during 
the julyseptember period this year thats down from 4771 
million or 103 a share in the third quarter last year 
the earnings decline would have been bigger without onetime 
accounting changes that boosted this years figures by 869 
million 669 million in the united stats and 20 million 
overseas 
ford stock finished down 2 at 2762 per share on the new 
york stock exchange tuesday 
no 3 chrysler corp reported a 214 million loss monday the 
automakers largest operational loss since the first quarter of 
1981 when it was recovering from near bankruptcy 
general motors corp the nations biggest automaker planned to 
release thirdquarter earnings wednesday like ford gms earnings 
were expected to be hurt by overseas profit declines 
my impression in europe is the whole european market turned 
down in the third quarter said auto analyst mary anne sudol of 
fitch investors service inc of new york ford relies a lot on 
the united kingdom sales which is down 125 percent for the 
first nine months 
she said ford held about 25 percent of the united kingdom 
market down from 30 percent a few years ago 
ford said it lost 89 million on its overseas automotive 
business which in the past has helped carry less profitable north 
american operations during the third quarter last year fords 
overseas operations earned 324 million 
the company said it made 50 million on its us automotive 
operations but that was offset by the accounting change for a net 
loss of 17 million 
in the united states ford got a bit of a break from a reduction 
in its incentive costs down to 975 per vehicle from 1000 for 
each car and truck sold during the 1989 period 
fords financial services group which includes consumer 
financing and other operations earned 141 million during the 
third quarter of this year down 258 percent from 190 million 
during the same period last year 
the groups income was reduced by 69 million or 15 cents a 
share to boost loan reserves for its first nationwide bank 
subsidiary based in san francisco 
fords earnings came on 23 billion in revenues up 139 percent 
from revenues of 202 billion during the julyseptember period 
last year 
for the first nine months of this year ford earned 14 
billion or 299 a share down from 352 billion or 751 a 
share during the same period in 1989 revenues for the period rose 
to 735 billion from 72 billion 
we believe that financial results will remain weak in the near 
term reflecting a continuation of the adverse factors affecting 
this quarters results said a statement by ford chairman harold 
poling and president philip benton despite the nearterm 
pressure on profits we at ford remain committed to an aggressive 
capitalspending plan 
that spending plan and pressure on profits prompted moodys 
investors service inc of new york to downgrade securities of ford 
and some of its subsidiaries by one notch last week however the 
ratings which are used as a reflection of its credit worthiness 
remained well within moodys investment grade

the us economy grew at a 
fasterthanexpected 18 percent rate in the third quarter the 
government said tuesday but the report failed to dissuade many 
analysts who believe the economy is entering a recession 
the commerce department report on the gross national product 
showed that consumers buying cars and other items had continued to 
drive the longest peacetime economic expansion in us history 
through september whether the expansion reaches its eighth 
anniversary in november was a matter of debate 
this release contradicts those who believe we are in a 
recession or are about to enter one commerce undersecretary 
michael r darby told reporters his boss commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher added in san antonio i hope all the 
doomsayers and naysayers and cluckcluckers go back in their 
holes for a while 
but economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets 
in new york said i believe were in a recession i think that 
most of the things showing strength in the third quarter will be 
weak in the fourth particularly consumer spending 
robert g dederick chief economist for the northern trust co 
in chicago also believes the economy is declining this quarter he 
contended that much of the gnp strength was concentrated early in 
the quarter it is by no means certain that it was growing 18 when 
the quarter ended 
indeed michael boskin chairman of bushs council of economic 
advisers said while this is pleasant news about the third 
quarter we are concerned about a sluggish fourth quarter and the 
early part of 1991 
he added that he was certainly pleased with the federal 
reserves action monday in pushing down a key shortterm interest 
rate a move that might be expected to boost economic growth 
the commerce department had continued bad news about the housing 
industry tuesday it reported that sales of new homes slumped 6 
percent in september the ninth decline in the past 12 months and 
the worst drop in half a year 
declining home sales suggest continued contraction in the 
industry since builders often put off new projects when inventories 
climb 
the gross national product report will be revised twice in the 
next two months as more information is received the final revision 
of the secondquarter gnp showed the economy grew just 04 percent 
rather than the 12 percent first reported 
consumer spending twothirds of the nations economic activity 
jumped 36 percent in the third quarter compared to a 02 percent 
gain in the second much of the advance was due to a 34 billion 
increase in automobile sales which had declined 61 billion from 
april through june 
but the conference board reported last friday that consumer 
confidence in the economy plunged in october to the lowest level 
since the 198182 recession the new york research group said its 
index tumbled more than 24 points the biggest onemonth drop in 
the 20history of the survey 
the fourth quarter is going to be sick said roger brinner 
chief economist at drimcgrawhill in lexington mass the 
consumer is terrified about the future 
in addition to consumer spending the department said 
thirdquarter economic growth was fueled by a 74 percent increase 
in business investment 
that activity was partially offset by a 17 billion decline in 
inventories held by business and a 79 billion merchandise trade 
deficit 
housing construction was off 154 percent and federal government 
spending was down 03 percent 
the commerce department also said that a gnp measure of 
inflation rose to 41 percent in the third quarter up from 39 
percent in the second it was the first gnp report since the 
persian gulf oilprice shock pushed up the price of many consumer 
goods 
the thirdquarter growth was an improvement over the meager 04 
percent gain during the second quarter when consumer spending 
inched up just 02 percent 
brinner said consumer spending was weak in the second quarter 
because it was stronger than normal during the first quarter due to 
unusually warm weather 
if you take spending out of the second quarter and put it into 
the first obviously it depresses second quarter and makes the 
third quarter look good he said 
the economy has grown for 95 months through september far 
beyond the previous peacetime record of 58 months between 1975 and 
1980 the economy expanded for 106 months from 1961 to 1969 
including the vietnam war 
a survey this month of 52 economists by blue chip economic 
indicators showed a consensus said the gnp is now expected to 
contract on an annualized basis in both the fourth quarter of 1990 
and the first quarter of 1991 providing us with the generally 
accepted definition of a recession 
for all of 1990 the consensus forecast of the blue chip 
economists calls for growth of 10 percent just above the 
administration forecast of 07 percent the economy grew 25 
percent last year slowing from a 45 percent pace in 1988 
total gnp the broadest measure of the nations economic 
activity reached an annual rate of 417 trillion in the third 
quarter when adjusted for inflation that was a gain of 185 
billion over the second quarter

oil prices slid back tuesday in a market that 
was so sluggish traders wouldnt even jump at rumors as they have 
for weeks 
analysts who have witnessed numerous rumorinduced buying and 
selling binges compared the quiet session on the new york 
mercantile exchange to the little boy who cried wolf 
this war has started so many times on the floor of the nymex 
that i think its getting a little weary of starting there said 
peter beutel an oil analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in 
hoboken nj 
light sweet crude oil the benchmark grade was up a little more 
than 1 per barrel early in the day before dipping to close at 
3454 per barrel down 14 cents for december delivery contracts 
later delivery contracts followed a similar pattern opening up and 
closing down 
during the light trading session people on the exchange said 
the market refused to budge on rumors that in other recent sessions 
would likely have sent crude prices surging by a dollar or two one 
of the rumors even had shots being fired in the persian gulf 
as the day wore on they became increasingly convinced that 
the general market was not behind them and we were not going to see 
any kneejerk reaction to these rumors beutel said 
i think the market is a little tired said annlouise 
hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
its just tired of reacting to these rumors its like crying 
wolf for something 
oil traders say they generally buy the rumor sell the fact 
but evidence of that strategy has been absent during the last two 
trading sessions 
oils high opening prices had been based on harsh words from 
us officials who warned iraq that a military solution to the 
crisis was possible traders and analysts could not pinpoint 
anything that later pushed prices down other than the markets 
apparent case of the doldrums 
futures for refined petroleum products also fluctuated aimlessly 
tuesday 
they opened higher along with crude and closed mixed 
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 130 cents to 9373 cents a 
gallon on november delivery contracts nearmonth contracts were 
also higher but more distant months closed lower 
wholesale home heating oil moved in the opposite direction 
closing with near months lower and distant months higher november 
delivery contracts were down 19 cent at 9117 cents per gallon 
natural gas futures were mixed december delivery contracts fell 
26 cents to 2408 per 1000 cubic feet 
after the market closed the american petroleum institute 
released weekly figures showing the nations supply of crude oil 
had fallen below 1989 levels for the first time since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
the us stockpile of crude dropped to 3395 million barrels 
last week compared with 3404 million barrels a week earlier and 
3454 million barrels a year earlier it was the first time this 
year that the crude stockpile had fallen from the comparable week a 
year earlier api said 
the stockpile of distillates which includes home heating oil 
was up to 1381 million barrels from 1369 million barrels a week 
earlier and 1187 million barrels a year earlier the gasoline 
stockpile was down to 2204 million barrels from 2226 million 
barrels a week earlier and 2232 million barrels a year earlier 
the nations refineries ran at 825 percent of capacity 
compared with 833 percent a week earlier and 866 percent a year 
earlier

silicon graphics corp on tuesday unveiled 
technology the company said will give personal computer users 
access to threedimensional graphics previously available only on 
expensive computer workstations 
the company announced circuit boards that fit inside 
international business machines corp and ibmcompatible personal 
computers that use intel corps powerful 80386 and 80486 
microprocessors 
the boards called irisvision allow users to move and alter 3d 
color images on the screen and instantly see the changes they make 
a feature important to scientists and engineers 
irisvision redefines and sets new standards for personal 
computer graphics said edward r mccracken silicon graphics 
president and chief executive officer it will change the way 
people use pcs for design and animation 
both the boards and about 15 software packages to take advantage 
of them will be available in january the company said more than 
20 software developers are writing applications for irisvision it 
added 
silicon graphics is known for its 3d graphics computers 
ranging from workstations starting at 10000 to supercomputers 
costing 500000 the boards are the first product the fastgrowing 
9yearold mountain view company has produced for the personal 
computer market 
they also come as competitors notably sun microsystems inc 
try to woo personal computer users with cheaper workstations 
irisvision boards will cost 3500 to 5000 the company hopes 
to sell 25000 boards during the first year 
they give you the same graphics performance as our personal 
iris product line of workstations said company spokeswoman 
jill grossman of computers that range from 10000 to about 
25000 
the boards allow personal computer users to put together a 
system to do sophisticated graphics for as little as 7000 
mccracken said they should cut into suns strategy of offering 
workstations ranging from 5000 to 9000 he said 
but a spokesman for sun also based in mountain view said his 
companys computers offer more than sophisticated graphics 
including networking capability and data processing not available 
on personal computers 
robert herwick an analyst with the san francisco brokerage 
hambrecht amp quist inc said the development of software for the 
new boards would help ensure their success 
he also said the boards should increase demand for silicon 
graphics workstations since those who like the new technology may 
want to move up to the companys lowend workstations 
silicon graphics posted a 32 million profit on sales of 420 
million in the fiscal year ended june 30 it had 115 in profit on 
264 million in sales in the previous year

us rep dan rostenkowski said tuesday that 
public opposition to taxes and spending cuts not partisan 
politics was the driving force behind the budget deficit debacle 
but he warned that the budget plan will require americans to 
make sacrifices that will help put the country on sound economic 
footing into the 21st century 
president bush has blamed lawmakers for the political wrangling 
that finally ended with the budget deal reached over the weekend 
and pundits will blame partisan politics for the breakdown the 
illinois democrat told members of the national soft drink 
association 
im not going to say it wasnt our fault but it wasnt all 
our fault he told an audience of about 300 gathered for the 
groups annual meeting 
lawmakers were faced with an impossible plea from constituents 
who urged dont raise my taxes dont cut spending but get rid 
of the deficit said rostenkowski chairman of the house ways 
and means committee 
those are tough orders to follow especially in an election 
year he said adding im not blaming the public im simply 
stating a fact 
rostenkowski who guided the budget plan through the house said 
tax increases as well as spending cuts were the only way to cut the 
federal deficit 
he blamed the budget crisis in part on years of greed and 
selfishness during the reagan administration 
this attitude has got to be reversed rostenkowski said 
and above all we have got to act together this means a renewed 
sense of patriotism 
the deficit reduction agreement is only the first step toward 
regaining our economic barriers he said 
you will recognize in the next five years some tremendous 
cuts in programs and services as a result of the 492 billion 
deficit deal 
there are cuts in the farm program there are cuts in foreign 
aid cuts in the health area he said noting that the deal 
involves 43 billion in medicare cuts 
thats a sizeable cut services are going to be curtailed 
rostenkowski said 
but he predicted voters will be willing to tighten their belts 
for the sake of the economy and wont lash back at lawmakers in 
next weeks election

platinum futures prices posted their strongest gains in 10 
months tuesday rebounding from depressed levels after a government 
report indicated the us economy had a stronger third quarter than 
most economists thought 
gold and silver futures turned in their best performances in 
more than a month 
on other commodity markets petroleum futures were mixed grains 
and soybeans were mostly higher and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed 
platinum futures settled 1840 to 1870 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in january up 
1870 at 437 an ounce 
it was platinums strongest day since jan 4 when the nearterm 
contract surged 1890 an ounce 
tuesdays rally marked a significant recovery for platinum 
which traded at a 4year low of 38750 on oct 16 amid fears that 
the economy was sliding into a recession 
those fears were eased at least temporarily by tuesdays 
commerce department report that the economy expanded at a 18 
percent rate in the third quarter more than twice as fast as most 
economists had thought 
the platinum market is sensitive to economic signals because the 
metal has many industrial uses thirtyseven percent of the 
platinum consumed last year went into automobile pollutioncontrol 
systems and another 17 percent was used in petroleum glass 
electrical and chemical manufacturing 
the market also tends to be volatile because platinum is more 
thinly traded than the other precious metals 
analysts said all the precious metals were oversold and due for 
a correction after at least four straight weeks of declines they 
said the initial surge prompted by the gnp report triggered waves 
of buying by players who had sold precious metals earlier in the 
belief that prices were headed lower still 
bette raptopolous senior metals analyst with prudentialbache 
securities said more economic data due out later in the week might 
determine whether the gains would hold 
commerce department reports on factory orders and personal 
income are scheduled for release wednesday followed by the monthly 
employment statistics on friday 
if those support the thesis that weve bottomed out you could 
see platinum recover quite well and silver also because they were 
declining on this recession picture raptopolous said 
gold futures settled 560 to 6 higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the november contract at 37970 a troy ounce silver 
was 88 cents to 93 cents higher with december at 4245 a troy 
ounce 
crude oil futures ended lower and heating oil and gasoline 
futures were mixed on the new york mercantile exchange amid 
conflicting factors 
escalating war rhetoric from iraqs saddam hussein provided 
support for the oil markets but the strength was offset by 
president bushs assurances that us consumers could count on 
adequate supplies of petroleum products 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 8 cents to 36 cents lower 
with december at 3454 a barrel heating oil was 85 cent lower to 
64 cent higher with november at 9117 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 12 cents lower to 132 cents higher with november at 
9373 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade supported in part by persistent rumors of a large 
sale of us corn to the soviet union or an eastern european 
country 
the agriculture department has not confirmed any large export 
corn sales of corn nevertheless the market was moved tuesday as 
it was monday by talk that about 500000 metric tons of corn were 
sold 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with december 
at 264 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents higher with 
december at 231 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher 
with december at 121 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 
cent higher with november at 590 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle futures settled

a nowdefunct satellite tv company 
indicted in alabama for beaming adult films outside its home state 
pleaded guilty to obscenity charges and paid a 150000 penalty to 
charity 
the charges against the new york company were sharply criticized 
tuesday by the american civil liberties union and the plea praised 
by pornogrpahy opponents who contend damage done to alabama 
youngsters cannot be reversed 
home dish only satellite network inc entered the plea monday in 
state court to two misdemeanor charges of distributing obscene 
materials it was the first satellite company in the nation to be 
indicted outside its home state on obscenity charges for sending 
adult films to another state 
new york gov mario cuomo refused in june to extradite four 
executives of home dish indicted last year by a grand jury in 
montgomery saying the charges were not punishable under new york 
law 
district attorney jimmy evans who is running for state attorney 
general said the plea was an admission by the company that it 
invaded the territorial boundaries of a state with hardcore 
obscenity 
martin mccaffery vice president of the civil liberties union of 
alabama said the indictment lacked constitutional grounds and set 
a dangerous precedent 
if he evans is really out to protect 12yearolds he should 
be going after tobacco companies mccaffery said 
the indictment stemmed from an obscenity law enacted in alabama 
last year evans said his office began to investigate after 
complaints from parents whose children bought copies of adult 
movies that had been videotaped from television by schoolmates 
the indictment led to home dishs american exxxstasy channel and 
tuxxedo channel being pulled off the air home dish went out of 
business after satellite owners refused to transmit its hardcore 
and rrated movies 
home dish was charged for broadcasting the movies santa comes 
twice and young girls do 
ron wise a lawyer for the company declined to say why it 
pleaded guilty since cuomo blocked extradition of the four 
executives board chairman paul klein his wife janet klein the 
companys vice president president jeffrey younger and treasurer 
robert kramer 
jean faucett executive director of citizens against pornography 
of alabama commended evans for securing the guilty plea but said 
it wont erase images placed in the minds of youngsters by the 
movies 
we have a lot of studies that deal with the harmful effects of 
pornography that the violent sexual images if they are received 
at a young enough age will fuse with the normal sexual appetite 
she said 
the damage done to those children can never be undone there 
is no amount of money that can pay for that 
the plea signals to prosecutors nationwide that local obscenity 
standards can be enforced against offenders based outside their 
areas evans said 
evans said the films depict graphic scenes of sadomasochism 
incest oral and anal intercourse and multiple vaginal 
intercourse 
at its height home dish had 12 million cable tv customers and 
80000 satellite subscribers 
home dish was fined 5000 and paid 75000 each to two 
childrens homes as part of the penalty evans said his office 
selected the charities father purcell exceptional children center 
and brantwood childrens home 
obscenity charges against us satellite corp of murray utah 
were dismissed charges are still pending against gte spacenet 
which owns the satellite used to broadcast the nowdefunct american 
exxxstasy channel

a lawyers group and medical experts joined 
tuesday to urge the government to strengthen safeguards for people 
with asthma who use an effective but potentially dangerous drug 
they said that overthecounter asthma medications containing 
the drug theophylline should be banned and that prescribing 
physicians and their patients should be aware of the potential 
hazards associated with it 
our message about theophylline is that this medication can be 
a lifesaver or a lifetaker said michael maher president of 
the trial lawyers of america 
scheringplough the leading manufacturer of theophylline 
products called the lawyers action a selfserving publicity 
campaign that will unduly alarm asthma patients and interfere 
with doctorpatient relationships by overstating ad 
overdramatizing the known risks of theophylline 
company officials said their theophylline products have had a 
good safety record with more than 60 million prescriptions written 
in the past five years adverse reactions amounted to 13 per 
100000 prescriptions said david pernock a company marketing 
executive 
scheringplough however does not make any nonprescription 
theophylline products because we feel it is a drug that should be 
monitored he said 
the food and drug administration banned overthecounter sales 
of theophylline as a singleingredient product in 1986 two years 
ago the agency proposed a ban on other nonprescription uses of the 
drug 
the lawyers group last week sent a letter to the food and drug 
administration saying it knew of 26 preventable 
theophyllinerelated incidents of death or serious injury since 
1975 
about 10 million americans most of them children suffer from 
asthma which causes about 5000 deaths a year 
though not a cure theophylline a chemical cousin of caffeine 
is the most widely prescribed remedy to ease breathing and has been 
on the market for more than 40 years 
but said the lawyers and medical critics of overthecounter 
sales of the chemical theophylline is also one of the most 
difficult drugs to administer and control in patients it can be 
tricky to find an effective dose without letting the drug reach 
toxic levels 
a safe dose can quickly become toxic if certain other drugs are 
also taken with it or if the patient has taken overthecounter 
remedies containing theophylline also the flu can turn a safe 
dose toxic because the illness slows the bodys elimination of the 
drug and the symptoms of toxicity are the same as for the flu 
nausea vomiting irritability and fever 
jeffry pollock of everett wash said he wished he had known 
that when a pediatrician increased the dose of theophylline 
prescribed for his daughter jennifer in 1986 when she had the flu 
within 48 hours she began having convulsions and suffered brain 
damage he said now 7 jennifer functions at the level of a 6 to 
8monthold he said 
theophylline was a big help to jennifer when she needed it to 
help her breathing but it also caused severe brain damage that 
jennifer will never be able to fully recover pollock said 
the lawyers and medical critics said patients should not 
discontinue their medication without consulting doctors but they 
also said theophylline should not be available in nonprescription 
medications 
in addition they recommended that potential hazards be more 
clearly outlined in warnings given to physicians and that 
simplified warnings in monmedical language also be given to 
patients and they said doctors should monitor the drug levels in 
their patients with regular blood tests 
theophylline is an important and useful medication and it 
needs to be made available said theodore rall a pharmacology 
professor at the university of virginia medical school who said he 
has used theophylline but i would urge that great caution be 
used 
allan weinstein an asthma expert at georgetown university 
hospital said that as with other drugs physicians should not 
prescribe theophylline unless they are comfortable with it 
theophylline is a product that requires close supervision by a 
physician who is aware of its side effects and possible hazards 
said weinstein who appeared at a briefing with pernock but said he 
had no ties to scheringplough

general cinema corp taking advantage of its 
large pool of available cash said tuesday it would acquire from 
the public the 40 percent stake in neiman marcus group it does not 
already own 
the company said it would pay 1440 per share for the stock in 
the specialty retailer 
but investors apparently were looking for a higher price they 
bid neiman marcus stock 337 a share higher to 1462 on the new 
york stock exchange 
general cinema which also owns movie theatres holds 60 
percent or 163 million shares of neiman marcus the company said 
it expects to pay 240 million in cash to purchase the remaining 40 
percent stake 
peter farwell a vice president at general cinema said the 
company has between 15 billion and 16 billion in cash thanks 
to the sale of its bottling business in march and the sale of its 
shares in cadbury schweppes plc last month 
those sales put them in the unusually good position to make 
acquisitions when a business is selling for cheap said david 
jackson an analyst with the western group in new york 
although the retailing field is sluggish now jackson said 
neiman marcus is a good longterm investment for general cinema 
specialty retailing has grown much faster than department 
stores he said they key in on items customers want rather 
than try to sell them the world 
neiman marcus group consists of neiman marcus bergdorf goodman 
and contempo casuals stores the group once part of carter hawley 
hale stores inc became 60percent owned by general cinema and 
40percent owned by the public in a 1987 restructuring 
farwell said general cinema is also lookng for a third market to 
break into with some of its remaining cash 
were looking for something outside retailing for 
diversity he said farwell would not speculate on what type of 
company general cinema might try to buy next 
for the year ending aug 4 1990 neiman marcus group had 
revenue of 169 billion and earnings of 282 million 
general cinema owns 1450 movie screens nationwide

britain and france were linked beneath the 
english channel on tuesday when workers used a twoinch probe to 
connect two halves of a 31mile undersea rail tunnel officials 
reported 
management sources at transmanche link the construction 
consortium building the chunnel the channel tunnel 
confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 825 pm when british 
workers sent the probe through to french colleagues 
it is an example of what europe is about british prime 
minister margaret thatcher said in london this is europe in 
practice 
the linkup fulfills a dream by napoleon in 1802 who thought he 
could defeat the english by connecting britain to europe with a 
land passage the chunnel is scheduled for completion in june 1993 
this is a hugely historic moment because it means in effect 
that britain is no longer an island said a construction union 
official 
eight workers suffered injuries two seriously about 90 minutes 
later when a tractor towing supplies rolled over on them in a 
service gallery authorities in nearby sangatte reported 
the basic goal of the channel tunnel project is to enable 
passengers to travel between london and paris in about three hours 
that time is comparable to flying if transport to and from 
airports is included and is half the time of a carferry journey 
the conservative daily express newspaper noted in its wednesday 
editions that britons would theoretically be able to walk to france 
for the first time since the last ice age 
the cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of 
94 billion to 167 billion including an extra 197 billion for 
unforeseen cost overruns 
the threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the 
english channel marks a major turning point in three years of 
drilling on the worlds costliest tunnel 
the meeting point was just over 13 miles southeast of 
shakespeare cliff the british terminus near the town of dover and 
10 miles northwest of the french town of sangatte near calais 
the tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side accounting 
for its total length of 31 miles geological conditions account for 
the different progress on each side 
french workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their british 
counterparts and relayed the news to transmanche officials the 
first champagne corks popped minutes later 
its an exciting moment its the first time we have air 
passing between the two tunnels said gordon crighton tunnel 
engineering manager 
we see it as just another exercise but im sure there will be 
a lot of parties going on he said 
preliminary tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of 
alignment another day will be needed to be certain technicians 
said but they called the lineup exceptional considering the 
massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories 
high 
the workers will now bore out a oneyard hole to permit passage 
from one half to the other they are expected to greet each other 
with handshakes in a few weeks 
two japanesedesigned boring machines are drilling the tunnel 
after it is finished one will be dismantled and hauled out in 
pieces the other will drill its own grave and be buried in cement 
because french officials said it will be too costly to extricate 
it 
a work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding 
more pay on the french side appeared likely monday to stall the 
linkup until the weekend or beyond 
but transmanche officials said earlier tuesday that the meeting 
in the middle would occur on schedule 
the chunnel actually consists of three tunnels two for railway 
trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them 
taking into account all the tunnels 80 percent of the drilling 
has been completed by giant japanesebuilt boring machines working 
from calais and folkstone england 
tuesdays linkup in the service tunnel is described by the 
french as a mouse ole a bore only two inches in diameter 
president francois mitterrand and mrs thatcher are expected to 
meet each other in the tunnel jan 26 after the digging for much 
of the tunnel is finished the first coupling of the two rail 
tunnels is scheduled for mid1991 
eurotunnel plc the worlds largest engineering project 
announced oct 8 that it had reached an agreement with its banks on 
35 billion in new credit more than 200 banks are involved in the 
financing 
the chunnels scheduled debut in mid1993 would come six months 
after the 12nation european community formally drops remaining 
trade barriers becoming a unified marketplace of 320 million 
consumers 
officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in 
the first year of operation although eurotunnel doesnt expect a 
profit until the end of the century 
a study released last friday in paris by transportation experts 
said the tunnels completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a 
wide area of continental europe 
some britons have worries of a different sort fearing an influx 
of ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals 
since construction began in late 1987 there have been seven 
deaths on the british side and two on the french five british 
firms were ordered last wednesday to stand trial on charges related 
to the death of a construction worker last year 
the undersea bond between the two hereditary enemies was 
envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a french engineer called albert 
mathieu 
napoleon wanted to build it but britain warned him off 
tunneling actually started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974 
but were abandoned
