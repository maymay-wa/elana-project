atlantas famous peachtree street will be 
turning peachy soon 
members of the georgia peach commission a growerfinanced group 
that promotes the states peach crop will donate 20 trees next 
month during a ceremony in downtown atlanta 
during the national democratic convention in july visitors 
wondered why there were no peach trees said spokeswoman judy 
harmon i thought the peach commission should do something to 
remedy that 
ms harmon said she contacted atlanta officials and learned that 
the peach trees that once lined the street were not replaced when 
they died because they created a nuisance 
the fruit attracts bugs and the trees arent very tolerant of 
auto pollution she said during a recent interview at a meeting of 
peach growers in fort valley 
she said city officials were skeptical about planting peach trees 
along the street until she discovered a variety that produces 
beautiful blooms but no fruit 
thats what were going to plant she said 
atlanta began in the 1840s as the terminus of the western and 
atlantic railroad and peachtree street running northward along a 
line of ridges quickly became an important commercial and 
residential thoroughfare in the growing city 
beginning near woodruff park downtown the street runs through 
office hotel and business complexes further north peachtree is 
lined with stately homes built early in the century the road ends 
more than 40 miles from downtown atlanta in rural northeast georgia 
the peach commissions trees will be planted in woodruff park 
during a ceremony tentatively set for march 23 said ms harmon who 
hopes the tree planting will encourage others to plant peach trees 
along the street 
it restores some meaning to the name of peachtree she said

the five central american presidents showed 
more interest in making love than war last tuesday an appropriate 
activity for valentines day but the question now is whether 
anybody is going to cheat 
president bush says hes wary of the promises nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega made to hold a free and fair election 
because he believes the sandinista leader has been unfaithful in the 
past after making similar pledges 
but the four other leaders all friendly to the united states 
who assembled with ortega at a beachside resort in el salvador 
believed ortegas promises were heartfelt enough to give him the 
benefit of the doubt 
the result was unanimous agreement on a lengthy communique 
designed to lay the groundwork for two objectives all sides say they 
want peace and democracy in nicaragua 
rep david bonior dmich felt ortegas stated commitment in 
the communique to democracy was so convincing that the nicaraguan 
contras should declare victory 
i think this is what the contra forces in essence have been 
asking said bonior long a contra antagonist i think it 
presents a unique opportunity for them to take advantage 
but bush was more skeptical whats troubling me is that 
claims like this have been made at one time only to see those 
claims repudiated bush said thursday 
in return for his promises of democratic reform ortega got his 
colleagues from honduras costa rica el salvador and guatemala to 
agree to draw up a plan within 90 days that will lead to the 
demobilization of the contras 
that has been ortegas highest priority for years a year ago 
the us congress granted his wish to suspend military aid to the 
rebels now his neighbors are agreeing to their demobilization 
meanwhile the united states has been playing the unaccustomed 
role of bystander to events in central america the bush 
administration has yet to make some key appointments including some 
at the state department and has been occupied with other issues 
leaving a vacuum in central america which the five countries decided 
to fill this week 
the administrations hand in central america seems to get weaker 
by the day two years ago some in the administration had high hopes 
that the contras would be able to topple the sandinistas 
a year ago the goal was reduced to just getting congress to 
approve humanitarian aid for the rebels now the administration 
wants to find a way to head off the planned contra demobilization 
hoping that their continued existence if only as a potential 
military menace will induce ortega to keep his word 
at a minimum this has been an interesting week for the reagan 
doctrine the grand design of the former president to assist the 
contras and anticommunist rebels elsewhere who are fighting 
prosoviet regimes 
the contras were once the centerpiece of that doctrine but they 
are now reduced to what amounts to welfare recipients huddled in 
austere camps in honduras near the nicaraguan border living off 
usdonated food facing the specter of demobilization and praying 
that the political winds in washington will some day favor them 
again 
in contrast to the contras the news was somewhat better this 
week for another pet rebel group of reagans the afghan 
resistance the day after the central american presidents called for 
the demobilization of the contras the last soviet soldier withdrew 
from afghanistan in a major triumph both for us policy and for the 
antisoviet resistance 
but the sovietbacked regime is still in power and peace still 
seems distant in afghanistan as the two sides both heavilyarmed by 
their respective superpower patrons continue their struggle with 
the soviet army on the sidelines for the first time in nine years 
the united states pressed the soviets to withdraw for years but 
now that the kremlin has complied washington is escalating its 
objectives 
bush said it would not be fair for the united states to cut off 
aid to the rebels after the departing soviet soldiers left behind 
all those fighter aircraft helicopters tanks howitzers and other 
equipment 
so in afghanistan the somewhat incongruous valentines week 
prospect is for a lot more warmaking than lovemaking

president bush says he will continue helping 
rebel groups in afghanistan after the soviet armys withdrawal and 
fully intends to support the contras in nicaragua when their current 
aid expires next month 
bush said thursday he preferred a peaceful reconciliation in 
afghanistan but was concerned that departing soviet forces may have 
stockpiled weapons for the marxist government in kabul 
it would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal 
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and 
thus leave an uacceptable imbalance he said in a session with 
reporters in the oval office 
bushs remarks came a day after soviet troops completed their 
withdrawal their departure has caused widespread fears that a 
struggle for control by competing guerrilla groups could throw 
afghanistan into a civil war 
the time for recrimination is over bush said the time for 
bloodbaths is over and i would like to see the various factions get 
together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a 
peaceful afghanistan with no more bloodbaths 
turning to nicaragua and the rebels fighting the leftist 
sandinista government bush said i have every intention of seeing 
that these people receive humanitarian support but how that comes 
about well just have to wait and see 
bush made the statement even though administration officials 
acknowledge that congress has gained the upper hand on the question 
of giving assistance to the rebels the current aid program expires 
march 31 
new questions have been raised about us policy in central 
america as a result of the agreement by the presidents of five 
central american nations including nicaraguas daniel ortega to a 
peace plan that would produce free elections by february 1990 in 
exchange for dismantling the contra fighting force 
on other matters bush said 
he would strongly oppose any attempt to outlaw all 
semiautomatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols and 
rifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling the 
trigger the weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was used 
to kill five children in a stockton calif schoolyard last month 
the tedious pace of making personnel appointments has him 
fustrated but bush also said that i dont think its hurting the 
government 
he hopes his campaign for high ethical standards in government 
has not created something that just carries things too far 
he expressed sympathy for louis sullivan his nominee as 
secretary of health and human services who gave up accumulated 
sabbatical pay to join the government bush also said that secretary 
of state james a baker iii had made the right decision to sell 
stocks in a new york bank holding company that holds third world 
loans 
while applauding the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan as a 
new chapter in the history of that country bush said he does not 
accept the soviet call for a ceasefire and arms embargo 
during a soviet embassy news conference ministercounselor 
yevgeny kutovoy the secondranking official said the question at 
stake at the present time is this either restoration of peace on 
the afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed 
but state department spokesman charles redman said there has been 
massive stockpiling by the soviets in recent months 
supplies provided to the kabul regime reportedly include numerous 
fighter aircraft and helicopters dozens of medium tanks infantry 
fighting vehicles armored personnel carriers more than 200 
howitzers and scores of other artillery pieces and hundreds of 
transport vehicles

the battle for control of lebanons 
christian heartland will have a profound impact on efforts to hold 
this fractured country together 
the power struggle appears to be finely balanced between army 
commander michel aoun and samir geagea head of the lebanese forces 
the main christian militia but political figures say aoun must 
crush geageas heavily armed fighters quickly if he is to have any 
chance of victory 
should aoun come out on top he likely will emerge as lebanons 
next president filling a vacuum caused when amin gemayels term 
expired sept 22 no successor has been elected because christians 
opposed the syrianbacked candidates 
if geagea wins a senior moslem official said itll be the 
final divorce the irrevocable partition of lebanon and possibly 
a new round of civil war fighting 
electing aoun would make accommodation of syria and its lebanese 
moslem and leftist allies possible and avert the threatened 
formalization of lebanons partition into sectarian cantons 
removing geagea fiercely antisyrian and antimoslem has long 
been a key demand of syria and its lebanese allies who allege the 
militia commander has close ties with israel 
geagea says the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate are an occupation force and he demands 
their unconditional withdrawal as a precondition for a 
christianmoslem settlement 
aoun appears to be aiming to drive geagea out of east beirut 
isolating him north of the city so that the capital can be reunited 
and parliament convened to elect him president on a platform of 
reunifying the country 
minutes before gemayel stepped down he named aoun prime minister 
of a caretaker military government until a successor could be 
elected 
aoun sought to strengthen his presidential chances by forging a 
hasty and uneasy alliance with geagea 
that outraged syria and its allies they rejected aoun and 
supported the predominantly moslem cabinet of acting prime minister 
salim hoss that had governed under gemayel 
the split fractured the 42000man army long plagued by 
sectarian divisions and deepened prospects of formal partition 
western diplomats in east beirut doubt aouns troops will be able 
to swiftly dislodge the lebanese forces from their strongholds along 
25 miles of the mediterranean coast north of beirut 
the army has superior armor and firepower but theres the 
issue of loyalty said one diplomat who requested anonymity 
its questionable how long aouns troops and officers will be 
willing to press the campaign against their coreligionists in the 
lebanese forces 
most of the fighters on both sides are maronites and pressure 
for a ceasefire is escalating from the sects spiritual and 
political leaders 
aoun counts mainly on three brigades trained by us green 
berets as well as three battalions of commandos and military 
police these units total about 12000 men with 98 ussupplied 
m48 battle tanks and 50 frenchbuilt amx13 light tanks 
geageas militia has 6000 hardcore fighters with thousands more 
reservists geagea has 12 m48s plus 60 t54 tanks 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon but its peace efforts 
have bogged down in the countrys unending violence and the complex 
puzzle of its politics 
syrias alliance with iran has also been strained by a challenge 
from the tehranbacked hezbollah for supremacy of lebanons 1 
million shiite moslems the countrys largest sect 
hezbollah the mirror image of the lebanese forces on the moslem 
side seeks to create an islamic republic in lebanon 
its power has been weakened by syrias main surrogate the shiite 
amal militia in fighting aimed at eliminating hezbollahs moslem 
extremists that would make a christianmoslem settlement easier

gov william donald schaefer announced a 
tentative settlement of the 22week baltimore symphony orchestra 
strike late thursday night but released no details of the agreement 
the settlement ends the walkout that began last september and 
concludes the longest running symphony strike in american orchestral 
history 
for all intents and purposes the strike is over schaefer 
said at an 11 pm news conference 
the 96 members of the orchestra must still ratify the agreement 
which schaefer said could occur by this weekend the next bso 
concerts are scheduled for next thursday and friday nights 
if the strike had not been settled by monday the orchestra would 
have been forced to cancel its east coast tour scheduled for next 
month 
last november the players proposed a fouryear contract that 
would have brought their salaries to 1050 a week in the last six 
months of the 19911992 season 
management countered by offering a contract that would have paid 
the players a minimum of 1030 a week in the last three months of 
that season including guarantees for broadcast and recording work 
under the contract that expired in september the players had 
earned a minimum of 770 a week 
thursdays negotiating session at the state office building was 
the first between the two sides since mediated contract talks broke

the federal government and the states would 
have to spend at least 132 billion more to expand the medicaid 
program to cover all americans who live in poverty according to a 
coalition led by the american medical association 
the coalition proposed such a plan thursday to cover the 
estimated 11 million people whose incomes are below the federal 
poverty level but who do not now qualify for the health assistance 
program 
medicaid simply does not work adequately in its current form 
said james r tallon jr majority leader of the new york state 
assembly and chairman of the coalitions committee on medicaid we 
call for a system that truly cares for the needs of the poor 
though medicaid was established as a federalstate program to 
serve the medical needs of the poor fewer than half of the 33 
million americans below the poverty line are covered by the program 
the coalition said 
eligibility varies from state to state and as healthcare costs 
have soared states have trimmed growth in their medicaid costs by 
restricting eligibility 
as a result the average income threshold for eligibility in 1988 
was 4792 gross annual income for a family of three 49 percent of 
the federal poverty level of 9690 the report said in alabama 
the state with the lowest income threshold a family of three can 
earn no more than 1416 a year to qualify for medicaid 
the coalition called the health policy agenda for the american 
people said its plan to expand the medicaid program and improve 
benefits would cost 132 billion to 28 billion above current 
medicaid expenditures with most of the additional cost borne by the 
federal government 
we are placing before the people a tough statement that there 
is an unmet need it is well documented the program is falling 
substantially short it covers fewer than half the poor in the 
country and thats going to have to fall to government tallon 
said new resources have to be made available because we have a 
system thats crumbling 
in fiscal 1988 the federal government spent about 305 billion 
and the states spent about 205 billion on medicaid 
the coalition proposes to 
establish a standard benefits package states would be required 
to provide that would add 65 billion for a median package and 
up to 215 billion for a package that included more services 
set income eligibility for the program at no less than the 
federal poverty level and require eligibility for those with 
incomes above the poverty level who have extraordinary medical costs 
raise reimbursement rates for physicians and hospitals at least 
to the level of medicare rates which would cost an additional 44 
billion 
reimbursement rates have dropped so low that at least a quarter 
of the nations physicians dont treat medicaid patients raising 
rates would encourage greater participation by healthcare 
providers and more frequent appropriate visits by patients to 
physicians offices for preventive care the group said 
the report by the coalition which represents both business and 
labor interests stayed away from any recommendations on requiring 
employers to provide health insurance to their employees without 
such a requirement some employers who now provide insurance 
coverage for employees who would be covered by the expanded medicaid 
program might drop the private coverage potentially adding more 
than 5 billion to the cost of the expanded program 
however the coalition noted that requiring employerbased health 
insurance for all employees and their dependents would provide 
coverage to 56 million uninsured workers below the poverty line 
that would reduce the cost of the expanded program by an estimated 
46 billion the group said 
currently some 35 million americans have no health insurance 
the health policy agenda for the american people was organized in 
1982 by the american medical association the ama pays for most of 
the work of the coalition which is composed of 172 groups 
representing business labor consumers the elderly children and 
healthcare providers

in usda for example is still being performed by deputy secretary

one of the questions i have asked every one of these people is 
how hard theyre prepared to work because if they come theyre 
going to work awfully hard probably a lot harder then theyve ever 
worked before yeutter said

in agriculture are achieved as the new administration pursues the 
longtime us goal of reducing world trade barriers 
bush said yeutters name rhymes with fighter and that he is 
tough as nails knowledgeable thats why i picked him and i 
know hes going to fight hard for farming for fair trade and for 
all the other important responsibilities for this department

native of nebraska and has held many public and private posts

marine band and family members yeutters repeated oath of office 
was administered by supreme court justice sandra day oconnor who 
also had sworn him in as trade representative in 1985 
bush said yeutter is about to make an enduring commitment to 
this department and then told a story about a farmer making a 
breakfast of eggs and bacon to show the difference between 
involvement and commitment 
the chicken is involved but the pig is committed bush said

the bush administration flunked its first world 
trade test by caving in to pressure from abroad and cutting back on 
duty levels for imported sport utility vehicles and vans critics 
say 
at issue was a decision thursday in which the treasury department 
scaled back a customs service ruling and said only some foreignmade 
sport utility vehicles and vans will be reclassified as trucks 
the customs service in january had said it would classify all the 
vehicles as trucks upon which a 25 percent duty is imposed rather 
than as cars subject to a 25 percent duty 
after thursdays reversal us carmakers and members of congress 
from automaking states said the bush administration let itself be 
swayed by foreign lobbyists 
the bush administration clearly caved in to pressure from the 
japanese said sen donald riegle dmich this decision hurts 
america it costs us money and jobs 
michigans other senator democrat carl levin saw it the same 
way in its first major action on trade the bush administration 
has put the wrong foot forward 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association which represents 
domestic carmakers said the original ruling to boost duties had 
been the correct one 
the customs service ought to decide us trade practices not 
foreign manufacturers the association said 
foreign automakers were more conciliatory but said none of the 
affected vehicles should be subject to 25 percent duties which they 
characterized as a new tax by the nonewtaxes president 
they also raised the specter of higher sticker prices on both 
imported and domestic sport utility vehicles and vans 
toyota motor sales usa congratulated treasury for courage in 
the face of massive political pressure from detroit but said none 
of the vehicles should be classified as trucks 
curt bartsch a spokesman for nissan motor corp in usa said the 
treasury ruling reduces but does not eliminate the economic harm 
brought by the tax 
laura segall speaking for american suzuki motor corp said the 
ruling probably will mean overall more expensive sportutility 
vehicles being imported which will be followed by more expensive 
domestic sportutility vehicles 
the treasury department meanwhile characterized its decision as 
a technical matter based on legal classification issues rather 
than a reflection of us trade policy 
under past policy the vehicles sometimes were considered cars 
and sometimes were classified as trucks depending on whether they 
were fitted with back seats and other amenities fortyfour percent 
of the 239000 affected vehicles imported last year were classified 
as trucks 
under the plan announced thursday fourdoor sportutility 
vehicles will be classified as cars and twodoor models will be 
considered trucks vans will be considered cars if they feature rear 
seats rear windows and rear doors 
treasury officials said that had the same policy been in effect 
last year 66 percent of affected vehicles would have been 
classified as trucks bringing in another 83 million in duties

the massachusetts congressional delegation 
showed its liberal colors and wyoming was the most conservative 
state in 1988 according to a survey by the american conservative 
union 
a lawmaker with a rating of 100 percent is one who voted in 
accordance with the position of the conservative group in all 
instances in massachusetts the average score was just 369 in 
wyoming it was 973 
based on its selection of 22 key votes in the two chambers some 
of which the group gave double weight the acu said both the house 
and senate voted more conservatively in 1988 than in 1987 the 
average house rating went from 37 percent to 44 percent while the 
senate average went from 40 percent to 43 percent 
in both chambers however the move to the right was made easier 
by a lack of confrontation over tough budget issues last year due 
to the 1987 budget summit the group said 
last month the americans for democratic action a liberal group 
released a similar survey and declared that the congress had become 
more liberal 
the differences occur because the two groups base their surveys 
on different vote lists however the surveys do highlight the 
ideological differences between the parties 
the acu said four senators and 38 house members all republicans 
scored 100 percent the ada last month gave two senators and two 
dozen house members all democrats 100 percent ratings 
the conservative group in its rating gave double weight to votes 
on three issues aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels the override 
of president reagans veto of the grove city civil rights extension 
bill and a vote on shifting 100 million away from the star wars

the justice department plans to detain central 
american refugees in a tent city on isolated south texas 
brushland while their applications for political asylum are 
processed congressional officials say 
immigration and naturalization service spokesman duke austin said 
thursday that there had been no public disclosure of the bush 
administrations plans for handling the flood of refugees and that 
the issue was still under review 
but capitol hill officials disclosed the justice department plan 
to pitch tents on land adjacent to a minimumsecurity federal 
detention center now being used to process the refugees 
applications 
rep lamar smith rtexas said in a statement that the tent camp 
would meet basic human necessities of adequate housing food and 
sanitary conditions 
more than 2000 refugees from central america are crossing into 
the united states illegally every week most of them coming across 
the rio grande at brownsville from mexico officials say 
treatment of the refugees by ins has sparked a lawsuit us 
district judge filemon vela on jan 9 blocked an ins policy that had 
barred asylumseekers from traveling beyond the rio grande valley 
while their applications were pending under the ins policy many of 
the refugees had been relegated to squalid squatters camps lacking 
basic sanitation and other amenities 
a congressional aide speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the justice department hopes word of the tentcity detention center 
quickly reaches central america and discourages more amnestyseekers 
from coming to the united states 
ins officials contend that many are seeking only to better 
themselves economically and are not actually fleeing political 
repression advocates for the refugees say many ins decisions have 
been politically skewed because the us government is unwilling to 
admit the extent of repression by central american governments 
allied with the united states 
the justice department plans to keep the refugees in tents near 
the port isabel service processing center about 15 miles north of 
brownsville the congressional officials said

this week show a shift from the grandiose unity plans that once 
sowed hope suspicion and conflict throughout the arab world 
the arab cooperation council born thursday in baghdad and the 
union of maghreb arab countries under discussion in morocco reflect 
modern economic concerns including reduced trade barriers and the 
opening of internal markets 
their model is closer to the european common market than the 
illfated united arab republic that joined syria and egypt as a 
single nation from 1958 to 1961 
dozens of arab unity proposals have been born and died since the 
region gained its independence from european powers after world war 
ii frustrated by the borders dividing people with a common language 
and common culture 
many tried in a stroke to sweep away the frontiers physically 
unite armed forces or unify foreign policy virtually all efforts 
failed victims of internal rivalry external interference or 
shifting political tides 
but like the eec the new groupings have a political impact 
they have divided the arab world into three main economic blocs 
the sixnation gulf cooperation council in the arabian peninsula 
the fivecountry maghreb union stretching from libya to the atlantic 
and the arab cooperation council of iraq egypt jordan and north 
yemen 
if successful the new groupings will give their members access 
to wider markets that should make their farms and industries more 
efficient and enhance their bargaining power in the world economy 
it might also be easier for the three blocs to reach effective 
agreements on economic cooperation than it has been for the 21 
individual arab countries 
the gulf cooperation council formed in 1981 evolved into a 
military and olitical alliance under the threat of the iraniraq war 
while the leaders of the new arab council deny plans to form a 
military bloc or a political alliance egypt iraq and jordan 
already cooperate militarily in some ways 
they also include two of the arab worlds strongest military 
forces iraq and egypt as well as one of the best trained jordan 
several of the leaders have acknowledged their economic 
cooperation has political implications their charter said they 
acted in part to enhance panarab security against current or 
future threats 
but while they have left the door open to other states the union 
will arouse apprehension in other quarters 
syrian leaders cannot enjoy watching jordanian tv reach into 
syrian homes with celebratory broadcasts of singers lauding iraqi 
president saddam hussein as saddam the joy 
they remain deeply at odds with both egypt and iraq which have 
tightened their embrace of a syrian friend jordan 
the union adds to syrias isolation already aggravated by arab 
support for iraq in the persian gulf war where fighting was halted 
aug 20 under a unsponsored ceasefire and egypts reintegration 
into the arab fold after years of estrangement following its 1979 
peace treaty with israel 
the new council also helps cement egypts return to the arab 
world 
but the political clout of the arab council will be limited by 
economic difficulties faced by all four countries as well as by 
outside interests all still maintain 
jordan iraq and egypt particularly look to saudi arabia for 
economic aid and can ill afford to alienate it 
the new agreement ties iraq to arab countries lying to the west 
but baghdad is counting on money from its southern gulf neighbors to 
help finance postwar reconstruction

air pollution last summer was the worst of the 
decade and the number of cities where ozone exceeded federally 
approved levels jumped 41 percent according to preliminary federal 
figures 
this new information shows the clear fallacy in industry 
arguments that americas air pollution problems are solving 
themselves said rep henry waxman dcalif who made the figures 
public on thursday 
a year ago the environmental protection agency listed 68 cities 
that had recorded peak ozone levels considered unsafe under federal 
standards last summer the number jumped to 96 metropolitan areas 
plus two areas considered to be rural 
the house subcommittee on health and environment chaired by 
waxman had requested the data from the federal agency 
epa officials said the data were only preliminary and had not 
been thoroughly analyzed but they acknowledged the findings 
indicate a significant increase in urban pollution in 1988 and 
suggested that when the final numbers are evaluated from all 
monitoring points the number of cities where pollution exceeds 
federal standards could exceed 100 
the preliminary data submitted to waxmans subcommittee show peak 
daily ozone pollution levels last summer were on average 5 percent 
higher than in 1983 which had been widely regarded as having the 
worst ozone pollution this decade last summers levels of ozone a 
key component of smog were on average 14 percent greater than those 
in 1987 
waxman called the data startling enough to affect the 
congressional debate on how to strengthen federal air pollution laws 
i expect this data to give a strong boost to congressional 
efforts to establish long overdue new pollution control requirements 
for the automobiles factories power plants and other pollution 
sources which contribute to the urban smog that now afflicts almost 
every american city said waxman 
waxmans subcommittee has scheduled a hearing later this month on 
the health impact of the air pollution he said the latest epa data 
indicate that more than 100 million americans now live in cities 
with levels of ozone or carbon monoxide pollution than exceed what 
the federal government considers safe 
ozone pollution caused by a variety of emissions from cars and 
trucks as well as industrial plants and factories causes coughing 
and chest pains and has been linked by some scientists to permanent 
lung damage 
according to the epa findings twothirds of the agencys 323 
monitoring sites reported higher ozone pollution levels last summer 
than in any other summer this decade 
the information which was collected by the epa from state and 
local air pollution control agencies covered the period from april 
through october 1988 the epa suggested that the hot summer 
contributed to the ozone problem 
the additional areas that were classified in 1988 as exceeding 
federal ozone pollution levels were 
manchester nh buffalo glen falls and adjacent essex county 
and poughkeepsie all in new york state sussex county del 
altoona erie johnstown lancaster harrisburg reading scranton 
and sharon all in pennsylvania charleston and greenbrier county in 
west virginia 
fayetteville and greensboro in north carolina greenville and 
adjacent cherokee county in south carolina knoxville tenn 
lafayette ind canton columbus dayton toledo and youngstown 
all in ohio lake charles la kansas city mo and denver 
an area is considered to have exceeded the federal levels if it 
has a daily peak ozone level of more than 012 parts per million of 
pollutant

the government should spend 13 billion over 
the next decade to provide enough commercial ships for massive troop 
and equipment movements should war break out a special maritime 
commission says 
despite that figure the real cost to the government would be 
about 57 billion because of the tax revenues generated by the new 
ships and facilities the commission on merchant marine and defense 
said 
the commission presented its proposals for legislative and 
private action to president bush on thursday but its chairman 
former gop sen jeremiah denton said bush made no commitment to 
seek the funds 
the commissions proposals include a package of legislation aimed 
at adding 244 ships that could be used to meet military needs some 
of the ships would be built abroad to allow shippers to become more 
quickly competitive internationally the report said 
another commission member retired navy adm james l holloway 
iii said the country probably has only 70 percent to 80 percent of 
the commercial ships that might be needed in an emergency 
if a crisis erupted someplace around the world we do not have 
enough ships under the american flag to support a planned 
operation holloway said 
holloway said the maritime defense issue has not been critical in 
the past because it was assumed us allies could provide ships if 
necessary but he said the united states may have to go it 
alone such as it did for a time in protecting persian gulf 
shipping 
troops and supplies likely would be available he said but we 
dont have the sealift to move them 
in addition to increased ship building the commission recommends 
adding 8208 mariners improving ship repair yards countering 
unfair foreign trade tactics against the us maritime industry and 
making several reforms in laws affecting the industry

unofficial ruling somewhat vindicated a controversial decision by a 
referee 62 years ago 
in front of chuckling onlookers at ringside at the mock court

choppelas declared the longcount controversy null and void 
gene tunney deserves full credit for the victory the judge 
said 
almost all the evidence was in tunneys corner tunneys son 
former sen john v tunney said the long count in which his father 
lay on the canvas for nine of the slowest counts in the history of 
boxing was the luckiest thing that ever happened to either 
fighter 
it kept their names in the public forum and gave added luster 
to both their careers tunney said 
if the controversy over the famous 1927 title fight was heated 
wednesdays session was not but thats not unusual for the court of

un peacekeeping forces are due in namibia 
this weekend to begin overseeing the nations transition to 
independence after 74 years of south african rule 
commissioner steven fanning head of a un police unit that will 
monitor namibias national police force was to arrive today in that 
country said martti ahtisaari the special un representative for 
namibia 
fanning is to hold weekend talks with namibian police officials 
ahtisaari said thursday 
namibian police which includes some south african officers will 
remain responsible for civil order but will be supervised by 500 
un police officers 
the un move into namibia follows the security councils 
unanimous adoption of a resolution thursday authorizing namibias 
independence process 
south africa has ruled namibia also known as southwest africa 
since it captured the territory from germany during world war i 
early next week gen dewan prem chand the commander of the 
military peacekeeping contingent will arrive with more 
administrators said ahtisaari 
the security council set april 1 was set as the date to begin the 
oneyear plan for namibias transition to an independent black 
majorityruled nation 
they also approved a report by secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar that calls for sending 4650 un military peacekeepers 500 
police supervisors and at least 1000 civilian election monitors to 
namibia 
un officials have not yet worked out which countries will 
provide personnel for the peacekeeping force but for the first time 
china has offered to send up to 20 election monitors said an asian 
diplomat 
perez de cuellar has estimated the effort will cost 416 million 
in its first year making it the biggest un peacekeeping mission 
since the belgian congo operation of 196064 which cost more than 
400 million and involved 19828 soldiers at its peak 
the general assembly on thursday approved funds for a 70man team 
of un military observers who will monitor the withdrawal of 50000 
cuban troops from angola as neighboring namibia becomes independent 
that group was budgeted at 92 million for this year and a 
total of 194 million during its entire 31month mandate of 
overseeing the cuban withdrawal 
in december south africa cuba and angola signed accords at un 
headquarters pledging their cooperation with a southwest african 
peace plan that includes the cuban pullout and namibian independence 
south africa refused to relinquish control of namibia without the 
withdrawal of the cuban troops saying their presence just over 
namibias northern border could intimidate voters during the 
independence process 
all cuban troops are to be out of angola by july 1991 
cuban troops have been in angola at that countrys request since 
1975 to defend it from attacks by south african troops and the 
usbacked rebels of the national union for the total liberation of 
angola

a house narcotics committees report on drug 
use says the problem will become even graver without greater 
international cooperation 
citing an increase in cocainerelated deaths last year the 
report said with the continued influx of cocaine into this 
country the prospects for any change in this situation in the near 
future are not promising 
the report by the house select committee on narcotics abuse and 
control added that current estimates of the scope of drug abuse may 
understate the problem 
without a concerted international commitment including a 
hemispheric drug summit and without increased resources at home 
the future picture is bleak chairman charles rangel dny said 
thursday 
the report said indicators showed an increase last year in coca 
and cocaine production and trafficking as well as greater opium and 
marijuana cultivation despite reports of stepped up eradication 
efforts in some countries 
the report catalogued a substantial haul of narcotics intercepted 
by federal agencies on their way into the united states but noted 
official estimates that the amount intercepted represents no more 
than 5 percent to 15 percent of what comes across the border 
despite the best efforts drugs continue to flood our 
borders because of bumper crops in producing countries the report 
said it said that the influx of drugs places a significant burden 
on federal state and local law enforcement efforts 
the panel also estimated that 6 million to 65 million americans 
need drug abuse treatment and said there are 11 million to 13 
million intravenous drug abusers 
currently however there are only about 250000 treatment slots 
according to the committee it said about 148000 are for 
intravenous abusers 
long waiting lists are common in many areas it said 
moreover there is no measure of those who are discouraged from 
even applying 
the panel said hospital emergency rooms recorded 1696 
cocainerelated deaths last year up from 604 such cases in 1984

one small step for a cat can turn into a giant leap 
when the feline lives in a highrise but a surprising number of the 
animals survive such falls veterinarians say 
sheila greenbergs fluffy brown himalayan two years ago took the 
plunge a 300foot fall down 24 floors at a condominium in the 
miami area and today is alive and well 
baily suffered no fractures according to neil tenzer who 
treated the feline for an internal injury 
sheldon steinmetz a north miami beach veterinarian said split 
palates and broken jaws are common because the cats land on their 
feet and as their bodies hit chins hit the ground 
their survival also seems to have a lot to do with heavy 
landscaping and the terminal velocity factor because of their 
weight and shape cats fall at a top speed of 60 miles per hour 
humans fall as fast as 120 mph 
theyre pretty incredible creatures steinmetz said 
veterinarian william marks says the cats often take a leap 
because of taunting by birds 
the cats out on the terrace he said there are birds out 
on the terrace the cat leaps at the bird the bird flies away the 
cat keeps going 
the cats are not that stupid he added in their defense 
but they are instinctive hunters 
studies have been done on cats with high rise syndrome in a new 
york city study of 132 fallings cats a mixed breed named sabrina 
took the record by surviving a 32story fall to a concrete sidewalk 
she chipped a tooth 
baily who may have the local record in miami apparently was 
cushioned by trees when she fell she was conscious and dazed but 
quite alive when her owner rushed downstairs 
we decided the cat really may know how to fly ms greenberg

federal regulators should unleash us 
telecommunications companies in the world marketplace but keep a 
tight rein on the regional bell companies the chairman of american 
telephone amp telegraph co says 
robert e allen said thursday that the bell companies that were 
created in the 1984 breakup of atampt are monopolies and should be 
regulated as such to allow them into the longdistance and 
manufacturing arenas as congress and the courts are considering 
would turn back the clock on the post1984 gains such as lower 
equipment prices lower longdistance rates and more widespread use 
of telephones he said 
the bell companies could potentially do a lot of damage to 
competitors in markets currently protected by the 1984 consent 
decree allen said at a meeting of the federal communications bar 
association 
if that happens he said the force of antitrust law will 
be blunted competition may wane and consumers may suffer 
he said that under the decree which prevented the regional bell 
companies from manufacturing equipment or providing longdistance or 
information services suppliers have flourished spurred by the 
knowledge that the regional bell companies have no inside 
manufacturer with an inside track 
allowing them to manufacture would not improve the nations trade 
deficit or create new jobs allen said 
the regional companies would be inclined to go overseas to buy 
critical switches for phone equipment because of the high costs of 
developing their own allen said 
to get into this business would mean alliances between the 
regional bell companies and switching companies in japan germany 
sweden france canada or great britain he said 
he said that while the united states debates the regulation 
issue foreign competitors are racing ahead thanks to government 
subsidies 
he said he wasnt calling for subsidies but for the government to 
unleash the competitive information industry in this country 
regulators need to act where they are clearly free to do so 
to enhance rather than hinder the competitiveness of american 
business he said 
allen who assumed the atampt chairmanship last april said there 
should be less regulation in competitive marketplaces such as 
longdistance calling where about 500 companies including mci 
communications corp and us sprint are battling atampt 
in the competitive part of the industry regulators have been 
slow to remove restraints this has denied the nation the full 
benefit of all competitors being able to compete flat out and this 
in turn penalizes america when it needs the very best technology to 
succeed in a time of intense international competition he said 
divestiture worked he said of the atampt breakup it 
promised protection of consumers by driving a clean wedge between 
the monopoly markets and the competitive markets 
he said atampt now was just one of many communications networks in 
the nation he said it was unfair that it be regulated in a 
competitive marketplace while leaders in other industries such as 
computers are not 
one is overly restrained the other is not restrained at 
all allen said

news reports about a man who threatened to 
sue a teacher for cutting his sons hair got the attention of police 
who arrested him for failing to complete a court sentence on an 
unrelated matter 
jack kotnik 34 of elyria was arrested wednesday on a bench 
warrant issued by municipal court judge john howard in january 1988 
for allegedly failing to attend classes as part of a drunken driving 
sentence 
the arrest came after news reports about kotniks 7yearold son 
and a firstgrade classmate who had their tails a long lock of 
hair hanging from the nape of the neck cut last week by their 
teacher katherine abba 
the teacher has been suspended pending an investigation 
meanwhile sharon kimble the mother of the other boy whose hair 
was cut said thursday that she and her husband had decided to press 
assault charges against the teacher claiming the youngster was 
bruised while being held down to have his hair cut 
ms abba initially that she had cut the students hair as a 
disciplinary measure but later declined comment on the matter calls 
to her home thursday went unanswered

a black firefighter who was airbrushed out 
of a photograph in a unions newsletter can sue the group for 
emotional distress a superior court judge has ruled 
the omission of charles johnson from the august 1987 photo did 
not amount to a statement that was libelous or portrayed him in a 
false light said judge stuart pollak dismissing those two counts 
of johnsons suit 
but in the ruling wednesday pollak said johnson could sue 
firefighters local 798 and two members involved in the newsletter 
for intentional infliction of emotional distress which requires 
proof of outrageous conduct 
johnson was one of several san francisco firefighters honored for 
a rescue effort the photograph in the unions newsletter mainline 
was altered to remove johnson the only black and only nonunion 
member in the group johnson belongs to the black firefighters 
association a separate organization 
in his suit he said the omission caused him humiliation and 
stress that kept him off the job 
the incident happened within a few months of the discovery of a 
swastika in an office used by two minority firefighters and the 
manhandling by whites of an officer involved in a department 
training program for women and minorities 
those episodes were cited by a federal judge who pronounced the 
fire department out of control in january 1988 shortly 
afterward chief edward phipps resigned and was succeeded by 
frederick postel 
the union apologized to johnson over the photograph but said he 
was omitted only because he was not a member of the union which has 
some minority members 
i have a hard time accepting the idea that a union or any other 
organization has a duty to publish pictures of nonmembers said 
duane reno a lawyer for local 798 even if the person does feel 
left out there should be a privilege that says the organization is 
free to grant publicity to its members 
he said the union would make another attempt to dismiss the 
emotional distress claim before trial 
howard moore johnsons lawyer said the suit would be redrafted 
to try to reinstate the libel and false light claims

the epa is forbidding use of the fungicide 
captan on lemons potatoes soybeans and 39 other crops but other 
favorites such as apples grapes and onions are among the twodozen 
foods exempt from the new rule 
the environmental protection agency said in its announcement 
thursday that it decided against an outright ban such as it had 
proposed in 1985 because the benefits of some uses of captan 
outweigh the risk from dietary exposure 
where it may continue to be used the risk of a person getting 
cancer from such exposure is less than one in 1 million the agency 
said the epa estimates that about 10 million pounds of the chemical 
is used each year 
captan was classified by the epa as probably causing cancer 
because exposure to the chemical had caused laboratory mice and 
rates to develop tumors 
some environmental groups have urged the government to ban the 
chemical altogether and expressed disappointment in the epa 
decision we are now telling people to wash their fruit and write 
your congressman said rick hind a spokesman for the us public 
interest research group 
the epa began looking into the possible dangers of captan in 1980 
and suggested four years ago that the risk of cancer is significant 
enough that a ban might be warranted 
but john moore epas acting deputy administrator said thursday 
that studies since 1985 have shown the health risk to be 
considerably less than once thought we are looking at theoretical 
lifetime cancer risks that are 100 to 1000 times lower than we 
previously projected he said in a statement 
moore said the agencys decision to allow continued use of captan 
on some food products is based on data which are a more realistic 
reflection of the actual residues of this pesticide found in the 
diet 
officials said the exposure estimates used four years ago were 
based on an assumption that 100 percent of each crop received 
maximum exposure to the chemical since then actual field data have 
shown the exposure estimates to be much lower the epa said 
the epa says captan may no longer be used on avocados beans 
beets broccoli brussels sprouts culp onions cabbage carrots 
cantaloupes cauliflower celery collards cotton crab apple 
cranberries cucumber eggplant grapefruit honeydew kale leeks 
lemons limes muskmelon mustard greens oranges pears peas 
pineapples potatoes pumpkins quince rhubarb rutabaga shallots

foreign submarines probed waters off 
sweden last year as often as before but appeared to back off after 
swedish forces fired at a suspected intruder the military said in 
its annual report 
the eightpage report that was released thursday said in spite 
of a number of observations technical indications and 
wellcoordinated action by antisubmarine warfare units we have no 
evidence of the nationality involved 
but the svenska dagbladet daily newspaper said the soviet union 
was singled out in a secret appendix to the report submitted to 
prime minister ingvar carlssons government 
the soviets have denied sending submarines into swedish territory 
since 1981 when a vessel washed onto the rocks outside a major 
swedish naval base moscow called that incident a mistake 
supreme commander gen bengt gustafsson told reporters the 
military had some ideas about the identity of the intruders but not 
enough to warrant diplomatic action 
naval commander vice admiral bengt schuback told a military 
seminar last month there was little doubt the intruders were soviet 
vessels 
they cant come from anywhere but hidden bases in the baltic 
and we know western countries have no such bases he said 
gustafsson said there had been a drop in the number of intrusions 
since late last year when the one who is violating our territorial 
waters began to act more carefully after the government fired on 
the suspected intruding sub last june off the coast 
gustafsson said the livefire response followed 
governmentaprroved guidelines established in 1987 to prevent 
intruders from escaping

community activists say they are heartened by 
the federal reserve boards decision to strengthen enforcement of a 
12yearold law forbidding loan discrimination against neighborhoods 
the reaction thursday followed the feds rejection of a request 
by the chicagobased continental bank corp the nations 11th 
largest to purchase a small arizona bank it cited continentals 
lackluster record of serving poor neighborhoods as required by the 
community reinvestment act 
the law passed in 1977 is aimed at preventing redlining 
the practice of denying loans to an entire neighborhood based on the 
predominant race or economic class of its residents 
although the fed had previously granted merger requests on the 
condition that the banks applying did a better job of community 
reinvestment in the future it had never denied an application 
we hope this is the beginning of a trend said allen 
fishbein general counsel of the center for community change a 
washingtonbased group concerned with housing and community 
development for a board composed entirely of reagan 
administration appointees this is an unprecedented step 
diane casey director of regulatory affairs for the independent 
bankers association of america said the fed appears to be trying to 
head off action in congress which last year considered several 
measures requiring regulators to more vigorously enforce 
antiredlining laws 
i think the fed is letting congress know that the existing law 
is more than strong enough for the fed to take action and that 
means you dont have to go through a significant restructuring of 
the act she said 
however rep henry b gonzalez dtexas and chairman of the 
house banking committee said members of his panel were still very 
interested in toughening the law 
the interest here is still intense he said the feds 
isolated and late awakening has to be viewed in the light of its 
prior compliance or lack of compliance 
continentals 14monthold petition to acquire grand canyon state 
bank in scottsdale ariz was rejected on a 42 vote wednesday 
with board members h robert heller and john laware opposed edward 
w kelley jr did not vote 
we feel that the fed has finally put teeth into the law said 
michael zucker an international representative of the amalgamated 
clothing and textile workers union which had lodged a formal 
complaint against continentals application 
zucker said continental never has done a good job of lending to 
the lowincome and minority community of chicago he described 
grand canyon as a boutique bank catering to affluent customers 
in suburban phoenix 
however thomas c theobald the chairman of continental said he 
was astounded and outraged at the feds decision we have an 
excellent and always improving record of community support he 
said 
the central banks 10page majority decision said given 
continentals size the banks participation in community 
development and redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory 
it noted the bank has since developed a plan that should make 
substantial contribution to correcting the past deficiencies but 
added the board does not believe that commitments by themselves 
can serve as a substitute for the established record of 
performance 
the fed also voiced concern about the banks plan to expand while 
still financed in part by and subject to the control of federal 
deposit insurance corp as the result of a 1984 federal rescue

a us human rights organization accuses the 
khmer rouge of resorting to atrocities against cambodian refugees 
that are chillingly reminiscent of policies blamed for more than 
1 million deaths in 197579 
asia watch a private monitoring group said nearly 100000 
refugees are virtual prisoners in camps in thailand but controlled 
by the khmer rouge the marxist group that ruled cambodia from 1975 
into 1979 
it said the refugees are subjected to torture summary 
executions forced labor denial of food and exposure to mines and 
shelling 
in the camps policies that have made them international 
pariahs are again pursued by the khmer rouge asia watch said in a 
45page report based on recent interviews along the border and news 
dispatches 
systematic human rights abuses and the determination to 
keep refugees away from the contaminating influence of western and 
international aid agencies are chillingly reminiscent of the 
barbarous practices that characterized khmer rouge rule in cambodia 
from 197579 it said 
marked by purges starvation and depopulation of cities those 
years became known as the killing fields era the title of a 
us motion picture on the period 
the international community must now insist that refugees in 
khmer rougecontrolled camps be allowed to choose whether they wish 
to remain in those camps or be transferred elsewhere it said 
the report was issued thursday on the eve of weekend diplomatic 
talks in jakarta indonesia aimed at ending the 10year vietnamese 
occupation of cambodia that ended khmer rouge rule 
asia watch said recent khmer rouge activities suggest a coming 
bid to regain power in cambodia and that thailand should be 
persuaded to crack down against the group 
the united states numerous human rights organizations and asian 
governments participating in the jakarta talks all have declared 
opposition to a return of khmer rouge control 
the report said there is a danger that protection of the 
cambodian refugees will be overlooked during fastpaced diplomatic 
activity on cambodia involving china the soviet union vietnam and 
the association of southeast asian nations 
a change in thai government policy is the first step asia 
watch said international pressure on thailand to establish and 
enforce international access to all refugee camps is essential 
the thais seeking to use the khmer rouge as a buffer between 
the thai military and vietnamese forces inside cambodia have 
acquiesced in the khmer rouges refusal to let civilians who wish to 
do so leave camps under its control it said 
but a new phase of the conflict with prospects for vietnamese 
withdrawal and solution of cambodias external problems no longer 
justifies this it added 
asia watch said the khmer rouge depend on thailand for food arms 
and other logistical support 
weapons supply to the khmer rouge and the transfer of these 
weapons across the thai border into cambodia should be terminated 
immediately it said it is clear from its efforts to 
stockpile weapons inside cambodia that the khmer rouge is preparing 
for a protracted war 
asia watch described teenagers and women forced to carry weapons 
and ammunition from thailand across heavily mined frontier zones 
into cambodia with heavy casualties denial of medical care and 
abandonment of the crippled 
between last june and november the khmer rouge attempted to 
shift 15000 refugees to cambodia from widely separated locations in 
thailand it said indicating they were part of a central policy 
probably ordered by leaders pol pot and ieng sary who observers 
believe continue to be the primary decisionmakers

a former mental patient who killed three 
coworkers this week before committing suicide showed no signs of 
being potentially violent when he was released from the hospital in 
1986 doctors say 
i have found nothing that would make me question the release 
decision made two years ago said stephen siebert acting director 
of clifton t perkins hospital center a maryland state mental 
hospital 
emanuel tsegaye 33 described by police as a disgruntled 
employee shot four coworkers three fatally and then killed 
himself wednesday afternoon in the seventh floor offices of chevy 
chase federal savings bank in bethesda md 
just a week before the shooting a therapist who met with tsegaye 
every two weeks reported that he was adhering to the terms of his 
conditional release from the mental institution siebert said 
perkins officials aided by outside consultants are reviewing 
the incident siebert said authorities says they have not 
determined the motive for the shootings or how tsegaye was able to 
obtain a gun 
the three bank employees who were killed were identified as 
cynthia mitchell 28 of landover md tanya walker 23 of fort 
washington md and mahasty aghakhan 29 of silver spring md 
edward johnson 22 who was shot in the jaw survived the attack 
but was listed in critical condition at suburban hospital in 
bethesda 
tsegaye had been hospitalized for depression five times in his 
life siebert said beginning in 1979 in his native ethiopia the 
first four hospitalizations were brief 
but a county circuit judge committed tsegaye to perkins in april 
1984 after he threatened a police officer with a dull butter knife 
and begged him to kill him according to perkins records 
tsegaye who was declared not criminally responsible for the 
attack was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar syndrome which 
caused him to experience extreme bouts of depression siebert said 
if anything said siebert tsegaye was considered a threat to 
himself but not to other people 
he was in for a suicidal gesture not violent behavior said 
siebert 
a treatment team evaluated tsegaye in 1986 and deemed him ready 
for conditional release a decision supported by an outside mental 
health professional and by the judge who had committed him tsegaye 
remained on medication and lived in several transition houses before 
eventually moving into an apartment in silver spring according to 
siebert 
the bank was not informed of tsegayes psychiatric history 
because of what hospital officials considered his right to privacy 
said siebert who pointed out that state law does not require such 
notification he said one person in 20 suffers from some form of 
bipolar syndrome and 99 percent never become violent

the customs service has ordered closer scrutiny 
of american flags from a taiwanese company that suggested that its 
us customers replace made in taiwan tags with made in usa 
the order followed complaints from american flag manufacturers 
and several members of congress 
william rosenblatt assistant commissioner in customs office of 
enforcement said thursday that an alert has been issued to all 
ports to closely examine inspections from this importer the ming 
teh flag co of taipei taiwan 
in addition customs is initiating an investigation to 
determine if markings have been changed after importation 
rosenblatt said in a letter to rep douglas applegate dohio 
the labelswitching possibility was raised by ming teh in a 
letter it wrote soliciting business from a us company 
we can realize why you need to lift off this label to 
prevent the resistance in us to import flags the letter said 
if possible we suggest you cut off this label after you receive 
the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags your own 
brand name and made in usa signs 
the solicitation added we can offer the labels too 
applegate was among the lawmakers who received a copy of the 
solicitation as part of a complaint campaign by domestic flag makers 
the office of rep harley staggers dwva said it forwarded the 
same complaint to customs back in june but was told it is very 
difficult to enforce the countryoforigin marking laws after items 
have cleared customs 
staggers was author of legislation seeking to ban all imports of 
us flags that legislation died at the end of the last session 
but the lawmaker is preparing to reintroduce it 
customs also has forwarded a copy of the taiwanese flag 
solicitation to the federal trade commission which if evidence of 
labelswitching is uncovered could go to court to stop the practice 
in addition if any domestic manufacturer could show it lost 
business to a labelswitching competitor federal law would enable 
the company to recover the lost profit and legal costs 
if a packaged flag complete with trim pole etc contains more 
than half americanmade components distributors can legally strip 
tags that say made in taiwan made in singapore or the like 
but they cant say made in usa unless its made in the usa 
said robert easton a special assistant for enforcement in the ftc 
bureau of consumer protection

there were no knockdowns in the courtroom but tunney won a clear

unofficial ruling somewhat vindicated a controversial decision by a 
referee 62 years ago 
in front of chuckling onlookers at ringside at the mock court

choppelas declared the longcount controversy null and void 
gene tunney deserves full credit for the victory the judge 
said 
almost all the evidence was in tunneys corner tunneys son 
former sen john v tunney said the long count in which his father 
lay on the canvas for nine of the slowest counts in the history of 
boxing was the luckiest thing that ever happened to either 
fighter 
it kept their names in the public forum and gave added luster 
to both their careers tunney said 
if the controversy over the famous 1927 title fight was heated 
wednesdays session was not but thats not unusual for the court of

a worldwide aviation agency will study ways to 
screen radios tape players and other seemingly harmless devices 
that could be used to smuggle a terrorist bomb aboard an airplane 
the 33nation council of the international civil aviation 
organization ordered the study the same day british authorities in 
lockerbie scotland said the bomb that brought down pan am flight 
103 was hidden in a radiocassette player 
us and british aviation authorities requested the twoday 
session that concluded thursday in montreal following the dec 21 
bombing over scotland that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on 
the ground 
the council ordered its staff to investigate what measures could 
be taken to prevent further terrorist sabotage aboard aircraft and 
said it will make those recommendations in several months to the 
160member international civil aviation organization the air 
affiliate of the united nations 
the council condemned all acts of unlawful interference against 
international civil aviation and urged member nations to intensify 
their air travel safeguards 
a concrete plan of action was agreed to by the members of icao 
which was our goal us transportation secretary samuel k 
skinner said at a closing news conference 
british transportation secretary paul channon described the 
meeting as marking a new era of international cooperation to 
combat the terrorist threat in civil aviation 
a resolution adopted by the council commits the organization to 
review whether more intensive measures are needed to detect sabotage 
devices especially explosives 
it urges quicker research and development on detection of 
explosives and on security equipment 
the organizations staff also will be considering whether new 
steps are needed to increase the matching of passengers and their 
bags as a security measure to consider the security problem of 
cargo mail and courier services using passenger aircraft and the 
issue of controlling access to airports 
the staff also will be looking at the security problems posed by 
radios computers and other electronic equipment in which explosives 
or components can be hidden 
channon speaking at an earlier news conference thursday after 
the announcement of the latest findings in the flight 103 
investigation said this is further evidence of the extent of 
this serious problem 
to ban radios altogether would be a very drastic step the 
british official said he said however it is a question that may 
have to be considered 
allan mcartor the outgoing administrator of the us federal 
aviation administration said new guidelines were issued thursday in 
washington after the lockerbie announcement 
the guidance is more a sense of vigilance than anything else 
he told reporters to be extra vigilant possibly xray in two 
dimension to look for hidden cavities 
mcartor said that while passengers can expect their electronic 
equipment to be checked more rigorously an outright ban on carrying 
them is unlikely 
i have not asked for any banning of electronic equipment nor 
have i heard it he said 
the organizations staff also will be considering whether 
comprehensive screening of checked baggage and the screening or 
passengers and hand baggage need new standards or recommendations 
the organizations president assad kotai said he hoped that 
most points could be handled this year the organizations general 
meeting is in september 
we have to strengthen further our preventive measures kotai 
said

tokyo dealers took to the sidelines today as the 
us dollar shed ground against the japanese yen while active 
buying propelled the markets main economic barometer to another 
record closing 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues started with more 
than a 100point surge at the onset of trading but fizzled out 
toward the end of the morning after profittaking by investors by 
the end of the early session the index a 6590point loser 
thursday had shed a marginal 136 points

the previous high was set wednesday when the index finished at 
3214948 points 
in foreign exchange dealings the dollar closed at 12572 yen 
down 061 yen from thursdays 12633yen finish it was traded in a 
tight range of 1255012590 yen during the day 
the us currency had opened at a lower 12590 yen following 
losses in overseas markets and one dealer said the dollar came 
under strong selling pressure after it broke the 12580yen level 
which he described as a technical point 
speaking on condition of anonymity the dealer added that 
movement of the dollar against the yen next week will depend on what 
the american trade deficit figure for december totals 
the us commerce department is scheduled to release the figure 
in washington later today and many local economists have predicted 
it to be slightly lower than novembers 125 billion 
but if the trade deficit is over 12 billion the us currency 
is likely to weaken even more the dealer said

the leaders of iraq jordan egypt and 
north yemen have signed a new alliance to improve economic ties 
king hussein of jordan called the arab cooperation council 
formed thursday at a summit in the iraqi capital of baghdad yet 
another link in the chain of arab efforts toward integration the 
official iraqi news agency reported 
president saddam hussein read the agreement aloud to a cheering 
crowd in baghdads grand festivals square the agency said also 
signing the 17article accord were king hussein president hosni 
mubarak of egypt and president ali abdullah saleh of north yemen 
officials of the four nations have said the alliance is intended 
solely to improve economic ties and has no military or political 
purpose that would compete with the 22member arab league 
they said it was similar to the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council and another bloc that may be formed in north africa by 
morocco tunisia libya algeria and mauritania 
the main goal of the arab cooperation council is to achieve the 
highest degree of cooperation coordination integration and 
solidarity among the member states the agency quoted the 
agreement as saying 
it said iraq was elected president for the first year 
western diplomats and political analysts in baghdad said there 
was no indication the new alliance would pose a military threat to 
israel 
they noted egypt is bound by its 1979 peace treaty with israel 
and the others have supported moves toward a settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict

a fullpage newspaper advertisement calling on 
episcopalians to take a stand against women priests gives a rallying 
point to people who are unhappy with changes in the church one of 
the campaigns supporters says 
we are letting people know that they do not have to go along 
with all this trendy stuff said the rev titus oates rector of 
bostons all saints episcopal church 
oates is a member of the evangelical and catholic mission that 
gave a testrun thursday to the ad in the boston herald the ad was 
aimed at the diocese that last week consecrated bishop barbara c 
harris as the first woman bishop in the anglican communions 
450year history 
episcopalians do something read the ad which included a 
litany of demands including the missions belief that priests 
should be male the ad asks readers to sign and return to the group 
a declaration of common faith and purpose and encourages 
readers to attend a synod planned this june by the fort worth 
texasbased mission a conservative episcopal group 
the ad was the latest note of discord sounded since harris was 
elected as bishop last september a position that gave her entry 
into an apostolic succession that the church traces back to the time 
of christ 
at harris consecration as suffragan or assistant bishop two 
men spoke against the ordination including one who termed it 
sacrilege but the congregation of about 8000 roared its approval 
when asked if their will was that she be ordained 
the 58yearold episcopal priest from philadelphia has generated 
controversy because of her gender her lack of formal seminary 
degrees her divorced status and her tenure as former publisher of 
the distinctly liberal episcopal publication the witness 
many church leaders saw thursdays ad as no threat to harris 
position 
in one sense its good copy and is a way for them to fly their 
flag said diane spence director of development at the episcopal 
divinity school in cambridge 
architects of the campaign say the ads will run elsewhere in the 
country this spring 
canon brien koehler of the evangelical and catholic mission said 
it is unlikely the episcopal church will reverse its 10year policy 
of allowing women into the priesthood but he said the june synod is 
intended to find a way to allow ourselves to live and breathe 
within the episcopal church whether the official channels of the 
episcopal church will tolerate that i think thats really a great 
question right now 
officials of the 96000member episcopal diocese of massachusetts 
said they had no comment on the ad 
spokesman jim solheim also said harris was aware of the ad and 
had no comment 
at a news conference after her election had been formally 
approved by episcopal bishops around the country harris 
acknowledged that some church members would have difficulty with her 
position but said she doubted a schism would result

to create a common market known as the great magreb 
this union is only the first stage toward a union of all arab 
countries libyan leader moammar gadhafi told leaders of algeria 
mauritania morocco and tunisia at the opening session thursday 
they proposed to finalize their treaty today following prayers in 
marrakechs nearly 1000yearold kotoubia mosque

particularly sudan chad mali and niger would join the union

countries but none of the other four summit nations has shown an 
interest in the move 
within the union all goods would move freely and there would be 
separate agreements on the free movement of their citizens

world 
but each country would retain its national sovereignty

the new interior minister acknowledged 
that police under ousted president alfredo strossner had torture 
chambers but he said they would be dismantled soon a newspaper 
reported 
the comments by gen orlando machuca vargas followed accusations 
in recent years by paraguays roman catholic church and human rights 
organizations that gen stroessner used torture to repress political 
opposition 
in an interview with the newspaper el diario noticias machuca 
vargas was quoted as saying his ministry would crack down on rights 
violations by police 
we are going to eliminate torture chambers in police stations 
since they do nothing for the image of the country and are degrading 
to the human condition he was quoted as saying 
the interior minister declined to give details of the torture 
chambers but said they will be shut down probably within a 
month 
stroessner was deposed feb 3 in a coup by gen andres rodriguez 
who named himself provisional president appointed a new cabinet 
and accepted the governing colorado partys endorsement for 
president in elections set for may 1 about 50 people were killed in 
the coup the government said 
human rights groups said stroessners forces frequently used 
torture 
after he consolidated power following a 1954 coup stroessner 
eased up on the most blatant human rights violations replacing 
murder and torture with harassment detentions and expulsions the 
rights groups charged 
machuca vargas said members of the investigative police agency 
which long has been accused of torturing political and criminal 
prisoners will be prosecuted if formal complaints are lodged 
we will investigate all the irregularities committed by 
employees of this ministry he was quoted as saying were not 
going to cover up for anybody our mission is to clean up the 
image of the interior ministry as being a repressive organ of the 
government

rafael mella latorre was arrested in october 1980 47 days after 
somozas car was blasted by a bazooka in a residential neighborhood 
of this capital city 
im emphatic in saying i had no participation in that i was a 
scapegoat of authorities in charge of the custody of somoza mella 
latorre told reporters 
the investigative police tortured me for almost seven months 
they even tortured my pregnant wife in my presence causing a 
miscarriage he said 
mella latorre was scheduled to be released in 1986 after being 
convicted and sentenced to six years in prison but prison officials 
accused him of participating in a prison riot that january judge

opponents of prime minister benezir 
bhutto may be trying to undermine her goverment by using the rage of 
a novel that allegedly blasphemes islam 
the furor over the satanic verses caused the most violent 
demonstration in the pakistani capital in a decade and occurred 
while ms bhutto was in china on her first official trip abroad as 
prime minister 
if the real purpose of the demonstration was only to protest 
the book it came at an odd time and an odd place said a retired 
bureaucrat who served under both ms bhuttos father the late prime 
minister zulfikar ali bhutto and president mohammed zia ulhaq who 
overthrew bhutto in 1977 
on sunday young moslems following religious leaders and 
political opponents of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party marched 
on the us information center in islamabad to demand that the 
united states a close ally of pakistan ban the book 
a rockthrowing mob smashed windows tore down the american flag 
and started small fires in the building 
police responded with tear gas and gunfire six people were shot 
to death and more than 80 were injured 
ms bhutto said the violence appeared to be the work of her 
political rivals and accused them of trying to whip up sentiment 
against the 2monthold government 
pakistan already had joined iran india bangladesh egypt and 
south africa in banning the novel 
an editorial in the frontier post an englishlanguage newspaper 
that often supports the bhutto party declared the path of 
confrontation is being followed by people who either do not 
accept the democratic way of life or are not happy with the results 
of the general elections and now wish to destabilize the popularly 
elected government 
organizers of the protest said the timing had nothing to do with 
ms bhuttos absence in china but was prompted by reviews of the 
book that appeared in international news magazines a few days 
earlier 
a government official said privately the reviews had the first 
details anyone had about the book nobody here has read the book 
a religious issue could bring together followers of zia who won 
the support of moslem fundamentalist parties by espousing islamic 
law for pakistan the program had made little headway by the time 
zia was killed in a plane crash in august 
zias political heirs ran in novembers elections as the 
eightparty islamic democratic alliance with adoption of islamic 
law as a major part of their platform ms bhutto has shunned 
islamization as a relic of the zia years 
her party founded by her father won the popular vote nearly 21 
in pakistans first free elections since the 1977 coup it fell 
short of a majority in parliament however and she formed a 
coalition with small parties and independents 
ms bhuttos lack of a majority has led to several confrontations 
with the conservatives the most notable over her attempt to repeal 
a constitutional amendment zia enacted giving the president broad 
discretionary powers 
moslems say the satanic verses offends their faith by 
satirizing the prophet mohammed as fallible and implying that islam 
is not the only true religion 
author salman rushdie a british citizen who was born in india to 
moslem parents says the work is not blasphemous

ayatollah khomeini has made a religious 
mistake in sending death squads after the author of the satanic 
verses a leading islamic theologian said 
executing salman rushdie would be virtually impossible under 
the tenets of islam and such a death order is a wrong ruling 
from a theological point of view said sheik mohammed hossameldin 
of cairos alazhar institute 
hossameldin said thursday that the book should be banned and 
burned but that nobody has been executed in islams 1350year 
history as an apostate which he interpreted as the crime khomeini 
invoked in his death sentence 
khomeini said the indianborn author deserved to die for 
insulting islam 
rushdie born into a wealthy moslem family in bombay says he 
does not believe in supernatural entities but insists his book 
is not slanderous 
the 1013yearold alazhar is considered the moslem worlds 
center of theology combining a university and mosque whose 
officials are appointed by the government 
khomeinis execution order and unrest in pakistan india and iran 
over the books publication make islam seem brutal and 
bloodthirsty said hossameldin 
he said there are four steps to follow with someone suspected of 
being an apostate before passing a death sentence 
a formal court questions the defendant on his motivation and 
whether his alleged offense was meant to signify rejection of islam 
once held to be an apostate the defendant is given a week to 
repent 
barring repentance he is sentenced to death the only 
authority enabled to pass such a sentence however is a moslem 
ruler with jurisdiction over the defendant 
finally if the defendant changes his mind and eventually 
repents at any time before his execution even the second before 
death he is absolved and released 
so you see its really impossible to execute an apostate 
because the defendant will always repent hossameldin said 
whoever understands islam will realize that the penalty for 
apostacy cannot be implemented in the history of islam there has 
never been any individual case of executing an apostate only wars 
against them 
he said he has not read the book but that alazhar officials have 
received reports and excerpts from moslem clerics in london

three years ago antiapartheid 
leaders launched a campaign to promote black activist winnie mandela 
as the mother of the nation and a symbol of resistance to 
government repression 
since then her image has been tarnished by controversies over 
her lifestyle public statements and involvement with a group of 
youths who have been accused of crimes 
in recent weeks the wife of jailed african national congress 
leader nelson mandela has been linked with alleged beatings of black 
activists disappearances and the death of a 14yearold boy 
on thursday black leaders of major antiapartheid organizations 
publicly abandoned and condemned her they told of many attempts to 
reconcile the conflict between mrs mandela and the black community 
and said they were outraged by her complicity in abductions and 
assault 
the government which isolated and banned her for nearly 23 
years has run several tv news programs on her troubles 
as far as the government is concerned the most effective way of 
discrediting mrs mandela may have been its 1986 decision to lift 
the ban on quoting her and remove all restrictions on her 
activities the government has exploited mrs mandelas foibles in 
its propaganda war against her husband but in many cases she has 
provided the ammunition 
public reports of battles between her bodyguards and other soweto 
youth groups go back to january 1987 when police questioned her 
about the death of one of the young men who congregate at her home 
under the name of the mandela united soccer team she formed the 
team in 1986 saying the youths were getting into trouble and she 
wanted to get them off the streets they have played few soccer 
games 
for two years her name has been popping up in court cases 
involving charges of assault murder and robbery by people alleged 
to have stayed at her house or used her car and van police 
occasionally have announced they were investigating charges against 
her but have never brought her to court 
antiapartheid newspapers sometimes delayed for weeks printing 
negative stories about her or her bodyguards for fear of being used 
in an antiwinnie mandela propaganda campaign but journalists have 
grown increasingly uneasy about mrs mandelas refusal to comment on 
the events and her continued support of the unpopular mandela 
united whose members have threatened reporters and photographers as 
well as residents of soweto 
for years she was known as the courageous stubborn wife of 
mandela fighting small battles in the conservative farming town of 
brandfort where she was banished she received a steady stream of 
international visitors and issued statements on mandela that could 
not be published in south africa 
her prominence soared in late 1985 after her brandfort house was 
burned and she challenged the government directly by moving back to 
soweto the largest black township 
she had not been quoted in south african papers since 1975 but 
suddenly she was at almost every major rally wearing anc colors 
her fist raised supporting the antigovernment protests and making 
radical statements 
the government without explaining why lifted the ban on quoting 
her shortly after she made one of the most controversial 
pronouncements of her life at a rally in the township of kagiso 
mrs mandela said with our boxes of matches and our necklaces 
we shall liberate this country 
the exiled leadership of the african national congress 
disassociated itself from the statement but her declaration was 
seen by the government as proof the anc supported the necklace

collaborators 
the mandelas married in 1958 when she was a 24yearold social 
worker and he was a 40yearold executive member of the african

underground mrs mandela spent 17 years under banning orders in 
solitary confinement on trial or under house arrest while raising 
two daughters 
in 1977 she was banished to brandfort where she started a 
clinic and daycare center 
she returned to soweto amid the national uprising in black 
townships breaking her bans on public appearances and speeches she 
said she spoke for the nations jailed black leaders and for the anc 
friends suggested police did not act against her because of the 
growing world focus on the mandelas as a symbol of black resistance 
to apartheid 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said last week that police 
were careful not to be seen as vindictive toward mrs mandela but 
he also said it was hard to get a case against her because witnesses

navajo tribal chairman peter macdonald 
has taken a leave of absence amid allegations that he accepted 
kickbacks but it was unclear today who will lead the nations 
largest indian tribe 
macdonalds decision thursday came a week after witnesses told a 
us senate committee that macdonald demanded trips gifts and other 
favors as a part of awarding contracts and other tribal business 
phoenix real estate agent byron bud brown testified on feb 7 
that he helped arrange a navajo ranch purchase in july 1987 for 
334 million from an oilman who had paid 262 million for the 
ranch hours earlier 
brown who has been granted immunity from prosecution said he 
gave macdonald 75000 and a luxury car as his share of the profit 
macdonald who acknowledges accepting gifts but denies 
wrongdoing announced his intention to step down during an emotional 
speech to the 88member tribal council he appealed for tribal unity 
and asked for access to records to defend himself against slurs 
and slanders 
macdonald 60 the flamboyant former aerospace engineer serving 
his fourth fouryear term as chairman failed to get the council to 
approve his chosen successor vice chairman johnny thompson 
the council then elected marshall plummer as temporary chairman 
tribal lawyers were trying to determine today whether the council 
acted within the law in bypassing thompson 
geoffrey standingbear an attorney in the chairmans office said 
thompson should become acting chairman automatically under the 
tribal code 
council members gave the macdonald a standing ovation as he left 
the meeting thursday night earlier people could be heard cheering 
outside the building when macdonald agreed to take a leave 
macdonald has refused to answer a subpoena from the senate select 
committee on indian affairs which has denied him immunity from 
prosecution or to discuss the allegations with nonindians 
in a navajo radio broadcast macdonald claimed the committee 
targeted him for his advocacy of indian rights he also said the 
committee is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty 
we want to look back with pride with what we have done and i 
ask you to let me leave and that you allow me to have retain 
effective legal representation but i leave that to your wisdom 
he said 
macdonald also asked to be treated fairly 
in the end we come to the same circle and love each other 
because there is no way we can walk away from our clans macdonald 
said 
macdonald and his runningmate thompson won office in november 
1986 by a plurality of about 750 votes of more than 60000 cast 
macdonald had been out of office for four years and served three 
earlier terms in 1977 a us district court jury failed to reach a 
verdict against macdonald on fraud and income tax evasion charges 
an estimated 170000 of the nations 200000 navajos live on a 
25000squaremile reservation that covers much of northeastern 
arizona and extends into northwestern new mexico and southeastern

solidarity leader lech walesa praised a 
tentative accord that would legalize the banned trade union movement 
if it reaches agreement with communist authorities on other 
political and economic reforms 
government and solidarity negotiators in part of broad talks on 
polands future agreed in principle thursday to amend the labor law 
so solidarity can be registered immediately if the two sides agree 
on other reforms 
thats a lot thats a lot thats great said walesa by 
telephone from his home in gdansk solidarity has demanded a return 
to legal status after being banned in 1982 
later solidarity activist henryk wujec was allowed to appeal on 
television for people to start solidarity organizing committees so 
there is a basis for legal existence of solidarity later because 
now we know it will happen 
officials announced the agreement after a session of a working 
group devoted to trade unions negotiators decided the union could 
be registered nationwide in one step under an amended labor law to 
be passed by the parliament 
a resolution passed by the working group also said the new 
solidarity would have freedom to create its own organizational 
structures but would have to negotiate jointly with other existing 
unions during talks with management 
negotiators in a working group on youth problems said the 
independent students association also should be legalized it was 
the campus equivalent of solidarity and was also banned in 1982 
government spokesmen have said since the talks began feb 6 that 
legalization of solidarity must be part of a package deal with 
the opposition 
authorities also require agreement on a program of economic and 
political reforms and on nonconfrontational elections this 
year after which members of the opposition would assume a minority 
role in parliament 
solidarity had wanted to be legalized under a new act and not be 
bound by the 1982 labor law which restricted how quickly a 
nationwide union could form 
we agree together that the procedure of registration will be 
opened by a single legal act registering the nationwide trade union 
that is such as solidarity demanded said journalist tadeusz 
mazowiecki who led the opposition delegation to thursdays 
discussions 
the government side has stressed it is not agreeing to make legal 
again the old solidarity which it blames for causing social discord 
in 1981 that led to its banning following a martiallaw crackdown 
the government has said it will legalize a new union under the same 
name that would function differently 
the broadbased talks with solidarity has received unprecedented 
coverage in an official media in recent months 
in another development an official newspaper for the first time 
published evidence that implicates the soviet union in the massacre 
of thousands of polish officers during world war ii 
the bodies of 4000 polish army officers deported to the soviet 
union were uncovered by hitlers army in spring 1943 official 
soviet and polish histories had maintained the nazis killed the 
officers in 1941 but many poles and western historians blame the 
soviets 
a confidential june 1943 report by the polish red cross that 
appeared wednesday in the weekly odrodzenie rebirth said 
judging by the papers found with the corpses the murder took 
place in the months of march and april 1940 
because the site 12 miles west of smolensk in western russia 
was at that time in possession of the soviets the report implied 
soviet responsibility for the crime

sudanese guerrillas today claimed 
they captured a heavily defended southern town killing or wounding 
hundreds of government troops sudan said it had repelled a rebel 
attack in the area 
a sudan peoples liberation army leader lam akol refused to 
list rebel casualties in the battle tuesday in liria near the 
southern provincial capital of juba 
akol said about 75 percent of the 1000 government troops 
defending liria were killed or wounded 
on wednesday the sudanese army command reported a rebel attack 
on a military convoy on a highway heading northwest of town the 
army statement said the rebels killed five soldiers and injured 14 
but it claimed the army was able to inflict heavy losses on the 
rebels who were forced to flee 
there was no independent verification of the claims 
liria is about 45 miles southeast of juba which is a prime rebel 
target between liria and juba is the governmentheld town of 
ngalangala and the white nile river 
we control 95 percent of southern sudan we are interested in 
capturing the other 5 percent akol said 
rebels late last month captured the upper nile town of nasir 
after months of siege nasir is 500 miles south of khartoum and 20 
miles from the ethiopian border 
the rebel radio believed to broadcast from ethiopias capital 
addis ababa said the main rebel leader john garang led the attack 
on nasir 
garang was a sudanese army colonel before he organized the rebel 
group in 1983 he launched the rebellion against the 
moslemdominated khartoum government to press for greater autonomy 
and economic reforms in the largely christian and animist southern 
provinces of bahr elghazal upper nile and equatoria 
in november the rebels and the democratic unionist party 
negotiated a peace agreement that was later rejected by prime 
minister sadek mahdis government 
the november agreement called on mahdi to lift the state of 
emergency suspend application of islamic law and convene a 
constitutional conference by dec 31 the rebels agreed to a 
ceasefire 
at the time of the negotiations the democratic unionist party 
was a coalition partner in mahdis government however the party 
left the coalition after the government rejected the agreement 
mahdi then reorganized his cabinet giving greater power to the 
national islamic front which advocates islamic law and opposes any 
agreement with the rebels 
the reported fall of liria came while a threeman democratic 
unionist party delegation was meeting with rebel officials in addis 
ababa 
we were exploring the best ways of bringing about the 
agreement akol said ways to mobilize the people to force the 
khartoum government to implement the agreement 
akol said the two parties did not discuss recent calls for a 
ceasefire by mahdi and secretary of state james a baker iii

a group of rightwing academics 
who believe black majority rule is inevitable have proposed creating 
an allwhite afrikaner nation in a thinly populated section of 
western south africa 
carel boshoff leader of the afrikaner freedom movement outlined 
details of the proposed nation thursday that he said would include 
the atlantic coastline starting about 60 miles north of cape town 
and extend 300 miles inland the area contains no major cities and 
much of it is desert 
boshoffs asyetnameless nation also would include the southern 
half of namibia but that south africanruled territory is due to 
gain independence by early next year 
his proposal contrasts sharply with the demand of a nationwide 
extremist group the afrikaner resistance movement for creation of 
a whitesonly state consisting of transvaal and the orange free 
state two of south africas four provinces both provinces have 
vast farming areas and numerous gold mines and transvaal includes 
the major cities of pretoria and johannesburg 
boshoff is a theologian and a former chairman of the broederbond 
a secretive society of influential afrikaners he is the soninlaw 
of the late prime minister hendrik verwoerd who designed south 
africas apartheid system in the 1950s 
boshoffs proposal represents a reversal of the ideology of 
verwoerd who sought to relocate blacks in nominally independent 
rural homelands while whites controlled the bulk of the country 
including the industrial centers gold mines ports and best 
farmland 
boshoff contends establishment of a small whitesonly nation is 
the only way of ensuring the survival of the afrikaners the mainly 
dutchdescended whites who make up about 60 percent of south 
africas 5 million whites 
in a controversial policy document last year boshoff said 
afrikaners should abandon hope of dominating the entire country 
where the 26 million blacks outnumber whites more than 5to1 
minority domination as currently practiced in south africa is 
morally unjustifiable he wrote 
the national party government rejects the idea of a white 
homeland it is struggling to find support for its concept of racial 
powersharing in which blacks would be brought into central 
government but would not be allowed to overrule white interests 
boshoff said he envisioned a transitional period in which 
afrikaners would move to the proposed white nation while it remained 
under south african control he said infrastructure would be 
improved with government grants similar to those extended to black 
homelands 
boshoff acknowledged the area is dry but suggested that the 
region along the orange river which forms the south africanamibia 
border could be developed for agriculture 
a move to the area would change the lifestyle of people as they 
know it now but they have a choice of staying in the fat of south 
africa and melting away or move toward a new beginning he said

pan am flight 103 was downed over 
scotland by a bomb concealed within a radiocassette player that 
investigators believe was placed aboard the plane in west germany a 
british detective said 
investigators believe the explosive that shattered the boeing 747 
on dec 21 was put aboard the aircraft in frankfurt where the 
flight began chief superintendant john orr said thursday it 
apparently had been placed in the hold of aircraft as checked 
baggage 
new positive lines of inquiry are unfolding he told a news 
conference in this southwestern scottish town where the jumbo jet 
crashed killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
while there is insufficient evidence at this stage to establish 
the identity of the person or group responsible for this dreadful 
crime the progress made and the evidence obtained has been 
substantial said orr an investigator from strathclyde police a 
scottish regional police force 
asked whether the investigation would point to a specific 
country orr said it may 
on feb 8 the jerusalem post reported the bomb that destroyed 
the jet was hidden in a radiocassette recorder and was traced to 
frankfurt 
that report quoted unidentified investigators as saying the 
device was similar but not identical to one found earlier in the 
possession of members of ahmed jibrils extremist popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command the group has denied 
involvement 
orr said the brand name of the radiocassette player had not been 
established and would not say whether it was a pocketsized device 
or a larger model nor did he say whether investigators had located 
the detonator 
antiterrorist experts have said the explosive most likely used 
was semtex an odorless highly malleable substance made in 
czechoslovakia and known to be used by terrorist organizations 
orr said he was aware of some aspects of the explosive that was 
used but declined to elaborate 
the discovery of the bombs hiding place followed painstaking 
reconstruction of a baggage container from pieces some no larger 
than a table knife strewn over 40 miles of scottish countryside 
the reconstruction of the baggage container suggests that the 
explosive device may have been among the baggage from the frankfurt 
flight orr said 
the particular bag which contained the device has not been 
identified at this stage but there is the most detailed work under 
way with forensic assistance to achieve this identification i 
believe this can be done he said 
orr said the belief that frankfurt was the origin of the bomb was 
based on a balance of probabilities most of the 1500 pounds of 
baggage in the container in which the bomb was located was checked 
in at frankfurt and the rest was interline baggage from other 
points 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt on a boeing 727 at londons 
heathrow airport the new yorkbound flight was changed to a boeing 
747 
a spokesman for the frankfurt prosecutors office which is 
coordinating the west german investigation into the crash said of 
orrs statement on the frankfurt connection we have no knowledge 
about that 
the most persistent claim of responsibility has come from an 
anonymous caller who has repeatedly told international news agencies 
it was the work of the guardians of the islamic revolution an 
iranian group 
cbs news reported this month that jibril was the principal 
architect of the bombing last month the hamburg newspaper bild 
reported jibrils organization was involved 
in montreal the 33member council of the international civil 
aviation organization is meeting to discuss ways to better airline 
security in the wake of the bombing 
a draft resolution cosponsored by britain and the united states 
calls for improving technology of bombdetection devices so they can 
detect plastic explosives 
the resolution questions whether computers radios and other 
electronic devices should be allowed aboard aircraft since xray 
scanners cannot distinguish between concealed explosives and 
components of the devices

iran has offered a bounty of up to 52 million for the murder of 
rushdie

we have decided not to publish the novel the satanic verses 
in order to not endanger the life and limb of the employees in the

a homeless man who read erudite publications by 
street lights and reportedly never asked for handouts was found dead 
on an upper east side street carrying 2000 in his pocket 
we all figured he wasnt broke he was just a broken man 
said donald davanzo an electrician at a construction site near 
where richard demattia 46 was found dead early thursday 
demattia had lived on east 66th street in manhattan for at least 
a year storing his belongings inside a church while his mother 
lucille demattia who lives about 10 miles away in queens tried 
desperately to find him 
mrs demattia told a local newspaper she had hired a private 
detective at one point to try to track down her son whom she said 
was a veteran receiving disability payments 
she said she did not know he had been homeless until late 
thursday when police traced her through an identification card her 
son was carrying 
when asked how she and her son whom she hadnt seen since 1986 
became estranged she said its a long story 
demattia had a bank account with 638 dollars in it at the time 
of his death which apparently was due to natural causes said 
manhattan chief of detectives aaron rosenthal 
he also had 2000 cash on his person rosenthal said adding 
that his source of income was unclear 
he was known to area residents and merchants as charlie and 
philip and stayed mostly on east 66th street between york and 
first avenues 
he was a peaceful man no one ever felt threatened by him 
said connie adamec a resident of the block 
the rev robert tomlian pastor of the st john nepomucene roman 
catholic church said demattia kept his belongings near a 
confessional and spent much of his time during the day inside the 
church only on extremely cold nights would he sleep in the church 
basement 
ms adamec said that she and other neighbors tried repeatedly to 
get damattia to go to a homeless shelter but he always said he 
preferred life on the street 
tabassam qureshi who owns two newsstands on first avenue near 
66th street said demattia was a regular customer who bought the 
christian science monitor and the wall street journal 
i dont know maybe he had a share in something qureshi said 
davanzo said he sometimes saw demattia who said he was an 
electronics engineer read the nation or scientific american as he 
lay beneath his quilts 
his shoes were always shined he said i guess there was 
something in his life he couldnt deal with and it broke him

the leader of the smallest faction 
fighting vietnams occupation of cambodia today said he dismissed 
his guerrilla commander and other senior officers for lack of 
discipline and disloyalty 
the leader of the smallest rebel faction son sann said he was 
taking over the military command of his khmer peoples national 
liberation front it was the latest in a series of internal disputes 
that have seriously weakened his force in recent years 
he made the announcement to reporters covering the preparations 
for the second round of talks aimed at settling the war between 
cambodian guerrillas and vietnamese troops who invaded cambodia 10 
years ago 
he said he dismissed gen sak sutsakhan the chief of the general 
staff and other officers after field commanders accused them of 
lacking loyalty and discipline 
in hanoi the official vietnam news agency quoted a foreign 
ministry spokesman as saying vietnam will do its utmost to make 
the jakarta talks a success 
but it quoted the unidentified spokesman as saying thursday that 
the guerrillas demanded the dissolution of the provietnamese 
government in cambodia in disregard of the realities 
the guerrillas have no foothold in cambodia and are losing 
support from the outside the vietnamese spokesman claimed 
according to the dispatch 
conflicts already had surfaced in thursdays preparatory 
discussions in jakarta for weekend talks that include vietnam and 
the government it installed in cambodia 
the full talks to begin sunday will bring together the leaders or 
foreign ministers of vietnam laos the four warring cambodian 
factions and the association of southeast asian nations 
indonesia malaysia singapore thailand brunei and the philippines 
all parties involved say they agree that a future cambodia should 
be independent and neutral all endorse a government consisting of 
the four cambodian factions and led by prince norodom sihanouk a 
resistance leader 
they disagree over who would supervise a general election 
son sann refused today to say how many troops his faction had 
but western diplomats in thailand put the figure at 13000 
the group has been torn by internal power struggles and a 
weakened military position since a 198485 vietnamese offensive 
wiped out all its major bases along the thaicambodian border 
son sanns group and that of sihanouk with an estimated 19000 
fighters are allied in the resistance coalition with the communist 
khmer rouge which has 3000040000 fighters some 6000070000 
vietnamese troops remain in cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and ended a khmer rouge 
regime under which about 2 million of cambodias 8 million people 
died from executions famine and civil unrest 
many nations are concerned the khmer rouge may try to reseize 
power 
hanoi has promised to pull out by 1990 or by september if a 
political solution is reached

the education departments civil rights office 
strayed far from its mission of fighting racial discrimination 
during the reagan administration say democratic investigators for a 
house committee 
a report by the majority staff of the house education and labor 
committee adds that the prospects for revived enforcement under the 
bush administration are not yet clear 
whether the ocr office of civil rights accepts its 
responsibility and begins to execute the laws as originally intended 
will depend greatly upon the commitment of the incoming 
administration to civil rights enforcement it said 
the authors said they hoped the bush administration would 
undertake a comprehensive review of the issues they raise in the 
report 
under reagan they conclude ocr was stymied by an 
administration which actively opposed the laws which were entrusted 
to it and took efforts to minimize the agencys potential impact 
the current director of the agency legree daniels is a holdover 
from the reagan administration and it is not known whether she will 
stay on in a letter published with the report daniels denounced it 
as replete with inaccuracies and misconceptions of ocrs role 
ocr is in charge of enforcing statutes barring discrimination on 
the basis of race gender handicap age and national origin in all 
federally funded education activities and programs 
democratic committee aides visited six of the 10 ocr regional 
offices between january and march 1988 they reported finding 
widespread mismanagement a decimated staff and confusion stemming 
from lack of policy direction from the top specifically they noted 
the following 
ocr initiated 9768 complaint investigations between fiscal 1981 
and 1988 most of them related to handicap discrimination only 15 
percent involved racial discrimination a violation of its 
mandate since the office was created in connection with the 1964 
civil rights act 
there was a clear perception among the regional office staff 
that certain issues were off limits and could not be investigated 
most of the issues involved race discrimination the report said 
the report noted these developments 
the number of fulltime equivalent employees at ocr has dropped 
from 1099 in fiscal 1981 to 820 in fiscal 1988 reagan 
administration budget requests for the agency declined from 51 
million in 1982 to 41 million in 1989 
the supreme courts grove city decision since reversed by 
congress prompted ocr to close in whole or in part 674 complaint 
investigations and 88 compliance reviews the decision said only 
specific activities or programs receiving federal money were subject 
to federal penalties for discrimination the problem was aggravated 
because the education department had no reliable way to trace money 
it had given to institutions or school districts 
the administration forced ocr to process state higher education 
desegregation cases under court oversight in 105 days rather than 
the 195 days recommended by the federal court cases were withdrawn 
or narrowed to accomplish this 
regional staff trying to cite schools for civil rights 
violations often were stymied by headquarters of 112 draft 
letters of finding of violations submitted from january 1987 to 
june 1988 only seven were approved while 92 were resolved with a 
violation corrected 
in many cases the violation corrected designation meant only 
that corrective action had been promised little followup 
monitoring was done to assure actual compliance by school districts 
and universities 
the committee staff said formerly segregated higher education 
systems must not be evaluated by a good faith standard but 
must be held responsible for totally eliminating the vestiges of 
discrimination root and branch 
it recommended that ocr conduct more broad compliance reviews of 
systemic discrimination issues particularly regarding race and it 
urged the agency to submit expanded staff computer and equipment 
needs to congress in time for fiscal 1990 budget consideration 
in her rebuttal daniels accused the committee staff of 
misrepresenting her agencys investigative and enforcement 
procedures distorting statistical evidence and drawing 
unsubstantiated conclusions she said ocrs emphasis on 
negotiations as opposed to enforcement actions has proven 
effective and averted the need for protracte proceedings in many 
cases

can a middleaged british housewife find 
happiness by fleeing her unresponsive husband two selfcentered 
grown children and a dreary workingclass existence in liverpool 
thats the question shirley valentine attempts to answer in a 
surprisingly laughfilled twohour monologue about the unused 
life of a woman who admits she has nowhere to go 
the play by willy russell which opened thursday at broadways 
booth theater is a deceptive little comedy its sweetness and fun 
are readily apparent primarily in the persona of its radiant star 
pauline collins but underneath the smiles lie a sadness and ache 
that give the play a special resonance 
why do we have all these feelings if we dont use them 
shirley asks she doesnt get much opportunity particularly with 
her lout of a husband who doesnt harass her as much as he ignores 
her 
he likes everything the way it has been says shirley about 
this man who wants his tea on the table at the same time every 
night and she complies even frying up an order of eggs and chips 
in front of the audience for much of her life shirley has just 
accepted things as they are particularly her relationships with her 
husband and children 
marriage is like the middle east she philosophizes 
theres no solution 
her good friend jane offers her one or at least an escape 
its a roundtrip ticket to greece without her husband act 1 
finds shirley debating whether she should go act 2 has her sitting 
on a greek island and gazing at the mediterranean 
in between there are stories homey ancedotes told with good 
humor and grace she reminisces about her days in school when she 
hated everything including herself and about her reunion with an 
old school chum who has become a highpriced hooker there are 
stories about her family particularly her son who once played 
joseph in a christmas pageant and improvised his way into a room at 
the inn there are also stories about her affair with a greek tavern 
owner the man who finally makes her see her own worth 
a lot of these ancedotes are funny and director simon callow 
lets the laughs build nicely but the evenings chief pleasure 
consists of watching the ingratiating miss collins develop her 
character the actress best known to american audiences as the 
saucy maid sarah on public televisions upstairs downstairs 
doesnt just tell jokes she uses them to build shirley into a 
credible human being who makes her sorrows as well as her silly 
behavior matter 
british playwrights seem to be dealing lately with the unraveling 
of the female mind manner and mores alan ayckbourn plowed similiar 
territory in his woman in mind seen last season offbroadway 
with stockard channing playing a hallucinating wife and mother alan 
bennett did a similar turn recently on televisions masterpiece 
theater his talking heads bed among the lentils was a 
bitter biting and achingly hilarious account of a provincial 
vicars alcoholic wife brilliantly played by maggie smith 
shirley valentine isnt of that caliber shirley simply is 
not as complex a human being as ayckbourns addled heroine or 
examined so unmercilessly as bennetts forlorn subject but because 
of miss collins shirleys tale of dreams deferred of a life not 
acted upon until it is almost too late arouses a lot of laughs 
some sympathy and even a little regret she makes you care for this 
woman who cant remember when her marriage stopped being good 
in other reviews 
howard kissel of the daily news calls shirley valentine a 
oneperson show that is actually a play a joyful captivating 
piece of theater 
in the new york times frank rich said audiences will adore 
pauline collins because she radiates the genuine unpretentious 
vitality of a warm old friend giving us the real lowdown 
however he added that miss collins captivates us with her 
honesty is all the more amazing given how frequently her vehicle 
seems contrived 
in the new york post clive barnes wrote that the play is more 
fantasy than realism and always shirley is a shade too cute to 
be true yet russell has a way with a phrase 
this is among the most entertaining evenings in town and both 
funny and touching as an added bonus

the seizure of a roman catholic church 
by dissident polish parishioners reflects a growing cultural clash 
between the us church and a new wave of polish immigrants a 
catholic official says 
about 100 parishioners began occupying st michael the archangel 
church on saturday because they want the rev roman palaszewski to 
remain the priest part of an exchange program begun with polish 
church authorities has been ordered to return to poland 
the protesting parishioners claim their new pastor the rev john 
bambol engineered palaszewskis ouster because the latter was too 
active in the polish community 
they said palaszewski who has been in seclusion since his 
removal brought enthusiasm to the church knitted together the old 
and young parishioners packed the polishlanguage masses and 
started a polishlanguage class for their children 
the drama in bridgeport has played out at other polish parishes 
in recent years 
in august 1987 1000 parishioners at a church in new britain 
took to the streets to protest the transfer of one of their priests 
a month later polish immigrants in portland maine picketed 
outside their church demanding a mass in their native language 
one top church official attributed these and many less strident 
flareups across the country to attitudes brought to the united 
states by poles weaned on a more politicized church and the 
solidarity movement 
its two different world views said the rev peter w 
zendzian who directs the office for pastoral care of immigrants and 
refugees for the us catholic conference of bishops in washington 
you have a lot of people who were solidarity members and they 
were able to mobilize quickly and make their feelings known 
he said thursday were more used to getting a committee and 
studying things our processes usually take a little bit longer 
the parishioners in bridgeport are vowing to occupy the ornate 
89yearold brick church in a largely hispanic neighborhood until 
bishop edward egan who heads the bridgeport diocese agrees to meet 
with them 
they have maintained their vigil in shifts their numbers 
swelling each evening to as many as 200 
most sit quietly in the candlelit sanctuary singing hymns and 
chanting prayers in polish 
some drift to the back of the church kneeling before an icon of 
the black madonna of czestochowa who is revered by polish 
catholics nearby is another icon of the rev maximilian kolbe the 
polish priest martyred in a nazi concentration camp 
frustrated by the bishops refusal to meet with them two of the 
dissidents began a hunger strike wednesday night they vowed to 
remain locked in a confessional until their demands were met 
a threehour meeting thursday night between members of the group 
and diocesan officials failed to settle the dispute 
palaszewskis fiveyear contract was terminated in december by 
joint agreement between franciscan officials in the united states 
and krakow poland according to church officials 
the priest was removed in december without explanation diocesan 
leaders who have said palaszewski has the right to appeal his 
transfer didnt comment on the dispute after thursdays meeting 
the dissidents many wearing solidarity buttons and ribbons with 
the redandwhite colors of the polish flag have made no attempt to 
disrupt the daily masses that continue to be celebrated in both 
english and polish 
the group includes a number of former solidarity members who came 
to this country within the last five years including richard 
debski one of the hunger strikers 
this situation is not only for our church it is everywhere 
there are polish people said debski who was jailed for about 
five months as a leader of solidarity in the polish city of wroclaw 
ironically the event that precipitated the rebellion reflects 
efforts by the american roman catholic church to accommodate the 
needs of polish immigrants who say they feel closer to polish 
priests than to american priests 
about 70000 poles have emigrated to the united states since 
1977 according to the immigration and naturalization service the 
number of immigrants peaked in 1984 and 1985 when about 9400 came 
to america in each year 
zendzian said the church set up the exchange program about a year 
ago with church authorities in poland to bring polish priests to 
america 
palaszewski the priest at the center of the st michaels 
dispute was brought to america under a similar program operated by 
the franciscan order which is responsible for assigning priests to 
st michaels

japans toshiba corp provided electrical equipment 
for a libyan factory that the us government suspects of producing 
shells for chemical weapons a toshiba official said today 
but the official said toshiba thought the factory was a 
desalination plant and acted only as subcontractor for japan steel 
works a frequent toshiba customer 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said japan 
steel works ordered power transformers and switching equipment for 
the plant from toshiba in june 1985 and toshiba delivered the 
equipment to the company in japan in december of the same year 
the equipment is a key component of electrical power systems in 
virtually all factories he said 
we had heard that the equipment would be taken to libya but 
understood that it would be used in a desalination project the 
official said 
but he said such equipment is normally examined by company 
employees after it is installed and said toshiba was still 
examining what happened when toshiba employees checked the suspect 
plant the results of that examination should be known next week he 
said 
the japanese government determined in spring 1987 that a toshiba 
subsidiary toshiba machine co violated international trade rules 
by selling sophisticated milling machines to the soviet union that 
were capable of manufacturing quieter propellors for soviet 
submarines toshiba said then that it was unaware of its 
subsidiarys activities 
japan steel works has denied it helped construct a chemical 
weapons plant or provided any weaponsmaking products to libya and 
said it only exported desalinization equipment and maintenance 
machinery for the suspect factory in rabta a desert area near 
tripoli 
officials from japans trade and foreign ministries also have 
denied any japanese involvement in production of a chemical weapons 
plant in libya

biologists spent almost a day in a driving rain 
watching sea lions circle a floating cage before two ventured inside 
and were caught for what is intended to be a permanent return to the 
pacific ocean 
both are being taken today to the long beach peninsula just 
north of the mouth of the columbia river where one nicknamed blue 
eye was released thursday said bob byrne of the state wildlife 
department 
he scurried off into the water and headed out to sea byrne 
said 
a second sea lion that like blue eye was captured wednesday in 
operation goodbye died in captivity later that night while 
coming out of anesthesia byrne said 
a fish ladder at the locks the sole passage for salmon and 
steelhead to reach lake washington and upstream spawning grounds 
has become a favorite feeding spot for about 20 sea lions which 
migrate through the area from southern california and mexico 
the relocation program is the sixth effort in five years of 
attempts to stop the predation which has endangered an already 
fragile steelhead run 
the dead sea lion found to have a 22caliber bullet wound in 
the neck and a severe infestation of lung worms was anesthetized so 
scientists could attach a radio transmitter to monitor the 550pound 
creatures movements 
using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that went 
along with studying them said bob delong a marine mammal 
biologist with the national marine fisheries service 
delong said sickie as the creature was dubbed probably was 
shot near the locks possibly by someone frustrated by the failure 
of previous efforts to chase the sea lions away 
im afraid were going to see more and more shootings he 
said 
the bullet wound and lung infestation however may have 
compromised his ability to withstand the anesthesia delong 
said 
ben deeble of greenpeace which has monitored efforts to rid the 
locks of the sea lions and given tentative approval questioned 
whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals 
he also said he would prefer relocating the animals and marking 
them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters to monitor 
their movements

police say the growing number of drugrelated 
arrests in the city has led to longer waits in booking and 
arraigning suspects with some officers complaining of spending more 
than 30 hours processing offenders 
im not going to say its the worst its ever been but there 
is a backlog everywhere in the system inspector john p walsh 
commander of the police departments criminal justice bureau 
conceded thursday its simply a volume problem 
although the officers are paid overtime for their waiting the 
patrolmens benevolent association has filed a lawsuit against the 
police department claiming that conditions are dangerous 
unsanitary and overcrowded for officers forced to wait for hours 
in manhattans criminal courts building queens central booking and 
brooklyn central booking at the mens house of detention 
the lawsuit was filed last month in state supreme court in 
manhattan a hearing is scheduled next week 
sure we like the overtime but to be dehumanized like this 
its like blood money said one officer who said he had been 
waiting 30 hours 
the criminals we bring in get three meals a day and a place to 
sleep said another 
one detective who had arrested a pickpocket in queens and spent 
39 hours waiting for the arrest to be processed said if i had it 
to do again id let the guy walk away 
the officers all declined to give their names 
walsh blamed the problem on a significant increase in arrests in 
the past year largely because of drugrelated crimes citywide 
arrests increased 304 percent last month over january 1988 from 
18671 to 24352 
he said the additional arrests meant that the district attorneys 
office in each borough had more cases and that officers had to wait 
longer for interviews with prosecutors in areas with limited space 
phil caruso head of the police union said conditions had become 
intolerable over the past year and the lawsuit was a last resort

federal agents carried a test bomb hand grenade 
and gun through american airlines security at logan international 
airport in 1987 the government charges in a lawsuit against the 
airline 
the lawsuit alleging 25 violations of federal regulations was 
filed thursday by jeremiah osullivan the acting us attorney for 
massachusetts 
al becker a spokesman for american airlines at its corporate 
headquarters in dallas said it would be inappropriate for him to 
comment on the lawsuit 
the lawsuit said that on june 22 1987 a federal aviation 
administration inpsector went through the airlines xray system at 
the airport with a test pipe bomb and a hand grenade in his 
carryon luggage 
another agent had a gun in an attache case the lawsuit said and 
the screener who was not paying attention to the screen while the 
encapsulated weapon passed through the xray system failed to 
detect the weapon 
test weapons are made of materials similar to real weapons and 
should look the same on xray machines the us attorneys office 
said 
on the same day the agents made the tests a federal agent saw 22 
passengers go through american airlines security without the 
employee looking through the monitor the lawsuit said 
it also said only one employee was working the security gate that 
day airlines are required to have both a monitor for xray machines 
and a supervisor on duty at all times 
assistant us attorney jeffrey robbins who is handling the 
case said that under faa procedures airlines are notified of 
security violations shortly after they are detected and some are 
filed as civil complaints and some are not 
the lawsuit seeks the maximum 1000 fine for each of the 25 
alleged security violations 
last december a bomb planted on a pan american jet exploded over 
lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the 
ground 
passengers have a right to expect that the airlines to which 
they are paying large amounts of money are taking their security 
obligation seriously and are paying attention to what they are 
doing osullivan said 
becker said american airlines has very elaborate very 
rigorous security at every airport it serves he said but 
acknowledged i know nothing about our system at logan in 
particular 
workers at the american airlines desk at logan declined to 
comment 
becker said the airline has been fined for security lapses in the 
past and that most airlines have some documented security violations

might be withdrawn from the occupied lands on voting days 
we recognize in you a possibility of a political entity 
rabin told palestinians let us be partners for peace 
rabin did not elaborate on what he meant by a political 
entity but his wording seemed to suggest he was expanding on the 
idea of limited palestinian selfrule or autonomy once offered by 
israel 
in the occupied territories thursday israeli soldiers shot and 
killed a 25yearold palestinian issam el bulbul during a 
stonethrowing clash in the occupied west bank town of nablus arab

fifty professional taxreturn preparers came up 
with 50 different answers when asked to calculate the federal taxes 
of a hypothetical family money magazine reported today 
the professionals answers ranged from 12359 to 35813 an 
even worse performance than a year ago 
the accountant who designed the test said the correct tax was 
23393 but the law is so confusing that several correct answers 
were possible money said ten of the 50 preparers made no major 
mistakes but computed the familys taxes as high as 24493 
the abundance of mistakes our test turned up suggests that pros 
are nowhere near as knowledgeable about the tax law as they are 
supposed to be money said in its march issue after all we 
were samplying highly regarded preparers who willingly accepted our 
challenge to calculate the model return 
the survey suggests that it is not only internal revenue service 
employees who are not fully up to speed on provisions of the 
landmark 1986 tax overhaul a general accounting office survey 
released last week found that irs personnel whose job is to answer 
taxpayers telephoned queries gave the correct answers to only 64 
percent of selected test questions that were posed during the last 
filing season 
the hypothetical family in the magazine survey was one with 
problems that while possible among those with high incomes are 
unlikely to be encountered by the typical taxpayer 
the family had salaries of 56400 but both spouses took lumpsum 
withdrawals from their pensions after quitting their jobs last year 
the wife started her own business and the husband spent the second 
half of the year negotiating to buy his own company they had a 
variety of investments owned two homes and were willed a third home 
by the wifes mother who died during the year 
a year ago money magazine asked 50 professional return preparers 
to figure the taxes of a makebelieve family then too they came 
up with 50 different answers and their bottomline figures varied by 
as much as 50 percent 
whats their excuse this year the magazine asked 
wesley r fitzpatrick a partner in the portland ore office of 
grant thornton accountants who designed this years test said he 
was completedly surprised by the results 
when the taxreform law was new you could understand the 
confusion but now its hard to explain all the mistakes about 
fundamental rules fitzpatrick said 
the survey found that some of the professionals failed to ask the 
right questions when they encontered something confusing about the 
hypothetical familys finances the gao said that same shortcoming 
was to blame for many of the mistakes made by the irs people who 
answer telephoned questions 
moneys survey involved 30 certified public accountants 12 
preparers from franchise taxpreparation operations three cpas from 
national accounting firms and five enrolled agents who are 
irslicensed taxreturn preparers 
returns free of major mistakes were prepared by five cpas not 
affiliated with national companies one enrolled agent three 
preparers from franchise outlets and fitzpatrick the cpa who 
devised the test 
money noted that the survey was conducted before much of the 
computer software widely used in the business was ready for this 
years returns in all probability the computers would have 
performed somewhat better than the preparers pencils and 
calculators although fitzpatrick maintains that software would not 
have caught the most common mistakes the magazine said 
although the hypothetical family had financial situations that 
most americans are not likely to encounter the professional tax 
preparers made mistakes in areas that are far more common for 
example 16 of the 50 failed to note that the familys 13yearold 
son would be required to file a return because he earned 600 mowing 
lawns

gravediggers ordered to exhume the corpse of a 
man who may have been murdered apparently dug up the wrong body 
twice and arent sure where to dig next a cemetery owner says 
the baltimore states attorneys office ordered the exhumation of 
the rev rayfield gilliard 77 who died last year two weeks after 
marrying a woman subsequently charged with killing four other people 
for their life insurance benefits detectives want an autopsy to see 
if he too was slain 
the first body removed in december from a paupers grave at 
mount zion cemetery in landsdowne just south of baltimore was 
actually examined in an autopsy before someone noticed the 
identification tag on it the body didnt even resemble gilliard 
said cemetery manager samuel brown 
the body was a real thin skinny man brown said mr 
gilliard was a heavyset man with big full face 
brown said his records wrongly indicated that gilliards body was 
in row 83 after the mistake was discovered brown said he realized 
gilliard actually should be in row 78 
several weeks later another body was exhumed but a detective at 
the grave found a toe tag with another mans name on it so the body 
was reburied 
the detective couldnt make out the name on the tag it was 
wil something so we put the body back brown said 
but brown said hes not convinced the second body wasnt gilliard 
the detective showed me a picture of mr gilliard and when we 
dug up the second coffin that guy looked exactly like mr 
gilliard he said whoever embalmed him did a good job 
joseph russ who owns the cemetery promised thursday to do our 
best to find gilliards body he blamed the erroneous burial 
records on inexperienced cemetery workers 
police say the woman gilliard married on jan 18 1988 is 
geraldine parrish 52 who is accused of orchestrating four slayings 
to collect the victims insurance payments 
gilliard died 15 days after the wedding leaving his 440 a month 
in social security benefits his home and about 1000 to his wife 
the death certificate said he died of arteriosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease a type of heart disease but the rev 
alphonso thompson who married the couple said that gilliard didnt 
have heart trouble as far as he knew 
last summer ms parrish was indicted and jailed charged in four 
deaths and three attempts to kill a fifth person police seized 45 
insurance policies from locked closets and safes at ms parrishs 
home

a japanese balloonist will abandon his attempt to 
cross the pacific ocean alone because of unfavorable winds and he 
plans to land his craft in the ocean an official said today 
project spokesman ren kato said fumio niwa will bring his giant 
orangeandblue balloon down saturday after an airplane determines 
his exact location 
today the balloon was floating 44 miles above the ocean 1450 
miles southeast of tokyo 
a boat from the maritime safety agency left yokohama for the area 
today but was not likely to arrive until sunday night kato said so 
niwa could end up bobbing in the sea in his tiny gondola for more 
than a day 
when he took off early wednesday niwa hoped to travel 5000 
miles to san diego in about four days and become the first person to 
cross the ocean alone in a balloon 
he planned to ride the jet stream highspeed highaltitude 
winds that generally blow west to east but changed his mind when 
he discovered the jet stream would have pushed him north toward 
alaska 
niwa initially stayed at a low altitude and traveled south in an 
attempt to catch the southernmost edge of the jet stream he then 
jettisoned most of his ballast and rose in altitude but missed the 
highspeed winds said hiroaki tanaka another project spokesman 
the loss of the ballast means he no longer is able to maneuver 
up and down to find a good wind tanaka said 
the 38yearold balloonist lifted off from yokohama southwest of 
tokyo in the 6footwide plastic gondola which he designed himself 
the capsule is pressurized and can float but has no navigational 
or heating equipment niwa relies on amateur radio reports based on 
satellite trackings to pinpoint his location 
the temperature was 23 degrees inside the gondola this morning 
and minus 13 degrees outside tanaka said 
batterypowered electric coils in niwas flying suit keep him 
warm 
niwa quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to 
prepare for the flight he said he planned to sleep during the day 
and stay awake at night 
in 1981 four men crossed the pacific ocean by balloon for the 
first time but no one has traveled the distance alone 
niwa who has 1000 hours of ballooning experience estimated the 
flight would cost about 540000 a sum he had hoped to regain by 
writing a book and lecturing about his experience

authorities investigating a major stock scandal 
today raided the main offices of the labor ministry and nine of its 
other facilities and they arrested a former ministry official 
shigeru kano 55 former head of the labor ministrys employment 
service division became the eighth suspect and the first former 
government official to be arrested in connection with the scandal 
since the scandal broke 20 people including three government 
ministers have resigned their positions 
kano resigned from his post in january after reports surfaced 
linking him to the stock scandal in which selected politicians 
bureaucrats and others were offered bargainpriced unlisted shares 
in recruitcosmos co a real estate subsidiary of the 
informationservice conglomerate recruit co 
shareholders earned large profits after the stock was offered for 
overthecounter trading raising the issue of bribery and 
favorgranting on the part of those involved 
the tokyo district prosecutors office and justice ministry 
officials charged kano played a major role in easing restrictions on 
employment information publishing a move that would benefit recruit 
co which earns 60 percent of its income from publishing 
employmentrelated information 
recruit officials allegedly spent 10000 wining and dining kano 
in return for his assistance in easing the restrictions prosecutors 
claim 
following kanos arrest 15 investigators from the prosecutors 
office raided the main building of the ministry of labor as well as 
nine other ministryrelated facilities to search for evidence 
against the former official who resigned in january 
prime minister noboru takeshita described the raid on a public 
office as a very serious matter he addressing legislators in a 
parliamentary committee but refused further comment on the latest 
development saying he didnt yet have all the details 
public support for takeshita has been severely waning a number 
of public opinion surveys have shown recently a relative and an 
aide of takeshita were invited to purchase the recruitcosmos 
shares but the prime minister himself has denied knowledge of the 
transactions 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi another highranking 
involved in the scandal said today that he regretted the arrest of 
a public official 
from the standpoint of establishing strict descipline among 
public servants it is regrettable that the arrest has in effect 
led to loss of public trust in the labor administration obuchi 
said in a news conference 
also today opposition parties stepped up demands in the diet or 
japanese parliament that former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
appear before a parliamentary committee for questioning on his own 
links to recruit 
nakasone was one of 17 politicians who earned hefty profits in 
the transaction of unlisted shares on thursday legislators raised 
questions regarding nakasones role as thenprime minister in the 
purchase of two us supercomputers 
nippon telegraph and telephone co a government 
telecommunications monopoly until its privatization in 1985 
purchased two multimilliondollar supercomputers from 
minneapolisbased cray research inc and resold them to recruit in 
1986 
the supercomputers operated by recruit have been kept on ntt 
premises until now and maintained by ntt technicians opposition 
lawmakers have charged recruit is receiving favorable treatment and 
that nakasone played a role in arranging the purchase and 
maintenance setup 
naohiko okubo secretary general of the secondlargest opposition 
party komeito called on takeshita today to disclose the contents of 
the meeting between nakasone and former president reagan in may 1987 
in washington during which an agreement over the supercomputer 
purchase was reportedly reached okubo was addressing a nationally 
televised parliamentary committee session

a state hearing examiner has ordered two beauty 
salons to serve a woman they turned away because she was infected 
with the aids virus 
the consent order coming two years after tema luft 36 was 
turned away by the salons preliminarily establishes the legal 
principle that people with aidsrelated illnesses are protected by 
marylands antidiscrimination laws 
this sends a message to businesses that are discriminating or 
might discriminate that if they do so they are going to be charged 
with violating state law lee hoshall a lawyer for the state 
human relations commission said thursday 
under the consent order approved tuesday by a hearing examiner 
for the commission the nail gallery in reisterstown and all that 
glitters in pikesville agreed to serve ms luft and others infected 
with the aids virus 
the case marked the first time a hearing examiner ruled that a 
state law protecting handicapped people from discrimination applies 
to people infected with the virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
the consent order averts a quasijudicial hearing on the 
complaint 
ms luft a campp telephone co employee who contracted the aids 
virus in 1985 said the settlement may not change attitudes toward 
the disease but will at least give infected individuals legal 
ammunition if they are faced with discrimination 
she said she was unsure whether she would return to the salons 
for service 
both salons had served ms luft until she made a televised 
appearance at an aids conference 
my clients are naturally glad the case is over said thomas 
bowden attorney for the owners of all that glitters they hold no 
grudge about tema and cetainly wish her well in dealing with her 
illness 
a woman answering the phone at the nail gallery today said she 
was the owner but would not comment on the ruling or give her name

marine lt col william r higgins abducted 
a year ago today while serving as a un observer is alive despite 
his captors statement that he was sentenced to death as a spy a 
shiite moslem leader said 
hell be released eventually by the proiranian shiite 
extremists who seized him abdul majid saleh political officer of 
the amal militia in this ancient port 50 miles south of beirut said 
thursday 
higgins from danville ky commanded a 76man un observer 
group monitoring the lebanonisrael border he was kidnapped by 
gunmen who stopped his car on the highway south of tyre 20 minutes 
after he had met with saleh 
saleh would not say how he knew higgins had not been killed by 
the organization of the oppressed on earth which claimed 
responsibility for the abduction 
his militia claims to have undercover agents who track hostage 
developments the moderate shiite movement backed by syria opposes 
the proiranian fundamentalist shiites who hold most of the 15 
foreigners missing in lebanon 
amal and hezbollah believed to be an umbrella group for those 
holding the hostages were at war for months and nearly 600 people 
were killed they reached a peace agreement in january that was 
mediated by syria and iran 
in an interview today on abc televisions good morning 
america higgins wife robin said she held out hope that salehs 
comments about her husband being alive were true of course weve 
seen many reports some very much in conflict with that i hope its 
true i hope we get better news and i hope we get him released 
soon she said 
militia officials and other sources interviewed in south lebanon 
shed new light on higgins abduction near tyre on feb 17 1988 his 
44th birthday was jan 19 
a security source told the associated press that members of amal 
tried to rescue higgins three days after he was kidnapped but were 
overwhelmed by hezbollah gunmen in the village of jibcheet 
he said 15 amal fighters infiltrated jibcheet the night of feb 
20 last year and surrounded the house where higgins was being held 
a dozen gunmen were guarding higgins but amal was determined to set 
him free 
a few shots were fired after which about 200 hezbollahis 
surrounded the amal men and disarmed them a golden opportunity to 
release higgins was lost 
no independent confirmation of the report was available but amal 
did make a considerable effort to find higgins angered that he was 
kidnapped in territory it considered its turf the militia created a 
dragnet and rounded up scores of hezbollah activists 
reflecting on the meeting a year ago saleh said we talked 
about the hostages and several other things 
nine of the foreign captives in lebanon are americans including 
terry a anderson 41 who has been held the longest anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
higgins unit since withdrawn was attached to the un interim 
force in lebanon its 5800 men from nine nations patrol a narrow 
strip of south lebanon separating israels selfproclaimed 
security zone from the rest of the predominantly shiite region 
timur goksel spokesman for the peacekeeping force said as a 
peacekeeper higgins didnt deserve such a treatment we hope that 
one day the kidnappers will realize what a mistake they made and 
release him 
goksel interviewed at the forces headquarters in the coastal 
village of naqoura said un officials have no way of knowing 
whether the kidnappers carried out the threat to kill higgins they 
made it in a statement dec 12 the last received about the us 
marine 
un and us government have denied allegations by the 
kidnappers that higgins was a spy for israel and was planning 
possible missions to rescue the other americans 
mohammed harqous amals security chief in tyre said the 
abduction was perfectly planned and carried out 
he said the kidnappers drove higgins in heavy rain through 10 
villages and changed cars three times in the tyre region before 
crossing the litani river on foot the night of feb 18 
harqous said higgins injured one of his legs during the rough 
hike northward and one of the kidnappers carried higgins on his 
back across the litani he would not reveal his sources of 
information 
higgins then was taken to jibcheet harqous said but he would 
not comment on the report of a rescue attempt by amal 
according to the security source a few days after the 
confrontation his captors took higgins to a base on the slopes 
around louwaizeh village near the western flank of israels 
security zone 
higgins was held in louwaizeh for about 40 days within a 
fiveminute drive of the security zone the source said early 
last april higgins was moved in a car fitted with diplomatic 
license plates from louwaizeh to south beirut and hes been held 
there ever since 
hezbollah controls nearly all the shiite slums of south beirut 
and most of the foreign captives are believed to be held there

a controversial exhibition of avantgarde art 
reopened today under tight security two days after police closed it 
because of a bomb threat 
the show was also closed on opening day feb 5 for five days 
when artists defied a ban on performance art and one fired two bbs 
into her sculpture 
uniformed guards patrolled the three floors of the china art 
gallery today as crowds of mainly young people gathered in front of 
the paintings and sculptures guards were posted at the main gate of 
the museum and no bags or large packages were allowed inside 
police closed the show wednesday after a beijing newspaper 
received a letter saying bombs would be planted in the gallery if 
the show was not shut for good organizers said they believe an 
artist was responsible for the threat which they view as a hoax 
it seems to be another kind of performance art said one 
organizer we think the artist is trying to show arts 
relationship with chinese society 
on feb 5 a series of performance art pieces culminating in the 
shooting of a telephone booth sculpture by the artist led 
authorities to close the show the artist and her boyfriend were 
detained for three days and then released 
the show is the largest avantgarde show in chinas history 
filling five large halls of the china art gallery with more than 250 
works it is the first largescale exhibition of chinese modern art 
to be held in beijing since 1981

about two dozens toilets and urinals in the king 
county courthouse exploded when they were flushed after an air 
compressor was mistakenly connected to a water line officials said 
we think weve lost about 20 to 25 toilets building services 
manager bill kemp said thursday the porcelain is actually 
cracked 
each time the pressurized privies were flushed in restrooms 
throughout the 72yearold building plumbing started popping kemp 
said instead of the usual swirl and gurgle of water geysers 
erupted 
officials eventually traced the problem to an erroneous 
compressor hookup by a construction worker on a nearby 430 million 
bus tunnel project 
they started blowing at about 1130 am and it took us a 
while to figure it out he recounted we knew it had to be air 
in the system but the city water department said that was 
impossible 
kemp said there were no reports of injuries although several 
people apparently were soaked 
after the incident all courthouse restrooms were closed for the 
day and employees and others had to walk across the street to 
toilets in the county administration building kemp said most 
courthouse toilets would be back in operation today damage has yet 
to be determined

nations today signed a treaty creating a common market and joining 
their countries in a union to compete with a united europe 
the chiefs of state of morocco algeria tunisia libya and 
mauritania signed the document creating the union of the arab 
great maghreb in marrakech city hall at the end of a threeday 
summit 
maghreb is the arab word for west and is generally used 
to designate the arab countries west of egypt 
libyan leader moammar gadhafis last minute proposal to expand 
the treaty to include sudan chad mali and niger was quietly 
dropped instead the leaders inserted a line in the text leaving 
the treaty open to include other arab or african countries at a 
later date 
the treaty would not have been possible without the recent 
reconciliation of moroccos king hassan ii and algerias chadli 
bendjedid the two countries had been on the brink of war for 15 
years over algerias support for the polisario guerrilla movement in 
the moroccanannexed western sahara 
morocco claims the former spanish territory 
with un help the quarrel was resolved 
immediately after the signing ceremony the leaders went to the 
1000yearold koutoubia mosque to pray 
the main body of the union is a council made up of the five 
chiefs of state it will meet at least once a year to make decisions 
and set policy on a variety of economic issues all decisions must 
be reached unanimously with any single nation having the right to 
veto 
a commission of prime ministers and foreign ministers will handle 
daytoday affairs 
the goal is for individuals and goods to be able someday to move 
freely through the 2millionsquaremile north african region in 
addition trade agreements with foreign states or groups of states 
will be negotiated jointly 
the leaders also plan to institute a single identity card for all 
citizens of the new union 
the arab leaders found motivation for their treaty in the 
european economic communitys plans for a europe without borders 
under a plan by the 12member eec the arrangement would be in place 
after 1992 and would permit the free flow of goods and people 
throughout europe

a serial killer is preying on prostitutes in 
the same crimeinfested area that gave rise to the southside slayer 
and may have killed as many as 12 women authorities said 
i will confirm that an investigation is currently being 
conducted on female victims who were engaged in prostitution for 
drugs said police lt fred nixon a department spokesman 
police lt john zorn who is coordinating the latest 
investigation said thursday that at least nine of the most recent 
victims were killed with the same weapon 
theres one gun they have one weapon used over and over 
zorn said its a small handgun this type and caliber of handgun 
has been targeted by the department 
you dont know theres one killer until several deaths occur 
zorn said once they make the connection and see the same gun 
they realize they have the same suspect 
television station kabc reported thursday that as many as 12 
prostitutes have been found shot to death in the area since august 
1985 
zorn also headed the task force that investigated the socalled 
southside slayer task force whose victims were found strangled in 
south central los angeles between september 1983 and july 1986 most 
of them had been stabbed and all but a few had arrest records for 
prostitution 
one man has been convicted of one of the slayings and two others 
were charged separately in seven of the killings 
kabc said police have been quietly investigating the latest 
string of killings for a year which drew criticism from community 
activist margaret prescod who called such a lowprofile approach 
outrageous 
it feels as though history is repeating itself she said 
eleven women were already murdered before they called the press 
conference to tell us about the southside slayer 
kabc said the investigation had been kept quiet because of fears 
that publicity would bring protests from residents but nixon denied 
that was the case 
our reluctance to publicize the killings has nothing to do with 
a fear of any major demonstrations he said 
police added they are warning women who fit the profile of those 
murdered to be cautious 
nixon said the victims are called strawberries in street 
jargon because they sell sex for drugs but declined to give further 
background on them

the personal conduct of defense 
secretarydesignate john tower has overtaken his pentagon business 
dealings as a focus of investigators attention as lawmakers prepare 
to take up his nomination 
of particular concern is towers 16month stint in geneva as head 
of the american delegation that met with the soviets to discuss 
mutual cuts in longrange nuclear missiles the former texas senator 
was there from january 1985 to april 1986 
according to a report in todays washington times details on 
towers sexual activities in geneva would come out in a closed 
hearing of a house subcommittee investigating allegations of 
security violations by another member of the delegation 
the newspaper reported that an investigator from the state 
department and one from the air force were to arrive saturday from 
geneva the investigators are to appear at a session of the house 
energy and commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee headed 
by rep john dingell dmich 
the times report which deals with a hearing on allegations 
against retired air force lt col robert moser says allegations 
about tower arose in an office of personnel management review on 
mosers request for a department of energy security clearance 
the review said tower kept both his secretaries in geneva as 
mistresses the newspaper reported two weeks ago abc news said an 
air force colonel claimed there were 14 separate liaisons involving 
members of the us delegation in switzerland 
in another published report the washington post said today that 
the fbi report summarizing the bureaus findings has uncovered no 
evidence linking him to the pentagon procurement scandal or illegal 
campaign contributions but the newspaper quoted one source as 
saying the report would contain a wealth of allegations about the 
guys personal conduct 
tom kirk the fbi agent who wrote the report told the newspaper 
the report will contain new information on tower that has not been 
made public 
tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and 
philandering many senators also have voiced concern whether tower 
could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than 1 
million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left 
the senate four years ago 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee which is reviewing the nomination has said that an 
investigation of towers actions in geneva found no security 
breaches 
additionally nunn said wednesday in rome ga that if members 
of the full senate bring up questions about towers personal life 
the lawmakers may be forced to meet behind closed doors 
i hope not but it depends on the type of questions posed on 
the senate floor by senators who are not members of the senate armed 
services committee nunn said referring to the senate 
deliberations should the nomination clear his panel 
i emphasize that the leadership of the senate will make this 
decision not the armed services committee or its chairman he 
said 
a closed session of the full senate is highly unusual occurring 
on average about once a year and usually relating to national 
security issues 
the last closed session occurred on march 29 1988 when the 
senate met to discuss the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
with the soviet union 
towers conduct in geneva also drew criticism this week from the 
reagan administrations former arms control chief kenneth l 
adelman 
although impressed with towers performance as a strategic arms 
negotiator adelman said the former texas senators lack of 
discretion proved troublesome then as before and since 
towers private behavior didnt directly affect his conduct of 
official business at the geneva talks adelman said but adelman 
said towers conduct should be a factor in the senate confirmation 
deliberations because a defense secretary has no private life 
adelman in a los angeles times interview published thursday and 
in a washington times column on wednesday provided no details on 
what activities proved troublesome

unrelenting rain flooded homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds 
of residents 
a central kentucky town became an island when swirling muddy 
water encapsuled it thursday the only way out was by boat or 
helicopter three people were killed and a child was missing after 
their car was swept away in a rainswollen creek near mineral wells 
texas 
tennessee gov ned mcwherter asked the us small business 
administration on thursday to designate eight middle tennessee 
counties as flood disaster areas kentucky officials said they would 
seek similar federal relief 
we hope the worst of it is over kentucky gov wallace 
wilkinson said after touring some of the hardesthit areas of his 
state

officer for the tennessee emergency management agency said today 
that forecasters were watching a storm in texas expected to move 
into the state 
it appears to be headed toward us either kentucky or 
tennessee will get a lot of moisture we just dont know who its 
going to be he said 
a weeks worth of rainfall measuring more than 10 inches in some 
places flooded roads forced schools to close and claimed at least 
three lives

forced from their homes by rising waters in most of the river 
systems in the western twothirds of the state

above flood stage at frankfort in central kentucky and several

the government today banned two 
antiapartheid publications for three months after accusing them of 
repeatedly publishing subversive material 
the publications based in cape town and affiliated with each 
other are grassroots a monthly tabloid newspaper and new era a 
quarterly magazine 
three other antiapartheid publications were banned for varying 
periods last year under stateofemergency regulations which give 
broad censorship powers to home affairs minister stoffel botha 
he said grassroots and new era had carried articles promoting 
revolution stirring up hatred towards the security forces and 
promoting the public esteem of unlawful organizations such as the 
african national congress 
the outlawed african national congress is the leading group 
fighting the south african system of apartheid which enshrines 
control by 5 million whites over a country with 26 million blacks 
grassroots was established in 1980 and distributes 50000 copies 
throughout the cape town region new era a younger publication 
circulates 5000 copies nationwide 
in a statement responding to the banning the staff of grassroots 
said today is a tragic one for the people of the western cape 
our fate has been predetermined by an individual minister whose 
subjective opinion cannot be challenged in a court of law it 
said on may 17 we will back and we will be continuing to 
publish the truth

police officers in at least four 
departments have used the mobile computer terminals in their patrol 
cars to transmit racial and other slurs authorities said 
police chief kenneth stonebraker said three officers in his 
department were disciplined for two incidents that have occurred 
since 1986 and a third incident last weekend was still under 
investigation 
robert benson executive director of the police communications 
center that recorded the exchanges said thursday that officers at 
the three other police departments the center serves manhattan 
beach gardena and el segundo have transmitted similar messages 
over their computers in the last several years 
the first incident reported in hawthorne came to light earlier 
this week when computer printouts kept at the communications center 
were leaked to television station kcbs they showed officers 
transmitting racial antihomosexual and antisemitic jokes 
theyre inappropriate theres no way to justify them 
stonebraker said but he added he doesnt believe the three 
incidents represent a festering problem within the department 
officers are told during training that computer printouts are

more than 100 detainees in a 
port elizabeth prison ended a 3weekold hunger strike today after 
being told of a government promise to free some blacks being held 
without charge 
the decision by 105 detainees at st albans prison was announced 
by attorney kobus pienaar it followed a decision thursday by 170 
detainees at a johannesburg prision to end their hunger strike an 
undetermined number of other detainees continued their strike at 
other prisons around south africa 
prominent antiapartheid detainees including some who have been 
hospitalized from the effects of the strike were freed while 
attorneys met with the minister of law and order aimed at more 
releases 
trevor manuel regional director of the united democratic front

researchers said today the atmosphere over the 
arctic region is primed for a very large destruction of ozone 
but a sixweek study did not uncover a vast ozone hole as had 
been found over the south pole 
scientists who led the recently concluded international research 
effort into arctic ozone depletion said there are clear chemical 
signs that significant ozone destruction could occur over the arctic 
region possibly within the next few weeks 
however there is no large ozone hole in the arctic dr 
robert watson a national aeronautics and space administration 
scientists and one of the research project leaders told a news 
conference 
a canadian scientist recently suggested in a study that an ozone 
hole may be developing over the arctic because of atmospheric 
pollution watson said the latest research could not make that 
conclusion 
but he and dr adrian tuck another project scientist said the 
research effort found strong evidence of an abundance of 
chemically active chlorine compounds and other conditions in the 
arctic region that are key to the destruction of the ozone layer 
an international team of scientists began the research effort in 
early january and concluded it recently 
scientists are concerned about the destruction of ozone in the 
stratosphere because it provides a protective layer against 
ultraviolet rays of the sun overexposure to such rays has been 
linked to skin cancer watson said it has been estimated that a 1 
percent depletion of ozone causes a 2 percent increase in 
ultraviolet radiation 
a primary cause of ozone depletion is the release of 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs into the stratosphere an 
international treaty has called for the reduction of cfcs used as 
a refrigerant and as a foamblowing agent by 50 percent over the 
next decade because of its harm to the ozone layer 
the arctic research effort which involved scientists from the 
united states britain and norway began jan 1 from a base in 
stavanger norway it included 28 flights over the arctic region 
aboard an instrumentladen dc8 and a highaltitude er2 
surveillance aircraft to gather data 
the researchers focused on a large vortex of westerly winds 
over the arctic region they reported finding the stratosphere 12 or 
more miles above the arctic highly perturbed because of chemical 
reactions including the presence of high levels of manmade 
ozonedepleting chlorine oxide gasses 
furthermore said the scientists they confirmed an abundance of 
highlevel clouds formed by tiny particles of ice these socalled 
polar stratospheric clouds intensify the chemical reaction that 
destroys ozone because they provide a surface chlorine molecules 
the researchers said the sixweek study found no direct evidence 
of arctic ozone loss but they concluded that a considerable 
portion of the vortex air was primed for zone destruction and if 
the amount of sunlight increases ozone could be destroyed at a 
significant rate possibly as much as 1 percent a day while the 
conditions exist 
but they said the research provided no solid evidence as to how 
much ozone destruction might occur over the arctic scientists 
previously have estimated that based on data collected from baloons 
about 6 percent of the arctic ozone may have been destroyed since 
l970 
the scientists said the degree of actual arctic ozone destruction 
in the future will depend on a variety of factors including future 
weather conditions amount of sunlight and how long the wind 
patterns remain in place 
nevertheless said tuck the atmosphere over the arctic is 
primed for a very large destruction of ozone although scientists 
do not foresee the degree of ozone destruction over the north pole 
as has been found over the antarctic 
were not dealing with a 50 percent ozone loss situation 
here said tuck a scientist for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration

a federal judge today ruled that the 
immigration and naturalization service can reinstate a policy that 
confines refugees to south texas while their applications for 
political asylum are considered 
the decision by us district judge filemon vela denied an 
injunction sought by attorneys for refugees who sued the ins over 
the notravel policy 
the regulation was blamed for a backup of hundreds of homeless 
central americans at the southern tip of texas the judge on jan 9 
temporarily ordered the ins to allow refugees to travel to their 
intended us destinations while he reviewed the request for a 
permanent lifting of the notravel policy 
many refugees then boarded buses for california and florida 
a report thursday indicated central american refugees might be 
detained in a south texas tent city while their applications for 
political asylum are processed us rep lamar smith rtexas says 
the facility would meet basic human necessities of adequate housing 
food and sanitary conditions there would not be a fence 
we think thats going to create a multitude of problems here in 
the lower rio grande valley mark schneider one of the 
attorneys who sued the ins over the matter said after learning of 
the judges decision 
the attorneys quickly appealed velas order attorney linda yanez 
said she filed the appeal in brownsville and asked for an injunction 
against the ins pending that appeal 
ins officials in harlingen said they would comment on the ruling 
later today 
more than 100000 central americans are expected to pour into the 
area this year after crossing the rio grande illegally near 
brownsville according to the ins 
ins officials last spring reported a large increase in the number 
of central americans seeking political asylum in south texas the 
agency had stamped asylumseekers documents and allowed them to 
travel to their declared us destinations until dec 15 when faced 
with huge case backlogs in cities such as miami and los angeles it 
started requiring people to pursue their cases in harlingen 
hundreds of immigrants started camping in squalid conditions in 
makeshift tents and condemned buildings in the area prompting a 
local public outcry 
attorneys filed a classaction lawsuit against the ins 
contending it failed to seek public comment before making the 
change as required by federal law the suit prompted judge vela to 
issue the temporary restraining order that expires monday 
vela today agreed with the ins that public comment was not 
required for the travel restriction because it merely constituted 
general statements of agency organization procedure or 
practice and did not remove the opportunity to apply for asylum 
the changes were procedural rather than substantive vela said 
the changes merely alter the location of adjudication of the 
asylum applications he wrote 
asylum is granted to those fleeing various forms of persecution 
the ins contends however that most of those seeking asylum come to 
the united states only for economic reasons and therefore do not 
qualify for asylum 
those suing the agency contend that the asylumseekers should be 
able to travel to cities where they have families and friends and 
better access to legal representation while pursuing their cases

a colombian who ran a major 
moneylaundering operation in the united states for some of the 
worlds biggest cocaine traffickers has been sentenced to 40 years 
in prison 
carlos restrepo 38 of medellin who claims he was engaged in 
the legitimate business of currency exchange said after sentencing 
thursday he would appeal his conviction 
restrepo and three other men sentenced with him in us district 
court were arrested in june 1987 after a threeyear fbi undercover 
investigation about 100 people around the country turned over 200 
million in drug money to fbi agents posing as money launderers said 
us attorney stanley twardy 
restrepo was convicted in november of 66 counts including 
multiple violations of the federal money laundering and travel acts 
racketeering and conspiracy 
he was found to have moved about 13 million in cocaine proceeds 
through a dummy corporation set up by the fbi in greenwich between 
september 1986 and june 1987 prosecutors also presented evidence 
that he laundered about 7 million through operations in los angeles 
and san francisco 
assistant us attorneys richard n palmer and james t cowdery 
told the court that the money laundered by restrepo would purchase 
more than 2 tons of cocaine in colombia for sale in the united 
states 
also thursday judge jose cabranes sentenced carlos gaviria 31 
of colombia to 20 years in prison gaviria was a lieutenant in an 
enterprise that laundered money for the organization of rigoberto 
correa the government said 
marco tulio lora 50 and jorge gomez 35 colombians who had 
been living in miami received 16year prison sentences prosecutors 
said they served as brokers in the moneylaundering business 
three men described as couriers for restrepo were sentenced 
wednesday one received a fouryear sentence while the others were 
placed on probation 
restrepo was the only defendant convicted in connecticut who did 
not plead guilty his attorney vincent flynn contended that 
restrepo was an innocent businessman involved in currency exchange

if youre still confused about the new federal 
tax law youre in good company fifty professionals who advertise 
themselves as experts calculated a mythical familys taxes and came 
up with 50 different answers 
even worse according to a survey by money magazine the experts 
figure for the familys tax bill varied from 12539 to 35813 the 
correct answer according to the accountant who devised the test 
was 23393 
the abundance of mistakes our test turned up suggests that pros 
are nowhere near as knowledgeable about the tax law as they are 
supposed to be money writes in its march issue after all we 
were sampling highly regarded preparers who willingly accepted our 
challenge to calculate the model return 
the experts actually did worse than in a similar money test a 
year ago when taxpayers were facing effects of the landmark 1986 
tax law for the first time 
in last years survey the professionals also came up with 50 
different answers but the gap between the highest and lowest was 
about 50 percent this year the highest was almost 300 percent of 
the lowest 
i was completely surprised by the results said wesley r 
fitzpatrick of the portland ore office of grant thornton 
accountants who made up this years test 
when the taxreform law was new you could understand the 
confusion but now its hard to explain all the mistakes about 
fundamental rules fitzpatrick said 
the hypothetical familys tax return was tackled by 30 
independent certified public accountants 12 representatives of 
franchise returnpreparation outlets three cpas from national 
accounting companies and five enrolled agents who are tested and 
licensed by the internal revenue service their fees range from 325 
to 2500 
according to money the only preparers who made no major goofs 
were five independent cpas one enrolled agent four franchised 
preparers and fitzpatrick who devised the test 
for the test fitzpatrick conjured up a threemember family whose 
tax problems are unlikely to be faced by most taxpayers however 
money said the experts made mistakes on basic tax provisions that 
could affect taxpayers at almost any income level 
for example the familys 13yearold son earned 600 mowing 
lawns but 16 of the professionals failed to note that he would have 
to file a return twelve of the experts made the wrong choice on the 
tax treatment of inherited us savings bonds raising the familys 
taxes by 3300 
the family had salaries of 56400 but both spouses quit their 
jobs during the year and took big lumpsum withdrawals from their 
pensions the wife set up her own business the husband was 
negotiating to buy his own company the couple had several 
investments owned two homes and inherited a third from the wifes 
mother 
the biggest problem for the experts although it had a 
relatively minor impact on the familys taxes was calculating the 
deduction for interest the 1986 law made major changes on this 
deduction 
ten preparers were wrong in claiming the husbands mother who 
lived with the family all year as a dependent nineteen experts 
claimed three times too much depreciation on equipment used in the 
wifes new business 
however money reported some errors cannot be blamed on the new 
law the magazine said 14 professional preparers made the wrong 
calculation on a loss on the sale of stock an area of law that 
dates back to 1921 
money noted that the survey was conducted before much of the 
computer software widely used in the business was ready for this 
years returns with computers the results would have been better 
the magazine said although fitzpatrick said computers would not 
have prevented the most common goofs 
it is not just professional return preparers who are having 
trouble with the new law 
two weeks ago a survey by the general accounting office an arm 
of congress found that irs personnel whose job is to answer 
telephoned queries from taxpayers gave the right response to test 
questions only 64 percent of the time during the last filing season

a fastmoving fivealarm fire gutted a 
prominent art gallery destroying a collection valued by the artist 
at more than 1 million and sending off flames that were visible 
throughout most of the city 
no injuries were reported but about 1100 people attending a 
concert at the fillmore auditorium adjacent to the duquette 
pavilion of st francis were evacuated authorities said 
the interior is all gone assistant fire chief ed murphy said 
at the scene of the blaze 
the blaze was controlled at 244 am more than five hours after 
it was reported firefighters were still trying to determine its 
cause but fire chief fred postel said it was believed to have 
started in a caretakers apartment in the six to sevenstory 
building formerly a synagogue arson investigator al silvestri said 
there was nothing suspicious about the fire 
there were flames like ive never seen before said eddie 
seymour 18 who lives a few blocks from the gallery which features 
the work of artist and owner tony duquette the fire was visible 
from most of the city and acrid smoke blanketed the western addition 
district and surrounding neighborhoods 
buildings adjacent to the gallery including the famous fillmore 
and the former peoples temple run by the rev jim jones were not 
damaged by flames but may have suffered water damage postel said 
about 140 firefighters battled the fire which quickly climbed to 
the roof of the stately buff brick building postel said the 
structures large open interior space and wooden ceiling supported 
by trusses instead of columns made it difficult to fight the blaze 
a shaken duquette watched as firefighters directed cascades of 
water into the building through the shattered stained glass window 
and the remains of a metal starburst sculpture that partly covered 
it 
the artist said the collection was valued at more than more 1 
million but was too distraught to provide other details the 
collection which had been featured in time and other publications 
included tapestries and sculptures much of it dedicated to st 
francis of assisi the saint for whom san francisco is named

with less than a week to go before the state funeral 
of emperor hirohito riot police already have taken up positions 
along the procession route from the imperial palace to the shinjuku 
imperial gardens 
other preparations for the feb 24 funeral are entering the final 
stages 
bulldozers cranes and construction workers have clearly left 
their mark on the normally serene parklike grounds of the gardens 
where the funeral will be held 
a main funeral hall with a curved roof in the traditional style 
of japans indigenous religion has been built along with a 
reception area for mourners and a prefabricated shelter for the 
media 
dominating the gardens are two white tents more than 330 feet 
long where the imperial family government leaders foreign 
dignitaries and other guests will be seated 
foreign ministry officials who gave foreign reporters their 
first look at the site friday said 5000 people will be seated in 
each tent guests unable to see the main hall will be able to view 
the proceedings on seven highdefinition tv screens 
representatives of 154 nations are expected to attend among the 
dignitaries will be president bush philippine president corazon 
aquino britains prince philip and french president francois 
mitterrand 
foreign ministry officials have been overwhelmed by more than 
1000 foreign journalists seeking credentials 
security at the gardens is tight with armored police vehicles 
and road blocks securing entrances officers scan the surrounding 
area from perches atop a large greenhouse 
since hirohitos death from cancer on jan 7 his body has lain 
in state at the main ceremonial hall of the palace 
riot police sometimes stationed only hundreds of yards apart 
have begun a 24hour watch on the fourmile route along which the 
emperors body will travel from the palace to the gardens 
the 40minute procession route winds through mostly business and 
government districts passing by the parliament and supreme court 
buildings several facilities built for the 1964 tokyo olympics also 
are along the way 
clad in dark blue helmets and uniforms and wielding silver 
shields and nightsticks the thousands of riot police along downtown 
streets are the most conspicuous evidence of the governments 
determination to maintain security 
a highranking official with the national police agency said 
the situation requires security on an unprecedented scale 
the government has 19 million to security a quarter of the 
funeral budget police will undertake random searches of vehicles in 
areas around the gardens and palace and check and reseal manholes 
frogmen will patrol the waters around one of the airports where 
dignitaries will arrive 
the police official said about 26000 police had been assigned to 
funeral security and that would be increased to 32000 on the day of 
the funeral there are about 220000 police in japan 
security requirements have forced police to bring in officers 
from all over the country but the official said 10000 areas 
designated as possible terrorist targets are being given 
sufficient attention 
we may suffer a blow but not a knockout he said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
newspapers have kept readers updated on what to expect when the 
day arrives running reports on everything on traffic to the 253 
temporary toilets along the funeral procession route

aviation week amp space technology said the 5200pound satellite 
is the third generation of defense support program payloads designed 
to give the united states instant alert of a missile attack 
the magazine said in a report to be published in its feb 20 
issue that nine of the new dsp satellites costing 180 million 
each will be launched over the next several years 
it said the satellite has an advanced infrared telescope to 
detect the heat exhaust of a missile rising after launch from land 
or sea 
while missile warning is the payloads primary role aviation 
week said the satellite also will provide intelligence on routine 
soviet and chinese missile test firings and space launches 
it also is expected to be able to detect the heat from military 
aircraft when they fly with their afterburners on for higher speed 
the magazine said the satellite has new survivability features 
including a system to protect it from groundbased lasers 
thirteen early model dsp satellites have been launched by the air 
force since 1971

a 2175 million jury award to rock hudsons 
lover is clearly excessive and catastrophic critics said 
but others praised the verdict for sending a message about 
responsibility to those with aids 
some lawyers were aghast at the size of the award to marc 
christian and one homosexual rights activist said he was concerned 
that the decision would wrongly free lovers of their responsibility 
to protect themselves against aids 
christian was hudsons homosexual lover before the actor died of 
aids on oct 5 1985 christian sued hudsons estate and personal 
secretary mark miller saying they had caused him emotional anguish 
by failing to warn him that hudson had the fatal disease 
jurors found hudson and miller engaged in outrageous conduct 
by failing to tell christian of hudsons diagnosis 
benjamin schatz a lawyer for national gay rights advocates in 
san francisco said the case sends a dangerous message it tells 
people that if they continue to bury their heads in the sand by 
engaging in unsafe sex and become infected its entirely their 
partners fault and they dont bear any responsibility 
while we understand the jurys sympathy for the plaintiff the 
precedent their award establishes is catastrophic said frank 
schubert president of the association for california tort reform 
what the jurys done is award damages for fear whether its 
rational fear or not 
christian consistently has tested negative for infection with the 
aids virus his lawyer said thats no guarantee he wont eventually 
develop aids because of his sexual liaisons with hudson 
under california law the issue is irrelevant said attorney 
margaret davis author of lovers doctors amp the law and tom 
coleman legal director for the gay and lesbian community services 
center in los angeles 
in many other jurisdictions you have to show physical injury 
as well as emotional injury ms davis said in california if 
you can prove emotional distress you do not have to prove a 
tangible injury 
coleman said the jury was right to side with christian but 
added the damages seem a bit high when you compare it with 
someone who may be paralyzed for life and may get a lot less money 
ms davis said the largerthananticipated award sends a 
really serious symbolic message to all lovers the person who is 
going to mislead a sexual partner is really going to think twice 
before they tell a lie 
schatz said he was concerned that the case opens the door to a 
variety of spurious lawsuits by angry lovers 
dr neil schram a member of the california medical associations 
aids task force called the award clearly excessive since 
christian apparently wasnt infected and put the blame for hudsons 
actions on society 
rock hudson was required all his life to be sexually dishonest 
in order to be successful schatz said he had to remain in the 
closet as long as society continues to tell people to hate 
themselves for their sexuality then its hard to expect them to 
respect their sexual partners and be honest

in the heart of paris home of fantastic foie gras 
and sublime sauces americans can satisfy an urge for pumpkin pie 
peanut butter creamed corn and even cheerios 
but the general store is more than just a kitchen away from home 
for expatriates 
its operators jeanpierre and elaine bourbeillon say it is 
increasingly popular with the french who are developing a taste for 
american food 
bourbeillon is french and his wife is from new zealand but they 
know a lot about cranberry sauce chocolate chip cookies taco 
shells and molasses 
they got hooked on american fare when jeanpierre was a 
commodities trader in the united states from 1976 to 1984 
the european idea of american food is built on preconceived 
notions and prejudices mostly developed from lack of knowledge and 
being exposed to the fastfood craze bourbeillon 46 said 
recently as he served customers there is more to american food 
than burgers and hot dogs 
when the bourbeillons returned to france from boston they made a 
list of foods a good representative idea of what america has to 
offer regional products like maple syrup and clam chowder from the 
northeast and texmex from the southwest he said 
they opened the store three years ago and their clientele is 
split evenly between americans and the french 
there has always been a lovehate relationship with the united 
states the french have always had a tremendous fascination with 
anything american bourbeillon said 
a french woman francoise roger entered the store on a narrow 
left bank street for a look around and bought a bottle of bleu 
cheese salad dressing and a jar of blueberry chutney 
im curious about the tastes of other countries she said 
today im concentrating on typical american tastes im here 
looking for sauces 
many customers come for the fresh brownies cookies and pies 
elaine bakes daily 
in the beginning we got a lot of press like we were some 
oddball operation selling california wine to the french 
bourbeillon said but the french have moved from a kind of amused 
interest to a genuine liking for american food 
and there are other trends the french are taking to brunches 
and are starting to like making pancakes or having a chili dinner 
for 20 its becoming an accepted thing to do at least in paris 
said mrs bourbeillon it is a change in attitude and a new way 
of life i dont think its a passing trend it is an evolution 
the general store is busiest at thanksgiving 
last year we discovered we were becoming famous mrs 
bourbeillon said the year before we did turkey for the first 
time with all the fixings plus pastry pumpkin and pecan pies 
this year we produced literally hundreds of meals 
demand was so great that they joined forces with a poultry dealer 
down the street mrs bourbeillon furnished a sage stuffing recipe 
and a neighbor cooked the turkeys while she baked the pies 
he kept running up here with pans of it for tasting sessions 
she said 
for the french we had to tell them what to do with the yams and 
cranberry sauce we gave out little recipes it was a lot of fun 
she said

the federal government authorized an 
attempt friday to rescue a bottlenose dolphin from the chilly waters 
of broad bay because the young mammal has been losing weight 
officials said 
a sevenmember team from sea world in orlando fla planned to 
try to trap the dolphin in a net during low tide and move it by 
truck or plane to sea world for rehabilitation 
this is for the animals best health and welfare at this 
time said douglas beach a biologist with the national marine 
fisheries service he may well be able to survive the rest of the 
winter i dont know but our fear is that he may not and we may 
have a real sick dolphin on our hands at a later date 
the service decided the animal nicknamed rascal should be 
rescued before it develops pneumonia or other ailments he said 
the dolphin which weighs about 250 pounds and is about 6 feet 
long stayed in broad bay months after other dolphins migrated 
south the animal eluded rescue efforts in december 
jack pearson curator of mammals at sea world said he expected 
the dolphin would be easier to capture now because it has become 
familiar with humans who have visited daily to check on its 
condition

the nations largest bookseller waldenbooks ordered the 
satanic verses off store shelves for fear that threats of violence 
against the books author and publisher might extend to its 
employees 
but the book was missing from many bookstore shelves today for 
another reason sales were booming 
this is not a freedom of speech issue the sole reason is the

brian weese general manager of encore books a harrisburg 
pabased chain of 47 stores in the middle atlantic states said 
several of his outlets have sold out their allotment 
the fistshaking is happening elsewhere thank god weese

sparked the sales rather than forcing people to remove it and not 
sell it

consumer groups say temporary regulations 
governing the size and placement of warning labels to be printed on 
alcoholic beverage containers are too lax to ensure that people will 
notice them 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms on thursday 
published the rules on the warning labels which congress last year 
voted to require on alcoholic beverages sold in the united states 
starting next november 
the regulations say the print in the labels must be at least 2 
millimeters high for containers larger than 8 ounces and at least 1 
millimeter for smaller containers the warnings must be placed on 
the brand label a separate front label or on a back or side label 
patricia taylor of the private nonprofit center for science in 
the public interest said the regulations serve the interests of 
the booze industry not the public 
its ridiculous to allow companies who fought labeling 
requirements for the past 20 years to print labels in tiny script 
any which way on the back or side of a bottle she said 
christine lubinski of the national council on alcoholism said the 
bureau had missed another opportunity to promote the publics 
health 
the public has 45 days to comment on the temporary regulations 
after which final rules will be published 
sen strom thurmond rsc who sponsored the labeling 
requirement in congress said if the final regulations allow 
industry members to place minuscule labels in difficulttofind 
places on the containers the purpose of the law has been defeated 
the labels warn that women should not drink alcoholic beverages 
during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects and caution 
that drinking alcoholic beverages impairs the ability to drive a car 
or operate machinery and can cause health problems

a jury today awarded 725 million in 
additional damages to rock hudsons lover who had already received 
an award of 145 million because the movie star failed to reveal he 
had aids 
the jurys decision on punitive and exemplary damages found that 
hudsons secretary and confidant mark miller acted with malice 
and intended to cause injury to marc christian when he failed to 
tell christian that hudson had the deadly disease 
if rock hudson had told me he had aids none of us would be 
here today christian said as he left the courtroom christian has 
not been diagnosed with aids 
he said he believes that times have changed and gay men do not 
now keep the kind of secrets that hudson kept from him 
this is 1989 and everybody has to take precautions for 
themselves he said i hope that no one will be as naive as i 
was in 1983 
millers attorney andrew banks called the size of the award 
outrageous and said he would file a motion to have it thrown out 
or reduced he said it was a good bet he would appeal 
some legal experts denounced the 145 million in compensatory 
damages 35 million more than the lawsuit asked for as 
excessive but a lawyer for christian had urged jurors thursday to 
add another 145 million to the judgment in punitive and exemplary 
damages the jury today awarded him half of that amount for a total 
of 2175 million 
the jury answered three questions in its verdict all of them 
yes the questions asked whether they found that miller intended 
to injure christian that he acted with a willful and conscious 
disregard for christians safety and whether millers fraudulent 
conduct deprived christian of a legal right or any other injury 
the jury decided wednesday that hudson and miller were guilty of 
outrageous conduct by deliberately hiding hudsons aids 
diagnosis from christian while hudson and christian continued to 
have unprotected sex 
the jury returned thursday to begin the next phase in the 
twomonth trial christians request for punitive and exemplary 
damages from miller only miller is named because state law 
prohibits such damages being awarded from an estate 
you have the opportunity to save the lives of untold millions 
you must surely be blessed christians lawyer harold rhoden 
told the jury 
but banks millers attorney told jurors to be cautious and go 
slowly in deciding 
banks urged the panel not to vent anger at hudson by penalizing 
miller 63 the secretary who also served as hudsons friend and 
confidante for 35 years 
hes not the person who had sex with marc christian banks 
said if youre angry at rock hudson i ask you to set all the 
feelings about rock hudson aside and consider mark miller there is 
no need to hit mark miller again 
christian 35 said he didnt find out about hudsons disease 
until it was announced to the world in july 1985 hudson died three 
months later at age 58 
christian sued the hudson estate and miller for 11 million 
claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress and an 
enhanced fear that he too will die of aids 
those who disagreed with the jurys decision to award christian 
35 million more than he had asked for said it could set a 
dangerous precedent 
im delighted with the message and im appalled at the size of 
the award said rabbi allen freehling chairman of the los angeles 
county commission on aids 
frank schubert president of the association for california tort 
reform called the verdict an awful decision 
while we understand the jurys sympathy for the plaintiff the 
precedent their award establishes is catastrophic schubert said 
theyve awarded for an injury that hasnt yet occurred what 
the jurys done is award damages for fear whether its rational 
fear or not 
rhoden told jurors that doubling the damages would send a message 
to the world that lovers cant keep secrets about aids without 
risking legal consequences 
if you bring in a verdict like the one you brought in 
yesterday you know the world is going to know about it he told 
the jury 
millers lawyer countered that the message already was sent 
its echoed around the world banks said now please 
exercise caution

japanese balloonist fumio niwa is giving up his 
attempt to cross the pacific ocean alone because of uncooperative 
winds and he plans to bring his craft down on the sea officials 
said friday 
project spokesman ren kato said an airplane would determine 
niwas location early saturday and that niwa then planned to bring 
his giant orangeandblue balloon down to wait for a ship to pick 
him up 
niwa lifted off early wednesday from his hometown of yokohama 
with the goal of becoming the first person to travel 5000 miles 
across the ocean alone in a balloon 
but the flight was frustrated from the start by winds that blew 
to the north rather than to california where niwa had hoped to land 
on sunday 
on friday his craft floated 44 miles above the pacific about 
1450 miles southeast of tokyo kato said 
kato said waves in the area were estimated at 20 feet in height 
and that niwa might not be able to bring down the craft until they 
subsided although the sixfoot plastic gondola carrying niwa can 
float high waves would batter it and possibly hide it from 
rescuers kato said 
japanese marine officials said no boats were in the area and that 
a coast guard ship would not arrive until sunday night 
if the high waves did subside and niwa brought down the balloon 
he could be left bobbing in the ocean for more than a day 
he should be able to survive for an extended period but the 
gondola will rock a great deal kato said hes likely to become 
very seasick 
niwa an experienced balloonist had hoped to travel to san diego 
in about four days with the help of highspeed highaltitude winds 
that generally blow west to east 
but after the launch the winds shifted north toward alaska niwa 
stayed at a low altitude initially in an attempt to travel south and 
then catch the southernmost edge of the jet stream which might have 
landed him farther south in north america 
he then jettisoned most of his ballast and rose in altitude but 
missed the highspeed winds said hiroaki tanaka another project 
spokesman 
the loss of the ballast means he no longer is able to maneuver 
up and down to find a good wind tanaka said 
niwa 38 quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to 
prepare for the flight he estimated the flight would cost about 
540000 a sum he hoped to recoup through a book and lectures about 
his experience 
in 1981 four men successfully crossed the pacific ocean by 
balloon for the first time but no one has traveled the distance 
alone

authorities on friday lifted a curfew 
called to quell ethnic violence after national elections gave the 
party of president ranasinghe premadasa another majority in 
parliament 
thousands of workers crowded the streets of colombo the capital 
on their way to work friday after the curfew ended at 5 am it was 
called thursday morning to forestall ethnic attacks during 
votecounting from wednesdays elections 
military officials said there had been no reports of major 
trouble during the curfew which confined most people to their homes 
at least 56 people were killed on election day during the 
fiveweek campaign more than 1000 people were killed by sinhalese 
extremists and tamil separatists police said both groups had vowed 
to disrupt the elections 
despite attacks and death threats 63 percent of 93 million 
eligible voters turned out 
premadasa whose united national party won 125 of the 225 
parliament seats called his election victory a decisive mandate 
for restoring law and order on this island off the southern tip of 
india 
however premadasa failed to gain the twothirds majority he 
wanted to ensure passage of legislation to implement his 
antipoverty program which he considers a key element in ending the 
bloodshed 
the minority tamil rebels opposed the elections because they are 
fighting the sinhalesedominated government for a homeland their

the irancontra trial of oliver north has been 
set to begin tuesday morning officials at the us courthouse said 
today 
problems have been worked out over the use of classified material 
that north wants to introduce in his defense and us district 
judge gerhard a gesell is telling the jury to report at 930 am 
tuesday said the officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
a jury of nine women and three men was chosen feb 9 the same 
day the justice department began trying to delay the trial the 
department lifted its objections on wednesday after receiving 
assurances from independent counsel lawrence walsh whose office is 
prosecuting north that classified material would be protected 
a stay of the trial granted last sunday by chief justice william 
rehnquist was vacated thursday 
meanwhile today a closeddoor courtroom fight continued over how 
the reagan administrations quid pro quo arrangements with third 
countries to provide aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels are to be 
presented at norths trial 
norths lawyers say the government is refusing to admit that 
president reagan and other top administration officials hid a policy 
of offering inducements to third countries for their support of the 
contras 
in a court filing wednesday that was made public today norths 
attorneys said walsh fails for the fourth time to 
acknowledge that reagan and other officials established a policy 
that the quid pro quo and other thirdcountry arrangements would 
not be disclosed 
the filing by lawyers brendan sullivan and barry simon reflects 
the courtroom fight that was continuing today behind closed doors as 
norths lawyers push for greater disclosures of arrangements which 
they have called the heart of the case 
gesell has said he will accept an admission of fact from the 
government on the arrangements rather than allowing norths lawyers 
to present the matter in detail in open court the issue involves 
substantial amounts of classified material 
in its proposed admission the government on tuesday suggested 
that north alone was responsible for devising a means of 
concealing a quid pro quo arrangement from congress norths 
lawyers said they said the independent counsels proposed 
submission on that point is grossly misleading and patently 
inadequate 
if the defense must be satisfied with a cold admission on the 
quid pro quo issue and must give up its right to present the many 
documents and the extensive live testimony that would bring the 
issue to life for the jury then it must also have an admission on 
the nondisclosure policy said norths lawyers 
they insisted that information be included setting forth 
particular instances in which executive branch officials withheld 
information concerning quid pro quo and other thirdcountry 
arrangements 
norths attorneys also said they want to supplement the 
governments admission with specifics of inducements the united 
states offered third countries to persuade them to support the 
contras 
they also saidthe names of the central american countries 
involved in the arrangements must be disclosed at trial 
norths lawyers are opposing a plan in which walsh would notify 
attorney general dick thornburgh any time particularly sensitive 
classified material is about to be disclosed 
the defense says the procedure would impose intolerable burdens 
on the court the witnesses and the jurors 
on tuesday gesell ordered thornburgh to stay out of the 
irancontra case saying it was up to walsh to prevent the 
introduction of classified information walshs office in meetings 
with the justice department then worked out the notification plan 
walsh says his procedure implements the judges order directing 
that the attorney general stay out of the case but gesell has made 
no comment on it 
despite gesells rulings the proposed plan gives the attorney 
general too much influence sullivan and fellow defense attorney 
barry simon said in a court brief 
but walsh said the defense motion is based on a misconception 
independent counsel does not contemplate the trifling bits and 
pieces activity by the attorney general which north professes 
to anticipate walsh said the daytoday conduct of this case 
will be by the independent counsel and only the independent 
counsel 
walsh said that he turns to the attorney general just as he turns 
on occasion to other government agencies and that as long as the 
agencies dont attempt to intrude in the courtroom north has no 
basis for objection 
the north trial was delayed this week because the justice 
department fearful that north would spill government secrets in the 
courtroom obtained a supreme court stay of the proceedings the 
court vacated the stay thursday after thornburgh said sufficient 
safeguards were in place to protect national security

the delayed criminal trial of former white 
house aide oliver north will begin next tuesday court officials 
said friday after final rules for disclosure of national secrets 
were ironed out 
there was no word directly from us district judge gerhard a 
gesell but the officials said the last problems over guidelines for 
handling classified information were resolved in closed meetings 
thursday and friday 
the officials spoke on condition that they not be identified 
details of the resolution were not immediately announced 
jury selection was begun on jan 31 and finished on feb 9 but 
that same day the justice department began efforts to delay the 
trial because of concerns that gesells rules for national security 
materials were not tight enough 
the department lifted its objections wednesday after receiving 
assurances from independent counsel lawrence walsh whose office is 
prosecuting north that undisclosable secrets will be protected 
prosecutor john keker and chief defense lawyer brendan sullivan 
will deliver their opening statements on tuesday after the jury is 
sworn 
norths lawyers argued friday that the jury must hear evidence 
during the trial that he was under white house orders not to 
disclose us offers of favors to countries that helped arm the 
nicaraguan contras 
most of the 12 criminal charges against north a former national 
security council aide involve hiding from congress and the attorney 
general what the administration was doing to help the contras 
because of national security secrets that swirl through material 
that may be made public during the trial gesell has to decide in 
advance what can and what cannot be presented to the jury one of 
the stickiest of those matters concerns the deals that may have been 
struck with third countries for contra aid 
norths defense includes a contention that he was authorized to 
do everything he did in diverting profits from iranian arms sales to 
help the contras fighting the leftist government of nicaragua 
gesell has said he will allow the government to make a general 
admission to the jury about the titfortat arrangements rather 
than allowing norths lawyers to present the matter in detail the 
issue involves substantial amounts of classified material 
an admission forces the defense to forgo the presentation of 
powerful evidence to the jury north attorney barry simon said in 
a court filing in return the defense is entitled to a full and 
candid concession of the basic facts that that evidence would prove 
together with the inference to be drawn from those basic facts 
the prosecution fails to acknowledge for the fourth time that 
former president reagan and other officials established a policy 
that the quid pro quo and other thirdcountry arrangements would 
not be disclosed simon said quid pro quo means 
somethingforsomething or an exchange of favors 
in its proposed admission the government on tuesday suggested 
that in one instance north alone was responsible for devising a 
means of concealing a quid pro quo arrangement from congress 
according to simon 
if the defense must be satisfied with a cold admission on the 
quid pro quo issue and must give up its right to present the many 
documents and the extensive live testimony that would bring the 
issue to life for the jury then it must also have an admission on 
the nondisclosure policy said norths lawyers 
simon proposed that the prosecutor tell the jury in the first 
paragraph that president reagan and other top administration 
officials established a donttalk policy 
he said also that the names of the central american countries 
involved in the arrangements must be disclosed at trial during the 
congressional irancontra hearings two years ago those countries 
were not publicly identified

president mikhail s gorbachev has appealed 
personally to president bush to help bring peace to afghanistan now 
that the red army has withdrawn a top kremlin diplomat said friday 
both the diplomat and a soviet general acknowleged at a news 
conference that the soviets are worried about continued bloodshed in 
afghanistan but rejected any parallels between their pullout and 
the 1973 withdrawal of us troops from vietnam 
the americans simply fled and abandoned everything when they 
left vietnam said gen valentin i varennikov deputy defense 
minister and chief of soviet ground forces we did not abandon 
anything we were not in a rush 
alexander a bessmertnykh soviet first deputy foreign minister 
said an individual message from gorbachev to bush seeks us 
backing for kremlin suggestions on how to achieve a political 
settlement in afghanistan including a halt in arms supplies to the 
usbacked insurgents and the establishment of a broaderbased 
government 
we are proposing that we assist in a ceasefire said 
bessmertnykh referring to the joint superpower action sought by 
gorbachev we consider that the united states and the soviet union 
can always play a positive role 
in what appeared to be a wideranging kremlin effort to prevent 
the violent overthrow of the promoscow government of president 
najib the soviets also sent messages to france britain west 
germany and italy asking them to give humanitarian and economic 
assistance to afghanistan bessmertnykh said 
messages were also sent to china iran and pakistan which have 
given weapons and other support to the guerrillas 
western diplomats and the insurgents have predicted najibs 
government will fall soon now that the soviets are gone the last of 
the red armys 115000 soldiers that had been stationed there 
returned home wednesday 
bessmertnykh said the withdrawal had created an extraordinary 
opportunity to end afghanistans nearly 11yearold civil war 
sparked by the april 1978 coup in which the marxist peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan seized power the soviets sent tanks 
and troops in the following year 
we believe all countries should respond to the emerging 
opportunity to put an end to the drawnout conflict by promoting the 
complete and fast settlement of the situation and the reinstatement 
of afghanistan as a prosperous strong independent neutral and 
nonaligned nation bessmertnykh said 
the message to bush from gorbachev was delivered to the white 
house on friday by soviet ambassador yuri dubinin said bush press 
secretary marlin fitzwater bush who was in st louis at the time 
did not have a chance to read the full letter fitzwater said 
fitzwater said the message from gorbachev generally repeats 
their public position 
fitzwater said he did not want to be more specific about the 
contents although he noted the soviet message did reiterate their 
public positions about ending support for the rebels 
we dont have a detailed response we just received the letter 
but our concerns remain the same fitzwater said 
bush said thursday he hoped the pullout would ensure no more 
bloodbaths in afghanistan but rejected a kremlin call for an 
immediate ceasefire and an arms embargo 
he said he could not endorse those measures because he was 
concerned that the retreating soviets might have left behind a 
tremendous amount of weapons and ammunition for their afghan 
allies 
according to us state department spokesman charles redman 
there was a massive stockpiling of weapons in afghanistan by the 
soviets recently and they handed over to najibs forces fighter 
aircraft and helicopters dozens of tanks infantry fighting 
vehicles armored personnel carriers more than 200 howitzers and 
hundreds of transport vehicles 
bessmertnykh seemed at pains to put the best possible cast on 
bushs statements when he said the soviets were encouraged by the 
presidents omission of any mention of continued us arms supplies 
to the guerrillas 
he said the soviets would like to take bushs words at face 
value 
later friday a senior official on secretary of state james a 
bakers plane said us weapons shipments to moslem guerrillas in 
afghanistan will be continued even if the soviet union ceased its 
support for the kabul government 
as long as the mujahedeen are fighting for the right of 
selfdetermination we should assist that effort the official 
said 
bessmertnykh also did not repeat kremlin charges the united 
states was violating the unbrokered accords that led to the 
soviet pullout by shipping weapons to the insurgents 
the departure of soviet soldiers at a time of political 
uncertainty has led some in the west to see similarities with south 
vietnam where communist forces seized power in 1975 three years 
after the departure of the last us combat troops 
there can be no parallels here said varennikov who 
previously served as the representative of the soviet military 
command in afghanistan now that soviet troops have gone we have 
left behind an integral and free state which is unfortunately still 
engaged in a war against bands that are still aggressive 
varennikov also said 30 soviet military advisers remain in 
afghanistan under a bilateral sovietafghan agreement 
these are mostly soviet military experts who will provide 
various kinds of needed assistance and ensure the landing of soviet 
planes bringing food and other goods to afghanistan varennikov 
told the tass news agency he said the advisers were not attached to 
afghan military units but to its government

one town was an island and unknown number of people were homeless 
friday in floodstricken kentucky where several swollen rivers 
crested and began to recede and sodden areas of tennessee got a 
fifth consecutive day of rain 
kentucky gov wallace wilkinson made another tour of flooded 
areas friday and was expected to seek a federal disaster declaration 
to make the state eligible for federal assistance tennessee gov 
ned mcwherter asked for similar relief thursday 
the two states have gotten a week of rain more than 10 inches in 
some places that flooded roads closed schools and some businesses 
and claimed at least three lives 
while the region is part of the area affected by last summers 
drought tennessee farmers worried that the heavy rain could harm 
their winter wheat crops planted last fall for harvest this year 
the national weather service said several kentucky streams had 
crested although the ohio river which forms kentuckys northern 
border and the green river in central kentucky continued rising 
mike callahan a weather service hydrologist said the broad ohio 
could force some river levels higher again when its high water backs 
up into lower streams 
kentuckys capital city frankfort got a break friday when the 
kentucky river finally stopped rising cresting 132 feet above 
flood stage at 442 feet 
frankfort city manager ken thompson said officials were still 
trying to determine how many people were left homeless by the flood 
but there was no firm count because most evacuees moved in with 
friends or relatives he said there was water in several hundred 
buildings in the city but the state capital complex was high and 
dry 
the citys civic center was packed with evacuees furniture and 
other belongings 
the forecast was a chance of light snow or rain through saturday 
with temperatures dropping 
hardest hit in kentucky was the tiny town of boston about 23 
miles south of louisville which became an island thursday when the 
last road into town was flooded the rolling fork of the salt river 
reached a recordtying 517 feet well above flood stage of 35 feet 
conditions in boston wont improve significantly until the ohio 
crests at louisville 23 miles north and allows the salt river to 
begin draining callahan said friday 
weve got plenty of food as long as nobody gets sick were 
all right said betty vandiver who has lived in boston for 32 
years 
rain fell friday for the fifth straight day in much of western 
and central tennessee and more rain was forecast for saturday 
since monday in tennessee memphis had received 529 inches of 
rain jackson 524 inches and nashville 530 inches high water 
overloaded nashvilles sewage system and raw waste was flowing 
toward the cumberland river 
in floodstricken obion county on tennessees northwestern 
corner the obion river was receding after breaking a levee 
thursday unleashing 3 feet of water that forced 377 people from 
their homes in the towns of obion and rives 
no injuries were reported but at least 50 homes two churches 
and a fire station were flooded and rives elementary school was 
closed 
a lot of the houses that were damaged had as much as 3 feet of 
water in them and state highway 216 had to be closed because the 
pavement was uprooted by the water said cecil whaley an 
operations officer for the tennessee emergency management agency 
a lot of the homes had up to 50 percent damage it could be quite 
awhile before they get back into them 
obion county along with neighboring dyer and weakley counties 
account for a third of tennessees annual 73 million wheat crop 
the states fifth leading cash crop state agriculture officials 
said 
well experience some flooding in the wheat fields but the 
loss wont be known until spring he said this could hurt the 
wheat crop if it continues it needs to warm up and dry out

the commander of lebanons main christian 
militia ordered his fighters to withdraw from battle friday after 
the army chief threatened an apocalpyse to wipe them out 
lebanese forces commander samir geagea who has been fighting for 
control of the nations christian community said he was willing to 
dissolve the militia if a conference of christian religious and 
political leaders asked him to 
intermittent duels with artillery and automatic weapons flared 
earlier in the christian sector of the divided capital despite a 
ceasefire signed wednesday by geagea and gen michel aoun the army 
chief 
in washington defense department officials said at least 13 
employees of the us embassy were evacuated to cyprus a defense 
department employee speaking on condition of anonymity said about 
25 remained at the embassy which the state department says has been 
caught in a cross fire 
the battles have deepened divisions in the christian community in 
this nation already torn by 14 years of civil war between christians 
and moslems 
in an effort to resolve the interchristian conflict peacefully 
maronite patriarch nasrallah sfeir held a conference attended by 21 
leading maronite leaders in bkirki north of beirut 
geagea told reporters after the fourhour meeting i am 
ordering all lebanese forces militiamen to withdraw from all fronts 
back to their barracks never again will we collide with the army 
whatever the general aoun wants well do geagea said 
asked if he will be willing to dissolve the 6000strong lebanese 
forces geagea said if the bkirki conferees say so i will but 
they havent taken such a decision 
he said he was prepared to pull his militia from christian east 
beirut if the moslem sector was simultaneously brought under 
exclusive control of the lebanese army 
from now on we and gen aoun are one hand he declared 
there was no immediate reaction from aoun who boycotted the 
meeting a statement by the conferees said they had briefed aoun on 
the deliberations the conferees resolved to consolidate the 
ceasefire withdraw lebanese forces militiamen to their barracks 
and apply law and order across lebanon 
aoun head of the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
moslemchristian government told a news conference earlier the 
conditions that permitted the army to coexist with the militia no 
longer existed 
we are responsible for the state and they want a ministate 
those who do not abide by the law ill crush their heads said 
aoun surrounded by senior officers of his 20000member 
predominantly christian army 
aoun said he had accepted a ceasefire mediated by sfeir on 
wednesday only to allow political efforts to resolve the problem 
peacefully 
otherwise it will be total destruction this time it will be 
an apocalypse he said 
shortly after the news conference the army announced that 2nd 
lt joseph bitar was killed by sniper fire from lebanese forces 
positions in east beirut that brought the death toll to 70 in 
fighting that broke out late tuesday at least 197 people were 
wounded 
aoun said the lebanese forces should compensate the people for 
the damage and casualties out of taxes the militia levies 
he said the militia charges about 400000 a day in illegal 
taxation of various businesses in the 310squaremile enclave that 
houses 1 million christians 
the lebanese forces and the various moslem and leftist militias 
have been collecting taxes in their respective areas of influence 
since the civil war broke out in 1975 
aoun accused the militia of starting the previous round of 
fighting which involved an attack on his residence in east beiruts 
posh suburb of rabieh 
he said his forces confronted the attack capturing five 
armored personnel carriers and their crews 
aoun was named head of an interim military cabinet by former 
president amin gemayel minutes before gemayels term expired sept 
22 parliament has failed to elect a successor because christians 
opposed the syrianbacked candidates 
aouns appointment violated an unwritten national covenant that 
gave the premiership to the sunni moslems the presidency to the 
maronites and the house speakership to the shiite moslems

president bush said friday that fledgling talks 
with congress on his 116 trillion spending plan are making 
progress and he will sit down with house and senate leaders next 
week to push for a quick and early resolution to this budget 
crisis 
the president said top democrats and republicans in congress will 
come to the white house on tuesday the eve of bushs departure on a 
fiveday trip to asia 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the session was 
intended to keep the momentum of budget talks going while bush was 
out of the country 
bush announced the conference with congressional leaders during a 
speech before students at washington university his third address 
in a week on the budget 
he got a warm reception in the university field house though 
outside his motorcade encountered handfuls of demonstrators against 
his antiabortion stance 
in his speech bush once again failed to offer a formula to 
produce the 96 billion to 11 billion in budget cuts needed to 
offset the cost of his commitments for new spending on domestic 
programs such as education child care the homeless and cleaning up 
the environment 
there are certain priorities that demand attention bush 
said yes we can afford to increase spending modestly 
selectively but only after tough choices are made 
democrats have complained that the president is taking credit for 
expanding social spending while making congress take responsibility 
for finding ways to pay for it 
however bush gave an upbeat assessment of the budget talks 
which are in their infancy saying we are making progress 
suggesting he would share responsibility with congress he said 
together weve got to make the budget process work 
i am committed to working closely with my friends on the hill 
to help them meet the target date set by the grammrudmanhollings 
law for an april 15th budget resolution bush said 
that law which requires a balanced budget by 1993 calls for a 
deficit in the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 of no more than 
100 billion down from an estimated 160 billion this year 
failure by congress to meet the target could result in 
acrosstheboard cuts 
bush said he wanted congressional leaders to come meet with me 
and in a spirit of bipartisanship get on with the nations business 
of getting a quick and early resolution to this budget crisis 
in his remarks bush also stressed volunteerism one of his 
favorite themes 
my friends from now on in america any definition of a 
successful life must include serving others in childcare center 
in the corporate boardroom at the rotary at little league or a 
tutoring program and in a church or synagogue bush said 
as for a federal role he said i know we can have a government 
with a heart as well as a head 
bush struck a decidely different tone from his predecessor 
ronald reagan who portrayed the government almost as an enemy 
the governments contribution is critical but by itself is 
insufficient to solve all of our national problems bush said 
yes most americans believe that our efforts must reach beyond 
government to care about our communities and to assist our 
neighbors the president said but they also believe that 
government can be an important catalyst in that process of helping 
individuals our communities and our nation 
fitzwater said participants at tuesdays budget meeting will 
include house speaker jim wright dtexas majority leader tom 
foley dwash minority leader bob michel rill senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan and the senior democrats and republicans from the 
congressional budget finance and appropriations committees 
treasury secretary nicholas brady budget chief richard darman 
and white house chief of staff john sununu also will take part 
after the speech bush had lunch with about two dozen people 
including students senior citizens and participants in the special 
olympics programs 
the president would not respond to questions by reporters on a 
soontobereleased fbi report on the qualifications of former sen 
john tower to be defense secretary were not going to have any 
press questions im not worried i feel good today bush said 
in washington congressional sources who requested anonymity said 
a review of a security clearance application by a retired air force 
officer included allegations about towers behavior as the head of 
an american delegation to arms talks in geneva in 1985 and 1986 
among the allegations was one that tower kept both his secretaries 
in geneva as mistresses 
on another subject fitzwater told reporters that while bush was 
in st louis a letter to the president delivered by soviet 
ambassador yuri dubinin had arrived at the white house from soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
fitzwater said that bush had not had the opportunity to read the 
letter in full and that a response had not been prepared the 
spokesman said gorbachevs message relates generally to the 
pullout of soviet forces in afghanistan it generally repeats their 
public position 
in moscow officials said gorbachev had sent messages to bush and 
other world leaders asking for help in ending the war between afghan 
factions following the red army pullout

a worldwide aviation agency will study ways to 
screen radios tape players and other seemingly harmless devices 
that could be used to smuggle a terrorist bomb aboard an airplane 
the 33nation council of the international civil aviation 
organization ordered the study the same day british authorities in 
lockerbie scotland said the bomb that brought down pan am flight 
103 was hidden in a radiocassette player 
us and british aviation authorities requested the twoday 
session that concluded thursday in montreal following the dec 21 
bombing over scotland that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on

president bush says he will continue helping 
rebel groups in afghanistan after the soviet armys withdrawal and 
fully intends to support the contras in nicaragua when their current 
aid expires next month 
bush said thursday he preferred a peaceful reconciliation in 
afghanistan but was concerned that departing soviet forces may have 
stockpiled weapons for the marxist government in kabul 
it would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal 
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and 
thus leave an uacceptable imbalance he said in a session with 
reporters in the oval office 
bushs remarks came a day after soviet troops completed their 
withdrawal their departure has caused widespread fears that a 
struggle for control by competing guerrilla groups could throw 
afghanistan into a civil war

air pollution last summer was the worst of the 
decade and the number of cities where ozone exceeded federally 
approved levels jumped 41 percent according to preliminary federal 
figures 
this new information shows the clear fallacy in industry 
arguments that americas air pollution problems are solving 
themselves said rep henry waxman dcalif who made the figures 
public on thursday 
a year ago the environmental protection agency listed 68 cities 
that had recorded peak ozone levels considered unsafe under federal 
standards last summer the number jumped to 96 metropolitan areas 
plus two areas considered to be rural 
the house subcommittee on health and environment chaired by 
waxman had requested the data from the federal agency

with president bush over dinner tonight about protecting the 
environment one of the future kings favorite causes before he

bush and his wife barbara invited the prince and british 
ambassador sir antony acland to a small informal dinner party at 
camp david md where the bushes will be spending the weekend

british embassy today with a select group of american movers and 
shakers and likely would figure in his conversation with bush at 
camp david

nature slowly cleansed their dairy 
herds of heptachlor but a legacy of lost dreams and lawsuits 
endures for ozarks farmers who unwittingly bought the banned 
pesticide in cheap livestock feed 
most have survived all this but they are a lot worse off now 
financially than they were before said state sen bill walters 
who filed lawsuits for some farmers ive sat at their kitchen 
tables and seen them cry 
a settlement involving 48 farmers expected this month would close 
out a saga of deceit confusion and fear that began in the mid1980s 
when heptachlortreated seed was fermented to make gasohol and the 
resulting mash was illegally sold as feed the government recalled 
milk and quarantined farms 
we are in the final throes of the final settlement with the 
final defendants said attorney john elrod of siloam springs none 
of the attorneys for farmers will disclose details of any 
settlements but elrod said this final one would come pretty darn 
close to adequately compensating his clients 
some of these farmers were in their 50s and 60s and dairies 
had been their entire livelihood said steve hignight the benton 
county cooperative extension service agent then all of a sudden 
youve still got all your expenses and youve got nothing coming in 
and everythings going out 
hignight had advised against buying the mash that was sold by 
jew inc and valley feeds inc not because of contamination 
knowledge of that didnt come until later but because its high 
water content cut costeffectiveness 
but to farmers who bought the mash in arkansas oklahoma and 
missouri the price seemed right tons were consumed here in 
arkansas top dairy county 
farmers delight at finding an inexpensive feed source turned to 
shock then helplessness in march 1986 when tests showed their 
dairy products were tainted with the suspected carcinogen banned in 
1983 for general use 
authorities recalled dairy products in arkansas oklahoma 
missouri kansas mississippi texas louisiana and tennessee and 
warned nursing mothers not to drink milk the food and drug 
administration quarantined more than 130 dairy herds in the three 
states where the feed was sold 
i had to be more of a listening ear than anything else 
offering a couch for people to talk said hignight a lot of 
times with these producers all you could do was spend a little time 
with them 
jim brown manager of cave springs farmers cooperative in this 
town between bentonville and springdale lost 90000 in sales when 
one quarantined dairyman turned to the turkey business he is 
grateful more dairies werent shut down 
many dairies were heptachlorfree and the quarantine eventually 
was lifted for all but 137 herds in the three states most herds 
were declared clear of contamination within 18 months but with 
natures slow flushing of the heptachlor a few herds emerged from 
the ban only last fall 
heptachlor settles in fatty tissues and the only way to purge it 
from cattle is milking a frustrating task for farmers who poured 
the frothy fresh product onto pastures for well over a year and a 
half thats all they did milk and dump because they were unable 
to do anything else hignight said 
as the farmers searched for answers we had folks come in with 
black magic and everything else that would cure you out in two 
weeks and really sold them a bill of goods one such cure 
proved to be charcoal and they got people to buy it at a time 
when they already had their feet kicked out from under them he 
said all i remember is it was outrageous beyond reason 
diversification saved some families and scores got lowinterest 
loans from cooperatives that marketed their milk they were repaid 
when farmers got loans from the federal dairy indemnity fund the 
us agriculture department paid more than 52 million to farmers 
in the three states 34 million to arkansas 13 million to 
oklahoma and 524000 to missouri 
court judgments to farmers allowed them to repay the fund about 
480000 by early this month said usda spokesman clarence domire in 
washington elrod said the repayments are closer to 700000 and 
that the remaining reimbursement is a critical issue in settling his 
sweeping lawsuit the largest filed 
participating in the proposed settlement elrod said would be 
jew and valley feeds velsicol chemical corp of memphis tenn 
which made heptachlor ceibageigy corp parent of funks seed co 
which sold tainted grain to the van buren companies and great 
northern commodities of detroit a seed broker 
in addition four jew officers were convicted or pleaded 
guilty to a variety of charges including wire fraud and adulterating 
feed 
the farmers most of whom have been involved in settlements 
wont talk about the case or their problems but brown said justice 
prevailed 
its just like me coming up here and taking your car away from 
you and going to your house and burning your house down and you 
get fired for it and you knew it was beyond your control where are 
you going to turn 
this whole community felt it and it was a bad situation but 
they are fighting back theyre fighters and theyre going to make 
it 
walters agreed it can take the heart out of a family but one 
thing about farmers in general is they are tough and they are 
survivors and these farmers will come back

a new group of jewish radicals is trying to 
enforce ultraorthodox religious beliefs by painting swastikas on 
the tombstones of israels founders and bombing sex shops and 
newspaper stands 
police say the mysterious group of jewish activists is called the 
keshet keepers of the torah and uses armyissued 
explosives either stolen from army bases or supplied to them by 
military sympathizers 
their campaign a renewal of the long battle against israeli 
secular society by orthodox fundamentalists has included the 
planting of more than a dozen bombs and the tossing of a grenade 
into a jerusalem sex shop 
no one has been hurt in the attacks partly because anonymous 
phone calls often warn in advance that bombs have been planted 
ehud sprintzak an expert on jewish radical groups says keshets 
activities are not intended to kill but to terrorize secular 
israelis 
the orthodox can use violence and beatings somebody can get 
burned by accident but killing a jew is taboo for them said 
sprintzak a hebrew university political scientist 
its the outer side of what happens inside the jewish orthodox 
society he said there is much violence inside that society 
rafi levy a police ministry spokesman said police are worried 
by the keshet campaign 
we treat them very seriously after all its an underground 
jewish organization a terror group he said 
the keshet campaign is based in the tel aviv suburb of bnei brak 
and the mea shearim neighborhood in jerusalem both orthodox areas 
where the groups ideas find some sympathy 
while the groups methods are denounced by many ultraorthodox 
jews most support keshets aims of enforcing public observance of 
the jewish sabbath the biblical rest day from sundown friday to 
sundown saturday and other religious commandments 
in early february police raided ghettolike mea shearim and 10 
members of leading orthodox families were detained 
less than a week later a caller saying he was from keshet warned 
of another bomb in a workingclass neighborhood bordering mea 
shearim the bomb was safely dismantled 
the keshet campaign began in august 1986 when the tombstone of 
theodore herzl a pioneer of the zionist idea of founding a jewish 
state in israel was defaced with swastikas on mount herzl near 
jerusalem 
this kind of activitiy stems from the ultraorthodox belief that 
the state of israel should not come into being until the messiah 
appears 
attacks continued this past august with bombs set off at three 
newsstands selling secular newspapers in bnei brak a series of 10 
bombs then were planted at similar targets but anonymous phone 
calls have warned of the explosives 
among other activities blamed on keshet were incendiary bombs 
found and dismantled under a bridge on the jerusalemtel aviv 
highway dec 31 on jan 8 an assailant believed to be orthodox 
hurled a grenade into a sex shop in downtown jerusalem damaging the 
shop but injuring no one 
the attackers usually leave police no doubt who is responsible 
on feb 6 the tombstone of david bengurion was defaced with 
swastikas at the sde boker communal farm where israels first 
premier had lived it was signed keshet search for us 
sprintzak said the name keshet has been around since the 1960s 
and is associated with earlier campaigns to close movie theaters and 
restaurants on the sabbath to protest autopsies or to stop 
archaeological digs seen as desecrating ancient jewish graves 
in the orthodox circles its an idea a concept but there is 
an organization behind the concept he said i estimate that 
keshet is a small group that organizes on an ad hoc basis 
yehuda meshizahav 30 who was arrested and released in 
connection with the police investigation of keshet said in a 
newspaper interview he doubted police could stop the attacks 
police think we have an underground many years ago when 
we fought against autopsies the activists were called keshet 
today there is no such thing he was quoted as saying 
we dont have a chief of staff and officers he said but 
to mobilize men for the action at any time is of no problem to us 
we are all soldiers in the almightys army

two weeks of skiing boating fishing or 
hiking in an unspoiled forest of pine and birch 
thats what swedens national prison administration offers as a 
vacation for hardened criminals serving prison time 
the vacationers at gruvberget a former logging camp 125 miles 
north of stockholm are convicted murderers rapists drug dealers 
and other felons serving longterm sentences 
we have the lowest walls of any prison in the world but they 
are also the thickest said director rolf johansson referring to 
the 12 miles of hilly woodland to the nearest farm 
up to 30 prisoners at a time stay at the mountain retreat for two 
weeks many with their wives and children prison officials number 
three and none have weapons 
sweden has one of the worlds most liberal corrections systems 
prisoners are called clients furloughs are frequent and the 
accent is on rehabilitation 
we want to give clients the opportunity to meet their wives and 
children outside the walls of prison and to give them new ideas 
about life said johansson 
this is a great place said an american doing time for 
selling drugs ive been learning crosscountry skiing yesterday 
we went walking seven or eight kilometers four or five miles in 
the woods and had a cookout hot dogs 
its like a real vacation its helping us recement our 
relationship he added nodding toward his swedish wife the 
45yearold former social worker refused to give his name just 
call me jack ok he said he was a vietnam deserter and has been 
in sweden for 20 years 
after completing onethird of their terms prisoners are eligible 
for furloughs of up to 48 hours as often as six times a year most 
prisons have conjugal rooms for visits from wives or girlfriends 
and marriage is not a visiting requirement 
the furlough system was curtailed for a time after the escape in 
october 1987 of one swedens most notorious spies stig bergling 
who apparently slipped out of the country while home on a weekend 
furlough 
the prison service reported 287 cases of prisoners returning late 
or drunk from the 8951 furloughs granted in 1987 the latest year 
for which statistics are available about 15000 people were 
sentenced to prison that year 8000 to sentences of less than two 
months and 1500 for more than one year 
no one has ever tried to escape from gruvberget the guests are 
given train tickets at their home prison and make their own way to 
the village since most are nearing parole johansson said it would 
make little sense to jeopardize the release 
one recent day skis were propped against the wooden twostory 
cottages which were built in the 1950s for woodcutters and their 
families 
four men in jeans or jogging suits were lazing in winter 
sunshine two were with their wives and children were crashing 
through the nearby woods they were waiting for a gray prison bus to 
take them to a public ski slope about a halfhour away 
the prisons administration bought the village 27 miles from 
ockelbo the nearest town in 1968 a fullsized basketball gym and 
a small dining hall were added to the 22 existing buildings 
including the loggers cabins 
it took four years before the authorities could override the 
skeptics and invite the first group of prisoners johansson said 
neighboring villages were a little worried when we started 
johansson said over the years they got used to us 
about 1100 prisoners a year spend time at the vacation camp 
about twice that number apply johansson said they are selected on 
the basis of good behavior and a clean record on previous furloughs 
each twoweek session is built around an activity theme one 
popular course is dance and exercise in which the prisoners do 
physical training aerobics and learn ballroom dances 
johansson said religious classes are often requested by men 
convicted of murder or manslaughter other sessions feature seminars 
in family life or resisting drugs 
mainly we try to teach them basic things to cook to dance or 
to walk in the woods with their children which they have never 
done johansson said 
for the prisoners furloughs and the special experience of 
gruvberget are lifelines to the world outside the walls 
if i couldnt see my wife on the weekends be with the kids a 
couple or three hours a week be able to touch them id lose 
contact with life said jack the american 
in the states if you get six years youll sit for four five 
or maybe all six he said and conjugal visits forget it but 
thats what holds families together if you have that kind of 
contact you can get back into life again

four years ago art conservator martin j 
radecki helped uncover more than two dozen forged paintings worth 
more than 200000 
now he wants to educate art consumers to spot the forgeries 
themselves using works falsely attributed to hoosier impressionist 
artists tc steele and william forsythe to illustrate his points in 
an exhibit at the indianapolis museum of art 
every major collector has gotten a few fakes he said in a 
recent interview in fact you could say youre not a major 
collector until youve gotten a bad one 
about five years ago works by the hoosier group of artists 
gained new popularity from a rekindled interest in regional art 
steele from owen county and forsythe from indianapolis and the 
others were landscape and figure painters who had flourished at the 
turn of the century 
while their paintings were greatly distributed in schools and 
libraries across the state little was widely known about their 
individual styles those were perfect conditions for the forgeries 
some of them badly done to enter the market 
radecki chief conservator at the museum since 1975 spotted his 
first forged steele that year while the staff was preparing a show 
in conjunction with the us bicentennial 
immediately the sky seemed odd to me he said of the 
painting a landscape with a woman carrying a red umbrella however 
he suspected it was merely a poor restoration rather than a forgery 
until a collector brought in the original of the same work a week 
later 
its like the light bulb turns on maybe theres more than i 
was thinking about he said steele did not paint any exact 
duplicates not in landscapes we were shocked 
nine years later more steele forgeries and some works by 
forsythe began turning up some were betrayed by the odor of fresh 
paint others were detected only through painstaking tests city and 
state police investigations eventually led to guilty pleas on 
different charges by two art dealers an artist and a local attorney 
the captured forgeries were turned over to the museum to be kept 
off the market and used as educational tools they form the basis 
for radeckis first exhibit is it genuine steele forsythe and 
forgery in indiana which runs through march 19 
its a much more technical exhibition than you normally see 
radecki said i wanted to follow the methods we used when we did 
the investigation 
the exhibit opens by defining fakes and forgeries and their 
methods and proceeds to examine how a bogus work can be discovered 
canvases and the stretchers used to spread them are examined as are 
more sophisticated tools such as comparisons with ultraviolet light 
and radiograms 
steele originals are displayed alongside the forgeries and the 
differences are striking the forged version of steeles classic 
pleasant run for instance deletes the bridge from the original 
and instead inserts a cabin 
some of these the fraudulent ones were not very good 
radecki said the forgeries sold for as much as 8000 when their 
actual worth might be only a tenth of that sum 
the exhibit concludes with a test in which museumgoers can try 
to pick five originals from five forgeries 
i would hope weve done a service to the public who will be out 
there purchasing paintings radecki said 
as recently as two months ago a forged steele seascape was 
traded at an illinois art auction he said 
i am certain we did not find them all there are still some out 
there radecki said one still has to be careful not only with 
steele and forsythe but with any painting

someday somehow congress is going to have to 
raise its pay but for now political paralysis is keeping the 
salary lid on for house and senate members and for judges and top 
administration officials too 
when congress gave up its 51 percent pay raise for fear of a 
voter rebellion the action also froze salaries for 1100 federal 
judges 834 appointed officials who manage cabinet and similar 
agencies 7000 top civil servants 12000 foreign service employes 
and 155 generals and admirals 
the salary commission that recommended a 45500 raise for 
congress also proposed increases for judges cabinet officers and 
other appointed positions they were part of the package that would 
have become effective automatically feb 8 if it had not been vetoed 
by both houses of congress 
it was 
the other salaries are pegged to those at the top 
as robert f kennedy once said im sorry to have taken so many 
nice fellows over the side with me kennedy then attorney 
general was joking about president lyndon b johnsons announcement 
that no member of his cabinet would be on the 1964 democratic ticket 
as vice presidential nominee 
with its rejection of this years pay raise congress may have 
effectively scuttled the system under which salaries were proposed 
by an appointed panel insulated against voter punishment for 
unpopular increases the recommendations went to presidents who 
could reject or revise them then they were to take effect in 30 
days unless the house and senate both said no 
congress linked judicial and executive branch salaries to its own 
as part of the same system of political insulation 
president bush had supported the raise and when congress turned 
it down he said judicial salaries should be increased separately if 
not as part of the pay package he said he would make a pay 
recommendation to congress later in the year 
i believe that some level of pay increase is in order and i 
will be working with the house and senate leadership to achieve that 
end bush said 
but first a cooling off period speaker jim wright of texas 
battered by both sides on the pay issue said the house wont be 
looking at new pay plans any time soon 
judicial salaries are a particular problem given the high price 
of lawyers these days federal district judges get the same 89500 
a member of congress gets and increasing numbers have been 
resigning their lifetime appointments in favor of private practice 
while judicial salaries have been increased six times during the 
last decade the raises represent just over half the increase in the 
cost of living judges complain that their real buying power has 
declined by onethird in the past 20 years 
but congress likes the package approach that ties their salary 
increases to those of judges and other officials on the 
safetyinnumbers theory that didnt work this time 
that leaves congress and the entire government back at square 
one on the salary problem the constitution says congressional 
compensation is to be ascertained by law which means by 
congress and congress still shrinks from the risk of voting to 
ascertain that it merits a raise former sen howard baker jr says 
congress may be institutionally incapable of setting its own salary 
it is the grand daddy conflict of interest of all time he told 
the salary commission 
rep dan rostenkowski of illinois has proposed what he says would 
be a way out he calls it the signin system and says it is 
based on the notion that congressmen should be honest about their 
salaries 
hes introduced a bill under which members would determine their 
own salaries within a range between the current salary and the 
135000 a year the commission recommended each member would pick a 
number announce it and be judged on it by constituents in the next 
election 
it is an idea whose time is not likely to come given the fact 
that choosing a raise individually would be even riskier than voting 
for one on the floor 
rostenkowski a 30year man who chairs the ways and means 
committee said hed sign up for the maximum because hes worth it

eighty years ago federal officials told the 
district of columbia to build its new prison in the rolling virginia 
hills 20 miles away near lorton 
today like an unwanted neighbor who refuses to move the prison 
complex badly overcrowded and antiquated is a source of fear to 
residents in the suburbs that grew up around it 
district officials say theyve been blocked at every turn in 
attempts to ease the problems at the lorton corrections complex and 
theres little they can do 
weve lost control concedes charlie peelie one of the 
guards charged with keeping order among the 8600 inmates its 
just that there are too many people here 
we live on a powder keg says neighbor helen thacker hoping 
her alarm system and the heavy locks on her backyard gates will 
protect her the next time someone escapes 
everybody wants everybody locked up but not in their 
neighborhood says marion s barry jr the districts mayor we 
have to do something 
but what 
barry has proposed building a new prison in the city while also 
expanding lorton preservationists are trying to stop the proposed 
facility in the district virginia officials led by their 
congressman are blocking any expansion of the present prison 
all the while conditions inside the 200acre complex grow ever 
worse 
the prison is 1400 prisoners over capacity and is expected to 
add at least 4000 more inmates by the turn of the century 
men stand in line for hours at mealtime showers and toilets are 
in short supply recreational facilities are so scarce that some men 
sit around for lack of anything better to do two men sleep in cells 
built for one 
the inmates are very uncomfortable and tempers are short 
says a prison chaplain the rev manning moore there are men who 
are cursing for attention and cant get it 
it was such an eruption in tempers that drew the nations 
attention hours after george bush was sworn in as president jan 20 
one inmate was stabbed to death fires set by freerunning prisoners 
destroyed two buildings 
no one escaped 
twelve men did last year three are still at large one who was 
convicted of manslaugher and two who were serving time for 
firstdegree murders 
residents of fairfax county some of whom live within a block or 
two of the prison say theyve seen escaped inmates walking around 
their neighborhood at night 
lisa walker frets when her 5yearold son plays outside her 
backyard and owns a doberman pinscher to fend off intruders 
i have guns she adds and if i need to protect myself or 
my son ill do it 
district officials say such fears are exaggerated 
people in fairfax county are so scared but we have never had 
an incident in fairfax says corrections department spokeswomen 
pat wheeler the escapees almost always go back to southeast 
washington if you watch the homes of their family and friends 
long enough youll usually find them 
beyond the daily concern about escapes residents of fairfax 
county one of the wealthiest counties anywere wonder about the 
prisons future 
so does the barry administration which has proposed spending 
350 million over a decade to modernize lorton expand the 
districts halfway house program and build a second prison near the 
city jail in southeast washington 
in all those efforts would add 3525 beds to the 7200 that are 
considered capacity at lorton 
much of the districts program focuses on lorton where only 200 
of 2000 acres are utilized the most appropriate place for a 
new prison says ms wheeler would be to build it in virginia 
wrong says rep stan parris the republican congressman whose 
district includes lorton 
the situation at lorton reached crisis proportions a decade ago 
and it has continued to deteriorate parris said after last 
months uprising 
last october he succeeded in having congress deny the citys 
request for 45 million to build an 800bed facility at lorton 
while the city operates the prison it is owned by the federal 
government which would have to pay for any improvements 
its the only penal institution in the nation thats located 
outside the political boundaries its supposed to serve parris 
says 
i think the penal requirements of the district of columbia are 
best served by the construction of a new and modern facility within 
the district but like a sewage plant or a dump or anything 
else nobody wants it in their neighborhoods 
at least not those near the city jail who obtained a historic 
designation for the site of the proposed second prison delaying 
officials plans 
late last year however the citys historic preservation board 
rejected the community groups arguments officials now hope to 
begin construction this spring 
congress approved 50 million for a new prison three years ago 
with the delays says ms wheeler im sure it must cost more 
than that even if construction began today and the group of 
people who are going to suffer for this are the taxpayers and 
theyre going to have to make up the difference 
so acute is the districts need for prison space that about 500 
inmates have been shipped at a cost of 60 a day to prisons in 
washington state nevada texas and virginia fifty inmates sent to 
the spokane wash county jail were so disruptive that several had 
to be sent elsewhere and jail guards at one point threatened a 
strike unless security was tightened 
part of the problem of finding space for inmates city officials 
say is the districts burgeoning violent crime rate 
serious crime rose 19 percent in the first 11 months of 1988 
compared to the same period in 1987 with homicides last year 
hitting a record 372 the homicide rate so far this year is running 
more than 50 percent ahead of last years pace 
but a lawyer for several lorton inmates disagrees 
an increase in the prison population is something they should 
have anticipted many years ago says doug hilliboe i think 
thats just the weakest excuse

gideon oliver rotates with two other movie series peter 
falks columbo and bl stryker starring burt reynolds 
gideon oliver comes from producers and writers whose credits 
include hill street blues murder she wrote and miami 
vice 
i said now this is a challenge gossett said this is 
something i can do and not get bored with with the repetition of 
and they got the best of television to do it for me in producers 
bill sackheim and dick wolf and david black the best if you cant 
do it with the best like that i cant do it 
as the crew set up across the street in chinatown gossett stood 
around and entertained a cluster of fans you the guy in iron 
eagle an eager youth asked gossett said yes you really fly 
that plane the young man asked gossett allowed that no he rode 
in the plane but he didnt actually fly it 
though hes played egyptian president anwar sadat won his oscar 
for a simmering portrayal of the drill sergeant in an officer and 
a gentleman and is bestknown on television for his role as 
fiddler in roots gossett has a huge following from his action 
movies 
gideon oliver is a karate expert who can take care of himself 
but said gossett if he gets hit its got to hurt and if he 
hits somebody thats got to hurt his hand 
what im trying to do is be careful with gideon oliver 
because it would be easy to do all action in these episodes 
gossett said it leaves out his intelligence his sense of humor 
his caring otherwise 
the wonderful thing about the show is it is not easily 
categorized said wolf hes not a cop he doesnt carry a gun 
hes not a private detective hes not a coroner hes a guy who 
understands subgroups because hes an anthropologist 
as he says in the first show he believes in the socratic 
method which is the acquisition of knowledge through the asking and 
answering of questions 
the nielsen ratings will answer the question of whether a 
noteasily categorized show can survive on network television but 
gossett sees no end of possible stories 
as long as theres mans inhumanity to man as long as theres 
cultural deprivation as long as theres conflict of some sort in 
this world and it doesnt look like its going to be over any time 
soon theres reason to have another episode he said

one of the most cynical little intrusions into 
the quality of life today is the telephone solicitation at 
dinnertime from a bank promoting a credit card or a marketing firm 
conducting a survey 
most people would probably rank it as one of those nagging little 
mosquuito bites of life that must be endured too small a matter to 
make an issue of but certainly an irritant that their lives could 
do without 
it is when the mosquitoes swarm that the minor peeves become 
unendurable and no less an authority on the subject than the 
quality review has given recognition to the disturbing phenomenon 
the review published by the american quality foundation and the 
american society for quality control usually concerns itself with 
momentous issues of product quality especially as they relate to 
american competitiveness 
in the past for example it has declaimed on such matters as 
detroits manufacturing problems japans production efficiencies 
and engineering and statistical strategies for maintaining high 
quality in goods production 
its descent into the more mundane world of pet peeves is provoked 
by the feeling that the mosquitoes are everywhere and that all 
those little bites are leaving a welt on the quality of life equal 
to that of shoddy products 
judging from its list the irritants are all the more irritating 
because as the country immerses itself deeper into the service 
economy as opposed to an economy of goods production it may be 
getting less service than ever before 
first on its list is the unreturned telephone call making it 
especially frustrating is that the original call probably was 
received by a machine which in its recorded voice assured the 
caller that a response would be forthcoming 
it may lead to telephone tag with each party making successive 
fruitless attempts to return a call the review editors comment that 
this timewasting endeavor is equivalent to rework in the 
manufacturing arena 
dinnertime sales or solicitation calls earned second place on the 
list and provoked the suggestion that the way to deal with them is 
to screen your calls through an answering machine which however 
may be your friends pet peeve 
hotel telephone operators who leave you holding the phone so long 
that you have to redial longdistance in order to leave a 
message make the list 
indefinitely delayed notices at airports earn a place along 
with the comment if the airline cant bring itself to be upfront 
with the information that this flight may never leave the ground 
maybe they could post the odds 
travelers who preempt overhead baggage compartments sales 
clerks who turn their backs on customers to serve telephone 
customers instead and servicemen or delivery men who keep you 
waiting all day are high on the reviews list 
one of the more serious of its pet peeves one that seemingly 
could rank with some of the oldfashioned complaints that quality 
control people used to be concerned with is the service contract 
even customers who purchase these contracts think they are a bad 
idea it says it asks why should anyone need a fiveyear service 
contract on a water heater that is guaranteed for 10 years 
all pet peeve lists are likely to differ especially if an 
attempt is made to limit them to a specific number 
the review for example feels that impenetrable packaging 
ranging from cracker wrappings to appliance containers and 
including envelopes that require tools to open belong on many 
lists if not theirs 
but it suggests that the diversity of lists merely proves the 
point that there are so many of these little irritants swarming 
through our service society that they are serving to create a major 
problem

its the capital of the free world and the 
murder capital of the united states 
just one night last week three people were killed in the 
district of columbia typically all were shootings and all police 
said could be drugrelated 
by wednesday 75 people had been killed this year in washington 
compared with 46 by the same time in 1988 last year set a city 
record with 372 homicides virtually one a day and 145 more than in 
1987 
at the current rate the city could log more than 600 murders 
this year 
the pace of the killings in 1988 594 for each 100000 
residents gave washington a distinction it didnt want murder 
capital usa detroit which held the title in 1987 had 58 murders 
per 100000 residents 
why washington 
police officers and experts agree handguns and a sudden influx 
of cheap drugs 
both are easy to come by and both are increasingly finding their 
way into the hands of young washingtonians many of whom have become 
armed delivery people caught in wars between drug gangs 
ten of the 42 people killed in october were teenagers seven 
more were in their early 20s 
it wasnt always so 
washington didnt become a target for the drug trade as early 
as other large cities did said gwynne peirson a retired 
criminology professor at howard university who spent 23 years as a 
police officer in oakland calif its a relatively recent 
phenomenon here because the population of washington isnt the size 
of many other cities so it wasnt as attractive a market 
initially 
that changed with the coming of crack a highly potent and 
addictive but cheap to get hooked on form of cocaine that can be 
smoked 
a typical dose of 100 milligrams which a regular user might 
smoke a dozen or more times a day sells on the street for about 
10 said maurice hill of the drug enforcement administration a 
75milligram starter dose often goes for 5 
the average kid with an allowance can buy crack unimpeded 
said mario perez a dea agent all he has to do is shake hands 
with his best buddy outside the school house 
one expert said the very nature of crack has driven up the murder 
rate 
theres something about the nature of crack that makes people 
crazy makes them impulsive and likely to do irrational things 
said hubert williams of the police foundation a research 
organization 
ive heard crack addicts say use of crack opens up every 
pleasure center in the body said williams who was a police 
officer for 24 years in newark nj the sensations are so high 
and also so short in terms of duration that almost after taking the 
first one you need a second one because youre on a downer so you 
have an ideal set of circumstances to create a huge market 
then there is the presence of guns 
ten to 20 years ago high school students might have carried pen 
knives as protection today said a city officer who requested 
anonymity the protection is a handgun often an automatic 
we have people who are settling their arguments with guns he 
said 
of the almost 1600 weapons seized by police since late 1986 
through operation clean sweep an undercover operation aimed at drug 
dealers more than 1200 have been handguns 
to all that add the high unemployment rate among the citys 
black teens in 1987 the last full year for which statistics are 
available 224 percent had looked for legitimate work but failed 
its an easy market with so many poor unskilled black people 
willing to take the small risk peirson said with people that 
are uneducated and unskilled the idea of standing out on a street 
making 500 to 1000 a night with the chances of getting caught 
relatively small its a small risk 
teenagers and even younger children are being recruited to man 
the front lines on the drug battleground because the 
narcotraffickers know full well that we live in a society that 
treats children as children perez said they shield themselves 
by the children who become targets of opportunity for other 
competitors most of the people being killed have barely begun 
to shave 
often these couriers work for one of the rival gangs of black 
americans jamaicans nigerians and latins battling for the same 
turf said perez 
if there was something organized maybe the number of 
homicides would be placated somewhat he said 
these are people who collect their bills one way or the 
other perez added they are very unforgiving for the slightest 
error or what seems to be betrayal 
these people are presently jockeying for position establishing 
areas of control fighting for turf theyre very very violent get 
off my sand dune and stay off my sand dune

what to do about the spiraling murder rate and the root 
problems of drugs and guns among the citys young has so far 
eluded officials 
operation clean sweep has resulted in close to 44000 arrests 
but one officer said were arresting the same people over and 
over besides the arrests officials say the undercover effort 
has netted 458 seized vehicles 215 million in cash and drugs with 
a street value of 167 million 
mayor marion s barry jr cited budget problems when the program 
was reduced in november but some police union officials say the 
effort has virtually ceased in the worst crime areas 
peirson contends merely arresting and sentencing street dealers 
wont do much good 
they can do prison standing on their heads he said 
remembering a conversation with a prison warden in morgantown wva 
she pointed out that 90 percent of them the inmates when they 
arrived had never seen a dentist had never seen an eye doctor now 
they had doctors three meals a day as much as they wanted this is 
not the kind of punishment thats going to deter them 
the mayor himself involved in a federal investigation of his 
personal and professional life said after last weeks threemurder 
night that the only thing i can do is give people hope that im 
doing what i can the people want ideas they want programs they 
want action 
yet his proposed budget would give the police department just 5 
percent more in 1990 
rather than more money barry thinks the department can do better 
with what it has 
in the short run said mayoral spokesman john white he has 
asked the police department to study the way in which it has 
assigned its manpower so that more police officers will be on the 
street rather than inside on administrative duties the mayor 
believes the size of the police force is sufficient but there needs 
to be better allocation of resources than we have 
not everyone on the city council agrees with barrys approach 
people are outraged said councilwoman nadine winter im 
telling him he doesnt have it under control he ought to call for 
help 
winter would have president bush declare a state of emergency and 
deploy every available resource even the national guard as 
part of the battle 
for its part the white house through press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said last week that everyone in the country including 
the president is outraged by the homicides whether it be in 
washington dc or california or anywhere else 
there are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind of 
problem fitzwater said the most obvious is for steppedup law 
enforcement 
most of the drugrelated shootings have been in the southeast and 
northeast quadrants of the city where a majority of its poor black 
residents live but some have spilled over into largely affluent 
northwest washington 
less than 1 miles from the white house drug dealers peddle 
their wares along a corridor from 13th to 16th streets nw 
diplomats at the spanish embassy on 15th street nw are wary of 
their neighborhood 
this area is well known for being a center strongly related 
to drugs and violence said embassy spokeswoman helga soto 
consequently the members of our embassy do not feel secure at all 
when entering or leaving the premises 
so far the violence hasnt dissuaded tourists who average about 
19 million a year from coming to town said austin kenny executive 
vice president of the washington area convention and visitors bureau 
the only people asking questions about violence in the city 
are reporters kenny said

antiamerican protesters are 
challenging south koreas policies toward the united states and 
sparking more us criticism here than at any time in four decades 
from student radicals yelling yankee go home to farmers 
denouncing us agriculture imports south koreans are venting their 
frustration and anger at one of their oldest allies 
when president bush visits seoul next monday he will find what 
one newspaper warns is a society quite different from the one he 
saw as vice president in april 1982 
dont come to korea bush yell radical students punctuating 
the words with raised clenched fists 
criticism of the united states is no longer relegated to private 
conversation american flags are torched and effigies of uncle sam 
or bush are burned 
some 12000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police with 
clubs and firebombs outside the national assembly this month and 
denounced the united states for trying to force open south koreas 
agricultural market 
radical students staged a series of attacks on us facilities to 
demand an end to american influence they vowed to hold nationwide 
antigovernment antius demonstrations to coincide with the 
presidents visit 
arson violence destruction and lawlessness cannot be 
tolerated said president roh taewoo in demanding an end to 
protests 
every us president since the korean war except richard nixon 
has visited seoul but none has come during a time of more public 
animosity against washington policies 
businessmen laborers and students who have never thrown a 
firebomb are heard to complain that south korea is victimized by 
unfair trade pressures and rude yankee arrogance 
when asked their nationality by a korean us citizens rarely 
acknowledge that they are american the us embassy and the us 
military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing which 
labels them from the usa 
the united states is no longer a sacred cow said a western 
diplomat requesting anonymity america is no longer the patron 
saint of south korea 
the united states has played roles in past dictatorial 
governments and we oppose the visit of us president bush claims 
a labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and human 
rights abuses of the past ussupported authoritarian government 
a few weeks ago the united states said it was considering 
closing its cultural center in the provincial capital of kwangju 
180 miles south of seoul because of repeated violent attacks and 
concern for the safety of its staff 
kwangju was the scene of a bloody nineday civil uprising in 
1980 many opposition and dissident figures claim the united states 
shared responsibility for the kwangju incident by acquiescing in a 
militarybacked south korean government plan to quell the uprising 
the united states denied the charge 
although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact on 
relations and radicals have little public support government 
leaders warn that growing antiamerican sentiment could endanger 
south koreas interests in washington 
the government lost no time in apologizing publicly for the 
kwangju center attacks and appealed to radical students not to 
damage traditional koreaus friendship 
the assistant foreign minister kim sukkyu reflects the 
thinking of many when he says antiamericanism is a minority view 
and a passing phenomenon despite loud voices and antiamerican 
activists 
more than half of south koreas 40 million people have been born 
since the korean war ended 35 years ago and long time observers 
link the intensity of antiamerican feeling to the age of the 
participant the younger the person the more likely he or she is to 
feel the united states has taken its relationship with south korea 
for granted 
the korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist south 
and the communist north since the end of world war ii in 1945 the 
united states helped south korea fight the 195053 korean war 
against the north and keeps 42000 troops stationed in the south 
under a mutual defense pact 
radical students and dissidents feel the presence of us troops 
stand in the way of unification talks with the north and have 
demanded the withdrawal of all us forces they also demand the 
halt to this years joint ussouth korea military exercises called 
team spirit 
a more realistic relationship is needed between the two 
governments say both protesters and some politicians a 
relationship which recognizes south koreas economic potential and 
place in global politics 
the united states is seouls leading trade partner korea sold 
america goods worth 8 billion more than it bought from the united 
states last year considerable pressure has been placed on the 
koreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance the 
deficit 
antiamerican comment became acceptable socially after last 
falls olympic games when south koreans of all ages had their 
frustration and resentment against the united states stoked by what 
they regarded as unruly behavior of us athletes and biased 
coverage by nbc

here are brief sketches of some of the places that president bush 
will visit during his 5day trip to three asian capitals beginning 
wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush will spend two nights in the hotel most likely in the 
imperial suite used by then president reagan during the 1986 
economic summit the hilltop site of the 27yearold hotel was owned 
by the noble okura family which had run one of the big prewar 
industrial combines called zaibatsu 
the 888room hotel across the street from the us embassy and 
ambassadors residence just finished a threeyear refurbishment 
last september the management says the us delegation is taking 
about 400 of the okuras rooms and 13 other foreign delegations to 
the funeral of emperor hirohito also will be housed there 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the palace where hirohito spent part of his young manhood and 
early married life before he ascended the throne in 1926 was 
completed in 1909 to be the crown princes residence and was such a 
grand building that the meiji emperor 18681912 was said to be 
unwilling to visit it 
modeled on the palace at versailles and the louvre akasaka 
palace is a grand example of architecture in the late meiji period 
when japan then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation was 
trying to outdo the west most of the building materials and 
furnishings were imported 
the palace which sits in its own large park was restored in the 
1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and to 
hold major conferences such as the 1986 economic summit prime 
minister noboru takeshita will host a reception there following the 
hirohito funeral

by us bombing 
the palace grounds include ponds moats and forests as well as 
administrative buildings and the fukiage mansion where hirohito 
lived through his final illness 
the moats walls and some structures date from the 17th century 
when the whole complex was called edo castle the fortified 
headquarters of the tokugawa shogunate that then ruled japan from 
edo the old name of tokyo

the site of the hirohito funeral services the park once served 
as the garden for the imperial household in midapril it becomes 
one of the favorite places in tokyo for people to picnic under what

tents 482 feet long to shelter 10000 japanese and foreign 
dignitaries from the february weather

built in less than a year for the celebration of the communist 
governments 10year anniversary in 1959 it sits on the west side 
of beijings broad tienanmen square in the traditional heart of the 
city and is the site for all major gatherings including communist 
party conferences and legislative sessions 
bush like other state visitors will come here for his official 
redcarpet greeting including cannon volleys and gifts of flowers 
from small children who jump up and down and shout in singsong 
warm welcome 
the president also will be toasted by chinas top leaders at a 
great hall banquet the central banquet hall with a twostoryhigh 
ceiling can sit 5000 people and often does but it is a long way 
from the basement kitchen and food often arrives cold

meaning the central and south seas zhongnanhai is a 213acre 
compound embracing two large lakes that used to be part of the 
imperial palace grounds it now serves as communist party 
headquarters and many visiting leaders including bush are taken 
behind its wellguarded vermillion walls to meet with party general 
secretary zhao ziyang 
in the past many top leaders also lived in zhongnanhai although 
the current leaders are believed to live most of the time in their 
own homes a small portion of zhongnanhai is open to chinese 
tourists as a park but remains closed to foreigners

bush is expected to attend services at this protestant church 
hidden behind high stone walls along a narrow hutong or alley the 
stone church built by missionaries with a round darkwood vaulted 
ceiling usually is filled to capacity on sundays with about 1500 
people making it one of the largest of beijings six protestant 
churches 
it was being used as a factory when bush lived in beijing as the 
us envoy like all other churches and temples its religous 
functions were halted during the radical leftist cultural revolution 
of 196676 when religion was banned it reopened as a church in 
1983

chinese artists and intellectuals are pushing back 
stateset limits on creativity and expression setting off the 
widest debate on politics art and culture in a decade 
from a television program on the collapse of chinas culture to 
an exhibition of avantgarde art to poetry readings in dingy 
dancehalls intellectuals in beijing are diving through a small 
window of opportunity to call for political social and economic 
change 
none of us knows how long this will last said yang wei a 
selfdescribed free artist but its a good time to be 
creating 
criticism of the government and the communist party long 
relegated to the privacy of ones home has become more open 
china is in crisis political economic and cultural said 
su shaozhi a leading marxist theorist during a talk at one of 
several study groups that have opened recently we need to 
democratize this society to allow the people to supervise the party 
and the government 
many say the government is too preoccupied with its economic 
troubles to worry about the current foment in intellectual life 
inflation in china has hit its highest level since the communist 
took power in 1949 reaching an official rate of almost 20 percent 
economists say it is actually twice as high 
corruption is widespread and the staterun press has recently 
acknowledged increases in prostitution strikes and drug smuggling 
with all this chaos the higherups dont really have time to 
watch over us bookworms said fei dawei an art critic at the 
central academy of fine arts as long as we dont ask for money 
they dont ask too many questions 
others say the authorities may not take the intellectuals 
activities seriously or may believe they havent become widespread 
enough to justify a crackdown indeed so far only a small but 
vocal fraction of chinas intellectuals are taking part 
a minority views the relaxation as a ploy by conservatives to 
create more chaos in society and provide an excuse for new 
repression but this perspective is not popular 
it doesnt take into account that the chinese people have 
changed said hou hanru a philosopher also at the fine arts 
academy the people arent listening to the government anymore if 
it yells again nobody will follow 
it also doesnt take into account the spontaneity of the change 
previous thaws were ordered or supported from above the hundred 
flowers movement of 1956 in which intellectuals were encouraged to 
criticize the communist party was apparently masterminded by 
chairman mao tsetung to identify heretical thinkers many of those 
who spoke out during the brief thaw were purged from the party and 
arrested 
the most recent period of relative intellectual freedom the 
democracy wall movement of 1978 which called for political freedoms 
was allowed by chinese leaders including the newly emerged top 
leader deng xiaoping in an attempt to justify their plan for 
widespread political and economic reform when the movement 
outlasted its utility its leaders were jailed 
an early sign of the newest thaw came last summer when the 
sixpart series river die young ran on national television twice 
to an audience of hundreds of millions 
as it discussed chinas fascination with dragons river die 
young criticized the chinese peoples willingness to bow to 
authority as it described the yellow river which has changed its 
course many times in the past killing millions of people the 
program questioned communist chinas turbulent history 
watching river die young we discovered that what our 
teachers taught us was false wrote one highschool viewer to 
screen writer su xiaokang you showed us chinas weaknesses 
another sign came in november in the small but wellrespected 
journal economic research three economists from the academy of 
social sciences called for the abandonment of public ownership the 
bedrock of the socialist system and the institution of a private 
property system 
our goal is to liberate the chinese people said one of the 
theorists hua sheng social justice the right of 
selfrealization is the essence of socialism and that has nothing 
to do with state control 
neither has politics been immune 
on jan 28 a group of political theorists gathered in the 
basement of a private bookstore to discuss a new periodical new 
enlightenment 
in its first two editions the booklet advocates political 
transformation 
the time has come for intellectuals to form a pressure group to 
force the government to change fang lizhi chinas bestknown 
dissident told the meeting fang has called for multiparty 
democracy and greater respect for human rights in china 
literature especially poetry has also blossomed in the form of 
small reading groups where authors and poets gather to share their 
works 
one such meeting was held jan 29 in a rundown dancehall in 
eastern beijing about 30 members of the group silent night 
gathered for an afternoon of poetry discussion and music 
writing in this society is very lonely work said one poet at 
the meeting we meet like this to cut the pain 
but like the current political debate these poetry readings have 
yet to reach the ordinary man 
art however has 
in december the first exhibition of nude paintings banned for 
decades under the puritanical policies of the ministry of culture 
opened in beijing about 200000 people saw it 
on feb 5 artists defied a ban on performance art during the 
first exhbition of avantgarde art at the china art gallery the 
nations main museum 
one artist fired two bbs into her sculpture a telephone booth 
another sold shrimp to protest the commercialization of art 
authorities closed the show for five days and allowed it to 
reopen on the condition that the artists would respect the ban 
but despite the restrictions many artists said things had 
changed for the better 
in the past we wouldnt have challenged the ban said one of 
the performers and once they closed the show they would have 
closed it for good now were pushing them 
the new thaw raises questions for chinas rulers as artists and 
intellectuals continue to stretch the boundaries of what is 
permissible will the rulers continue to ignore the change and 
concentrate on the economy or is another crackdown coming

trucks and barges pile 52 million pounds of 
paper cans plastic and other trash daily onto a staten island 
dump building the worlds biggest mountain of garbage toward a 
height rivaling the skyscrapers across the bay in manhattan 
much of that could be recycled and new york officials have begun 
considering a plan to do so elsewhere more and more communities 
are already recycling the trash their citizens throw out 
they have little choice while the new york dump is planned to 
operate 11 more years a third of the nations 6000 garbage dumps 
are expected to shut within five years forcing communities to find 
new ways to dispose of their garbage 
every american man woman and child generates 35 pounds of 
refuse a day adding 160 million tons to the nations trash pile 
each year 
that pile holds 42 percent paper 23 percent food and yard waste 
94 percent glass 92 percent metals 65 percent plastics and 94 
percent other materials according to the us environmental 
protection agency 
ten states already require or soon will require residents to 
separate newspapers glass jars milk cartons tin cans or other 
discarded items for recycling trucks or bins legislators in 33 
states are expected to consider plans to increase recycling this 
year 
people dont want incinerators or dumps near them so they are 
beginning to force their elected officials to start recycling 
programs said cynthia pollock shea a senior researcher at 
worldwatch institute a nonprofit organization that studies 
environmental issues 
recycling is not new in the united states during world war ii 
everybody recycled said barry commoner director of queens 
colleges center for the biology of natural systems people even 
recycled rubber bands and string 
but the efforts to conserve mostly ended with the war now only 
10 percent of the nations garbage is recycled compared to as much 
as 60 percent by some cities in europe and japan 
studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be 
recycled and epa has set a goal of recycling 25 percent in four 
years 
the process of recycling is simple separating usable products 
from the trash processing them so they can be substituted for more 
expensive raw materials at manufacturing plants and returning them 
to the marketplace as parts of new products 
it has not been so easy to put into effect some communities have 
had trouble finding buyers for discarded newspapers glass or 
plastic recycling programs require startup funds and perhaps 
most importantly peoples habits of throwing trash into only one 
can be difficult to change 
still experts predict recycling will eventually become a part of 
the everyday infrastructure of cities and towns 
today trash trucks dominate waste hauling said peter 
grogan director of material recovery for rw beck and associates 
which has helped dozens of communities start recycling programs 
but by the year 2010 were going to see as many recycling trucks 
as dump trucks recycling centers as common as video shops and 
recycling introduced in lesson plans in schools across the country 
among the communities now making it easier for residents to 
recycle trash several are considered international models 
hamburg ny a buffalo suburb started a program in 1981 and 
now claims 98 percent of its 3350 households participate unless 
they want to eat their garbage they better separate it or we wont 
pick it up said ann kankolenski a public works department 
employee she said 34 percent of the trash is recycled and nearly 
all the rest burned 
seattle residents already recycled 24 percent of their garbage 
before the city started its program last year and the city is aiming 
for 60 percent in 10 years even steel garbage cans are being 
recycled 
wilton nh officials say a voluntary sixtown program in 
southwestern new hampshire has 70 percent participation started a 
decade ago the program recycles 42 percent of the garbage brought 
to a center burns 47 percent and buries 11 percent 
even more is possible 
connie leach vermonts recycling director feeds her food scraps 
to worms 
they eat everything up leach said of the little red worms 
that are covered with peat moss in a basement box lined with plastic 
and newspapers the worms digestive system allows them to eat the 
food quickly and so far it hasnt attracted cockroaches or mice 
ive been very surprised at how well it works she said 
leach named recycler of the year in 1987 by the national 
recycling coalition doesnt stop there she recycles all her 
household waste except for some types of plastics junk mail on 
highgrade paper and light bulbs in a month she throws out only 
two small bags 
ed steyh seattles administrator of garbage and recycling 
contracts also goes to great lengths to recycle his trash 
he lives on an island in puget sound where he can recycle only 
tin cans so on his ferry rides to work he takes newspapers glass 
aluminum cans and other items 
i bring them to my inlaws and they recycle it with their 
things steyh said 
solid waste management companies also are expanding into 
recycling creating more markets for recycled materials 
everyone is jumping on the bandwagon said darlene snow 
recycling director for the national solid waste management 
association which represents 2500 companies that handle half of 
the nations household waste and 95 percent of its industrial waste 
she said the industry approached recycling warily they had a 
routine a routine without a lot of regulations then all these 
state laws came she said what happened was that haulers 
nationwide were losing business to recycling 
now industry seminars on the topic are full she said 
the recycling movement also has put in jeopardy some proposed 
trashtoenergy incinerators planned incinerators have been shelved 
in los angeles seattle boston philadelphia and austin texas 
incinerators have been touted as a way to produce energy and 
reduce the amount of garbage but questions persist about the affect 
on air quality and on the disposal of the byproduct of ash laced 
with toxins 
in 1983 new york city proposed what would be the worlds largest 
trashtoenergy incineration system the project which still needs 
federal and state permits faces stiff opposition from 
environmentalists and neighborhood groups 
environmentalists say the solution to the citys garbage crisis 
should be aggressive recycling their goals are 60 percent in 10 
years 90 percent in 20 years currently the city recycles less 
than 1 percent of its trash 
however under legislation proposed earlier this month in new 
york city mandatory recycling would be phased in over five years 
the debate has now changed from what are we going to do about 
the garbage crisis to how much can we recycle said david 
antonioli a staff member with the new york public interest research 
group the earth is not a dump

mountains of scrap tires are being eroded by 
entrepreneurs who are cutting them up for fuel mixing them with 
asphalt to extend highway life and using them to soften airport 
runways 
the pioneers are seeking profitable ways to recycle discarded 
tires and remove a huge trash problem an estimated 240 million 
tires are added to the highly flammable heaps each year 
some tires are recycled the oldfashioned way by retreading but 
only 20 percent are suited for that use a few get new life as 
buffers for marine and truck loading docks some end up in the 
backyard as tire swings 
but most tires just piled up until business people and scientists 
recently stepped up efforts to find new uses 
in cleveland for instance a company is experimenting with 
chopped up tires as a fuel additive in coalfired boilers to see if 
they can reduce acid rain and scrap tires are being used as 
components in septic tank systems 
for some finding new uses for scrap tires is like hauling 
garbage you get paid to take it in and get paid to make it into a 
fuel said anderson b carothers chairman of waste recovery inc 
his company uses scrap tires as a supplemental fuel at three 
woodprocessing plants 
we compete against oil in the northwest against gas in 
louisiana and in the southeast were competing against coal 
carothers said 
waste recovery spent 2 million apiece on plants in portland 
ore houston and atlanta each capable of burning 5 million tires a 
year but the company is not making money yet carothers said 
robert h snyder former research director of uniroyal a 
tiremaker that is now part of uniroyal goodrich tire co spent much 
of his career trying to build a better tire and now is working to 
retire the mountains of leftovers 
its very clear to me that a scrap tire can very well pay for 
its selfdisposal he contends 
snyder a consultant in detroit said much of his current 
research is confidential because he intends to seek patents but he 
said one new use is adding chopped bits of tires to speed up the 
composting of sewage sludge 
its gathering a fair amount of momentum snyder said citing 
community programs in new hampshipe and research at rutgers 
university in new jersey and in us department of agriculture 
laboratories in maryland 
if each of the 250 sludge composting sites in the nation used 
scrap tire chips instead of traditional wood chips to promote the 
process a threeyear supply of scrap tires would be needed snyder 
said 
another trend people in the business foresee is increasing state 
and city regulation of scrap tire disposal carothers said disposal 
costs range from 25 to 50 cents a tire depending on licensing and 
transportation costs 
florida for instance began a 50cent surcharge on each new tire 
sale this year to finance disposal the surcharge will double to 1 
in 1990

as a gesture of goodwill american groups have 
broughildren to this country for treatment of 
injuries they suffered in the devastating earthquake in their 
homeland two months ago an intermittent series of stories by 
associated press reporter bruce rule wilht 37 armenian cl trace the progress 
of one 
injured boy karen kocharian here is the first story looking at 
his initial adjustment to the united states 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
only days after arriving from armenia 
9yearold karen kocharian stood behind the grocery store cash 
register his bandaged right hand maimed in an earthquake tucked 
in his jacket pocket with his good hand he tried to help make 
change in unfamiliar dollars and cents 
the boy waiting to be treated for injuries he suffered when the 
quake last december shook down the walls of his school smiled at 
everyone who entered george and annadid ohanians store 
the couple immigrants from the soviet unit the newspaper quoted one 
source as 
saying the report ould contain a wealth of allegations about the 
guys personal conduct 
tom kirk the fbi agent who wrote the report told the newspaper 
the report will contain new information on tower that has not been 
made public 
tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and 
philandering many senators also have voiced concern about whether 
tower could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than 1 
million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left 
the senate four years ago 
nunn whose committee is reviewing the nomination has said that 
an investigation of towers actions in geneva found no security 
breaches 
he also said wednesday that if members of the full senate bring 
up questions about towers personal life the lawmakers may be forced 
to meet behind closed doors 
i hope not but it depends on the type of questions posed on 
the senate floor by senators who are not members of the senate armed 
services committee nunn said referring to the senate 
deliberations should the nomination clear his panel 
i emphasize that the leadership of the senate will make this 
decision not the armed services committee or its chairman he 
said 
a closed session of the full senate occurs only about once a year 
and usually relates to national security issues the last occurred 
on march 29 1988 when the senate discussed the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty with the soviet union

this ramshackle jungle settlement has become 
a boom town in perus illicit cocaine trade luring thousands from 
city shantytown or impoverished countryside with a promise of quick 
fortune from the coca leaf 
pascual mendieta came out of poverty in the village of la 
libertad three years ago planted coca for awhile and now owns an 
electronics store 
tenyearold daniel aguilar was sent to tocache by his mother to 
shine shoes after his father died and now he earns enough money to 
live on and send home 
how am i going to deny i cultivate coca if its growing all 
around here as far as the eye can see said david buttgenbach a 
peruvian of german descent who lost his job as a laborer when the 
lumber company he worked for went bankrupt 
coca is paying for my six children to study in good schools in 
lima without coca my family would go hungry 
landless peasants the jobless from lima highland merchants 
colombian drug dealers all have streamed into tocache swelling 
its population from 10000 in 1981 to 25000 today 
when i was working four years ago in a poor neighborhood in 
lima you heard the name tocache tocache tocache kids were coming 
out here then to build airstrips for the drug traffickers said 
the rev paul feeley a canadian priest who now works in aucayacu 
55 miles south of here 
operation thunderbolt a major police drive against cocaine 
trafficking in the upper huallaga river valley in late 1987 put a 
dent in the narcotics trade in tocache it forced the towns cocaine 
boss a gang leader known as the vampire to flee into the 
jungle and dried up the flow of drug dollars sales in shops fell to 
half their normal level 
but the 250man police force that seized control of tocache from 
an alliance of leftist guerrillas and cocaine smugglers has dwindled 
to about 50 troopers today and the town is regaining its goldrush 
atmosphere 
new three and fourstory homes jut up against a backdrop of 
jungled hills shops along tocaches unpaved muddy streets are 
filled with color television sets stereo systems and luxury items 
like goldplated lighters 
the towns allure is reflected in a popular rock song going to 
tocache which led perus top 10 musical hits for three months in 
1988 tocaches fame is such that peruvians have coined a word 
tocachization to describe the explosive violence corruption 
and wild lopsided prosperity of other jungle villages following in 
its steps 
tocache once again is receiving a steady flow of 
narcodollars from colombian drug buyers who arrive in small 
planes at clandestine runways in the jungle the colombians pick up 
shipments of coca paste semirefined cocaine made from the 
leaves of coca bushes that cover mile after mile of hillsides in the 
area 
in colombia the paste is refined into pure cocaine powder which 
is smuggled to the lucrative us and european markets 
the dollars to pay peruvian coca farmers end up being trucked 
over the andes to a network of streetside money changers in lima 
perus capital on the coast 300 miles to the southwest economists 
estimate the cocaine trade pumps as much as 12 billion a year into 
perus faltering economy a sum equal to half the countrys earnings 
from legal exports 
the appeal of narcodollars has made tocache and neighboring 
settlements a promised land for some 200000 peasants who have 
migrated to the upper huallaga valley in the last two decades to 
grow coca a crop that pays 10 times as much as any other 
it is illegal to grow coca in peru without the permission of the 
state coca company enaco which markets the leaves to drug companies 
or distributes them for such uses as chewing and making tea enaco 
says all of the coca in the huallaga valley where the vast majority 
of perus coca leaf is cultivated is illegal but peru lacks the 
manpower equipment and resources to stop it 
the prosperity around tocache is apparent even to the casual 
observer the jungle trails outside town pass house after house with 
television antennas refrigerators and gasoline generators for 
power often motorcycles and fourwheel drive vehicles are parked 
outside 
such acquisitions are luxuries in peru where most peasants 
consider themselves fortunate to have a solid meal a day 
farmers are not the only ones to benefit from the coca bonanza 
everyone in this town from the bigshot coca dealer to the 
streetcorner ice cream vendor lives off drug trafficking either 
directly or indirectly says a police commander speaking on 
condition he not be identified by name 
the sudden riches obtained by immigrants are resented by the 
small number of townspeople who have not joined in the cocaine trade

school superintendent william tirado says bitterly the towns 
teachers have become steadily poorer while uneducated peasants from 
the andes have grown wealthy overnight 
they arrived poor and have become rich while we the teachers 
the ones with education are poorer than ever tirado says the 
only ones who have failed to progress are those who have not 
participated in this illicit business 
police say most of tocaches residents including prosperous 
merchants and bar keepers continue cultivating coca outside of town 
even after they make enough money to open legitimate businesses 
townspeople are suspicious of outsiders and most refuse to 
acknowledge their direct involvement in the illegal often deadly 
enterprise of cocaine trafficking 
pascual mendieta 30 the owner of the electronics store says he 
stopped growing coca since opening his business 
i planted a little coca and after two years i had enough money 
to open this store he said business has gone well i have no 
complaints 
daniel aguilar the shoeshing boy was in tocache 12 hours after 
his mother put him on a bus in the mountain town of huanuco and not 
long after that he was earning five dollars a day three times the 
national minimum wage 
i send money home to my mother each week so my brothers and 
sisters can eat he says proudly 
tocaches growth was made possible by the jungle highway a 
visionary project launched 25 years ago during the administration of 
president fernando belaunde terry to spur colonization of perus 
virtually uninhabited tropical forests the highway running 1000 
miles north to south hugs the lower eastern slopes of the andes 
the coca boom began when the jungle was opened up says edgar 
machado a professor at the national agrarian university in lima and 
an expert on coca that was when the migration of landless 
campesinos began they were the pioneers of the jungle and the first 
thing they did was plant coca as the most profitable crop 
available 
miguel gonzalez 33 manager of a small restaurant and one of the 
few born here recalls that when he was a boy tocache was a sleepy 
village of several hundred farmers 
people used coca to chew they knew nothing about cocaine he 
says referring to the centuriesold andean tradition of chewing 
coca leaves to dampen hunger and increase energy 
things began to change when drugtrafficking gangs under 
pressure from police moved their base of operations to tocache from 
aucayacu and tingo maria the valleys biggest town 80 miles south 
of here 
since 1984 drug traffickers have been considered the upper 
crust of tocache society school superintendnent tirado says with 
an ironic chuckle moral values have been turned upside down 
young people have lost all interest in studying they want money 
and the quickest way to get money is to plant coca 
the biggest drug trafficker of all was the vampire he is 
believed to still be in the area although he has not returned to 
town 
people say his name was fitting he lived in a sprawling 
garishly decorated home with a bloodred ceiling and similarly 
colored furniture when he saw an attractive woman on the street he 
took her and if her companion was foolish enough to protest he 
killed him 
the vampires favorite killing spot was the bridge over the 
huallaga river backed up by his henchmen he would take his victims 
there drive a knife into their chests or shoot them through the 
head and dump their bodies into the swiftflowing river townspeople 
say 
i knew the vampire says daniel the shoeshine boy he 
lived in the casa grande i shined his shoes he gave me big tips 
and joked with me but when he was in a bad mood he was mean

when mario muelas leaves the construction 
site in the winter twilight he walks to his car through narrow 
alleys where christians moslems and jews once rubbed shoulders 
then he drives four centuries back home to madrid 
the 45yearold architect is working in the vast 16thcentury san 
pedro martyr convent complex drawing up and executing plans to turn 
it into a modern government administrative center 
some days when i leave i feel like im emerging from the 15th 
or 16th centuries i dont know where i am muelas says surveying 
one of three cloistered patios that form the core of the former 
dominican convent that expanded to about the size of a soccer field 
through the heart of toledo as the roman catholic order grew in 
power 
the transformation of the convent which has also served as an 
army barracks stables home for the elderly and orphanage is the 
largest project yet undertaken in the preservation and restoration 
of toledo a once strategic city on a hill whose origins go back to 
the roman colony of hispania 
like venice in italy and fez in morocco toledo has been declared 
part of the worlds cultural patrimony by unesco the united nations 
educational scientific and cultural organization and as in the 
case of venice and fez toledo needs more than declarations to help 
it remain a living city as well as a monumental symbol of a time 
when three of the worlds major religious cultures thrived together 
on a rocky outcropping of the la mancha plain 
roseanne bartholomew wife of us ambassador reginald 
bartholomew calls toledo one of the places where three cultures 
lived successfully comparing the citys former mix to that of 
jerusalem and beirut in their finer days 
mrs bartholomew is the only nonspanish member of the board of 
directors of the yearold toledo foundation which seeks to mobilize 
the interest government support and independent financial backing 
necessary to save the city she hopes to set up a us branch when 
she returns to washington when her husband leaves his post in spain 
this year 
the group has just moved into its headquarters in a room at one 
end of the medieval st martin bridge renovated by toledo youths 
employed at a restoration workshop school set up by the regional 
government of castillela mancha 
convents like san pedro martyr are a key element in the future of 
toledo there are some 50 within the old walled portion of the 
city most were built to house at least 400 cloistered nuns each but 
now have less than 20 inhabitants most of whom are over 65 
since the spanish state confiscated much of the churchs property 
in 1834 the convents have fallen on hard times 
the rehabilitation of san pedro martyr muelas says the 
dominicans meant it originally as an administrative center for some 
aspects of the spanish inquisition when they opened it in 1540 is 
budgeted at 10 million the spanish interior and economy ministries 
are paying the bill rather than building something new in toledos 
industrial park across the tagus river 
another convent san juan de la penitencia has been turned into 
an international studies center for north and south american 
students sponsored by the university of minnesota and spains jose 
ortega y gasset foundation 
the center has served as the setting for several tricultural 
congresses 
roman catholics and jews lived under moslem rule when the moors 
incorporated toledo into the cordoba emirate in 711 before it became 
the capital of an independent moorish kingdom in 1012 the city was 
reconquered by a christian king in 1085 and reached its glory under 
the 12521284 reign of alfonso x the wise 
at the height of his rule toledo became the most important 
jewish center in spain a country known in hebrew as sepharad from 
which sephardic jews get their name moorish artisans using brick 
construction carved wood sculpted plaster and painted tiles built 
the transito and santa maria la blanca synagogues 
then in 1492 queen isabella in an effort to consolidate her 
position on the iberian peninsula signed an edict banishing all 
moslems and jews from spain 
as part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary in 1992 of 
the first voyage of christopher columbus to the new world the 
spanish government has declared toledo the headquarters of sepharad 
92 and a symbol of spains reencounter with its jewish heritage 
when edgar bronfman president of the world jewish congress 
visited toledo a year ago mayor jose antonio molina told him the 
old city needed 100 million over the next two decades to reverse a 
depopulation trend that threatened to turn the city into a ghost 
town filled with monuments and tourist shops 
of toledos 60000 inhabitants about 16000 live inside the 
citys moorish walls where streets are only as wide as a persons 
outstretched arms parking is impossible and everyone knows what 
youre doing in the words of steve kennedy an englishman married 
to a spaniard who lived in the old city for six years 
on evenings and weekends the main zocodover plaza fills with 
people who come to gossip drink a beer or buy almond paste 
marzipan a moorishjewish legacy and a toledo speciality 
many of the dwellings in toledo have been abandoned over the 
years by squabbling heirs who dont want to live 42 miles from much 
more uptodate madrid many are either palaces or hovels too big 
or too small for single families 
former mayor juan ignacio de mesa a member of the foundations 
board of directors is looking for a way to use stateoftheart 
technology to make a medieval city liveable 
de mesa is working with representatives of the citys major 
industries alcatel nixdorf and the beecham and jansen 
pharmaceutical firms to solve mundane but pressing problems of 
what to do with the elecrical and telephone lines that dangle in 
clusters and crisscross narrow streets and the television antennae 
that sprout from redtile roofs 
the spanish government through the ministry of cultures 
restoration department has earmarked 816 million pesetas 710000 
in 1989 for work on toledos magnificent 13th century cathedral the 
tornerias mosque santa maria la blanca and the santa fe convent a 
similar sum was budgeted last year 
the ministrys museums department spent an additional 333 
million pesetas 290000 restoring the house of the painter el 
greco the transito and the santa cruz museum the regional 
government spent 701 million pesetas 609000 
these amounts de mesa says are but a drop in the bucket 
the foundation is in the process of drawing up the first overall 
plan to present to the ministry of culture on what has to be done to 
establish what mrs bartholomew calls the very fine balance 
between a museum city and a city that lives 
spanish government support for the plan is essential in 
encouraging fundraising from other sources she adds 
de mesa says the lack of a specific plan has hindered 
fundraising from sources outside spain including american jewish 
groups that could be interested in the restoration of the citys old 
jewish quarter

fulfilled its duties under the community reinvestment act which 
requires banks to meet local credit needs including those in poor 
neighborhoods

although the texas premium is not as big as it 
used to be some of the states smaller weaker thrifts are chasing 
after depositors with rates so high that federal regulators have 
become concerned 
texas thrifts account for 11 of the top 25 yields available on 
sixmonth jumbo certificates of deposit according to 100 highest 
yields a publication in north palm beach fla 
ten of the texas 11 are rated financially weak or insolvent 
making them least able to afford the high rates they pay depositors 
their actions could add to the cost to taxpayers of the bush 
administrations proposed 90 billion bailout the government says 
paying a premium rate has an effect on the total cost to the 
government in resolving these insolvencies and in the meantime 
others in the region have to compete with these insolvent 
institutions alan whitney spokesman for the federal deposit 
insurance corp said in an interview thursday 
the jumbo certificates of deposit are sold in units of 
100000 meaning the buyers tend to be institutions or wealthy 
individuals who are on the lookout for high yields backed up by 
federal insurance 
a few weak thrift institutions still continue to play the 
hotmoney game said robert k heady publisher of bank rate 
monitor a publication affiliated with 100 highest yields 
aside from the relatively small number of high payers rates on 
deposits at big texas thrifts are today only slightly above the 
national average a change from the days when the states sampls had 
to pay a big texas premium to attract deposits 
most of the highest rates on regular deposits are now offered in 
the northeast and midatlantic states where there is strong loan 
demand because of the healthier economy 
the fact is that in light of the presidents statements and 
other statements by the administration there is no excess level of 
risk in placing deposits in texas institutions whitney said 
the bush administrations 90 billion proposal to rescue troubled 
thrifts many of them in texas was intended partially to close 
those institutions that were driving up deposit rates for the rest 
of the industry 
but two insolvent houstonarea thrifts this week jacked up 
interest rates as high as 1075 percent for sixmonth jumbo cds 
the spike in rates which already is subsiding was described by 
officials of highbidding bancplus savings association and 
commonwealth savings as a temporary cyclical cash drive for 
mortgage operations 
one of the primary objectives of the government is to stabilize 
the situation and it certainly doesnt lend stability when there 
are rates out there of such size said douglas valdetero 
executive vice president at houstonbased university savings 
theres no way you can buy that kind of money and turn it out and 
make any profit on it 
university savings tried to keep up with the increasing rates for 
cds which were limited to deposits of 95000100000 the thrift 
raised its sixmonth rate from 98 percent to 101 percent monday 
before dropping back the next day to 9875 percent 
valdetero said the thrift retreated on its own from the rate 
battle but whitney said university is under fdic jurisdiction and 
that the agency stepped in to reduce the rates 
commonwealth meanwhile boosted its rates to 1075 percent from 
about 93 percent bancplus was close behind at 1065 percent but 
lowered its rate on the sixmonth deposits to 1060 percent thursday 
and expected to drop still lower by friday spokesman brendan duffey 
said 
commonwealth paid the highest rate in the nation for sixmonth 
jumbo cds as of wednesday at 1075 percent according to 100 
highest yields 
the rest of the top five were sandia federal savings amp loan of 
albuquerque nm 985 percent resource savings of dallas 980 
percent first federal savings and loan of colorado springs colo 
980 percent and fidelity federal savings bank of corinth miss 
980 percent 
the list is for institutions of all sizes 
as for the bigger thrifts statistics from the 10 largest thrifts 
in each of the 10 major us cities showed houston had an average 
911 percent rate on jumbo cds and dallas averaged 910 percent 
compared to the national average of 897 percent 
rates in detroit and boston were even higher at 926 percent 
presumably the demand for loans is high enough in those cities that 
their thrifts need to offer high rates to attract deposits that they 
can then relend heady said 
reflecting the regional shift a year ago 75 of the nations 100 
top yields on regular smalldenomination cds and money market 
accounts were offered by texas institutions 
only 10 to 12 texas institutions remain on that list while about 
66 are from the northeast and midatlantic states heady said

president bush is disputing criticism that his 
116 trillion budget allows him to take credit for proposing 
expanded social spending while sticking congress with finding ways 
to pay for it 
its a twoway street bush said as he vowed to make good on 
his commitment to work with congress on spending cuts 
the president who made the remarks on thursday in an oval office 
interview with a group of reporters was to give yet another 
outoftown speech today promoting that fiscal 1990 spending plan 
his talk at washington university in st louis was his third 
speech on the budget since he unveiled it a week ago before a joint 
session of congress bush made similar remarks to business leaders 
in new hampshire on monday and to state legislators in south 
carolina on wednesday 
todays address also was expected to stress volunteerism in the 
private sector one of bushs pet themes 
democratic critics have called bushs budget vague on where he 
would make between 96 billion and 11 billion in cuts to carry out 
his commitments for new spending on domestic programs like 
education child care the homeless and cleaning up the environment 
i said ahead of time i didnt expect everybody would jump up 
and down and say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread 
bush said on thursday 
but he rejected the notion that he had been deliberately vague in 
the budget to put the onus on congress alone for coming up with 
unpopular spending cuts 
yes theres a lot more detail that has to be hammered out and 
we will work with them to satisfy their interests and find out what 
they want its a two way street bush said 
he said he was generally pleased with the reaction so far toward 
both his budget plan and to his program to rescue the nations 
ailing savings and loans even though he conceded that the twin 
plans werent universally popular 
bush also denied anew any major policy rift with federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan even though they hold different views on 
inflation and interest rates 
its one of the best fights in town bush said of battles 
between a president and a fed chief you all love it all 
politicians love it bankers like it all editorialists for the wall 
street journal love it but i want to avoid that because we arent 
far apart 
greenspans fed has been nudging up shortterm rates in recent 
months in an effort to minimize inflation risks bush said thursday 
i dont see the inflationary pressures as so bad or enough to 
warrant substantially higher interest rates 
higher interest rates could the dampen economic growth that bush 
is counting on to produce government revenue gains assumed in his 
budget

share prices were near their morning lows in

figures came as little surprise to the market 
the rise in the annual inflation rate to 75 percent in january

comments last saturday by chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
since the rise was expected by the markets its impact was not 
strong dealers said 
we wouldve liked to have seen lower numbers one dealer 
said but one can only say they were as bad as had been expected 
by noon in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share

britains annual inflation rate surged to 75 
percent in january from 68 percent in the previous month pushed to 
its highest level in more than six years by higher mortgage rates 
the government said friday 
the department of employment said its retail price index rose 06 
percent in january from the previous month 
the index which uses a 1987 base of 100 stood at 111 in 
january crease of 73 percent to 75 percent chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson warned last saturday that the rise was likely 
to be much above the 68 percent increase recorded for december 
the 75 percent inflation rate is the highest since mid1982 
share prices retreated on londons stock exchange on the news 
and the pound rose a bit trading in the markets was quiet 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was down 144 
points or 07 percent at 20194 after the report was released 
the index was 125 points lower before 
the pound was quoted at 17785 vs 17780 earlier 
these figures do show very strong inflationary pressures 
said nigel richardson an analyst with the london investment firm 
rowe and pitman mullins and co 
the department said the rise was mainly due to higher mortgage 
interest payments reflecting mortgage rate hikes made in january 
following the latenovember rise in the british commercial banks 
base rate to 13 percent from 12 percent 
excluding mortgage payments the department said the annual 
inflation rate was 55 percent 
the government remains determined to bring inflation down but 
one consequence of using the higher interest rates as its weapon is 
higher inflation in the shortterm the department said 
the january increase also reflected higher food prices motor 
insurance premiums and rail fares it said

debt and expenses from a 1986 leveraged buyout by 
management of fruehauf corp caused increased losses in the fourth 
quarter and for 1988 the trucktrailer and auto parts maker says 
fruehauf on thursday reported a net loss of 102 million or 
139 a share for the three months ended dec 31 compared with a 
net loss of 61 million or 84 cents a share in the fourth quarter 
of 1987 
the losses came despite improved revenue 5570 million for the 
quarter up from 4619 million for the yearearlier period the 
company said in a news release 
for the year fruehauf said it had a net loss of 565 million 
or 650 a share on revenue of 209 billion compared with a net 
loss of 415 million or 597 a share on revenue of 196 billion 
in 1987 
the company said it had longterm debt of 710 million on dec 
31 though that was down from 794 million on dec 31 1987 and 
interest expenses of 101 million for 1988 reduced from 109 
million the year before 
depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of the buyout 
amounted to 1135 million in 1988 down from 1189 million in 
1987 the company said 
its kelseyhayes operation provided the only revenue increase for 
the company 
fruehauf said revenue from automotive operations its 
kelseyhayes subsidiarys antilock braking systems and aluminum 
wheels grew 215 percent partly offset by costs of a new plant 
and equipment 
but the company said rising materials costs contributed to a 62 
percent decline in trailer manufacturing revenue and a 194 percent 
decline in revenue from its shiprepair facility in jacksonville

despite claims by domestic producers of excess 
steel production capacity worldwide a leading importer says there 
are shortages that justify a second look at us steel trade quotas 
us steelmakers demanding another five years of quotas cite 
excess world capacity of 100 million tons or more per year of steel 
as the basis for cutthroat trading practices 
i assure you most steel is imported into this market because it 
fills specific needs of american steel users said erwin l klein 
a director and immediate past president of the american institute 
for imported steel 
that may help dispel the notion most steel brought into this 
country is foisted on american buyers by means of unfair trade 
practices 
references to foreign production overcapacity as a cause of 
problems for the us steel industry may concern obsolete plants and 
marginal product categories klein said in a speech prepared for 
delivery thursday night in hasbrouck heights nj to the 
association of women in the metals industries 
though global surplus is widely discussed we have all 
encountered specific product shortages in the past year said 
klein who is also vice chairman of steelinter usa inc of new york 
a major importer of belgian steel 
the shortages involve plate large structural shapes and rod he 
said 
the new yorkbased importers association says the bush 
administration should ease the steel import restrictions under the 
fiveyear quota plan due to expire in september bush has promised 
american producers to extend the protection 
us producers say another five years of quotas are necessary if 
they are to fully recover from a near disasterous slump in their 
industry from 198286 they accuse foreign steel producers 
especially those in europe of producing excess steel with 
government subsidies to maintain employment in their countries 
klein said that since the early 1970s domestic steel buyers had 
been forced to turn to foreign suppliers not only for particular 
types of steel but also because total domestic steelmaking capacity 
repeatedly had fallen short of demand 
the shortfall was more than 20 million tons in 1988 and the 
problem was especially acute in the west and southwest where 
domestic production facilities were insufficient he said 
importers have asked that bush make any further quotas temporary 
with a timetable for being phased out they want quotas to be 
voluntary and constantly adjusted to suit the needs of steel users 
the importers also say semifinished steel products imported by 
american producers should not be covered by the quota plan 
the interests of steelconsuming manufacturers should get equal 
consideration with those of the large steel producers klein said 
those steelusers create 25 times more value employ 30 times 
more workers and export nearly 100 times more in dollar terms than 
the steel industry he said

the dollar rose against major foreign currencies in 
europe today after the us government reported the countrys trade 
deficit narrowed in december 
the us commerce department said the december trade deficit 
declined to 119 billion from a revised november figure of 122 
billion the november shortfall was originally reported at 125 
billion 
one milan trader had said that there would be a greater tendency 
to sell than buy the dollar should a neutral figure emerge from the 
washington report 
this trader defined a neutral result as somewhere between 11 
billion and 12 billion 
milan traders said there were far fewer dollar bulls in the 
market than at the same time last week due largely to mounting 
opinion that the us federal reserve was not about to hike us 
interest rates as many had been expecting 
in london the dollar improved against the british pound after 
the trade report it cost 17720 to buy one pound compared with 
17770 at midmorning and 17712 thursday

the 815 million awarded to a woman who 
said a gd searle amp co birth control device left her infertile was 
not so shockingly excessive as to force a new trial a judge has 
ruled 
us district judge robert renner on thursday denied the 
companys motion for a new trial which it had asked for on several 
grounds including juror misconduct errors of evidence in the trial 
and excessive punitive damages 
a jury in september found in favor of esther kociembas claim 
that a searle copper7 intrauterine device had triggered a pelvic 
infection that left her infertile 
this court simply cannot say that the verdict is so shockingly 
excessive in the light of evidence and minnesota law that the 
court has grounds to force plaintiff to choose between a new trial 
or a reduced amount of punitive damages renner said 
searle which plans to appeal said in a statement issued after 
the ruling that it clearly believes that a new trial was warranted 
based on the evidence of jury misconduct 
that flagrant misconduct occurred demonstrates the failure of 
the judicial system to assure a fair trial for both parties as 
required by federal law the company said 
renner rejected the claims of misconduct after questioning jurors 
in december three of the eight jurors had signed affidavits 
alleging they were victims of verbal harassment and intimidation and 
had been bullied into an unjust verdict by their fellow jurors 
the affidavits also said newspaper accounts of the trial had been 
smuggled into the jury room 
attorneys for kociemba presented evidence during the trial that 
would have allowed a reasonable jury to conclude that searle 
knowingly placed millions of women at risk of serious infection 
loss of fertility and surgery for removal of internal organs 
renner ruled 
about 500 lawsuits have been filed over the copper7 the most 
widely used iud in the united states before it was withdrawn from 
the us market in january 1986

the carls jr fast food chains general 
accounting director has been indicted by a federal grand jury on one 
count of securities fraud in connection with insider trading 
alvin a deshano 53 of orange was charged thursday with 
receiving and using confidential company information to avoid a 
7107 loss on stock involving the anaheimbased carl karcher 
enterprises which runs the carls jr hamburger restaurants 
a statement from loren pannier chief financial officer of 
karcher enterprises said al remains an active employee of the 
company this matter should have no effect on the companys 
business 
the us securities and exchange commission filed a civil lawsuit 
last april accusing deshano of using an oct 12 1984 financial 
report to get rid of 1725 shares of karcher stock deshano sold the 
shares on oct 15 1984 on oct 23 1984 karcher enterprises 
publicly announced that lower earnings resulted in a drop in stock 
value 
deshano could not immediately be reached for comment friday a 
call placed to his office before business hours went unanswered 
his attorney david m wiechert of irvine said his client 
never would have intended to deceive or defraud anyone 
he had legitimate reasons for diversifying his investments and 
assets at the time of the sale that were wholly unrelated to the 
information wiechert said 
the sec lawsuit also accused karcher enterprises chairman and 
chief executive officer carl n karcher along with 14 of his 
relatives of avoiding more than 300000 in stock losses six of the 
16 defendants including company president donald f karcher have 
agreed to pay 187560 in fines and penalties to end their 
involvement in the sec suit 
the remaining defendants including deshano are scheduled to 
stand trial on april 11 deshano is the only one who has been 
criminally charged 
if convicted he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison 
and fined 250000

along with rising stock prices dividends have 
been making news with cheerful regularity in the investment world of 
late 
spurred on by strong earnings such bluechip companies as 
general motors minnesota mining amp manufacturing general electric 
and cocacola all have raised dividends in recent weeks 
but some analysts doubt this marks the start of a major trend 
dividends still have a long way to go they say to regain anything 
like the stature and importance they were accorded a generation ago 
dividend payments by the companies that make up standard amp poors 
500stock composite index rose an unusually strong 11 percent in 
1988 says sampp in its weekly publication the outlook 
this year however the firm is projecting what it called a 
more typical 5 percent increase 
when companies have found themselves with cash to spare in the 
1980s they have opted more and more frequently for an alternative 
to a dividend increase buying back some of their stock 
a buyback gives each of the remaining shares outstanding an 
increased though indirect claim on a companys earnings 
unlike a dividend payment it does not create a tax liability for 
individuals and other taxable investors 
for investors that arent subject to current taxes such as 
pension funds a buyback helps provide a stable market for those who 
wish to sell their shares and leaves the rest free of the need to 
decide how and where to reinvest a cash payout 
three decades ago it was an accepted principle that stocks 
should yield more than bonds to compensate for the extra risk they 
represented 
today stocks dividend yields averaging about 35 percent pale 
beside the 9 percent available from a virtually riskfree treasury 
bill 
since world war ii the percentage of total earnings companies 
pay out in dividends has fluctuated in a range of roughly 40 percent 
to 60 percent the high points came in the prosperous 1960s and the 
lows occurred in the inflationwracked 70s 
lately this payout ratio has fallen once again to the 
extreme low end of its historic range 
the absence of any drastic pickup in inflation argues for an 
upturn in the payout ratio soon maintains jeffrey applegate an 
analyst at tucker anthony amp rl day inc 
theres no evidence yet that the ratio is rising he said in 
a recent commentary but the third year in a row of 
nonaccelerating inflation should cause companies to boost that 
payout 
if they dont the risk is that somebody else will come along 
and increase shareholder value and those managements will be 
looking for new jobs 
historically dividend increases have been seen as tangible 
declarations of confidence and optimism from corporations expressed 
in hard cash rather than verbal promises or projections 
analysts ned davis and martin zweig in their advisory 
publication futures hotline say positive trends in dividends do 
tend to work in the markets favor up to a point 
by the time almost all the dividend news is favorable 
increases resumptions extra payouts as opposed to decreases or 
omissions it can be read as a danger signal they say 
at that level the increasing dividends suggest that 
corporations are overconfident davis and zweig conclude when 
everything looks too good the market tends to be overbought and 
risky

a group of us companies is close to completing 
a proposed trade pact with the soviet union that would allow foreign 
businesses for the first time to take profits out of that country in 
dollars according to a published report 
executives of the six us companies called the american trade 
consortium and officials of more than 30 soviet trade and economic 
organizations have negotiated for nine months to complete the 
agreement business week said in its feb 27 issue 
the accord which was expected to be signed by early april would 
clear the way for the six corporations to negotiate joint ventures 
in the soviet union and could prove to be the biggest and most 
complex trade agreement ever developed between the west and the 
soviets the magazine said 
central to the accord is the guarantee that the countries would 
be allowed to repatriate their profits in dollars from the soviet 
union 
a number of western companies already have embarked on joint 
ventures in the soviet union but the inability to repatriate 
profits in dollars has been seen as a key obstacle in expanding that 
field 
the american trade consortium companies include ford motor co 
rjr nabisco co chevron corp eastman kodak co johnson amp 
johnson archer daniels midland co and the new york merchant bank 
mercator 
foreign companies generally cannot take dollars from the soviet 
union because the country badly needs the currency to buy imports 
soviet exports are limited so dollars are in short supply 
under the agreement the companies earning dollars would create a 
cash pool and would be allowed to take dollars out in proportion to 
the amount of rubles they put in 
chevron would be a key cash provider at the outset under the 
plan through a joint venture for the export of soviet oil while 
the other us business would be mainly selling to the soviet market 
for rubles chevron would be bringing in dollars chevrons earnings 
would then go into the cash pool to cover any profits that are 
repatriated by the companies 
the hard currency us companies need to repatriate their profits 
will be guaranteed by soviet institutions 
the other us companies also are working out their own deals 
eastman kodak has been negotiating to produce blood analyzers and 
floppy disks as well as to sell film and operate photofinishing 
laboratories archer daniels midland is negotiating to set up a 
factory to produce fructose starch and ethanol johnson amp johnson 
is looking to health products ventures and rjr nabisco is 
negotiating the manufacture of cereals crackers and cigarettes the 
magazine stated 
ford is working on a venture to help the soviets revitalize their 
auto industry starting with the import into the ussr of its scorpio 
model and eventually setting up production facilities 
last month the american trade consortium offered to buy the 
partially built us embassy in moscow for use as business offices 
for the group 
the united states halted construction on the embassy because it 
was found to have been riddled with soviet listening devices while 
the soviets were building it

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade in a continuation of the selling 
that brought soybean and wheat prices down sharply near the close of 
thursdays session 
major factors in the selloff include improved growing conditions 
in south america and reports that france has overcome some 
logistical hurdles to completing a sale of 15 million metric tons 
of wheat to the soviet union 
the development lessens the possibility that the soviets will 
need to increase their purchases of us wheat as some traders had 
hoped 
the brazilian government on wednesday issued a report pegging the 
198889 brazilian soybean crop at 226 million metric tons an 
increase from the 215 million to 221 million metric tons forecast 
in december 
the improved outlook for the south american soybean crop is based 
on wetter weather in brazil and argentina where drought conditions 
prevailed earlier in the growing season 
in early trading wheat was cent to 1 cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 422 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 
1 cents lower with march at 267 a bushel oats were 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with march at 203 a bushel soybeans were 
1 cents to 3 cents lower with march at 725 a bushel 
cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 12 cent to 55 cent higher with april at 7617 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 23 cent to 58 cent higher with 
march at 8230 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent lower to 25 cent 
higher with april at 4192 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
57 cent lower to 28 cent higher with march at 3785 cents a pound

president bush back on the road championing his 
116 trillion spending plan said today he will personally 
participate in highlevel budget talks next week and share 
responsibility with congress for difficult spending cuts 
bush said he had invited house and senate leaders to the white 
house next tuesday the day before he leaves on a fiveday far east 
trip for a round of talks to speed a budget accord 
together weve got to make the budget process work bush 
told students at washington university here 
next weeks meeting appeared designed to blunt democratic 
criticism that bushs budget enabled him to take credit for 
proposing expanded social programs while leaving congress with the 
unpopular job of finding ways to pay for them through cuts in other 
areas 
budget analysts say the spending plan bush unveiled last week 
while calling for restraints in defense spending but new initiatives 
in education housing childcare and environmental cleanup falls 
about 96 billion to 11 billion short of meeting the deficit 
targets he set forth 
i am committed to working closely with my friends on the hill 
to help them meet the target date set by the grammrudmanhollings 
law for an april 15th budget resolution bush said 
that law which requires a balanced budget by 1993 calls for a 
deficit in the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 of no more than 
100 billion down from an estimated 160 billion this year 
failure of congress to meet the targets can result in 
acrosstheboard cuts in military as well as civilian programs 
direct involvement by a president this early in the budget 
process is rare however bush has promised all along to work 
closely with the democraticcontrolled congress and engage in a 
number of bipartisan meetings with leaders 
bush spokesman stephen hart said next weeks white house meeting 
was the beginning of his bushs personal involvement with 
congress in the budget process 
he said bush was not seeking to sidestep the usual legislative 
process and that tuesdays session likely would not involve any 
detailed number crunching over specific spending levels 
the president told his audience that he had called the top five 
congressional leaders to attend the meeting house speaker jim 
wright dtexas house republican leader robert michel of illinois 
house democratic leader thomas foley of washington senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine and senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said the chairmen and 
ranking minority members of the congressional budget finance and 
appropriations committees would also be there 
fitzwater called the session an opportunity to assess progress 
thus far to go over some of the numbers that have emerged in 
preliminary sessions the president also wanted to build momentum 
while he is out of the country visiting the far east 
fitzwater said those at the meeting would discuss where do we 
go from here how do we get more direct negotiations in his 
speech bush said the session was intended to demonstrate a spirit 
of bipartisanship and to show a readiness on his part to get on 
with the nations business of getting a quick and early resolution 
to this budget crisis 
bush as he has done this week in two other outofwashington 
appearances outlined the highlights of his budget plan calling it 
responsive and responsible and fairminded in its strategy 
he gave particular emphasis to its proposed initiatives on 
education including the first installment toward a 500 million 
program of grants for the nations best schools 
we have made education the gateway arch of the bush 
administration the president declared referring to the citys 
trademark steel arch on the banks of the mississippi river 
his talk at washington university here follows similar remarks on 
his budget to business leaders in new hampshire on monday and to 
state legislators in south carolina on wednesday 
todays address also stressed volunteerism in the private sector 
one of bushs pet themes 
my friends from now on in america any definition of a 
successful life must include serving others he said in 
childcare center in the corporate boardroom at the rotary at 
little league or a tutoring program and in a church or synagogue 
he characterized his budget as one that leaves power in the 
hands of the people and said i know we can have a government 
with a heart as well as a head 
we must forge strong partnerships between all levels of 
government and voluntary organizations business corporations and 
individuals to lend a hand mend a wound and help the less 
fortunate bush said 
on thursday bush rejected the notion that he had been 
deliberately vague in the budget to put the onus on congress alone 
for coming up with unpopular spending cuts 
yes theres a lot more detail that has to be hammered out and 
we will work with them to satisfy their interests and find out what 
they want its a twoway street bush said in an oval office 
interview with a group of reporters

the us trade deficit shrank to 13734 
billion in 1988 the first annual decline since 1980 as a surge in 
exports offset a relentless climb in imports the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said exports shot up to an alltime high 
of 32222 billion last year a dramatic 268 percent above the 1987 
level led by a boom in sales of americanmanufactured products and 
farm goods 
the huge gain in exports was enough to offset an 83 percent 
increase in imports which also rose to a record level of 45956 
billion 
for december the trade deficit shrank slightly to 119 billion 
down from a revised november figure of 122 billion 
however both november and december represented the highest 
imbalances between what the united states imported and what it sold 
abroad since august 
analysts are worried that the improvement in americas trading 
performance has stalled out after improving dramatically in the 
first half of 1988 the deficit actually began to widen again toward 
the end of the year 
reversing that trend and getting further trade improvements is 
one of the major economic challenges facing the new bush 
administration 
the trade deficit along with the related federal budget deficit 
represent the twin towers of debt that president bush inherited from 
ronald reagan 
reacting to the report the administration said it was committed 
to working for a further reduction in the trade deficit by boosting 
americas competitiveness on world markets and shrinking the budget 
deficit 
many analysts say the budget deficit has played a major role in 
the worsening trade performance of the 1980s by making america more 
dependent on foreign investment 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher said congressional 
approval of the bush budget along with a cut in the capital gains 
tax would help to further reduce the trade deficit 
reducing the cost of capital increasing personal saving and 
promoting research and development will go a long way to ensure that 
america wins at home and in the global marketplace mosbacher said 
in a statement 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called the decline 
in the trade deficit good news it does show steady improvement a 
trend of improvement he said the trade deficit had dropped 22 
percent on a yeartoyear basis 
the 1373 billion deficit for all of 1988 was down 194 percent 
from the alltime high of 1703 billion set in 1987 it was the 
first year that the trade deficit has shown any improvement since it 
fell 125 percent to 314 billion in 1980 the last year of the 
carter administration 
during the reagan years the deficit soared above the 100 
billion mark as americans appetite for foreign goods proved 
insatiable in 1985 thentreasury secretary james a baker iii 
engineered a coordinated effort with major us allies to devalue 
the dollar on foreign currency markets in an effort to make american 
goods more competitive and imports more expensive 
the strategy has proven successful in boosting exports but has 
had much less of an impact in curbing imports 
some economists believe the dollar will have to fall further to 
see more improvements in trade other analysts owever worry that 
steeper declines could scare off the foreign investors the united 
states has come to depend on to finance its borrowing needs and 
could run the risk of igniting a new inflationary spiral 
for 1988 the 268 percent surge in exports boosted the fortunes 
of american manufacturers who hired thousands of new workers and 
rushed to expand production facilities 
the narrowing of the trade deficit and the boom in business 
investment contributed fully half of overall economic growth in 1988 
the bush administration must now work to promote further export 
increases in 1989 or run the risk that economic growth will slow 
appreciably this would be a setback for the administrations other 
economic problem finding a way to reduce the huge federal budget 
deficit 
for 1988 sales of manufactured goods surged 252 percent to 
2148 billion reflecting increases in a variety of categories from 
office equipment to airplanes 
sales of agricultural products were up an even stronger 293 
percent to 37 billion but analysts said much of this increase 
reflected higher prices caused by last summers drought 
as usual americas largest trade imbalance was with japan a 
deficit of 554 billion down 73 percent from the alltime high 
set in 1987 
the deficit with the 12member european economic community was 
down even more sharply falling 472 percent to 128 billion for 
1988 the deficit with canada the largest us trading partner 
declined by 96 percent to 106 billion 
for december imports and exports both rose to record monthly 
highs exports climbed 56 percent to 2919 billion and imports 
jumped 33 percent to 4109 billion 
many economists are predicting that based on recent trends the 
1989 deficit will rise 
michael evans head of a washington economic forecasting firm 
said he expected the 1989 trade deficit to rise to 150 billion 
such an increase would act as a sharp drag on overall economic 
growth as measured by the gross national product 
many economists forecast the overall gnp will grow just 27 
percent in 1989 down from a fouryear high of 38 percent in 1988 
this economic slowdown would spell trouble for the bush 
administration which is counting on continued rapid growth to boost 
government revenues and lower the budget deficit 
on thursday president bush said his administration will try to 
keep the export boom alive by seeking to reduce barriers that are 
keeping american products out of foreign markets 
weve got to knock down barriers and we will relentlessly 
pursue negotiations to end subsidies that distort markets and that 
restrict trade bush said

the big three automakers set a record with 
combined earnings of 1121 billion last year but forecasts of 
slower economic growth are casting doubt on whether the bonanza can 
continue 
i think were getting a little closer to saturating the market 
in cars and interest rates will begin to take their toll said 
auto analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
who predicts big three earnings will fall 10 percent to 15 percent 
in 1989 
the combined earnings of general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp for 1988 were up 145 percent from the previous 
combined record of 979 billion in 1984 
ford told its employees today they would get profitsharing 
checks of about 2800 apiece next month lower than last years 
3700 because of a decline in us earnings general motors is 
giving profitsharing checks of about 254 per employee chryslers 
will be about 720 
analysts predict the us economy will soften this year taking 
the auto industry with it 
new vehicle sales for the 1989 model year are forecast to fall 
from the 156 million cars and light trucks sold for 1988 the 
third best on record to about 15 million 
given the economic climate a decrease in vehicle sales might be 
better than an increase because the increase would imply an 
economic boom and busts follow booms said scott merlis an auto 
analyst with morgan stanley amp co 
and even with lower sales and a 15 percent earnings decline in 
1989 merlis said detroit would still be at a healthy level from 
an earnings point of view 
executives from each of the big three said costcutting programs 
helped boost 1988 earnings gm said it saved 48 billion by 
trimming costs 
but one of the unknowns in the automakers future earnings 
equations is the cost of buying incentives that customers have come 
to expect 
gm spokesman terry sullivan said the company spent about 42 
billion on incentives and discounts on option packages in 1988 556 
percent more than in 1987 
david mccammon fords finance vice president and treasurer said 
the no 2 automaker spent about 400 million more on incentives in 
1988 than the previous year he declined to disclose specifics but 
estimated that ford spent about 25 percent less per car on 
incentives than gm 
chrysler spokesman tom houston declined to say how much 
incentives cost the no 3 automaker last year or how it compared 
with 1987 in the past chrysler has used incentives liberally 
gaining market share by selling more cars while losing profits 
besides forecasts of dropping vehicle sales volumes and continued 
cost cutting some experts fear there could be a recession in the 
next few years but even that some analysts said wouldnt be a 
disastrous for the automobile industry 
merlis said the big three could increase earnings by 50 percent 
over the next five years on flat or lower sales through massive 
cutbacks 
recessions have a tendency to create belttightening he 
said the best is yet to come when it comes to the costcutting 
potential

with a strike deadline looming a federal judge 
issued injunctions today against both eastern airlines and the 
machinists union to resolve an aircraft maintenance dispute that the 
carrier says has grounded 17 jetliners 
senior us district judge c clyde atkins ruled the militant 
union must work on 12 grounded aircraft and members must work 
overtime if required by the carrier with no slowdowns and no 
sickouts 
he also decided that work already begun by outside contractors 
hired by eastern on five aircraft will be allowed to continue but 
eastern has been barred from farming out any more such work during a 
30day coolingoff period in their stalled talks 
if no contract agreement is reached by midnight march 3 eastern 
is free to impose its own work rules and the 8500hundred member 
union representing eastern machinists baggage handlers and other 
ground crews are free to strike 
we have 17 aircraft on the ground normally we have zero 
eastern attorney david ross told the judge as the airline fought the 
unions motion to keep all maintenance work in house we cant get 
these done even if we get back to full production 
ross contended there was too much backlog for the machinists 
alone to handle the work and outsiders are needed to get all of the 
aircraft back in service 
but george tucker attorney for the union responded its our 
work we can do it we will work overtime if required and there 
will be no slowdowns 
ross kept repeating that the machinists will be pushed to the 
limit as new aircraft come in for maintenance and tucker repeated 
the unions arguments that the work has traditionally been down by 
organized labor 
with the attorneys bickering atkins broke in and said ive 
made my ruling there will be no more planes or equipment shipped 
but the work may continue on the five planes that are already 
undergoing work 
i am entering an injunction against both sides effective from 
now on until march 3 the company can continue the work on the five 
that are already out but no more will be shipped the judge said 
the union will do all the work required of them including 
overtime if asked with no slowdowns and no sickouts 
his verbal order will be backed by a written decision in the 
afternoon atkins said 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the groundings first 
disclosed in court wednesday have forced the airline to adjust the 
schedules downward he said passengers were being warned in 
advance of any cancellations 
even the present backlog of grounded aircraft is totally 
unacceptable and poses a severe threat to a company in easterns 
dire financial condition the miamibased carrier wrote in its 
court briefs 
wildcat walkouts earlier this month were overt acts of economic 
warfare and tended to further the bargaining goals of the union 
the filing said 
russ mcgarry vice president of the machinists miami local 
blamed the delays on managements actions in preparation for a 
possible strike 
we feel the company has purposely shipped out the parts 
shipped out equipment and depleted the number of personnel available 
to work mcgarry said they suspend a crew then turn around and 
farm out the work because there was nobody to do the job

losses estimated at 3354 million for 1988

the interstate commerce commission approved 
today a 5year antitrust exemption that allows a company owned by 
major railroads to continue controlling rail car purchases 
the company trailer train co of chicago had asked for a 
15year extension over the objections of the justice department the 
state of oregon and a major rail car builder the commission imposed 
some conditions on the arrangement and the final wording was being 
worked out said icc spokesman dennis watson 
the icc gave the company an extension of a pooling arrangement 
critics say amounts to a monopsony this is an antitrust term 
for a company that controls purchasing in an industry often 
enabling it to set prices and dictate product development 
trailer train which is owned by 22 railroads controls about 80 
percent of the nations railroad flatcar fleet including the vast 
majority of intermodal cars which are used to carry standardized 
containers that also are loaded onto ships and trucks 
the arrangement including joint purchasing and ownershp of 
rail cars will be in the interest of better service to the public 
and economy of operation and will not unreasonably restrain 
competition the icc said in its ruling 
the companys pooling and leasing procedures allow railroads to 
exchange cars so they can be used more efficiently and not have to 
return empty 
the commission also approved a proposed stock ownership 
redistribution which extends ownership of trailer train to some 
smaller railroads 
critics including a company that has sold thousands of railcars 
to trailer train said prior to the decision that competition among 
railcar suppliers will not survive if trailer train continues to 
have control over purchasing for all of the nations railroads 
william a furman president of greenbrier cos whose subsidiary 
gunderson inc builds railcars in oregon said under these 
current conditions trailer train can with government sanction 
abuse this tremendous economic power we know they have abused it in 
their dealings with us 
furman noted that airlines are not allowed to pool together and 
buy airplanes nor can the railcar builders join together to 
acquire raw materials fix prices or allocate markets 
he said the number of companies building freight cars has fallen 
from 20 in 1979 to four today 
the justice department in november 1987 questioned trailer 
trains antitrust immunity and asked the icc to hold hearings and 
reconsider before deciding whether to grant an extension todays

eastern airlines in its waning days as operator 
of a northeast air shuttle is offering its shuttle passengers 50 
department store gift certificates in a bid to lure fliers from pan 
am corps rival service and keep its own passengers from defecting 
ailing eastern started the promotion last month a few weeks 
after pan am started mailing its frequent shuttle passengers coupons 
worth 25 off a oneway pan am shuttle ticket 
the 50 eastern certificates redeemable at bloomingdales and 
other well known department stores in the northeast are given to 
passengers buying roundtrip tickets two or more of the 
certificates may be combined toward a purchase and certificates must 
be redeemed by march 15 
they eastern are trying to hold the shuttle together said 
david perelman president of dms travel in new york theyre using 
this as an incentive as a bribe to keep people on the shuttle 
oneway shuttle fares are 99 during peak hours 
miamibased eastern which faces the threat of a possible strike 
by its machinists union on march 3 also has introduced coupons for 
the rest of its domestic system offering passengers big discounts if 
they fly after that date 
new york developer donald trump who recently cleared a number of 
regulatory hurdles is scheduled to complete his 365 million 
acquisition of the eastern shuttle sometime next month 
eastern whose shuttle carries about 3 million passengers 
annually and pan am are locked in fierce competition over their 
lucrative shuttle services which fly hourly between new york 
boston and washington and are used mainly by business travelers 
last week pan am launched a new advertising campaign for its 
shuttle service calling it the corporate jet pan am officials 
denied that the new ad blitz was planned in anticipation of the 
flamboyant trumps debut as a competitor 
but they conceded that curiosity and publicity about trump will 
prompt some passengers to take his shuttle service on a trial basis 
pan am said its service now commands nearly 50 percent of the 
northeast shuttle market it shares with eastern 
the gift certificates are an attempt by eastern to thank people 
for their loyalty bruce nobles the head of the eastern shuttle 
said in a telephone interview he denied that the promotion was 
designed to match pan ams flight credit coupons 
nobles formerly was president of the pan am shuttle and left 
about a year ago to work for eastern 
weve really had a wonderful response to the certificates we 
have seen an increase in customers on the shuttle said eastern 
spokeswoman cori zywotow in miami she declined to specify the 
increase in shuttle bookings which the airline attributes to the 
certificate giveaway 
the 50 certificates can be redeemed at bloomingdales and macys 
in the new york area garfinckels woodward amp lothrop and 
bloomingdales in washington and filenes jordan marsh and 
bloomingdales in boston

british media baron robert maxwell canceled a major 
address friday on the launch of his englishlanguage newspaper the 
european saying his editorial team was not yet pursuing shared 
goals and a unified concept 
the launch of the new daily aiming to start with half a million 
readers across europe in early may has already been postponed once 
maxwell however said in a lastminute letter in which he 
withdrew as a keynote speaker at a european conference of foreign 
press associations that he had a total commitment to launching the 
european as the first paneuropean paper 
the 65yearold maxwell who bought the us publishing giant 
macmillan inc for 26 billion last fall oversees a publishing 
empire with operations in 28 countries and 40000 employees 
i would rather make sure this important project is right than 
stick to a preconceived timetable and get it wrong he said 
until i can be satisfied as publisher and editorinchief that 
the english and french components of our editorial team are fully 
and successfully integrated and pursuing shared goals and a unified 
concept i will not launch the paper he added saying he would 
have another announcement next month 
maxwell immediately came under attack from participants at the 
conference aimed at setting the groundwork for better working 
conditions for foreign correspondents around the world particularly 
in europe 
eugenio scalfari editor of the romes largest circulation daily 
la repubblica called the concept of the european a bestiality 
adding that there was no such thing as european public opinion or 
unified taste he claimed that maxwell was closing a printing plant 
in france and firing some employees reflecting difficulties in 
starting such a newspaper 
scalfari supported the concept of national newspapers distributed 
abroad and challenged the soviet union to allow a newspaper owned 
by western europeans to be printed in moscow and distributed 
throughout the country 
the twoday conference inaugurated by italian president 
francesco cossiga also heard a proposal by the president of italys 
stateowned television system to start a european newsfilm agency to 
counteract american dominance of the field 
the new federation of foreign press associations will seek to 
avoid restrictions such as censorship and travel bans and try to 
limit physical harm to foreign correspondents around the world

american telephone amp telegraph co reorganizing 
again said friday it would decentralize this year by giving more 
power to the heads of 15 to 25 business units 
the change should help the former phone monopoly focus on the 
bottom line but is likely to unsettle employees who have already 
gone through several reorganizations since the 1984 breakup of the 
bell system said richard toole a merrill lynch amp co analyst 
the old monopoly mentality is really being wrung out of the 
company toole said to another extent you would like to get it 
the management structure right get it fixed once and for all 
the wall street journal reported on the reorganization in a 
friday story based on an interview with randall tobias an atampt vice 
chairman atampt did not officially announce the changes 
more of the basic business decisions in the future will be made 
by these individual business units rather than an overlay of top 
corporate executives said walter murphy an atampt spokesman 
theres not one big cutover date for this its all going to be 
happening as the year rolls out murphy said at a time when 
things are going pretty well for us this should make the company 
perform even better 
the presidents of atampts five major operating groups will be 
renamed group executives and will oversee sets of business units

dennis b levine the investment whiz turned 
crook whose squealings spawned wall streets insider trading 
scandal is briefing business school students about a subject he 
knows whitecollar crime 
levine paroled from a federal prison last year told his story 
of greed gone awry to about 90 rapt columbia business school 
students thursday in a tightly guarded and unpublicized session 
people who attended said 
the visit to the prestigious school came against a background of 
increased emphasis on ethics by business educators partly because 
of criminal behavior in the seductive highstakes world of 
securities and commodities trading 
levine who was not paid to speak at columbia traced his 
involvement in a fiveyear scheme that turned 40000 into 126 
million in illegal profits via his trades on illegally obtained 
information about pending corporate takeovers 
he said its very easy in such a heady exciting atmosphere 
simply to lose yourself in the enormously competitive race said 
columbia professor james kuhn who teaches ethics and attended the 
speech he now realizes it was a major source of his downfall 
levine 36 was paroled last september from a twoyear prison 
term for securities fraud tax evasion and perjury he remains under 
the supervision of federal probation authorities until april 
in a plea bargain with government prosecutors levine pleaded 
guilty to four felonies was fined 362000 and returned 116 
million in illegal profits 
the exinvestment banker who worked at several investment firms 
is best known for snitching on ivan f boesky the nowimprisoned 
insider trader who himself made millions of dollars using 
information supplied by levine 
both men are key figures in a corruption scandal that has dogged 
wall street for nearly three years 
levines appearance at columbia was endorsed by ethics experts 
and former prosecutors who said the theoretical approach by 
business schools to social responsibility could use some reallife 
lessons from financial felons 
charles carberry a former assistant us attorney who arrested 
levine in may 1986 said that as long as levine isnt making money 
by peddling his life story on the campus lecture circuit speaking 
would be effective 
when you have close physical contact with someone whos really 
gone through the ringer all these penalties you read about take on 
a new reality said carberry who is now in private practice 
i think he might be able to tell them things about his 
experience they may never be able to get out of a book he said 
levine would be permitted to profit on a book about his 
experiences under a new york law that prohibits only violent 
criminals from exploiting their stories for money 
but he has kept a low profile since his release and is said to be 
occupied with pending civil suits against him levine is permanently 
barred from working on wall street his attorneys did not return 
telephone calls friday 
another famous insider trader former wall street journal 
reporter r foster winans went on a speaking tour and wrote a book 
after he was convicted of securities fraud charges winans in 1983 
agreed to tip a broker about upcoming marketsensitive newspaper 
columns in exhange for a cut of the brokers profits 
columbia officials said levine agreed to speak on a guarantee of 
no publicity the school deployed a public relations staffer in the 
lobby to keep at least one newspaper reporter away from levine 
levine was brought to campus by a student group called mores 
managing organizations responsibly ethically and successfully 
with the approval of the dean only students in the group and two 
ethics classes could attend 
according to students who attended the speech levine praised the 
skill of government prosecutors and said he made naive and foolish 
mistakes but never clearly stated that the ordeal fundamentally 
altered his values 
levines remarks they said were more about lawbreaking than 
ethicsmaking kuhn said students were quite skeptical of a man 
who could get himself into these problems and not have greater 
qualms about it 
levine spoke for about 20 minutes then answered questions for 
more than an hour he was dressed in a dark suit like the investment 
banker he once was 
i told him privately he would have been much more effective if 
he came dressed in sackcloth and ashes kuhn said

a bit stronger than expected 
analysts said the figures raised some concern that the federal 
reserve might be inclined to tighten credit further

didnt contain any unpleasant surprises as some talk on the street 
had suggested thursday

soybean futures prices rallied higher friday on 
the chicago board of trade as the market digested the days bearish 
news and adjusted to the reality of tight supplies grain futures 
advanced modestly 
the surge in soybean futures brought the market off its lowest 
level this year earlier in the day soybeans for delivery in march 
had fallen to 722 a bushel on reports of steadily improving 
growing conditions for the south american soybean crop 
the brazilian government had issued a report on wednesday pegging 
the 198889 brazilian soybean crop at 226 million metric tons an 
increase from the 215 million to 221 million metric tons forecast 
in december 
the improved south american crop prospects have kept the soybean 
market under pressure most of this month but fridays rally 
suggested traders had refocused on the tight supply situation 
created by last summers drought 
everybody lost sight of the major point that there are very few 
beans in the world at this point said cathy leow an analyst with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
at the close wheat was cent lower to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for march delivery at 424 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents higher with march at 269 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
3 cents higher with march at 205 a bushel soybeans were 10 
cents to 20 cents higher with march at 746 a bushel

more than 150000 ford motor co workers will 
receive profitsharing checks of at least 2800 apiece next month 
the secondlargest such payout in company history executives said 
friday 
the amount is 10 times more than the profitsharing payments 
general motors corp employees will receive and nearly four times as 
large as the planned payment to chrysler corp workers 
the ford payments which total 460 million will be split among 
workers represented by the united auto workers union some salaried 
employees and some laidoff and retired workers 
the exact number of workers eligible for the payments and the 
precise amount of money will be set by the time checks are mailed 
march 6 said ford spokesman tom foote 
at gm eligible workers will receive profitsharing checks of 
about 254 while chrysler employees will receive average payments 
of 720 next month 
the profitsharing payments outlined in the companies contracts 
with the uaw are tied to earnings in the big threes us operations 
the chrysler payment announced feb 2 is the first linked to 
corporate profitability and will be sent to about 80000 employees 
chrysler paid its uawrepresented workers about 500 each in lieu of 
profitsharing checks during the last two years 
on tuesday about 470000 gm workers learned they would receive 
profitsharing checks for the first time in three years 
last year ford employees got about 3700 apiece but earnings 
from us operations shrank this year at the nations no 2 
automaker reducing the profitsharing checks 
fords current track record of immense profitability gives the 
company unique opportunities which it should carry out to be used 
to strive for better quality better health and safety and better 
working environmets in the plants uaw vice president stephen 
yokich head of the unions ford department said in a statement 
friday 
dale brickner the associate director of the school of labor and 
industrial relations at michigan state university said it was 
unlikely profit sharing would produce immediate effects on 
automobile production or quality 
in the long term it might he said profitsharing in most 
american firms is a fairly recent kind of innovation what we dont 
know about is very largescale operations or huge corporations like 
gm or ford

from the champs elysees to the japanese 
parliament to hong kongs waterfront stock market authorities 
suddenly are prosecuting securities frauds that had been ignored 
overlooked or condoned for years 
the enforcement campaigns have led to embarrassing scandals in 
france japan hong kong mexico and elsewhere for crimes that range 
from profiteering on inside information to bribery and embezzlement 
to many us securitieslaw specialists an intriguing common 
thread among these crackdowns is their coincidental timing 
some experts believe the highly publicized insider trading 
scandal on wall street has jolted foreign governments into 
scrutinizing sleazy practices in their own backyards 
i think whats been happening in the united states in the last 
five years has caused countries like france and japan to beef up 
enforcement efforts in terms of securities regulation said 
william tyson a legal studies professor at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton business school 
louis loss a harvard law school professor who has been consulted 
by foreign governments in drafting securities regulations said many 
were several decades behind the united states in antifraud 
enforcement and only now were grappling with the severity of 
whitecollar crime 
part of the reason loss speculated is theyve read about the 
financial scandals in our country 
he also said theyre beginning to understand the necessity of at 
least trying to show investors that their markets are fair because 
youre not going to play cards with me if ive got a marked deck 
others said the explosive worldwide expansion of the securities 
industry over the past several years coupled with quantum leaps in 
communication technology that make crossborder trading easy have 
forced many governments to toughen previously lax antifraud laws 
weve seen more scandals because the markets are growing 
said michael mann associate director for international affairs at 
the securities and exchange commissions enforcement division in 
washington 
the bottom line is you can trade in any market now from 
anywhere in the world and get your money to that market to close the 
deal he said 
to be sure insider trading manipulation and other shady market 
practices long deemed illegal in this country remain widespread in 
many parts of the noncommunist world 
in britain stock prices of companies targeted for takeovers 
often rise sharply at least one month before the official public 
announcements of deals although insider trading has been illegal 
since 1980 
in west germany where insider trading is not only tolerated but 
a term for insider doesnt exist in the language stock prices 
regularly rise in advance of improved earnings reports 
switzerland historically a haven for the profits of illegal 
financial dealings because of tough banksecrecy laws only made 
insider trading a crime last july 
in hong kongs freewheeling stock exchange which many trading 
professionals have likened to the dodge city of international 
securities markets conflicts of interest are said to be a way of 
life 
it was the only exchange to shut down for completely for four 
days after the october 1987 crash eight market officials including 
former chairman ronald li were arrested later on charges of taking 
bribes 
things arent much better in mexico city where earlier this 
month prosecutors arrested four top brokers and interrogated dozens 
more in connection with widespread fraud allegations that range from 
insider trading to sale of phony securities almost all of mexicos 
24 registered brokerage houses have been implicated and securities 
regulators have promised tough new rules 
japan home to the biggest stock market modeled its postwar laws 
on securities fraud after those in the united states but rarely 
enforced them one reason said tyson is the japanese never felt 
insider trading was wrong 
a recent japanese move to put teeth in its laws has since led to 
a massive stocktrading scandal thats jolted the countrys 
governing party and created a nationwide debate about business 
ethics 
the scandal involved the sale of thousands of shares of unlisted 
stock by the recruit co to politicians and other prominent people 
at bargain prices the buyers reaped windfalls when the shares were 
publicly traded later 
three cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other seniorlevel 
aides have resigned and there has been speculation about the 
involvement of prime minister noboru takeshita 
an equally serious scandal has been dogging french president 
francois mitterrands government because of an intensified 
securitiesfraud enforcement campaign by the commission des 
operations de bourse frances market regulator 
the commission found evidence of blatant insider trading in the 
stock of the us company triangle industries inc immediately 
before it was taken over by pechiney sa a french metalmaker those 
implicated included businessmen with close ties to mitterrand 
it is unclear why the french commission seized upon the triangle 
takeover as the launchpad for what has become daily frontpage news 
in france but people familiar with the probe have said the french 
were tipped off by their american counterparts at the sec which has 
been attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with france and 
several other countries for policing international market frauds 
to date the sec has only secured cooperation agreements with 
britain japan switzerland three canadian provinces and brazil 
many countries simply ignore sec requests for help in tracking paper 
trails and some have laws that ban foreigners from gaining access 
to any financial records 
mann declined to say whether the sec played a role in the 
trianglepechiney affair but he said the need for international 
cooperation in securities law is one of the most sensitive problems 
faced by the enforcement agency 
from the sec perspective the focus is to try to work out 
arrangements with foreign countries that allow us to properly 
enforce the us securities laws without infringing on the 
sovereignty of those countries he said
