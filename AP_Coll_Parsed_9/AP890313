two men of mideastern appearance were seen in 
the neighborhood of the commander of the uss vincennes in the weeks 
before the navy captains van was destroyed by a bomb a law 
enforcement official said monday 
sharon rogers wife of capt will rogers iii was alone in the van 
when the bomb detonated friday while she drove alone to work she 
got out of the van moments before it caught fire and was not injured 
rogers gave permission last summer to shoot down a plane over the 
persian gulf that was presumed from radar data to be a fighter but 
actually was an iranian civilian passenger jet 
the official who disclosed the information on condition of 
anonymity said it was not clear if investigators had been able to 
piece together detailed descriptions of the two men the information 
was based on interviews with neighbors the official said 
the official spoke after a report in mondays new york times that 
one man of middle eastern appearance had asked passersby where 
does the captain live 
fbi spokesman gary laturno said he could neither confirm nor deny 
the report 
investigators however were beginning to move away from their 
suspicions that the bombing was directed from abroad by 
international terrorists the times reported in tuesday editions 
sources told the associated press that based on intelligence 
information and initial reports from investigators the explosive 
device was believed to be very crude and not of the quality that 
would be expected from prominent iraniansupported terrorist groups 
last week oliver buck revell a top fbi official testified 
before congress about the potential terrorist threat posed by 
iranian students in the united states he cited the san diego region 
as one area where there was a high number of students 
but the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity cautioned 
against drawing the inference that students were behind the rogers 
bombing 
the fbi said it was chasing hundreds of leads as it tried to 
determine if the bombing was a terrorist act in retaliation for the 
shooting down of the airliner all 290 people aboard the airliner 
were killed 
there has been no claim of responsibility for the bombing 
rogers and his wife remained at an undisclosed location monday 
under the protection of naval investigative service agents 
officials at the school where mrs rogers teaches said they do not 
expect her to return to work this week 
the fbi which is coordinating the investigation has made a 
public appeal asking for calls from anyone who may have seen 
something suspicious before during or after the blast 
the fbi has described the bomb as an improvised explosive 
device rather than a manufactured military device types of such 
devices include pipe bombs 
investigators with the san diego fire department and the metro 
arson strike team concluded on the day of the blast that the 
explosion was caused by a pipe bomb the fbi then assumed primary 
jurisdiction of the investigation 
meanwhile navy officials said monday that enhanced security at 
navy installations in the san diego area would remain in effect 
until the fbi concludes its investigation of the bombing 
theres been no change in our security posture since it was 
increased friday said chief petty officer craig huebler a 
spokesman at the san diego naval base therell be no change until 
the fbi can complete its work and report back on what we are dealing 
with

a company which operates adult bookstores 
across the street from fbi headquarters pleaded guilty monday to 
federal racketeering charges ending a twoyear investigation the 
justice department said 
fbi agents entered the stores and found videotapes with titles 
such as tracis big trick his to command and bound and 
punished according to court documents 
the plea agreement was outlined in us district court 
the agreement provides that the two stores directly across the 
street from the j edgar hoover building will be closed immediately 
while two others located just down the street will be shut down 
later 
the case is the first obscenity prosecution in the federal court 
in the district in 26 years and is only the second time the federal 
racketeering law was used in an obscenity case since congress placed 
obscenity violations under that law in 1984 according to assistant 
attorney general sg dennis jr 
automatic enterprises inc the owner of the bookstores was 
fined 150000 as part of the settlement

presidents bushs backers have been eager to 
point to his administrations new plan for easing the third world 
debt crisis as evidence to counter his new teams goslow image 
yet despite such promotion the white house has yet to announce 
that the president himself has given final approval to the plan 
asked about the presidents involvement in the debt plan white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that bush has not 
made final judgments on changes in the policy 
recent debtrelated riots in venezuela that claimed 300 lives 
have increased pressure for a new approach to the 410 billion in 
debt run up by that country and other strategically key latin 
american nations including mexico and brazil 
belttightening attempts by nations strapped with the 
international debt have forced governments to cut salaries and 
subsidies in many cases leading to sharply reduced standards of 
living 
the bush administration plan introduced on friday by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady has received generally favorable reviews 
both at home and abroad it moves from past policy by urging 
commercial banks to forgive part of the stifling debt owed by third 
world nations the reagan administration had favored new lending 
instead of debt forgiveness 
rep james leach of iowa a republican member of the house 
banking and foreign affairs committees said the proposal makes 
mincemeat of the gossip of the week that the administration has no 
guiding vision 
the fact of the matter is that our new president has inherited 
a rather barren plate from his predecessor leach said a 
domestic and international financial crisis has been in the making 
for some time it has fallen on the bush administration to act 
leach also cited the administrations savings and loan rescue 
plan as evidence that bush is moving swiftly on financial matters 
but caution remained the watchword at the white house where 
fitzwater said the president has not made any final judgments 
he said it is proper for such ideas first to be discussed in 
speeches and so forth by the various agencies and administrators 
another white house official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said over the weekend that fitzwaters comments still stood 
its true it hasnt gone formally to the president but that 
doesnt mean he isnt backing brady all the way the ideas brady 
discussed are definitely the way the administration is going 
since all the ribbons and the bows hadnt been tied by all of 
the bureaucrats involved bushs name wasnt formally placed on the 
plan the official said

some senior federal judges think the taxpayers 
are getting a bargain from the semiretired jurists even though 
dozens accept pay raises after they stop all judicial work 
but other senior judges are concerned even angry that 
colleagues take pay boosts without working a third group is 
satisfied with current pay levels for semiretired judges but 
believes that younger fulltime judges deserve more money 
an associated press survey conducted in february and march of 
the nations 277 senior federal judges found that 48 or 17 percent 
no longer do any judicial work nevertheless they remain eligible 
and in most cases eager for any pay raises granted to active 
judges the survey was undertaken because the government refuses to 
release its own data on the workload of individual senior judges 
the ap found most judges reduce their workload when they take 
senior status many give up criminal cases some drop complicated 
civil cases nevertheless they handle 10 to 15 percent of the total 
federal court workload which is considered a godsend by their 750 
active colleagues 
you cant make a judge work if he doesnt want to work said 
bailey aldrich at age 81 a working senior appeals court judge in 
massachusetts 
i wrote a letter to a congressman that getting the senior judge 
a raise even though he wasnt working anymore was a small price to 
pay to get rid of active judges who are old 
congress created senior status in 1919 to encourage older judges 
with life appointments to step aside for younger replacements 
federal judges of a certain age and experience may take senior 
status which allows them to decide how much work they do 
those who instead choose full retirement through resignation keep 
for life the same salary they had on their last day of work there 
are only 13 of these 
in february senior judges and their active colleagues were 
denied a 50 percent pay raise when congress rejected increases for 
top officials across the government 
two new bills in congress would add 20 to 30 percent to judicial 
salaries trial judges are paid 89500 a year and appellate judges 
earn more up to 115000 for the chief justice 
the ap survey found no senior judge who has stopped hearing cases 
and was willing to forgo any pay raise ronald davies an 
84yearold senior trial judge in north dakota was typical of most 
who addressed the issue 
im a senior judge and i get paid whether i work or not i felt 
it the raise congress rejected was long overdue davies who 
took senior status in 1971 and stopped hearing cases altogether six 
months ago planned to accept that raise 
but some stillworking senior judges felt differently 
if you dont want to do the work retire and get out said 
raymond j pettine a 76yearold trial judge in rhode island who 
has maintained a full caseload since taking senior status in 1982 
i think there probably should be some requirement that they 
work to a certain extent said john minor wisdom a fabled new 
orleans judge who at 83 worked on appeals courts in four states last 
year 
john t elfvin 71 a senior trial judge in buffalo ny who 
handles about 66 percent of a normal caseload said there ought 
to be a look taken at individual situations at some point a judge 
should be cut off from getting senior status 
other senior judges endorsed raises for active judges to attract 
qualified younger lawyers in an era of soaring salaries for private 
attorneys but were content with their own salaries 
the job is worth the money the 135000 which congress 
rejected for an active judge said eugene r gordon a senior 
trial judge in north carolina who at 71 carries a 50 percent 
workload for what youre paying me on senior status 89500 
its fine but we are going to have to raise the salaries to attract 
good people 
the ap reported in january that a previously undisclosed 1987 
federal court study showed 20 percent of senior judges did no 
judicial work that study tracked trials and cases completed during 
12 months but identified the judges only by code number 
the ap survey which found that 17 percent do no judicial work 
unlike the 1987 study gave judges credit for dormant but 
unresolved cases even though they have not required recent judicial 
action 
the nonworking senior judges include such famous figures as 
retired chief justice warren e burger and watergate trial judge 
john j sirica 
of the 48 sirica and 19 others suffer from serious health 
problems that either limit or preclude continued judicial work 
others devote their energies to pursuits away from the 
courthouse ranging from managing their investments to serving full 
time on public commissions like burger who heads the bicentennial 
celebrations for the constitution and bill of rights 
but there are senior judges who stay with court work or try to 
despite enormous obstacles 
in north carolina 75yearold senior trial judge woodrow jones 
maintained a 75 percent caseload until his larynx was removed last 
october unable to speak he still works on petitions and motions 
that can be handled with written orders 
in baltimore 88yearold former chief trial judge roszel c 
thomsen was forced by failing hearing to give up cases but he comes 
to the courthouse every day to serve as consultant or researcher for 
other judges 
the mixed feelings about pay raises were summed up by frank m 
coffin an appeals court judge in portland me who took senior 
status last month 
at age 88 they become sick and they cant judge any more are 
they to be deprived at the end of their life of a small increment 
that is probably the only thing that can be added to their estate 
thats the most sympathetic case coffin said 
the least sympathetic case is the senior judge who at a very 
early age decides not to hear cases and takes senior status i would 
not object to taking a hard look at that situation

senate members are in the position of two 
brothers who badly bruised after an unwanted fight need to put the 
past behind them and get on with life 
the angry intensity of the fight that scuttled john towers 
nomination as secretary of defense wont make that easy 
but president bushs quick decision on friday to nominate rep 
richard cheney rwyo a former white house chief of staff and the 
no 2 republican leader in the house may start the process of 
calming the senates turbulent political waters 
bush acted only 24 hours after the senate voted 5347 to reject 
tower his choice of cheney received favorable reviews from members 
of both parties and quick hearings were promised by the senate armed 
services committee 
senate republican leader bob dole who had said the tower defeat 
would not be forgotten by the gop retained an edge of bitterness 
this will be a confirmation not an execution he said of the 
cheney nomination 
but he soon was looking as much forward as back 
i believe this will help to put all of the tower business 
behind us dole said 
what does the senate have to put behind it 
here are some of the words that jolted the chambers stately 
marblewalled facade and its oldboyclub traditions of courtesy 
comity and civility 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo i have to rage at a senate that 
has lost its sense of responsibility its sense of fairness a 
senate which will never willingly shoulder responsibility 
the nomination process is now a tool of intrigue of arrogance 
and of raw political power 
we have no need of smoking guns to ruin a mans career anymore 
just enough smoke to cover the vicious partisan intentions of those 
who would seek to run the executive branch from capitol hill 
this has been a confirmation process corrupted contaminated 
hijacked by character assassination by the cowardly leakage of 
unsubstantiated allegations 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn there are very strong feelings 
on this side of the aisle that we have been had it is going to 
be hard to put the pieces back together it will not be automatic 
we feel abused and hurt 
but some republicans such as sen john warner of virginia say 
they already feel a spirit of reconciliation creeping over this 
place 
many democrats hastened to speed reconciliation along help 
restore the senates normal courtliness and rekindle the fragile 
bipartisan flame that was at least temporarily snuffed out in the 
storm over tower 
but democrats also were upset at the fierceness of the battle 
over tower 
charges and countercharges of partisanship hypocrisy and bad 
faith are being hurled from the white house to capitol hill and back 
again said sen patrick leahy dvt the debate in the senate 
has been as personal and acrimonious as i have seen in my 14 years 
here 
but leahy added while things may get worse before they get 
better i am confident they will get better 
sen robert c byrd dwva the chambers most senior democrat 
said the harsh words should stop 
we must not rub salt into the wounds that have been opened let 
us act like adults not like warring children in a sandlot football 
game he said 
towers problems in the senate stemmed from allegations in a 
massive fbi report that he abused alcohol had improper relations 
with women and had lucrative links to giant defense contractors that 
posed the appearance of conflict of interest 
after bush announced the selection of cheney as a replacement 
candidate wallop was asked the inevitable questions about the new 
nominees personal life 
he made it clear that in cheneys case another bruising fight 
over personal matters is unlikely 
a smart straight arrow wallop said of his homestate friend 
i do not know what possible skeletons could exist in that 
closet

in richard cheney president bush has found a 
nominee for defense secretary whose personal and political finances 
show little contact with the defense industry 
unlike john tower who was rejected by the senate in part because 
of his lucrative links to military contractors cheney has found 
favor with dentists insurance companies farm groups and energy 
companies 
and although the wyoming republican has been paid better than 
most of his house colleagues for giving speeches raising a total of 
81350 in 1987 he gave 59000 of that to charity according to 
his most recent financial disclosure forms 
that was more than he had to give away to meet house limits and 
none of the money had come from the defense industry 
over the last five years cheney has raised more money through 
speaking fees 266875 than even house republican leader robert 
michel who got 250888 according to a study by common cause he 
kept 107937 of that 
cheneys disclosure forms show that he is financially comfortable 
but is not rich by congressional standards 
in 1987 he earned between 226333 and 290833 and had assets 
worth between 200000 and 530000 he had less than 50000 in 
debts 
cheney depended on special interests to pay for about a third of 
his last reelection campaign which cost some 292000 a 
relatively small amount for congressional races 
while much of his campaign money came from energy insurance and 
farming interests cheney did raise more than 13000 from defense 
contractors however all but one of those defense interests gave 
far less than the legal limit according to records filed with the 
federal election commission 
that one company fmc corp gave cheney the 5000 legal limit 
through its political action committee 
other defense contractors contributing to his 1988 campaign 
included lockheed corp and martin marietta corp which each 
donated 1500 and trw inc and united technologies corp which 
each contributed 1000

pushed by hunger civil wars and 
unemployment thousands of central american refugees are working 
their way through mexico on an often dangerous trek to what they 
hope will be a better life in the united states 
its like a trail of ants one mexican official said of the 
central americans flooding across mexicos southern border 
mexican officials estimate that at any given moment at least 
10000 cental americans are in mexico many of them heading toward 
brownsville texas the closest point in the united states to 
central america 
oscar mauricio torres sosa legal adviser to el salvadors 
migration department said at least 550000 to 600000 people over 
10 percent of the population have left the country during its 
9yearold civil war the vast majority for the united states 
all types of people are leaving from all social levels 
torres said 
as many as 100000 central americans may enter or try to enter 
the united states this year us immigration officials say 
many of the refugees say they are persecuted in their homelands 
by death squads the army or guerrilla groups many take buses 
through other central american nations and arrive in tapachula in 
the southernmost state of chiapas 
on the 1100mile trail north to matamoros the refugees 
encounter extortion from officials and bus drivers then find 
themselves cheated or stripped by smugglers who offer to take them 
past newly reinforced us border patrols in the 
matamorosbrownsville region 
cirse amador 22 a nicaraguan said her group of six paid a bus 
driver 65 to get past checkpoints in mexico after they got to 
matamoros she said they took us all off the bus they asked for 
50 apiece and since we didnt have dollars they took 50000 
pesos or 21 she said 
once inside the united states the refugees face arrest by the 
us immigration and naturalization service which is jailing and 
deporting those who cant prove political persecution 
nevertheless thousands are determined to get through 
one day ill get there i dont know when but ill do it 
said 28yearold eduardo lopez lozano a mechanic and repairman from 
relatively peaceful tegucigalpa honduras 
life has been hard for me and has taught me to do everything 
and this will help me in the united states lopez told the 
associated press 
mexican officials in tapachula complain that central americans 
take jobs from mexicans dont pay taxes on their businesses and 
commit crimes 
they would not however discuss the problem in detail and spoke 
only on condition of anonymity 
our worry is the same as in the united states what do we do 
with them here we have an economic recession declared one 
official mexico is already struggling to provide jobs for one 
million new workers annually 
for most central americans there is no way to legally migrate to 
the united states unless they fall into a preference group either 
by family relations or special skills or by luck via an annual 
lottery 
for many requesting political asylum had been the only legal way 
in but at the us border a suddenly toughened us policy has 
changed the pattern 
many are waiting at the border for another chance others are 
seeking to cross illegally with coyotes or peoplesmugglers as 
many mexicans do still others are looking for softer points along

a year and constitute guatemalas largest single source of foreign

prosecutors are preparing to try their 
first case in the defense department purchasing scandal this month 
nearly three years after they began the coasttocoast investigation 
already a defense contracting firm hazeltine corp of 
greenlawn ny a former top executive of unisys corp a former 
procurement officer with the marine corps and seven other defense 
industry figures have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges 
us attorney henry hudson of the eastern district of virginia 
who is directing the wideranging case said he is pleased with the 
progress of the investigation of the 150 billion pentagon 
procurement system 
hudson said those pleading guilty have agreed to cooperate in the 
operation ill wind investigation that burst into public last 
june when fbi agents raided 44 locations around the country 
court documents indicate investigators relied on evidence 
obtained from telephone wire taps to obtain search warrants 
were moving along at a good pace hudson said last week 
after a key figure in the case charles f gardner a former general 
manager of a unisys division on long island ny pleaded guilty to 
bribing a former highranking navy official melvyn paisley 
paisley the former assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems has not been charged with any wrongdoing 
now a private consultant he has denied through his attorneys 
that he knew anything about gardners bribe which the government 
said was in the form of buying paisleys condominium in sun valley 
idaho in august 1986 for an inflated price 
hudson refused to say if he expects more indictments but defense 
attorneys say a federal grand jury is still hearing evidence 
only one government official jack a sherman formerly a 
procurement officer with the marine corps has admitted taking 
bribes he acknowledged that he accepted 43000 from consultants in 
exchange for confidential information about the competitive bidding 
process 
the government did not name the consultants sherman who faces 
up to 20 years in prison and a 500000 fine is to be sentenced on 
april 7 
hudson also declined to answer any questions about whether the 
case could encompass members of congress their campaigns or their 
staffs 
gardner for example admitted that he caused 1000 illegal 
corporate contributions to be laundered to the campaigns of rep roy 
dyson dmd and former rep william chappell dfla 
hudson however said neither congressman knew the contributions 
were illicit 
the labyrinthian case involves charges that defense firms or 
their employees hired private consultants who bribed pentagon 
officials for information needed to win multimilliondollar 
contracts often the small network of consultants consisted of 
former pentagon officials who maintained contacts with people inside 
the defense department 
in the first trial scheduled to start march 27 in us district 
court prosecutors will attempt to prove that teledyne electronics 
of newbury park calif and three of its employees paid a private 
consultant william parkin to obtain details about a 100 million 
navy radar contract 
parkin is accused of paying another consultant fred lackner of 
woodland hills calif who in turn gave money to stuart berlin a 
onetime navy procurement specialist prosecutors say 
all the defendants have pleaded innocent to the charges which 
are contained in an indictment unsealed on jan 6 
my position on behalf of my client is that when all of the 
evidence is produced we are confident the jury will find bill 
parkin committed no crime whatsoever said gerard treanor 
parkins attorney 
when he receives the governments witness list next week treanor 
said he will find out if some of the people who have pleaded guilty 
will testify against his client 
parkin worked with a number of defense contractors including 
unisys hazeltine northrup and teledyne electronics parkin also 
knew gardner the former unisys executive and paisley treanor said 
at the pentagon meanwhile the case has touched off another 
review of ways to overhaul the procurement system defense officials 
have suspended or fired government employees identified in the ill 
wind investigation suspended a number of companies and 
consultants from doing any government work and required a number of 
contractors to swear in writing they have not received any bidding 
based on inside information 
some of the companies also have launched internal reviews of 
their practices unisys a computer company that was formerly the 
sperry corp examined its practices to ensure they were legal 
hazeltine has done the same thing company officials say both 
companies say they have cooperated with the government in the 
investigation

profits from illegal cocaine sales are so vast 
these days that government agents measure drug dollars by weight and 
cocaine dealers in a scramble to launder the bulky cash have even 
gone so far as to buy banks 
the cocaine organizations are generating a horrendous amount of 
cash said us attorney robert bonner 
if they cant convert this cash and get it out of the united 
states the whole point of the illegal drug operation is frustrated 
most people dont realize the physical space and weight taken 
up by cash proceeds until it is counted we are measuring this 
money in weight 1 million in cash is well over 100 pounds of 
currency 
so drug dealers devise ingenious schemes to get money out of the 
country the arrests of 37 jewelers and their employees has exposed 
what authorities say was a clever new mechanism using bogus gold 
transactions to hide drug profits 
in recent years bonners office has prosecuted moneylaundering 
rings that went so far as to buy their own banks but nothing has 
matched the scope of the ring broken by the federal operation 
polar cap which allegedly involved whole families as defendants 
and more money than any case before it 
the case broke open feb 22 as federal agents searched 85 
locations in los angeles new york and miami and us marshals swept 
into los angeles wholesale jewelry mart arresting proprietors of a 
dozen jewelry and bullion outlets 
jewelers allegedly laundered more than 1 billion in just over 
two years 
a federal grand jury here indicted 33 jewelers and associates 
wednesday four other defendants were indicted in san jose the 
previous week 
authorities also confiscated 80 million in property including 
jewelry 12 million in gold 674 million in cash a condominium 
apartment complex five houses and a 10story building in the center 
of the downtown mart 
this investigation certainly will pay for itself bonner said 
at a news conference announcing the indictments 
according to court documents the moneylaundering operation was 
run primarily from ropex corp owned by wanis joseph 
koyomejian and andonian brothers manufacturing co owned by vahe 
and nazareth andonian one defendant raul vivas is in custody in 
uruguay from where he allegedly ran the ring 
the defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of 
thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering hundreds of milllions 
of dollars in cash from drug sales across the country they also 
were charged with conspiring to violate the money laundering control 
act and to avoid reporting currency transactions over 10000 as 
required by law 
the maximum sentence for conspiracy is life imprisonment the 
maximum for money laundering is 20 years in prison and fines up to 
25 million 
most of the defendants are different from any arrested in the 
past instead of colombian nationals deep into the drug trade they 
are of armenian syrian turkish and lebanese extraction emigres 
who seemed to have grabbed a piece of the american dream with their 
thriving gold and jewelry businesses 
the defendants through their lawyers have declared their 
innocence 
government officials wont comment in depth on polar cap but 
some 300 pages of affidavits show their view of how the gold and 
jewelry trade became a nearly perfect cover after the 1986 arrests 
of major moneylaunderers 
according to affidavits heres how one goldrelated transaction 
worked 
on dec 12 1988 nine boxes of cash 2568000 were shipped 
from zampg gold in new york by armored car to andonian brothers api 
subsidiary in los angeles where it was counted and phone calls were 
made confirming the amount 
the next day nazareth andonian ordered 177 kilograms of gold 
credited to a gold brokerage account of ronel refining of hollywood 
fla a gold refining company and deposited the 2568000 in a los 
angeles bank 
he later wiretransferred 2491152 to ronel keeping 76848 as 
apis 3 percent commission for laundering ronel owner richard 
ferris used the money to pay for the gold keeping a 4 percent 
commission at that point according to an affidavit ronel is 
positioned to repeatedly sell the same gold to apila via various 
gold brokers 
cash was delivered daily by drug couriers to about a dozen 
jewelry stores in new york and los angeles then transported to api 
or ropex for counting and deposit under the guise of gold sales the 
government said millions then were transferred to banks in panama 
and uruguay for delivery to colombia as payment for cocaine that had 
been shipped on consignment to the united states 
the amount represents proceeds of approximately 70 tons of 
cocaine sold in the united states in two years bonner said 
the scheme worked without detection until early last year when 
incidents on two continents led federal agents to begin 
surveillance including wiretaps bugs hidden cameras and secret 
trash collections in several us cities 
everything began to unravel in january 1988 when wells fargo bank 
reported abi was making extraordinarily large deposits of us 
currency into specific accounts in one threemonth period 25 
million had been deposited 
drug enforcement administration agent michael orton said in an 
affidavit that the government learned from a new york cocaine dealer 
that drug proceeds were being delivered to an api office there for 
laundering 
then an agent working in montevideo uruguay learned from a 
cocaine dealer of a money laundering operation in los angeles 
miami and new york that was initiated in april 1986 by panamanian 
and colombian drug traffickers he described the money laundering 
operation as utilizing bogus gold shipments and transactions to 
conceal the laundering orton said 
the source named two latin american partners in the scheme but 
it wasnt until last september that multiple informants apparently 
seeking leniency in their own cases began spilling details of the 
operation naming the principals and pinpointing its center in the 
los angeles jewelry district 
at one point 23 dea and fbi agents were intercepting calls to 
andonian brothers and ropex they heard apparently coded talk of 
large amounts of money and saw deliveries of duffle bags boxes and 
catalog cases filled with money 
the currency would be piled on tables sometimes to the ceiling 
said a prosecutor and it would be counted by highspeed counting 
machines 
gathering evidence became complicated when api began using a 
paper shredder to destroy documents and black spray paint to 
obliterate the return addresses on packages delivered to the 
company orton said he found a chemical solvent which dissolved the 
paint and revealed the address of a jewelry company in new york 
which allegedly was shipping money to be laundered 
according to bonner increasing seizures of money and cocaine in 
los angeles indicate that it has supplanted miami as the nations 
cocaine capital as mexican and colombian cartels join forces to ship 
drugs from mexico 
weve had a definite shift of cocaine coming across the mexican 
border rather than being shipped in from florida he said the 
result is that los angeles now has become the major distribution 
point for cocaine

sales of big fourwheeldrive tractors the 
kind that go for as much as a quartersection of land in some parts 
rebounded sharply in 1988 and are expected to show further gains 
this year 
preliminary estimates by the agriculture department show that 
2729 of the big tractors were sold last year up 65 percent from 
just 1653 in 1987 the gain may be around 14 percent in 1989 to 
about 3100 units says the departments economic research service 
but the gains still leave sales of the big machines far short of 
the more than 10000 a year purchased in the late 1970s just before 
heavy debts falling commodity prices and other problems put a 
financial crunch on the nations farm economy 
the fourwheeldrive models are not the only tractors or machines 
that figure into todays huge agricultural investment but they are 
one of the barometers and their costs are formidable as of last 
october according to usda surveys the tractors cost an average of 
76800 each 
a few other machines cost more however large grain combines 
averaged 91600 each last fall and selfpropelled cotton pickers 
were 84800 each comparatively farmland nationally averaged only 
548 per acre a year ago 
the usda agency says in a new report that total farm machinery 
expenditures gained in 1987 after seven consecutive years of 
decline overall it said farmers spent 577 billion on machinery 
in 1987 up from 461 billion in 1986 
preliminary estimates put 1988 expenditures in a range of 59 
billion to 65 billion and the forecast for 1989 calls for a 
further increase to 64 billion to 71 billion 
machinery sales rose to a record of almost 12 billion in 1979 
before beginning a slide of more than 60 percent to the 461 
billion of 1986 now with farmland prices rising and credit more 
easily available farmers are looking harder at machinery 
the drought improved farm equity and the increasing age of the 
farm machinery stock will likely have a significant influence on 
1989 farm machinery sales prospects the report said a 
continuing rise in land prices not only improves farm equity but 
indicates an optimism on the future profitability of agriculture 
most new farm machinery sales were up last year although the 
drought and its shriveling of grain yields probably caused the 16 
percen fall in sales of selfpropelled combine units which 
dropped to 5995 from 7172 in 1987 the report said sales this 
year could rise to 7300 units 
farm machinery sales in the latter half of 1988 slipped as the 
extent of the drought became apparent the report said farmers 
who saw yields declining delayed purchases of tractors combines and 
other equipment 
however those farmers who did raise crops or had large 
quantities stored from previous harvests saw commodity prices climb 
thus many of these found it advantageous to replace or upgrade 
their equipment 
although the growth in sales continues to be good news for farm 
machinery manufacturers there is still significant room for 
improvement the report said within most machine categories 
1989 sales will likely approach only onethird of their 197880 
average

a pellet made mostly from bagasse the crushed 
stalks that remain after sugar cane is processed shows possibility 
as a feed base for smallscale shrimp producers according to 
agriculture department scientists 
donald w freeman who works for the departments agricultural 
research service at the ab mckay food laboratory in mississippi 
said the canebased food might make it easier and cheaper to grow 
shrimp in hawaii and other tropical areas 
tests in hawaii showed that the shrimp not only ate the bagasse 
pellets which are fortified with inexpensive forms of protein 
fats and minerals but also the bacteria algae and microscopic 
zooplankton that feed on the pellets 
feed costs are one of the shrimp farmers biggest costs the 
bagasse is cheap and plentiful in hawaii a major sugar cane 
production area and the experimental pellets cost only about 100 a 
ton compared with 300 to 450 for commercial feeds 
growth of the bagassefed shrimp was said to be comparable to 
those grown in ponds and provided the regular feed 
the report said that 76 percent of the shrimp consumed by 
americans in 1987 765 million pounds valued at least 12 billion 
wholesale was imported 
freeman said smallscale fish farmers in hawaii the virgin 
islands puerto rico and other tropical areas might be able to raise 
shrimp economically by feeding bagasse pellets 
dried feedlot manure also works well as a source of nutrients for 
pond microorganisms which the shrimp eat and costs about the same 
as the bagasse pellets but freeman said manure has image 
problems 
the bagasse pellets arent intended for highyielding intensive 
fish farming where most of the nutritious microorganisms arent 
allowed to grow he said in the highly intensive pond operations 
shrimp must have better quality feed to make up for nutrients that 
the microorganisms would provide

at 353 billion while rebounding modestly exports still are well 
below the record levels of the early 1980s 
meanwhile imports of agricultural products are at record value 
levels totaling 21 billion in the fiscal year that ended last 
sept 30 says the departments foreign agricultural service 
the topvalued group of imports was horticultural products 
fruits nuts and vegetables worth about 37 billion beef and 
pork imports were next at 27 billion closely followed by

the government has just published a booklet 
establishing that one mans flounder is another mans eyed platefish 
it establishes too that some folks who give fish their ordinary 
names their street names you might say would not make it in the 
public relations business 
not as long as they insist on applying the name longnosed 
pigfaced bream to a fish thats marketed under the noble name 
emperor 
and not if they insist on calling the grunt the brown sweetlips 
or calling the anchovy the smig or the grenadier the rattail 
just off the governments presses is the fish list fda guide 
to acceptable market names for food fish sold in interstate 
commerce 
it is a compilation of the market names that the government 
accepts for imported and domestically available fish sold for human 
consumption 
the booklet was published jointly by the food and drug 
administration and the commerce departments national marine 
fisheries service chiefly to help the industry comply with the law 
that requires that a species of fish be marketed under a consistent 
national name no matter what the locals might call it 
take rockfish 
people in the midatlantic area call striped bass rockfish 
said mary snyder assistant to the director of the division of 
regulatory guidance at the fda one of the compilers of the fish 
list 
to the rest of the country the rockfish is a completely 
different fish she said it is related to ocean perch which is 
a rough looking fish squatty and with rough scales and spinny 
fins what we here in the washington area call a rockfish is 
cigarshaped has stripes and is very different 
labeling fish uniformly is important because laissez faire naming 
can lead to deception about a month ago the government seized 
45672 pounds of frozen fish fillets imported from new zealand they 
arrived labeled orange roughy a tasty expensive fish when in fact 
they were merely the smooth oreo dory a cheaper fish 
the government gives fishmongers a choice they can sell fish 
under the governmentassigned market name or under the common name 
often an english translation of the scientific name given fish by 
ichthyologists 
thus what some people call the boston mackerel and others call 
the caballa but which has the scientific name scomber scombrus can 
be sold simply as mackerel its governmentapproved market name or 
as atlantic mackerel its scienceaccepted common name 
the fish list was published because fish dealers who called 
the government to raise fish name questions sometimes got 
inconsistent answers 
the book lists 24 species of croaker 38 of snapper 18 of eel 
62 of rockfish 31 of grouper 15 of grunt 21 of anchovy 34 of 
shark and 21 of mackerel some of which may also be sold as jack 
mackerel chub mackerel king mackerel snake mackerel or as 
japanese scad inca scad or rough scad 
when consumers buys anchovy they may be getting anchoa mitchill 
common scientific name bay anchovy one time engraulis mordax 
northern anchovy another time and anchoa compressa deepbody 
anchovy a third time 
no matter said mrs snyder they can all be sold as just plain 
anchovy because they are so similar in taste and appearance that the 
consumer wouldnt know the difference only another anchovy could 
tell for sure 
the fish list lists only fish used by people as food not 
pets no guppies included no goldfish either even though college 
students once had the custom of eating them whole raw live and wet

a device that appeared to be a pipe bomb 
was planted behind an iranian restaurant sunday forcing authorities 
to evacuate the area before explosives experts determined it was a 
fake police said 
no arrests were made in the case authorities said police sgt 
tim brown speculated that it may have been in response to fridays 
bombing of a van being driven by the wife of the navy captain who 
mistakenly shot down an iranian airliner over the persian gulf 
there were no threats and no prior problems of any kind but 
with all the media attention from the san diego bombing a lot of 
people might have been upset brown said 
the replica pipe bomb was discovered by a teenage employee of a 
neighboring business behind the dehkadeh restaurant about 11 am 
the sergeant said he said the phony device was fitted with a wire 
inside likely to make it appear realistic when xrayed 
about five nearby homes and the occupants of about 10 businesses 
were evacuated for several hours 
the restaurant was about to open for lunch when the pipe was 
found manager saeed bashizadeh said 
we hope it wasnt because of the bomb in san diego because we 
are here now and dont want any trouble bashizadeh said

along some jewelry insignias and other small items for several nasa 
workers who never get the chance to fly on a shuttle 
hes hoping to have more time to observe the earths surface from 
his lofty perch than on his first flight when the crew had to shift 
the shuttle away from the earth during part of the mission to melt 
the ice 
you really do get this feeling looking at the earth of how

conciliatory measures if that country shows it is serious about 
holding fair elections next year according to us officials 
under such circumstances the administration also would be 
prepared to upgrade diplomatic relations with nicaragua including 
the exchange of ambassadors the officials said the two countries 
have not been represented at the level of ambassador in each others 
capital since last july 
the list of possible gestures toward the sandinista government 
numbers about 20 according to the officials who asked not to be 
identified 
alternatively the administration has prepared a potential list 
of punitive measures of similar length if nicaraguan opposition 
forces are not given what us officials perceive to be an equal 
chance in the balloting which probably will be held next february 
these steps include the tightening of the fouryearold trade 
embargo against nicaragua and applying pressure on aid donors such 
as japan and west european countries to withhold assistance from 
nicaragua 
secretary of state james a baker iii has alluded to the new 
approach in general terms saying a carrot and stick policy has 
the best chance of winning support from congress and achieving a 
democratic outcome in nicaragua 
as part of the process of national reconciliation which other 
central american countries have been encouraging in nicaragua the 
sandinistas announced on friday they will pardon 1894 members of 
the military force which had served the rightist prerevolutionary 
regime a decade ago 
the pardon will apply to all but 39 members of that force 
nicaraguan officials said 
over the short term the new administrations approach to 
nicaragua is likely to undergo its stiffest challenge on the same 
issue that bedeviled president reagan during much of his eight years 
in office the contra rebels 
more than 10000 contras are assembled in camps in honduras near 
the nicaragua border surviving on a usfinanced humanitarian aid 
program 
the bush administration wants the contras to continue on as a 
unified force to keep pressure on the sandinistas but according to 
congressional sources democratic lawmakers are eager to see the 
rebels demobilized contending that their continued existence will 
only make the sandinistas less willing to make concessions during 
the coming electoral process 
the democrats argue that the dismantling of the contras is 
entirely consistent with the spirit of the central american summit 
meeting last month in el salvador which called unanimously for the 
breakup of the contras in exchange for the creation of an open 
system in nicaragua 
as the administration sees it demobilization of the contras 
would only increase the possibility of sandinista footdragging in 
carrying out democratic reforms baker strongly supports maintaining 
the contras at least as a potential fighting force 
the conflicting points of view most likely will come to a head 
later this month when congress decides whether to extend 
humanitarian assistance for the contras the current package expires 
on march 31 
the size of the request has not been decided but congressional 
democrats are expected to favor an aid program that emphasizes 
resettlement of the contras outside of honduras in effect ending 
their role as the administrations chief asset in the region 
but administration officials believe the contras if they are 
allowed to continue on as a cohesive unit can still play a useful 
psychological role in encouraging democracy in nicaragua even though 
they have received no us military aid for more than a year and 
none is expected for the foreseeable future

salvadorans for the first time 
in their history have the chance to keep one party in power or 
replace it with a completely different partys program and ideology 
the choice to be made sunday is between presidential candidates 
of the incumbent christian democratic party and rightist republican 
nationalist alliance or arena five other parties are running 
candidates but acknowledge they have no chance of winning 
that there is a choice at all along with prospects of a 
constitutional transfer of power demonstrates how far this nation 
has progressed toward democracy 
but security forces and rightwing death squads continue to 
summarily execute suspected leftists the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front terrorizes elected officials and a brutal 
civil war that has left 70000 dead drags on 
whatever the outcome the term of president jose napoleon duarte 
a linchpin of us policy in the region ends june 1 the 
constitution forbids reelection and duarte is dying of cancer 
duartes great legacy is this election and this transition 
said a senior us diplomat its ironic that his enemies arena 
are the ultimate beneficiaries of duarte and the democratic 
conditions he created 
washingtons role in el salvador cannot be underestimated the 
country receives 500 million in aid every year almost as much as 
it collects in taxes 
arena favors a smaller state role in the economy and is 
considered less open to negotiations to end the war one of its 
slogans is a militaristic win the peace 
the question in many minds remains has progress toward 
democratic government been great enough to prevent the country 
sliding into chaos 
arena trounced the incumbents in last years legislative and 
municipal elections and is favored to win though a runoff probably 
will be necessary 
independent polls give arena candidate alfredo cristiani a lead 
of three to nine percentage points over christian democratic fidel 
chavez mena 
arena founded by rightwingers linked by many to death squads 
says it has changed its campaign refrain is vamos al cambio 
meaning lets change but many fear an arena victory will bring 
more violence and intensify the war 
arenas antecedents make us worry about the prospect of their 
victory violence will undoubtedly increase gregorio rosa 
chavez auxiliary roman catholic archbishop of san salvador said in 
a recent homily 
the rightists count on pervasive dissatisfaction with the 
christian democrats who have failed to bring peace 
no independent poll gives arena the 51 percent necessary for 
victory in the first round polling is complicated by the war 
people who fear revealing their preference and the possibility of 
coalitions in a second round which would be held in late april 
us pollsters greenberglake in a survey released last month 
said 27 percent of those consulted intend to vote for arena 
eighteen percent said they will vote for the christian democrats 
while nearly 40 percent were unwilling to divulge their preference 
or were undecided 
in the most telling element of the survey 58 percent said they 
believe the christian democrats do not deserve reelection 
the people want alternation in government alternation 
contributes to the establishment of democracy armando calderon 
sol said in an interview he is mayor of san salvador and one of 
arenas top four leaders 
duartes 1984 victory was the first semblance of a democratic 
presidential election in el salvadors history he took power from a 
provisional regime that had emerged from a 1979 coup 
the coup was the start of a reform process to end a monopoly on 
power exercised by an alliance of the military and a landowning 
oligarchy 
arena was founded in 1981 by ousted army intelligence maj 
roberto daubuisson who has been linked with death squads by human 
rights organizations the christian democrats and the us embassy 
the squads connected to security forces ran rampant in the early 
1980s and were blamed for thousands of slayings 
daubuisson a legislator denies the charges his party has 
sought to refurbish its image of violence and fanaticism by 
promoting cristiani an urbane businessman educated at georgetown 
university 
but the charismatic daubuisson still is the partys big drawing 
card and he continues to be introduced at rallies as our maximum 
leader 
vice president rodolfo castillo claramount recently called arena 
a party of fascists the party anthem is belligerant almost 
morbid with refrains that liberty is written with blood and 
el salvador will be the tomb of the reds 
voting will take place under difficult conditions the guerrillas 
have told their supporters to boycott the vote and have decreed a 
nationwide road transport ban beginning wednesday such bans usually 
are quite effective

buoyed by a flawless countdown and a 
good weather forecast nasa was set to launch space shuttle 
discovery on monday with five astronauts and a cargo that includes a 
100 million satellite and four crippled rats 
at 1158 pm launch pad workers began to pump 528000 gallons 
of supercold liquid hydrogen and oxygen into the shuttles external 
tank the chemicals will fuel the three main rocket engines that 
must fire for 8 minutes to put discovery into orbit 
liftoff was set for 807 am est forecasts called for clear 
skies and mild temperatures ideal for launch of the first shuttle 
mission of 1989 only the possibility of strong highaltitude winds 
gave any concern and nasa officials said wind conditions at 
midnight were favorable for the launch 
tomorrow morning is a great day to go fly shuttle boss 
richard truly said at a sunday afternoon news conference the 
weather has been getting prettier and prettier were in good 
shape 
the countdown proceeded so smoothly on sunday that preparations 
skipped two hours ahead of schedule 
it seems a little scary its going so well said chuck 
henschel launch test director were ahead of where we want to 
be 
the faultfree countdown was in sharp contrast to the troubles 
that plagued nasa in getting discovery ready for the mission the 
flight originally had a feb 18 target date but a series of faulty 
or suspect parts delayed the launch four times 
workers changed out turbo pumps in the main engines when flaws 
were found in the pumps on sister shuttle atlantis last week tests 
showed a failure in the system that commands the separation of the 
two booster rockets and the external tank the unit was replaced 
with a part removed from columbia 
launch of discovery sets in motion nasas ambitious plan for 
seven shuttle missions this year while building toward a 
onceamonth flight rate by 1992 the flight will be the third since 
the nation returned to manned spaceflight following the challenger 
disaster of 1986 
discoverys fiveman crew is to be awakened about 3 am monday 
and will board the shuttle at 515 am 
waiting for them in cages aboard the ship will be four rats part 
of an experiment on the effects of weightlessness on the healing of 
injured bones 
a small piece of bone was clipped from each of the rats and how 
well these injuries heal during five days in weightlessness will be 
studied when the rodents are returned to earth 
discoverys main job for the 28th shuttle mission is to deliver 
to orbit a 100 million communications craft called the tracking and 
data relay satellite the satellite is the final point in an 
orbiting communications network that will keep the shuttle and other 
spacecraft in almost constant radio contact with the earth the 
network will enable nasa to shut down six ground tracking stations 
saving 3 million a month 
the satellite called tdrs4 will be released from discovery 
about six hours after launch two later rocket firings will send the 
tdrs to a stationary orbit 22300 miles over the atlantic ocean 
nasa already has two such satellites in orbit but tdrs1 has 
been in use since 1983 and is ailing it will be moved to a new 
location in orbit for use as a spare 
tdrs2 which was to have been the second in the network was on 
board challenger when that spacecraft exploded shortly after launch 
last september tdrs3 was deployed from discovery during the 
first shuttle flight after the challenger accident the satellite 
now is over the pacific ocean and will be used during the current 
mission 
discoverys crew is led by navy capt michael l coats 43 who 
is making his second spaceflight his pilot is air force col john 
e blaha 46 on his first shuttle mission 
the three missions specialists on the crew are james f buchli 
43 a marine colonel who has twice before flown into space marine 
col robert c springer 46 and dr james p bagian a 37yearold 
physician both springer and bagian are space rookies 
in addition to monitoring the rats the astronauts will conduct 
other experiments 
two types of plants will sprout in a small garden on board to 
test the effects of weightlessness on root growth officials said 
this study may develop ways to grow plants aboard the space station 
scientists also will study the effects weightlessness on the 
development of embryos by flying 32 fertilized chicken eggs the 
eggs will be incubated throughout the mission and the embryos will 
be compared later with some grown at the same time on the ground 
discovery is to orbit for five days one hour and land on 
saturday at edwards air force base in california

only from the vocabulary of course 
in its latest battle against franglais or anglicized french the

now companies wont be taken over by raiders or raidairs 
as the french say theyll be taken over by attaquants or

entered last week into the official journal where all official 
pronouncements are inscribed 
it states that the french designation be used in all 
administrative texts documents or correspondence as well as in 
information or presentations for radio or television 
the decree did not specify how authorities might deal with 
continued flagrant use of the outlawed english words 
the action was the latest in a more than decadelong battle by 
french officialdom against franglais the battle has been mainly 
uphill 
the 1988 petit larousse dictionary which is published every year 
and acts as a sort of mirror of contemporary life and language 
deemed raiders an acceptable word it was one of 73 new entries 
in the popular vocabulary words like snob meaning just

when president bush rolled up his pants and showed 
off his cowboy boots at an inaugural ball rocky carroll couldnt 
have asked for better advertising 
not that he needs it carrolls boots which he makes for 
presidents countrywestern singers and professional athletes among 
others are so popular that longtime customers have to drive around 
the block a few times just to park at his rjs boot co shop 
before he became famous he used to fix all my high heels 
donna meyer said recently while picking up a pair of boots carroll 
repaired oh he is still fixing them for me but he is so busy 
now 
i love what i do carroll said i was raised in a shoe

first tooth on an old heel 
carrolls grandparents started the business in the east texas 
town of tenaha the craft was passed to his parents who taught 
carroll carroll who made his first boot at age 10 has passed the 
trade to his son and daughter they in turn operate two other 
shops in houston

ras albisha iraq ap the iraqis manning their armys 
southernmost observation post on the iraniraq ceasefire line lay 
in the sun idly watching the iranians in their outpost a few 
hundred yards across the mouth of the shattalarab waterway 
the iranians do the same peering through binoculars across the 
estuary that flows into the persian gulf 
the soldiers on both sides are waiting for a peace treaty between 
their governments that will allow them to go home 
the only sounds to intrude on the overpowering quiet are the 
cries of sea gulls that wheel above and the waves from the gulf 
breaking on the seaweedstrewn beach 
the soldiers biggest problem is the boredom and the hordes of 
bugs that buzz over the marshy shoreline 
despite reports of violations of the 7monthold ceasefire 
further north life in what was one of the bloodiest battlegrounds 
of the 8year iraniraq war has assumed a sleepy tranquility 
weve plenty of time now for fishing playing cards and 
reading says the iraqi officer who commands the small squad 
manning the sandbagged post 
dont do that a young iraqi lieutenant quips as a reporter 
tries to photograph the remains of an iranianbuilt bridge and a 
sunken vessel the iranians will take that as a violation of the 
ceasefire 
eleven months ago this area was under constant iraqi air and 
artillery attack the main target the concrete bridge the iranians 
built to link the bridgehead on iraqs faw peninsula that they 
captured in february 1986 
for two years the iraqis tried and failed to dislodge iranians 
dug in around the marshlands ringing the battered oil terminal town 
of faw 
then last april they launched a surprise attack after weeks of 
diversions and stealthy infiltration and recaptured faw in a 36hour 
battle 
it was the first of a chain of victories that pushed the iranians 
out of all iraqi territory they had overrun and forced tehran to 
unconditionally accept a un ceasefire resolution 
a large sign erected at the entrance to faw says 52948 iraqis 
and more than 120000 iranians were killed in the battles for the 
sandy peninsula 
the iraqi toll was the first indication that reporters for 
western news organizations have had of the scale of baghdads 
losses unofficial estimates have put the iraqi death toll for the 
whole war at around 150000 
the claim of 120000 iranians killed merely in the fighting for 
faw is impossible to verify the iranians have only admitted to some 
130000 dead for the whole war although western analysts estimate 
that is only a fraction of the true total 
iranian losses generally were considered to be at least three 
times the iraqi casualties mainly because of the carnage in the 
iranians human wave attacks against the wellentrenched iraqis 
iraqi officers said more than 65 million shells were fired by 
the two armies during the iranian occupation of faw 
the ruined town one of the few iraqi towns overrun by the 
iranians stands as a symbol of our sacrifices and heroism said 
anwar saeed alhadithi governor of nearby basra 
he told the associated press that plans have been completed to 
build a new urban center in faw to replace the old town 
iraqi authorities last year launched a nationwide donation 
campaign to collect money to rebuild faw which had a prewar 
population of 56000 
similar drives were launched in neighboring kuwait and other 
persian gulf countries 
reliable iraqi sources say millions of dollars have been 
collected for the reconstruction which is expected to start next 
month on the anniversary of the liberation of faw 
the government has not spelled out its plans for the faw port 
which before the war was a key oil export outlet to japan and europe 
rebuilding the port cannot start until iran and iraq reach 
agreement in their deadlocked peace talks on clearing the 
120milelong shattalarab of sunken ships war debris and silt

eastern airlines renewed flights to seven latin 
american cities sunday and continued to lure bargain hunters to its 
northeast shuttle in an effort to rebuild despite a weekold strike 
however the airlines lure of 12 fares on the shuttle may have 
worked too well several hundred wouldbe shuttle passengers in 
boston new york and washington were told theyd have to wait for 
monday morning flights because all evening flights were booked solid 
eastern ballyhooed the reopening of its latin american routes as 
a new start for the airline which filed for bankruptcy protection 
last week blaming its pilots for honoring machinists picket lines 
and plunging the carrier into a cash crisis 
service to three more south american cities two domestic routes 
and montreal will begin later in the week the airline said 
what were really saying is it is the start of a new smaller 
restructured and viable eastern airlines said eastern spokesman 
robin matell 
eastern lured customers on its 62 bostonnew york and new 
yorkwashington shuttle flights with the 12 weekend fares down 
from 69 weekday fares begining monday will be 49 one way down 
from the usual 99 
airline officials said 31500 people crossed picket lines over 
the weekend to take the cutrate flights others tried to get aboard 
the flights and failed 
at logan international airport in boston stranded passengers 
were told to show up at the eastern terminal at 530 am monday 
when the first shuttle was slated to leave for new york 
officials at washington national airport said over 100 people who 
were unable to get onto flights would have to spend the night at the 
airport or make other travel arrangements 
in new york an undetermined number of people were stranded at 
laguardia airport 
its a bummer said terianne tapia who was up from new york 
to visit her boyfriend in boston i have to be at work at 9 am 
eastern officials said those passengers should have gotten to the 
airport sooner 
those people were not stranded we advertised the flights were 
on a firstcome firstserve basis matell said im sorry they 
have to wait for the next flight but they should have gotten there 
earlier 
asked if eastern would pay for hotel accomodations matell said 
absolutely not 
however matell later said the passengers who missed flights 
would be allowed to fly free during offpeak hours and for the same 
12 rate during peak hours if they had purchased roundtrip 
tickets over the weekend 
eastern just nine days earlier the nations seventhlargest 
carrier with 1040 daily flights planned to put 75 planes into the 
air sunday the first of the renewed latin american routes took off 
just before 4 pm for quito ecuador eastern spokeswoman virginia 
sanchez said 
matell said the shuttle and international routes were considered 
the best place to deploy easterns limited resources and generate 
revenue a 365 million sale of the shuttle to new york developer 
donald trump is pending and easterns international routes are 
among its most marketable assets 
meanwhile secretary of transportation samuel skinner said on 
cbs face the nation that the bush administration considers the 
labor dispute none of our business and has no plans to 
intervene we are not in the business of running eastern airlines 
or negotiating the contract for labor skinner said 
eastern hopes to be up to 140 flights a day by weeks end matell 
said the highest number of flights in one day since the strike 
began march 4 has been 93 
during the first week of the strike eastern maintained one 
thriceweekly flight from miami to buenos aires argentina and 
santiago chile as well as its east coast shuttle service 
easterns unions have accused frank lorenzo chairman of eastern 
parent texas air corp of trying to cannibalize the airline pilots 
and flight attendants unions have honored machinists picket lines 
which went up when the 8500member union refused to grant 125 
million in concessions to the moneylosing airline 
today eastern is up and flying company president phil bakes 
said sunday in a statement with this we begin building the great 
airline weve always known eastern could and should be 
bakes was a vice president at continental airlines in 1983 when 
lorenzo filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as eastern did 
on thursday in new york 
former eastern chairman frank borman said sunday on abcs this 
week with david brinkley that he knew of no one in the management 
or on the board of texas air who wanted bankruptcy 
continental gradually rebuilt its schedule while in bankruptcy 
reorganization but eastern unions say management wont be helped as 
it was at continental by union workers crossing picket lines 
eastern estimated sunday that out of 3600 regular pilots it had 
200 flying 
the air line pilots association said the latin american routes 
are more complicated than the bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle 
which had provided nearly all of easterns strike service and it 
doubted the company had enough experienced pilots to keep flying 
them 
alpa also said the companys few pilots will be grounded by 
federal aviation administration limits on flying time such as 30 
hours within seven days matell said eastern has had no significant 
increase in delays 
matell said no decision had been made yet on when to bring in 
noncontract workers to replace strikers the company has 1500 
employees working having laid off 9500 nonunion workers last week 
in atlanta about 2000 striking workers and their families 
joined for a pep rally near the airport lorenzo was the main target 
of slogans painted and pasted on shirts cars kites and even a dog 
matell said eastern flew 10200 passengers saturday approaching 
capacity and had long lines again sunday 
lawyers for the machinists plan to go to court this week seeking 
an estimated 75 million in back wages frozen when the company 
filed bankruptcy on payday for most machinists workers the pilots 
next paycheck was due march 15 
the only good thing about bankruptcy is that it hinders 
lorenzos ability to slice this thing up like a piece of salami 
said rick chapman secretarytreasurer of the alpa local 
departures scheduled from miami starting sunday were bogota 
colombia guatemala city lima peru panama city panama quito 
ecuador guayaquil ecuador and san jose costa rica thriceweekly 
flights were planned to start later in the week for asuncion 
paraguay cali colombia and la paz bolivia 
our loads are looking good said eastern spokeswoman virginia 
sanchez noting heavy passenger turnout for flights to panama city 
and lima 
the company also intends to resume thricedaily flights between 
miami and puerto rico on monday along with service to montreal then 
add direct flights later this week between washington and boston

the communist party will tackle critical food 
shortages in a special meeting this week that comes amid signs 
president mikhail s gorbachev and politburo rival yegor k ligachev 
disagree on the solution 
the hottest issue on the agenda of the 300member central 
committee is gorbachevs desire to lease stateowned fields to 
farmers 
in recent appearances ligachev has skipped lightly over leasing 
and emphasized collective farming the traditional system that has 
left soviet consumers standing in line for meat and vegetables 
at the meeting wednesday and thursday the policymaking central 
committee is likely to agree on the need to ease the poverty and 
isolation of rural life it also is expected to order the 
dismantling at least partially of an agricultural superministry 
formed in 1985 
in what appeared to be part of a campaign leading to action 
against the superministry the communist party daily pravda on march 
6 reprinted citizens complaints the agency is bureaucratic 
ineffective and useless 
the central committee also will formally elect the 100 communist 
party members nominated for the nations new 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies 
but the meetings major task is to overcome divisions at the 
highest levels and to take bold action on the worsening shortages 
that could derail gorbachevs entire reform program 
the food problem as it is known in the soviet union means 
long lines for limited products of poor quality 
a diet that includes twice as many potatoes and 50 percent more 
sugar than americans eat but roughly half the fruit and meat 
a distribution system that lets three out of four potatoes rot 
before they reach the table 
a grain harvest of 195 million tons in 1988 well below targets 
that required the soviet union to spend precious foreign currency 
to import 36 million tons 
migration to the cities to escape the inadequacies of rural 
education housing roads goods and services 
today comrades the most critical question is 
unconditionally supplying the population normalization of the 
demands of the market gorbachev said in a speech in kiev last 
month 
of all the problems of supplies to the population the most 
urgent is food he said 
gorbachev has enthusiastically endorsed the idea of allowing 
families to obtain land under longterm leases from the collective 
and state farms he says it will give farmers greater security and 
incentive 
in an effort to boost the idea official newspapers abound with 
reports like the following published in moscow news 
nikolai sysolyatin took a lease from a state farm in the kirov 
region and began raising 110 steers with the help of wives and 
children the team mowed grass at night the best time for that in 
contrast 50 percent of the fodder at the state farm rotted it 
said 
but sysolyatin was driven out of business by suspicious 
neighbors because the bloody experience of collectivization in the 
1930s made peasants distrustful of individual initiative moscow 
news said sysolyatin left 30 steers bellowing with hunger when he 
moved to the city 
gorbachev insisted to his kiev audience that ideology is less 
important than results 
we must open the door to anyone who is capable of radically 
changing the situation he said no stereotypes and dogmas must 
stand in the way of deciding the food problem 
in january gorbachev complained that bureaucrats and neighbors 
who drove the likes of sysolyatin out of business viewed them as 
rockefellers seeking to get rich at the expense of others 
ligachevs recent statements praising collective farming stand 
out in stark contrast 
in a visit to review farm policy in czechoslovakia ligachev told 
soviet television we have become convinced one more time that the 
basis for any progress in food programs is actually development of 
collective forms of management such as collective farms and state 
farms along with a steady development of selffinancing 
a week earlier in a speech in the siberian city of omsk ligachev 
said improving social conditions in rural villages was the key 
question he gave only passing mention to leasing 
improving village life for us is the question of questions 
ligachev said 
ligachev was the no 2 figure in the politburo and considered a 
conservative counterforce to gorbachev until gorbachev demoted him 
in september ligachev became chairman of the partys agricultural 
commission

the oppositions chief negotiator says 
political reforms laid out during five weeks of talks with the 
government are hanging by a hair because of apparent resistance 
by communist hardliners 
historian bronislaw geremek said sunday that his side had 
received a government draft on a new electoral procedure that lacked 
basic political decisions that we had agreed upon 
is it that someone simply forgot about them or maybe there are 
forces on the other side that are strong enough to block the whole 
contract he said 
the opposition received the draft saturday and geremek made his 
comments sunday at a meeting of the oppositions citizens committee 
the committee gathered to evaluate progress in the historic talks 
on reinstating the banned solidarity free trade union movement and 
salvaging the battered economy the opposition is demanding free 
elections greater access to the media and a say in the formation of 
economic policy 
hearing the report by geremek citizens committee members adopted 
a statement calling for full realization of solidaritys demands 
and expressing concern at the apparent tendency by the government 
side to limit democratic changes 
a dozen days before the end of the roundtable talks it seems 
that the whole deal is hanging by a hair geremek told the 
gathering 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz at a news conference 
sunday also spoke about some points missing in the draft but he 
said it was too early to raise an alarm 
neither he nor geremek said what agreements might be lacking in 
the draft 
the 120member citizens committee was formed last year by 
solidarity chairman lech walesa to bring together leaders of the 
main opposition groups 
on thursday government negotiators agreed to democratic 
elections for a revived senate and that 35 percent of the 460 seats 
in the sejm the present unicameral parliament could be open to 
independent candidates 
it has not been determined how many seats or how much power the 
senate will have in return for the senate the opposition agreed to 
the creation to a strenghthened presidency whose occupant would have 
the power to dissolve the legislature 
elections are tentatively scheduled for june 4 
the ruling communist partys 230member central committee is 
expected to ratify either this week or next week the agreements 
made at the negotiations 
both sides have said a pact on the talks should be signed by 
april 3 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski told supporters 
saturday that they must be ready to stand facetoface in a 
democratic test in the elections the official pap news agency 
reported sunday 
it said jaruzelski addressing more than 2500 party officials 
told them their job is not only mobilizing people to come to the 
polling boxes anymore 
the goal is to elect the best so that those best are our people 
members of the party members of allied parties nonparty members 
really independent but standing on the ground of socialism he 
said according to the text distributed by pap 
solidarity legally chartered in the fall of 1980 as the first 
free union movement in the soviet bloc was crushed by a december 
1981 military crackdown and outlawed the following year

a dozen descendants of massachusetts pioneer 
william bradford are making a pilgrimage to britain to celebrate the 
birth of their ancestor who fled to the new world four centuries 
ago in search religious freedom 
everybodys very excited i think its a onceinalifetime 
thing said marion vuilleumier the 11th greatgranddaughter of 
bradford and an organizer of the trip 
the group members of a descendants society called the gov 
william bradford compact are leaving tuesday for austerfield 
yorkshire 
the celebration of bradfords 399th birthday will be held there 
sunday and is expected to draw representatives of queen elizabeth ii 
and the american embassy 
the homecoming was arranged after ms vuilleumier visited 
austerfield and learned that a celebration was planned for march 19 
which is believed to be bradfords birthday 
bradford who sailed for america aboard the mayflower was among 
a group of people seeking to separate from the church of england 
the group formed what later would become the congregationalist 
movement 
he was the second governor of the plymouth colony which was 
established in 1620 and is best remembered for his chronicle of the 
settlement of plymouth plantation is a primary source for the 
history of massachusetts colonists said jeff scotland a spokesman 
for the plimoth plantation museum devoted to massachusetts early 
history 
bradford who died in 1657 and his coreligionists found 
religious freedom by establishing a community under their own 
sometimes rigid rules said scotland who occasionally portrays 
bradford at the museum 
it takes a lot of courage to cross the atlantic in a leaky boat 
and to carve out a home in the wilderness scotland said to be 
so principled that youre willing to do that just so you can worship 
without being thrown in jail that makes a statement 
the bradford compact formed about 40 years ago has about 400 
members and holds annual meetings in plymouth 
ms vuilleumier said the british recognition of bradfords 
historic status seems a fitting ending to the centuriesold rift 
with the mother country 
i think he would have been pleased to see it she said he 
would have been very pleased to be vindicated

on april 16 1968 army capt thomas jay 
hayes iv was killed in vietnam after dragging two wounded comrades 
to safety as enemy forces overwhelmed his platoon 
on sunday hayes became the latest fallen hero to have a building 
on the west point campus renamed in his honor 
as his classmates from the west point class of 66 gathered for 
the dedication ceremony in the spotless gymnasium previously known 
as the east gym they reminisced about hayes leadership heroism 
and potential for greatness the qualities that led the academy to 
rename the gym in his memory 
he inspired all of us said classmate john wheeler former 
secretary of the securities and exchange commission and president of 
the washingtonbased center for the vietnam generation 
we knew this guy would have been a statesman not just a 
soldier but a statesman and that gave us an extra boost said 
col c hilton dunn jr now assigned to the army corps of engineers 
several other buildings on the campus which lies 50 miles north 
of new york city have also been named after west point graduates 
who like hayes showed exceptional leadership as a cadet excelled 
in athletics or some area of study and were killed in action 
a few weeks ago a different gymnasium was named after carl 
robert arvin class of 65 who died in vietnam at age 24 more men 
will be honored in the same way said wheeler 
the program to name buildings after the fallen heroes was 
initiated by west points commander gen david palmer 
hes updating west point by bringing the best of our past into 
the present said wheeler by finding men like tommy hayes 
hes reigniting at west point the light of inspiration 
wheeler who counted hayes among his best friends said he 
researched hayes death until he was satisfied that he knew exactly 
what had happened 
his platoon was helicoptered into a landing zone and instantly 
hit by a huge force of overwhelming enemy fire wheeler recalled 
it was daylight hours and they were terribly exposed he 
dragged one wounded man back to safety and then another back to 
safety 
the men he rescued lived but hayes was shot and killed on the 
spot 
hayes whose father and grandfather attended west point had been 
ninth in his class nearly all of hayes 579 classmates went to 
vietnam 30 died there more than any other class said wheeler 
hayes was sent over as an engineer to handle battlefield 
construction but instead volunteered for infantry duty after his 
yearlong vietnam tour was over he signed up for another he was 
killed halfway through it at age 26 an old man considering the 
average age of a soldier in vietnam was 19 said wheeler 
it was tough it was almost like losing a brother robert 
kesmodel now a baltimore businessman said of learning that hayes 
had died 
col mac hayes now a west point regiment commander was in 
vietnam when he read in stars and stripes that his classmate had 
been killed 
its always a devastating thing to find out said hayes who 
was not related to thomas hayes the people who tended to do 
things and be leaders unfortunately were the casualties because 
they served on the front lines 
wheeler said the survivors share an intense triple bond its 
vietnam and the tet offensive of 68 then burying the most 
killed from any class in vietnam then coming home and feeling so 
alone 
but he said sundays reunion took another bite out of the 
unnecessary bitterness and pain that our country feels from the war 
in vietnam by affirming the integrity in toms life and the 
choices he made

the government of prime minister sadek 
mahdi has resigned under pressure from the military in a move that 
could open the way for peace talks with rebels in the south 
the state council sudans collective presidency accepted the 
resignation on sunday and mahdi began trying to form a new cabinet 
newspaper reports indicated mahdi who submitted the resignation 
late saturday faced a struggle in creating a cabinet and it was 
uncertain when a new government might be formed 
the reports said the armed forces were insisting on two seats in 
what had been a 21member cabinet but mahdi had not offered them 
any they said mahdi is trying to neutralize the military power by 
bargaining with trade unions and professional associations 
army officers joined by unions and some political groups issued 
an ultimatum three weeks ago for mahdi to create a broadbased 
government and open peace talks with the sudan peoples liberation 
army after six years of civil war 
mahdis umma party was dominant in the old cabinet and its junior 
party was the national islamic front a moslem fundamentalist party 
newspapers said the national islamic front is not expected to 
take part in a new government because of disputes over islamic law 
islamic law is in force but it has been largely ignored and its 
penalties have not been enforced since the 1985 ouster of dictator 
gaafar nimeiri 
many people in southern sudan are christians or animists they 
oppose islamic law and the khartoum government which is controlled 
by predominantly moslem north sudan 
the southern rebels demand more autonomy and greater shares in 
aid and development programs 
mahdi has been facing his worst political crisis since he became 
head of the government after general elections in april 1986 
the centrist democratic unionist party was the secondlargest 
party in mahdis coalition until they walked out in january to 
protest the governments economic policies and mahdis refusal to 
bring a peace plan before the cabinet mahdi then formed a new 
cabinet with the national islamic front 
ten days ago mahdi and representatives of 65 political groups 
and unions agreed to a proposed new government and peace overtures 
toward the rebels but the islamic front rejected the plan saying 
it jeopardized islamic law

more than 50000 demonstrators many waving 
quebec flags and shouting french quebec marched through the 
citys streets in one of the biggest outpourings of french canadian 
nationalism in years 
the mood was generally friendly but one placard proclaimed 
death to anglophones 
organizers who had expected only 25000 people to participate 
were jubilant over sundays turnout in sunny but extremely cold 
weather 
the message is great said guy bouthillier spokesman for the 
movement for a french quebec its obvious these people want to 
have back their law 101 
the group organized the protest march in support of the 
nationalist language law passed in 1977 by the quebecer party that 
provincial premier robert bourassa amended last december 
the demonstrators want the quebec legislature which reconvenes 
tuesday to return to a law allowing businesses to post signs only 
in french bourassa decided to permit some bilingual signs inside 
the businesses though only french can be used outside 
considering the size of the demonstration i think it will make 
bourassa think about a few things said quebecer party leader 
jacques parizeau who marched with the crowd 
some of the marchers draped themselves in the provinces 
fleurdelys flag and others carried placards with slogans like 
the humiliation has lasted long enough and quebec for 
quebecers 
the march ended with a rally at city hall 
roughly 80 percent of quebecs 65 million people are 
francophones they say they have long been locked out of good jobs 
and other benefits by english speakers 
jacques st amant who marched with his two children said he 
wanted to sensitize them to the fact that french quebec might 
disappear 
his 9yearold daughter christine who plans to become a french 
teacher nodded and said french is important for me 
although the marchers were predominantly frenchcanadian a 
number of english speakers and foreign immigrants turned out to 
offer their support as well

when christian and animist refugees first 
began to trickle into this dusty little moslem town residents 
greeted them in the spirit of charity 
today many look upon the newcomers as a threat 
the locals received their brothers when they were in bad 
condition but when they became well they compete for jobs so 
yes there is friction between them said abdelrasoul nour 
governor of darfour region 
the refugees arrive in this moslemdominated town of 20000 at a 
rate of up to 300 a day they have trekked northward within 460 
miles of the capital of khartoum in search of food and of safety 
from civil war between moslem northerners and the christian and 
animist southerners 
this nations twin scourges of fighting and famine have reduced 
hundreds of thousands of sudanese to homeless nomads who survive 
mainly through the good graces of international relief groups 
about 225 million people live in southern sudan last year up 
to 500000 perished from war and related causes many starved to 
death in isolated villages 
during the last summer rainy season between 1000 and 2000 
refugees died in muglad according to mark cunningham of the 
irishbased concern relief organization more than half of them were 
children he said 
now about 12000 people live here as outsiders and 10000 more 
are expected before the next rainy season 
muglad like the government in khartoum is mainly arab moslem 
the displaced newcomers represent an array of african cultures 
the southern rebels are fighting for more autonomy from the north 
and a greater share of the countrys wealth 
the first refugees trudged into muglad last april most have come 
from aweil about 150 miles away in the embattled bahr elghazal 
region 
they walked along train tracks eating shrubs and finding very 
little water many of the weak and sick died along the way 
but those arriving look relatively strong only a few show 
reddishorange hair a sign of malnutrition 
they live in a makeshift camp on the outskirts of town in stick 
huts covered with plastic sheets 
only a few have found local jobs most are totally dependent on 
food and water distributed by concern 
as a group of journalists toured the camp refugees in rags with 
copper bands around their arms and ankles performed a traditional 
southern dance 
but they had changed the words to fit their new lives 
our homes are destroyed and we have gone hungry life has 
become very difficult we wish we could go home we wish there could 
be peace and we could go home

a hotly debated art exhibit that has a us flag 
lying on a floor touched off a protest by about 2500 veterans and 
supporters and a clash that led to the arrests of at least four 
police said 
before the scuffle police arrested two men who described 
themselves as art students as they stenciled american flags on the 
sidewalks around the museum building they were charged with 
criminal damage to property 
during sundays demonstration outside the art institute of 
chicago a group of veterans attacked about a dozen students who 
were holding a counterdemonstration they swung fists threw hot 
coffee and shouted at the students to leave the country police 
intervened and no one was injured 
police said at least one veteran was arrested on battery charges 
and three students were charged with disorderly conduct the 
confrontation was broken up after police led the students to a 
corner about two blocks away from the veterans and kept the groups 
apart 
in front of the institute the veterans who came from at least 
nine states chanted one two three four get the flag off the 
floor 
i just think its a sin to have the flag on the floor said 
michael boorsma 38 a vietnam veteran from suburban batavia it 
bothers me tremendously 
veterans also came from wisconsin west virginia michigan 
indiana oklahoma new york vermont and arkansas they waved 
hundreds of flags including some with the revolutionary war motto 
dont tread on me 
the demonstration was the biggest in a series of protests over a 
student art exhibit titled what is the proper way to display a 
us flag the exhibit includes the flag lying on the floor 
beneath a shelf where visitors can write comments in two ledger 
books veterans contend that the placement of the flag invites 
viewers to step on it 
studentartist dread scott tyler said he had no apologies for 
his exhibit which he described as revolutionary 
in the counterprotest one of the art students carried a poster 
showing adolf hitler ayatollah khomeini and republican mayoral 
candidate edward vrdolyak a supporter of the veterans protests 
with the caption art critic get rid of degenerate art 
a second group of counterdemonstrators about 20 primarily older 
artists stood near the veterans under heavy police guard they 
carried empty picture frames on sticks to show that the exhibit 
being protested was essentially empty of artistic merit but 
that the right to free expression should be upheld they said 
the exhibit which includes art by 66 minority students opened 
on feb 17 
earlier this month a judge rejected a lawsuit by veterans 
groups contending that the artwork desecrated the flag 
the gallery was opened to the public for a few minutes sunday 
morning but was closed after veterans repeatedly picked up the 
flag said security guard alicia lloyd

the dollar was mixed in early european trading 
today upward movement checked by fear of central bank intervention 
and a lack of incentive to move before wednesdays release of new 
us trade figures foreign currency dealers said 
gold prices fell slightly 
dealers said factors pointing to a higher dollar include 
speculation about rising us interest rates following surprisingly 
strong february employment figures 
but the market is too afraid of central banks to push the dollar 
aggressively higher said bernd hartwig chief dealer of 
norddeutsche landesbank girozentrale in hanover west germany 
one can assume that interest rate speculation will take the 
dollar higher but the fear of central banks is very much present 
he said 
a dealer at a large frankfurt bank said the next point to look 
for are the us trade figures 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 069 yen to a closing 12957 later in london it 
was quoted at 12975 yen

a reported us plan to quell the palestinian 
uprising in israels occupied territories is unacceptable because it 
calls on the plo to surrender its only weapon for swaying public 
opinion palestinian leaders said 
at a mideast peace symposium here the palestinians also urged 
the united states to back an independent state for their people as 
part of a steppedup international peace effort they spoke on the 
second day of a threeday symposium at columbia university 
several leftwing israeli legislators and prominent jewish 
leaders attending the symposium predicted the reported us plan 
would fail if it didnt offer a permanent solution for reconciling 
the demands of israel and the palestine liberation organization 
the new york times reported sunday that the bush administration 
plans to propose that israel and the plo take steps to ease tension 
in the israelioccupied territories 
us officials plan to ask israel to release some of the 
palestinians arrested during the 15month uprising end or limit 
detentions and reopen schools in the territories the newspaper 
said quoting an unidentified senior administration official 
the us initiatives also would call on the plo to halt violent 
demonstrations in the territories block antiisraeli raids from 
southern lebanon and stop distributing inflammatory leaflets the 
newspaper said 
these demands are unbalanced unfair said faisal husseini 
director of the arab studies center in east jerusalem and a 
palestinian leader in the occupied territories 
they are asking us to stop the demonstrations he said of the 
reported us proposals while israel was being asked the 
minimum 
nabil shaath chairman of the political committee of the 
palestine national council said the united states first should 
endorse a separate palestinian state as part of a peace plan 
lets put the horse where it should be and the cart where it 
should be and the horse is the peace arrangement said shaath 
whose council is the legislative arm of the plo what is not 
negotiable is the final result an independent palestinian state 
side by side with the state of israel 
david susskind vice president of the jewish coordinating 
committee for belgium said jews in europe and the united states 
must pressure israeli leaders to accept a palestinian state 
israel needs the solidarity of the jewish people he said 
yossi sarid a member of the leftwing citizens rights movement 
in israels knesset or parliament said the bush proposals will 
fail if the administration plans only an interim agreement 
without addressing the final status between israel and the plo 
but a jewishamerican lawyer who met with plo chairman yasser 
arafat in sweden last year welcomed the reported us plan and said 
the plo still needs to show israelis that it can make all its 
factions abide by its pledge last year to refrain from terrorism 
the biggest problem that is confronting the plo at this point 
from both the israeli and american point of view is that it isnt 
clear to those two parties that the plo can control the 
situation said rita hauser citing recent incursions by plo 
guerrillas into israels selfdeclared security zone in south 
lebanon 
the new bush proposals were to be presented today when israeli 
foreign minister moshe arens meets with the president the times 
reported while the suggestions for the plo were to be presented 
through the american ambassador in tunis robert pelletreau jr

recruited to battle the biggest blaze in this parks 45year history 
after it blackened 615 acres of oak pine and juniper woodlands 
a helicopter flight over the fire sunday evening revealed it 
covered much less than the 1200 acres estimated earlier 
that actually puts us in better shape but its still the 
largest fire in the parks history and it probably will keep 
spreading for a couple of days before we get it under control 
said park spokesman jim paxon 
unless winds pick up we should get a good handle on this thing 
monday then id say it should be a couple more days before its 
under control thats if we dont get any winds

with light winds and no precipitation for the southwest texas area 
during the next few days

of forestry battled the fire sunday paxon said about 160 additional 
personnel had been requested from the interagency fire center in 
boise idaho to fight the blaze 
officials also planned to use three helicopters to dump water on 
hot spots in the fire which is burning in the high chisos mountains 
of this rhode islandsize park along the rio grande 
no injuries were reported and no structures were in danger 
authorities said 
but fire officials were concerned about a pair of peregrine 
falcon nests within 1 miles of the flames paxon said the nests 
which shelter at least four of the endangered birds werent at risk 
from the flames but would be protected if winds shifted 
the blaze was believed to have been started by human 
carelessness authorities said 
about 100 campers mostly college students on spring break were

a convicted copkiller whose clemency three 
years ago drew a sharp rebuke from thenvice president george bush 
could taste freedom this week but the controversy over his case may 
linger on 
gary mcgivern serving 25 years to life for the 1968 shooting he 
insists he didnt commit is to appear for the third time before the 
state board of parole since getting clemency 
hes going to be paroled predicted michael kavanagh the 
ulster county district attorney who prosecuted mcgivern and wants 
him to remain behind bars 
mcgiverns long fight for freedom has attracted the support of an 
unusual array of people including folk singer pete seeger liberal 
attorney william kunstler and conservative columnist william f 
buckley 
mcgivern and fellow inmate charles culhane received life 
sentences for the shooting death of william fitzgerald a 
westchester county deputy 
prosecutors said mcgivern culhane and inmate robert bowerman 
tried to escape from a car while being transported for a court 
appearance fitzgerald and bowerman died from gunshot wounds and 
mcgivern and culhane were wounded 
mcgivern and culhane have maintained bowerman acted alone but a 
second deputy in the car joseph singer said they were involved in 
the escape attempt 
the two men were convicted in a 1975 retrial after a first trial 
ended in a hung jury and an appeals court threw out their 
convictions in a second trial citing jury selection errors and 
inconsistency in singers testimony 
mcgivern became eligible for a parole hearing after gov mario 
cuomo granted clemency on new years eve 1985 the board has 
rejected mcgivern twice but at his last hearing in december 1987 
he was allowed to reapply in 14 months instead of the maximum 24 
months that said kavanagh means mcgivern is likely to be released 
by the boards own rules if theres a wait of less than two 
years you dont consider the crime just the institutional record 
and the progress explained edward elwin executive director of 
the parole board 
after 20 years in maximumsecurity prisons mcgivern was moved in 
may to a mediumsecurity institution 
the prospect that the 44yearold inmate might go free had 
prompted prison guards and law enforcement officials to denounce 
cuomo in the past 
shortly after cuomo granted the clemency bush went on the attack 
i can tell you one thing about the difference between a liberal 
politician and a conservative one governor ronald reagan kept cop 
killers in jail bush told a new york city political dinner at 
the time cuomo was considered a contender for the 1988 democratic 
presidential nomination 
as lieutenant governor cuomo recommended mcgivern for clemency 
in 1979 after he passed two lie detector tests but thengov hugh 
carey refused 
cuomo was elected governor in 1982 two years later singer shot 
himself to death outside his home in berwick pa police said he 
left no suicide note 
then six years after his original recommendation cuomo signed 
the clemency papers himself 
it was a very difficult call this man is not a cop killer 
he said 
kavanagh however insists mcgivern is a murderer and a con 
man who has fooled a lot of people 
if this kid wasnt a nice white irish boy who had some very 
serious connections with the rich and powerful this never would 
have happened he said

the shenanigans of television evangelists 
have spawned another player in americas multimilliondollar board 
game industry this one irreverently named fleece the flock 
the game developed by a writer an inventor and an illustrator 
is based loosely on monopoly but instead of realestate 
tycoons players assume the roles of greedy evangelists 
i came up with the idea when jimmy swaggart was caught in the 
motel said elizabeth fuller author of my search for the ghost 
of flight 401 and other books i thought these guys belong on 
a board game 
equipped with collection plates players toss the dice and pursue 
ownership of theme parks television stations and record companies 
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own 
sexual escapades secret 
fuller collaborated on the game with inventor stanley mason 
whose 30 patents include masonware microwave cookware and roy doty 
a humorous illustrator 
the three formed tongueincheek productions and sold the rights 
to market the game to regent continental a philadelphiabased 
company that produces board games for some of the nations largest 
toy makers 
the company plans to have a pilot run of 10000 games selling at 
25 retail available mostly in the northeast by april 1 said cindy 
levinson an account executive for regent 
fleece the flock is only the latest board game to capitalize 
on people in the news milton bradley maker of the some of the 
countrys most popular games last month unveiled trump the 
game based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate 
mogul donald trump 
analysts say any new entry into the 760 millionayear 
boardgame industry faces an uphill battle 
more than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not 
make it past that years christmas said david s leibowitz a toy 
industry analyst with american securities corp in new york the 
success of any new toy item is pretty tough 
but fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that 
americans seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of 
television evangelists will create a niche for their game 
during five months of testing the inventors were dumbfounded to 
discover one common trait among test players they all were cheating 
by the end of the game that prompted the inclusion of one rule 
assumed in most games thou shalt not cheat unless thou canst get 
away with it 
no reallife evangelist is named and the inventors insist they 
are not attacking religion itself fuller is a unitarian doty and 
mason are both methodists 
its a comment on humanity mason said its aimed at the 
human foibles we have when well support people like this when we 
know they are evil

the association of southeast asian 
nations announced today that vietnamese refugees arriving in their 
countries will no longer automatically qualify for resettlement 
in other words those who cannot prove they are fleeing political 
persecution will be returned to vietnam 
a foreign ministry statement said the new policy would take 
effect tuesday and will be applied regionwide 
asean diplomats said the new policy applies only to vietnamese 
refugees 
since vietnam boat people began fleeing their country a 
decade ago all the asean countries malaysia indonesia thailand 
brunei singapore and the philippines have accepted any vietnamese 
who arrived as a refugee 
refugees were given temporary asylum and put into camps to await 
resettlement by the united states australia canada new zealand 
and other western nations 
asean diplomats said that under the new policy those arriving 
would be screened by officials of the country where they land with 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees providing 
assistance 
those found to be fleeing for political reasons or fleeing 
persecution would be given refugee status but if it is determined 
the emigrant has left vietnam hoping for a better economic life in 
the west he or she would be put into a camp to await repatriation 
the asean diplomats said their nations had wanted the cutoff 
date to be included in the draft plan developed in malaysia at the 
end of a meeting held last week to prepare for an international 
conference on refugees but representatives from the united nations 
the united states sweden and other countries had objected saying 
all those who flee should be given refugee status 
a compromise was reached under which asean could issue a separate 
statement on the cutoff date asean members said vietnam has 
already agreed at the planning session to accept those seeking to 
go back voluntarily 
but vietnam has said it would not accept anyone forcefully 
returned it was still uncertain what would happen to refugees 
denied resettlement who refuse to go back asean said 
the move follows hong kongs adoption of a similar tough new 
policy under which vietnamese boat people are considered illegal 
immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fled 
persecution vietnamese refugees have since the communist takeover 
in their country sailed by the tens of thousands to seek asylum in 
noncommunist southeast asia

as a warm breeze carries the breath 
of spring to the serenity of her suburban houston home maureen 
seeba surrounds herself with the horror and anguish of a conflict 
half a world away 
each day the professional artist tries to work on a portrait of 
terry anderson who on thursday will reach the fourth anniversary of 
his abduction in beirut lebanon 
anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of 15 foreign hostages in lebanon 
including nine americans believed kidnapped by proiranian shiite 
moslems 
theyre easy to forget about when you live like this with a 
good life and your kids are at home and you have enough food to 
eat and you just have to decide where you want to go each day 
mrs seeba said 
she focused her artistic interest on anderson after she saw the 
newsmans plea to president reagan in a tape released by his captors 
last oct 31 
it was just very heartbreaking she says hes been over 
there four years and i have to ask myself what have i been doing 
the past four years because i really havent been that aware of 
him 
so in between paintings of flowers boats and people the 
32yearold artist began painting likenesses of anderson haunting 
portraits that chronicle his ordeal nearly all are character 
studies of his face some show him with a beard others are 
cleanshaven some are in a single color others are multihued 
she has a couple dozen paintings and has thrown out maybe 25 or 
30 she didnt like her favorite is a yellow portrait showing a 
nearly emotionless anderson 
im sure at this point hes about drained of any expression 
she says the yellow is like a nuclear flash its so intense but 
it also could signify the yellow ribbons that are not hanging in 
everyones doorways i guess thats why i like it 
she said she has not contacted any members of andersons family 
including his sister peggy say who has urged national leaders to 
work for his release her images of anderson are based in part on 
photos and videotapes andersons captives have released to news 
agencies 
if nothing else because im someone who doesnt know him by 
doing at least one painting of him every day even if nobody ever 
sees it hes being remembered she said hes not getting out 
but he is being remembered 
mrs seeba said her attempts to arrange a showing of her anderson 
portraits have been rebuffed by managers of public buildings in 
houston where art generally is exhibited 
they all say the same thing she says they say its just 
too controversial and they dont want to offend anybody 
any proceeds from the sale of her anderson works will go to the 
journalists committee to free terry anderson she said so people 
wont accuse her of trying to exploit him for her own fame 
anguish thats what im trying to show she said i just 
want to raise consciousness i want the public to remember

the apparently random brutal murders of 
two prominent residents were separated by 15 years but they have 
come together to shatter the serenity of this hillcountry town 
michael berryhill who has spent 14 years on death row and has 
come within hours of the electric chair faces a third trial in the 
1974 slaying of george hooks jr manager of the local union carbide 
plant hooks was shot to death in his home as his family watched 
berryhills two previous murder convictions and death sentences 
were overturned on appeal no trial date has been set 
meanwhile lawyers for 18yearold william scott are seeking a 
change of venue for their client who is charged with the feb 11 
strangling of addie roper the 75yearold aunt of gov joe frank 
harris 
the two cases have coincided because of a glacially slow appeals 
process for berryhill and the rapid arrest of scott together the 
two crimes serve as reminders for cartersvilles 9500 residents 
that small towns are less insular than they once were 
i guess atlanta gets closer to us every day said charles 
hurley publisher of the cartersville daily tribune news 
cartersville is a nostalgic flashback everybodys our town 
tucked among hills lakes and rivers 40 miles northwest of atlanta 
the town has had a few murders but most were easier to explain 
police maj charles siniard said 
domestic fights or armed robberies he recalled in a recent 
interview nothing like these 
both hooks and roper appeared to have been chosen at random and 
neither knew their attackers police say both times robbery was the 
motive and small change was the prize they say 
on oct 7 1974 a man forced his way into hooks home 
terrorized his family and shot hooks five times as his son then 12 
and wife watched hooks died the next day 
after he shot hooks he put the gun in the boys mouth and 
threatened to blow that boys brains all over the place said 
attorney william elsey who defended berryhill in his first trial 
berryhill then 22 with 34 prior convictions and a habit of 
getting high from sniffing varnish was convicted the following 
january and sentenced to die 
the conviction was thrown out by the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals which ruled that statements he made without a lawyer 
present were used in court a second conviction and death sentence 
were thrown out because the makeup of the jury was judged improper 
on feb 11 mrs roper was killed in her home the widow and 
retired florist was described by townspeople as everybodys aunt 
scott who had a reputation as a troublemaker in nearby cassville 
where he lived was arrested and charged within days of the killing 
siniard said it was hard to explain how mrs roper became a 
victim 
why lets say didnt the killer stop at another house 
before he got to hers there are some strange activities these days 
we keep thinking maybe it will never happen here again but it 
always will 
tim chason executive vice president of the local chamber of 
commerce raised a reward for the capture of mrs ropers killer and 
said he had no problem getting pledges for 6400 
the last time the town raised a reward he said was in the hooks 
case

israeli troops killed at least three 
palestinian guerrillas in south lebanon early today in a gunbattle 
illuminated by parachute flares after a chase through hills near 
israels border 
it was the second day in a row that israeli troops had clashed 
with guerrillas in israels selfproclaimed security zone that were 
headed for attacks in northern israel 
the israeli army showed reporters the bodies of three slain 
guerrillas at a base in northern israel displaying identification 
papers showing the dead men belonged to a syrianbased plo faction 
and saying they intended to attack an israeli settlement 
the faction the palestine liberation front said in a statement 
that the guerrillas were headed into israel for a raid 
the israeli military said the three were killed in a halfhour 
fight after a predawn chase of several hours through the hills a 
lebanese police spokesman said four guerrillas were killed 
the discrepancy could not immediately be resolved 
the police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
rules said the guerrillas were intercepted in israels security 
zone at the village of meiss eljebel shortly after midnight 
he said the israelis fired about 600 parachute flares during the 
action 
in its communique the israeli military said air force planes 
dropped the flares to light the way for the troops after they 
spotted the guerrillas near meiss eljebel about half a mile from 
the israeli border 
a soldier in the force identified only as ofer under army 
regulations told reporters at the base in northern israel that his 
sergeant opened fire on the guerrillas after spotting their hiding 
place about 20 yards away and the guerrillas fired back 
then he said the whole force joined in and threw hand 
grenades one of the terrorists opened fire and missed and then he 
was killed 
the names on the guerrillas documents were ahmed mohammed 
atallah mazen mohammed shams adin and khaled mohammed ibrahim 
also displayed to reporters were leaflets carried by the men 
which said their mission was to identify with the children of the 
stones referring to the palestinian uprising in israelioccupied 
territories 
the guerrillas carried ak47 automatic rifles with several 
magazines hand grenades three small missiles barbed wire cutters 
and photographs of members of their faction killed in earlier raid 
attempts 
todays was the fourth clash between plo guerrillas and israeli 
soldiers in less than three weeks on sunday israeli soldiers 
killed two palestinian guerrillas who entered the security zone 
at least 12 guerrillas have been killed in the clashes and no 
israelis were injured 
israel has cited the clashes in asking the united states to call 
off its dialogue with the palestine liberation organization it 
maintains they prove that plo chairman yasser arafat is violating 
his renunciation of terrorism 
maj gen yossi peled the head of northern command told israel 
radio today we are talking about intensive activity by all the 
terrorist organizations what happened last night is another stage 
the aims of these organizations hasnt changed they want to hurt 
israeli settlements 
washington ended a 13year ban on dealings with the plo and 
initiated a dialogue with the plo in december after arafat renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
arafat and his aides have said attacks against israeli military 
targets are not included in the plos definition of terrorism 
an israeli foreign ministry official said todays attempted raid 
indicated arafat could not force his entire organization to stick to 
his renunciation of terrorism 
its just one more indication that the plo doesnt control all 
the groups said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the plo serves as an umbrella group for eight guerrilla factions 
which sometimes fight among themselves and launch independent 
attacks on israeli targets the largest group is arafats mainstream 
fatah 
israel established security zone up to 10 miles deep in south 
lebanon to protect its northern border when it pulled most of its 
forces out of the region in 1985 ending a threeyear occupation

the police department is considering lifting a 
ban on recruits who have tried lsd or other hallucinogenic drugs 
we want to be current and reflect society said leroy brady 
department personnel administrator we dont want to punish what 
was experimental drug use we are losing candidates 
some department officials and beat officers question the wisdom 
of relaxing the ban while police are trying to crack down on illegal 
drugs 
id say were not lowering our standards brady said were 
looking at it from a practical standpoint of whats happening in 
society 
brady said several police agencies accept applicants who 
experimented with hallucinogens five to 10 years in the past san 
diego police havent determined the proper time frame in which they 
may allow past use of those drugs he said 
city personnel director richard snapper said his only concern is 
whether such drugs could still prompt flashbacks but he said 
weve talked to medical people and were finding the fear of 
flashbacks is unfounded 
police officials say up to 60 percent of recent applicants 
admitted drug experimentation up to 40 percent of recruits who 
passed written exams were disqualified because of past drug use 
brady said 
the ban applies to such drugs as mescaline peyote and 
phencyclidine or pcp also banned are heroin and illegal steroids 
city policy allows people who have used marijuana up to six 
months before applying to become officers cocaine use as recent as 
two years earlier also is acceptable

most foreign ministers gathered at a 
conference of islamic nations oppose saudi arabias bid to win 
formal recognition of the afghan guerrillas newly declared 
government diplomatic sources said today 
however the saudis are expected to gather enough support to 
reject irans campaign to persuade the 46member organization of the 
islamic conference to back its stand on salman rushdies novel the 
satanic verses 
saudi arabia and other islamic countries have criticized rushdie 
and banned his novel saying it blasphemes islam but they have 
refused to support the call by irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
for the british writers death 
shiites moslems who dominate in iran comprise only a tenth of 
the worlds 1 billion moslems and the iranians are clearly 
outnumbered in their bid at the conference to gain support for 
khomeinis death decree 
irans official islamic republic news agency said an iranian 
delegation headed by the deputy chief of the islamic propagation 
organization mohammad ali taskhiri left tehran on sunday to attend 
the gathering 
saudi arabia broke off diplomatic ties with iran last year 
accusing it of fomenting terrorism among shiites in the kingdom 
the saudis have been regarded for centuries as the most 
influential state within the moslem world 
king fahd inaugurated the fourday meeting today and was expected 
to deliver a lengthy speech at its first session 
only two member states saudi arabia and sudan have formally 
recognized the afghan guerrillas pakistanbased interim government 
the guerrillas are trying to topple the sovietbacked kabul 
government of president najib 
the saudis want the other group members to both recognize the 
interim government and accept it as afghanistans representative to 
the islamic organization 
the guerrillas foreign minister gulbaddin hekmatyar told 
reporters that delegations were visiting islamic countries to seek 
recognition of his government which iran opposes 
iranianbacked afghan guerrillas walked out of the conference 
that created the interim government because of a dispute over 
sharing power with more powerful pakistanibased groups 
hekmatyar said some islamic countries have put conditions 
asking for a broadbased government to be eligible for recognition 
as for the iranbased groups it is an internal problem and 
should not be taken as a pretext to delay recognition he said 
however one asian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
suggested that member governments were hesitating for other reasons 
most islamic governments dont seem to easily digest the idea 
of recognizing a rebel government because that would be a dangerous 
precedent and an unsettling example to be emulated by maverick 
political groups elsewhere in the islamic world 
the guerrillas created their interim government less than a month 
after the soviets completed their withdrawal from afghanistan 
ending a costly nineyear intervention 
the islamic representatives also planned to consider collective 
action to create an independent palestinian state 
conference sources said the ministers were expected to discuss a 
diplomatic offensive to force israel to relinquish territories it 
occupied in 1967 and accept a palestinian state there

south carolinas army national guard is 
worried too many soldiers cant read well enough to understand the 
manuals for such hightech weapons as the hawk missile apache 
attack helicopter and the m1 abrams battle tank 
the training manuals are written for 10thgraders but 40 percent 
of the enlistees tested read at the ninthgrade level or below 
according to recent tests 
adjutant gen t eston marchant estimated that 25 percent of 
those reading at the ninthgrade level or below work in hightech 
speciality areas or will when the guard finishes its modernization 
program 
there is no way guardsmen reading at the fourthgrade level can 
get trained for using that equipment much less read the field 
manuals said marchant who commands the states 15400 army and 
air national guardsmen 
he said the situation is embarrassing but added we have no 
choice its either a matter of not being able to man field and 
function as a military unit or trying to do something about it 
to close the gap the guard is encouraging enlistees to enroll in 
adult education classes to improve their reading officials said 
the reading program does not affect the states air national 
guard 
the guard will give reading tests to 12798 enlisted personnel by 
the summer said maj bill power guard spokesman as of february 
tests given to 6793 enlistees showed that 40 percent were reading 
at the ninthgrade level or below 
sixty percent of the guards enlistees read well enough to 
comprehend weapons manuals officials said to be considered 
combat ready 85 percent of a guard unit must be trained in its 
specialty areas on the hightech weaponry 
the south carolina army national guard is getting the advanced 
weaponry because it has been ranked as the countrys top outfit in 
six of the past nine years said capt jim carter guard educational 
services coordinator 
south carolinas hawk missile brigade will be activated in 
october the guard has 60 abrams tanks and 20 helicopters

extremists who hold anderson captive diminishing his prospects for

immediately after the inauguration of president bush there were 
signs that anderson might soon be freed 
she didnt specify what signs but said the political climate at 
the time was more encouraging than it had been in many months 
with the publication of rushdies book which many moslems 
consider blasphemous there has been increasing animosity between 
the two cultures she said 
but were not going to give up she said 
about 100 residents of batavia listened to a roll call of the 
hostages in a high school gymnasium sunday and heard mrs say urge 
them not to allow anderson to be forgotten

publishers exhibiting are showing support for the jewish state at a 
time when it is confronted with a declining image after 15 months of 
palestinian rebellion 
the star of the 14th jerusalem international book fair at its 
opening sunday was rushdies book which has been banned in several 
countries because many moslems consider it blasphemous the book 
prompted irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to urge moslems to hunt 
down and kill the indianborn british author 
israeli publishers at the opening called on their colleagues 
abroad to unite in condemnation of the iranian threats against 
rushdie which include a bounty of 52 million 
the history of our people and other nations in this century 
teaches us that we cant keep silent and let a bloodthirsty ruler 
pursue his criminal threats said racheli edelman of the israeli 
publishers association 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was whisked past an exhibit of 
rushdies book to avoid an encounter that could upset israels 
moslem minority he declined comment saying im just visiting 
the israeli keter publishing house proudly displayed copies of 
the novel beside a large sign the satanic verses shortly in 
hebrew 
at the jerusalem post stand an official said he sold 20 copies 
of the englishlanguage version in the first two hours of the fair 
a record for the hebrewspeaking country where the 547page novel 
costs 3270

also included are eastern bloc countries that have no diplomatic 
ties with israel poland hungary and yugoslavia 
this years fair is the largest since the weeklong biennial event 
began in 1961 said jerusalem city spokeswoman bonnie boxer 
this is another proof that jerusalem the eternal capital of 
the jewish people can overcome the difficulties and confrontations 
and appear as the heavenly jerusalem sending to the whole world 
messages of peace and justice shamir said at the opening 
security was heavy guards searched visitors purses at the 
entrance and inside other security men patrolled with portable 
radio telephones

the leader of west germanys 
jewish community today said strong showings by extreme rightist 
parties in state elections indicate a voter trend that must be 
halted to protect democracy 
the extremeright national democratic party picked up seven seats 
in the frankfurt city legislature sunday as well as seats in the 
mainkinzig district council east of hanau and in the city of bad 
hersfeld near the east german border 
the ultraright republican party gained seats in two district 
councils and in the city council of bad nauheim north of frankfurt 
in january the republicans gained 11 seats in the west berlin city 
legislature 
the farright parties support expulsion of foreign workers and 
asylumseekers from the country 
heinz galinski the head of the jewish community bitterly 
attacked the outcome 
the move to the right and the renunciation of the democratic 
parties represent the trend of the federal republic west germany 
in the 40th year of its existence galinski told the associated 
press 
galinski added the year 1989 is more suitable to reflect on 
democracy and to protect it 
in voting across hesse state the christian democrats suffered 
losses of 68 percent compared with the 1985 elections that 
includes losing power in frankfurt which the party had controlled 
for 12 years 
the leftleaning social democrats will have 40 seats in the newly 
formed city parliament the environmentalist greens 10 seats and the 
christian democrats 36 
rightwing radicalism must be decisively combated the 
christian democrats general secretary heiner geissler told hesse 
state radio 
less than two months ago the christian democrats were ousted 
from power in west berlin 
the greens and social democrats are expected to form a governing 
coalition in west berlin and christian democrats fear the same 
could happen on the federal level after next years elections 
critics claim the christian democrats are as a result trying to 
appeal to more conservative voters and have been adopting some of 
the causes of the far right 
some members of chancellor helmut kohls governing party called 
today for a revamping of its strategy 
in bonn prominent christian democratic politician juergen 
todenhoefer urged an emergency meeting of the party 
for six years the party has been experiencing one election 
fiasco after another without making any serious analysis 
afterwards he said in a letter to kohl he released a copy to the 
news media 
statewide in hesse the extreme right made gains 
the frankfurt vote gives the party a small but vocal opposition 
force in one of west germanys most important cities and its 
financial capital it is the first time since 1968 the national 
democrats have had representation in frankfurt 
in the town of woelfersheim the party won nearly 16 percent of 
the vote or more than double its results in the last elections in 
1985 
the republicans gained seats in local councils in the rheingau 
taunus district near the rhine river and in the wetterau district 
northeast of frankfurt the exact number of seats was not determined

joe clark the gettough principal 
portrayed in the movie lean on me today blamed his fiveday 
suspension on political opponents who resent his place in the 
national spotlight 
im going to give them hell clark said on abcs good 
morning america im not going to let them drive me out 
the eastside high school principal who patrols the halls with a 
bat and bullhorn was suspended by the superintendent last week over 
a school assembly featuring a sequined dancer who stripped her male 
partners down to gstrings 
clark said he seen the dance troupe perform previously and its 
show contained nothing of the inappropriateness that took place on 
that particular day 
clark said that his opponents whom he did not name engaged in 
a strange kind of sabotage 
i think the situation is being exacerbated by a few little 
gnats who need to be swatted because ive found that the city 
council and the other harbingers of doom are nothing ultimately but 
a bunch of sapsuckers who are trying to suck the juice the blood 
and the spirit from me he said 
clark has been principal for seven years his boot camp tactics 
have won as much criticism as praise from parents politicians and

only one in three of todays marriages can be 
expected to last according to a new study that says divorce and 
separation have been underreported 
the projection is contained in a study in the journal demography 
which says an apparent decline in divorces since 1980 is likely to 
have little effect on longterm prospects 
this decline may indicate a return to a more stable family 
life however it would be foolish to jump to that conclusion from 
this brief deviation from the trend said researchers larry l 
bumpass and teresa castro martin of the university of wisconsins 
center for demography 
with the marriage rate running about double that for divorces 
they note that the basic data indicate that 56 percent of recent 
first marriages would be likely to disrupt within 40 years of 
marriage 
however studies have found a serious underreporting of 
divorce and separation in the governments current population 
survey according to their study recent trends in marital 
disruption 
taking that into consideration we conclude that the best 
estimate based on these data is that about twothirds of all first 
marriages are likely to disrupt 
as high as this estimate may seem it is based on the 
assumption that a plateau in the longterm trend has in fact 
occurred the authors added 
bumpass noted in a telephone interview that published divorce 
statistics do not include separations 
population experts estimate that as many as 6 percent of 
marriages end in separation without a divorce he said that added 
to the more than 50 percent that divorce push the total near the 
twothirds range he said 
these are only estimates not precise predictions bumpass 
stressed we dont have a crystal ball he said 
the nations divorce rate rose sharply from the mid1960s through 
1980 and then seemed to reach a plateau and even slip somewhat an 
event some observers took to be a return to older family values 
this is disputed by bumpass and martin however who contend that 
the changes in this decade could occur for a number of reasons 
without any overall shift in values 
the growth in divorce after the 1960s has to reach a limit at 
some point they said plus some rate changes occur merely because 
the overall composition of society is changing 
even though the longterm increase in marital instability may 
have plateaued since 1980 the level remains very high martin and 
bumpass noted 
studies by the national center for health statistics show a 
divorce rate of 25 per 1000 people in 1966 rising to 36 in 1970 
48 in 1975 and 52 in 1980 by 1988 the rate had slipped back to 
48 according to the most recent provisional data available 
one factor no one can predict is the result of the rise in 
cohabitation bumpass added 
half of all recent marriages involve people who lived together 
first he said that means many cases in which people would formerly 
have married and later divorced now end with a couple breaking up 
before they ever get married 
concern about the spread of the deadly disease aids may also have 
contributed to this leveling off in the divorce rate the authors 
said although the changes had begun before aids became a wellknown 
issue 
no one knows whether a major social transformation is likely to 
be brought on by an aids epidemic among heterosexuals in the 
absence of such an epidemic it seems most likely that the risks of 
marital disruption will continue to increase martin and bumpass 
said 
age at marriage is among the greatest factors their study said 
with divorce or separation twice as likely for women who marry as 
teenagers 
thus the trend toward marriage at more mature ages in recent 
years is a likely factor in reducing the divorce rate they said 
the same is true for education they found 
as divorces increase among first marriages more people are 
available to tie the knot a second time and bumpass and martin 
found that second marriages were even less stable than first ones 
persons entering second marriages are by definition those 
willing to consider divorce if they are unhappy they observed 
overall second marriages were 25 percent more likely to break up 
than first marriages they found 
the study appears in the february edition of demography which is 
published by the population association of america

american bishops of the roman catholic church 
returned home after four days of meetings at the vatican today and 
said pope john paul ii and others in the church hierarchy 
recognize that it is no easy job to be a bishop especially in 
america 
archbishop john may president of the us conference of catholic 
bishops told reporters i believe that as a result of this 
meeting the bridge between rome and the united states is stronger 
than it has ever been in recent memory 
may said he and his fellow clerics have a heightened sense that 
pope john paul and the members of the curia understand our situation 
and support us in our work that they recognize that it is no easy 
job to be a bishop especially in america 
clearly there were some differences of perspective as 
might be expected in any gathering of five dozen such people but 
these differences have to do with approach and not with doctrine 
he said 
the archbishop said many of the factors that make america 
distinctive are the ones that make her great the freedom of 
thought and expression the pluralism of cultures and religions the 
democratic spirit which values the opinion of each individual 
that this would conflict at times with the hierarchical nature 
of the church is not surprising he said what we came to rome 
to say and it was received calmly and well was that this spirit of 
america must influence our own approach in the states he said 
if the summoning by the pope of the us hierarchy seemed 
extraordinary and if the two sides said not all their differences 
were meant to be resolved at the meeting americans prelates left 
the impression in earlier comments in rome that both sides agreed to 
leave things be and not pursue any substantial followup action 
cardinal bernard law of boston said he didnt see the meeting 
triggering a great moment of change in the us church 
we will continue to go about our ministry as we have in the 
past declared chicagos cardinal joseph bernardin 
vatican officials criticized the moral climate in the united 
states signaling out the efforts of planned parenthood to promote 
birth control and the greed and adultery typified by the tv series 
dallas 
at the same time they acknowledged the bishops achievements in 
working in such a highly secular atmosphere and stressed the 
influence they have on europe and the developing world 
but they also pointed to specific problems and raised questions 
on such issues as the granting of annulments the preparation of 
priests and the response to the feminist movement 
without departing from a fundamental optimism about the church 
in the us i think i must signal some matters on which we should 
work together better to insure the interest of the family was the 
way cardinal eduard gagnon the vaticans chief on family matters 
put it 
the us bishops defended their performance and said 
participation in the life of the church by americans compares 
favorably with that in other western countries they stressed that 
their work should be evaluated in the context of their democratic 
society 
this is not a meeting that has winners or losers said 
monsignor james lynch secretary of the us conference of catholic 
bishops except that truth is being served 
here is a sampling of some of the comments and giveandtake 
during the meeting that ended saturday 
on the role of the bishop 
may president of the bishops conference 
to assert that there is a church teaching with authority 
binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of contradiction to 
many americans who consider the divine right of bishops as outmoded 
as the divine right of kings accordingly bishops live and work 
constantly in this atmosphere 
cardinal joseph ratzinger the vaticans chief theologian as head 
of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith 
the criterion for the truth is such that its worth suffering 
for it those who announce the gospel must also be martyrs in the 
most profound sense of the word 
on american democracy 
cardinal bernardin of chicago 
we work our destiny in full view of the publics eye this is 
an element of our ministry that we are not always able to control 
perhaps this is a special blessing of our experience although some 
would see it as a mixed blessing 
on the declining number of priests 
cardinal william baum an american who heads the vaticans 
congregation for catholic education 
a positive approach to vocations must shrug off the pressures 
to mute the priesthood that come from people who want women priests 
married priests parttime priests or simply optional celibacy 
archbishop daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati 
how attractive is a lifetime of service in a culture which 
stresses selfsatisfaction and in which lifetime commitment seems 
more and more difficult even in marriage 
on annulments and marriage 
archbishop achille silvestrini prefect of the holy sees highest 
court pointed out that of the 45632 annulments granted worldwide 
in 1986 36180 were in the united states 
archbishop john quinn of san francisco 
by providing a place where families can socialize together with 
others who share their commitment to the person and message of 
christ the parishes of the united states help to compensate for the 
rootlessness and lack of social and religious support that are 
inherent in our society with its secularistic stance and high 
mobility 
on feminism 
cardinal gagnon the canadian who heads the pontifical council 
for the family 
it is evident that ideological feminism has a deterious 
influence on the family but conversely the best way to counter its 
influence will be to care more about the family and make every one 
in it more conscious of his or her vocation to serve and not to be 
served as christ has taught us 
on mass attendance 
archbishop daniel kucera of dubuque iowa 
nearly onehalf of american catholics attend sunday mass each 
week the vast majority receive holy communion at these masses 
while this statistic shows a greater level of participation than in 
many other developed western countries we are seeking more 
effective ways of encouraging participation of nonpracticing 
catholics

federal officials hope that a conviction in the 
sky piracy trial of fawaz younis will send a message to potential 
terrorists that the united states has a long arm that can haul them 
to justice 
you can send that hijacker a message justice department 
lawyer karen morrissette said in her closing argument to the jury 
the panel of seven women and five men resumed deliberations today 
critics say that even conviction and life imprisonment for younis 
would do little to dissuade hijackers and that acquittal would be 
at best costly and embarrassing and could undermine americas 
counterterrorism efforts 
the us government has gone to enormous effort and expense to 
capture and try younis who admitted on the stand that he led a band 
from lebanons amal militia in hijacking royal jordanian airlines 
flight 402 from beirut on june 11 1985 
two americans were held hostage in the hijacking no one was 
killed 
critics of the government cite the relative obscurity of younis 
who was a minor figure in amal a shiite moslem group that controls 
most of west beirut 
he is no abu nidal said terrorism expert neil livingstone of 
a far more notorious terrorist leader 
moreover trial by an american jury is not the most effective 
weapon against terrorists who generally come from regions torn by 
violence and lawlessness said another thinktank specialist robert 
kupperman 
terrorism should be treated as a national security issue and 
not as a criminal justice issue said kupperman of the center for 
strategic and international studies in washington 
jailing younis wont end world terrorism but it could be a small 
step in that direction respond supporters of the government policy 
the trial of younis is part of a coherent policy on 
terrorism said bruce hoffman a terrorism specialist at the rand 
corp in california 
younis may not be abu nidal but you have to start somewhere 
in developing legal precedents for apprehending trying and 
convicting terrorists said hoffman 
the message is that if you are going to attack us citizens 
and property we are going to come looking for you and if we catch 
you you will get a fair trial and if you are guilty will be 
convicted said hoffman 
victoria toensing a deputy assistant attorney general who helped 
plan the younis case described the trial as a victory for 
cooperation among the justice state and defense departments and the 
first test of a 1984 statute under which the united states asserts 
jurisdiction over cases involving the taking of us hostages abroad 
not only did we use the longarm statute for the first time 
but we showed that we could capture one of these defendants under 
the law and bring him back and try him she said 
younis was lured aboard a yacht and arrested in international 
waters in the mediterranean sea on sept 13 1987 by a team 
including the fbi hostage rescue squad the us military and 
intelligence agencies 
federal officials have not disclosed the cost of the younis case 
but besides paying the salaries of the fbi agents intelligence 
operatives sailors pilots lawyers and federal marshals involved 
the government has relocated and given new identities to at least 15 
middle easterners under the witness protection program 
in deciding to grab younis instead of a bigger fish said 
toensing government officials were swayed by the strong case 
against him 
there are always several possibilities out there you have a 
combination of the getability of somebody plus the case ready to 
go to trial she said and a conviction against younis could open 
the season on bigger fish 
look at dope dealing bigwigs dont touch the stuff it is 
always harder to get the top guy they always send underlings 
said toensing who served as deputy assistant attorney general in 
the criminal division for four years in the reagan administration 
she left the government for private practice last august

discovery and its five crewmen waited 
out bad weather and thundered into orbit today to deploy a 100 
million satellite that completes a network giving astronauts almost 
unbroken radio contact with earth 
the 113ton winged spaceship also carrying four crippled white 
rats and 32 chicken eggs among its scientific experiments vaulted 
off its seaside launch pad into a cloudless sky at 957 am est 
liftoff was delayed one hour and 50 minutes to allow fog to burn off 
and nasa computers to adjust the shuttles path to compensate for 
shifting highaltitude winds 
nasa reported 8 minutes after liftoff that discovery had 
achieved a successful orbit 180 miles above the earth 
all systems are clean as a whistle mission control 
commentator brian welch reported from houston 
the flight postponed for nearly a month by mechanical faults is 
the third since the challenger disaster more than three years ago 
and starts nasa on an ambitious schedule calling for seven shuttle 
launches in 1989 
its a great start to a long launch season launch director 
bob sieck told a news conference he said that except for the 
weather the countdown was virtually faultfree 
a 700foot geyser of flame trailed the 15 billion craft as it 
rolled onto its desired course and sped toward orbit 
more than 45000 people jammed viewing areas along nearby 
beaches roads and river banks to watch the blazing departure of the 
28th space shuttle flight 
two minutes and six seconds after liftoff the flight passed a 
critical milestone when the two solid fuel booster rockets burned 
out and jettisoned on schedule into the atlantic ocean the failure 
of a booster rocket joint led to the loss of challenger and its 
sevenperson crew 
six hours into the flight the astronauts were to perform the 
main task of the mission deploying the 2ton tracking and data 
relay satellite it then was to be carried by its own rocket to a 
22300milehigh orbit to join two older satellites and complete an 
orbiting network essential for communicating with future space 
shuttles and with science and military satellites 
with the new satellite operational mission control will be able 
to communicate with an orbiting shuttle 85 percent of the time in 
contrast with the old system of ground stations which provided only 
15 percent coverage nasa plans to shut six of those ground stations 
at a monthly savings of 3 million 
immediately on reaching orbit commander michael l coats pitched 
the shuttles nose down so crewmate dr james m bagian could 
photograph the 154foottall external fuel tank as it drifted away 
toward a breakup over the indian ocean 
on the last shuttle mission atlantis thermal tiles were 
severely damaged by insulation that stripped off the tank after it 
was hit by debris that fell off one of the solid fuel booster 
rockets 
modifications were made to correct the problem and todays 
photographs should show if any more insulation came off 
jim got some real good pictures of the tank from the overhead 
window coats reported we can see it real well 
coats and his crew were awakened at 316 am and in a surprise 
showed up for breakfast wearing business suits and ties fine china 
and candles adorned the table for the steak and eggs feast 
wearing the suits instead of the normal casual wear apparently 
was a tongueincheek response to word that nasa was trying to curb 
astronauts penchant for fun officials reportedly were annoyed by a 
televised show two missions ago when the crew floated through the 
shuttle cabin wearing colorful hawaiian shirts 
flying with coats a 43yearold navy captain are air force col 
john e blaha 46 the pilot marine cols james f buchli 43 and 
robert c springer 46 and bagian 36 a physician coats and 
buchli have flown on previous shuttle flights 
discovery originally was set for liftoff feb 18 but the launch 
was postponed four times by the need to replace faulty or suspect 
engine parts 
shuttle chief richard truly said the success of this mission is 
absolutely vital to nasas continued recovery from the 
challenger accident and the agencys move toward safe routine 
onceamonth shuttle launches by 1992 
following the flight the 1989 shuttle schedule lists the launch 
of the magellan probe to venus in april secret defense department 
payloads in july and august the galileo mission to jupiter in 
october a communications satellite in november and the hubble space 
telescope in december 
coats said the first two postchallenger flights by discovery 
in september and atlantis in december were important to show 
that we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe 
the next step coats said is to prove we can do it on a 
regular basis that were back in the business of space to show 
were a spacefaring nation again 
the mission is filled with scientific experiments the rats with 
chips of bone cut from their legs are to be studied to determine 
how well broken bones heal in the weightlessness of space 
the animals will be compared with a ground control group of four 
rats researchers believe healing will be slower in space because 
astronauts have suffered loss of calcium during flights 
the experiment is an important step toward learning how well a 
broken human bone might mend during long flights aboard a space 
station or on a trip to mars 
also aboard is a special 70 mm imax camera to photograph 
deteriorating areas of the earth 
theyre trying to produce a movie that shows the earth as a 
very fragile thing in the universe and that maybe everybody on earth 
ought to pay a little attention to not destroying it blaha said 
in a recent interview 
the astronauts also will conduct experiments to determine the 
effects of weightlessness on plant cell division the growth of 
protein crystals and the development of chicken embryos 
discovery is to remain in orbit for five days one hour seven 
minutes landing saturday at edwards air force base in california

president bush today called for throwing the 
book at ocean dumpers and vowed to support more aggressive 
criminal prosecution against them and other despoilers of the 
environment 
promising to chart a course of environmental activism bush told 
a group of state attorneys general that on many issues the time 
for study has passed 
the president said his administration would soon submit to 
congress legislation to reauthorize the clean air act and to set 
new standards to reduce industrial emissions that cause acid rain 
he also said he favors stepping up the superfund cleanup program 
and assuring compliance with hazardous waste laws 
and bush told the white house session i think working with 
you all we can do a lot of throwing the book at those engaged in 
illegal ocean dumping 
he told the legal officers they should closely study the cases 
now before the involving environmental abuse id like you to 
think about the most serious cases where weve got to move beyond 
civil penalties toward criminal enforcement he said 
bush said criminal charges brought against those who abuse the 
environment would serve both as a sanction and as a deterrent 
he praised states for taking the lead on environmental issues and 
said were going to find solutions and weve got to find state 
and federal roles that work 
in his 10minute address the president focused exclusively on 
the environment and on the war on drugs 
as i look at your agenda its clear to me that this 
association and the white house are fighting the same battles 
bush said 
he characterized drugs as like a chemical weapons that a 
society turns on itself and declared weve got to see our 
great cities no longer held hostage to drug lords 
the president got good marks for his talk

the senate is moving quickly on the nomination 
of rep dick cheney rwyo as defense secretary with hearings on 
president bushs replacement for john tower to begin tuesday it was 
announced today 
house republican leader robert michel and sens alan simpson and 
malcolm wallop rwyo will formally introduce cheney to the senate 
armed services committee said pete williams a spokesman for cheney 
the opening of hearings was scheduled for tuesday afternoon the 
committee announced 
williams said cheney spent this morning in briefings at the white 
house and was expected to go to the pentagon later in the day 
bush selected cheney after the senate rejected tower last 
thursday by a 5347 vote one member of the armed services committee 
expressed hope today that consideration of cheney could be wrapped 
by by weeks end when the senate begins a twoweek recess 
sen timothy wirth dcolo said on nbcs today show the 
more rapidly we get through this the better i would hope we could 
be done by the end of this week 
the senate also turns this week to impeachment charges against 
district judge alcee l hastings of miami accused of plotting to 
obtain a 150000 bribe and lying about it at his 1983 conspiracy 
trial 
the congressional agenda includes new house ethics committee 
sessions on speaker jim wright dtexas plus possible legislative 
action on the eastern airlines strike and a senate vote on increased 
job protection for government whistleblowers who report waste 
fraud and abuse 
the 52yearold hastings the first black district judge in 
florida was acquitted in the 1983 trial but now faces an effort to 
remove him from the bench and take away his 89500 salary 
hastings attorney terence j anderson maintains that the trial 
should have settled the matter and that th impeachment effort 
prompted by complaints from fellow judges represents a classic case 
of double jeopardy 
anderson also claims that hastings cannot receive a fair hearing 
because key witnesses have died and many senators are not planning 
to attend the hearings at which evidence will be presented instead 
they plan to rely on videotapes of the proceedings 
the house approved a 17count bill of impeachment 4133 on aug 
3 alleging that hastings plotted with prominent washington lawyer 
william borders to obtain a payoff from two brothers convicted in 
hastings court of skimming money from a teamsters pension fund loan 
it also says hastings perjured himself in testimony at the trial 
and in an unrelated count that he improperly divulged information 
obtained from a wiretap and thus torpedoed a federal investigation 
house prosecutors say impeachment is not the same as a criminal 
proceeding and thus the double jeopardy argument does not apply 
the senate plans to hear arguments wednesday and decide thursday 
whether to dismiss the charges 
meanwhile the house ethics committee starts closeddoor 
deliberations this week on six broad allegations that wright used 
his office for personal financial gain and improperly lobbied 
government regulators 
under tight secrecy the panel of six democrats and six 
republicans has held two weeks of hearings to determine whether 
disciplinary action is warranted the defense is set to wrap up its 
presentation tuesday 
chairman julian dixon dcalif said deliberations could take 
two or three days with final action possibly spilling into next week 
among other things wright stands accused of skirting outside 
income limits through bulk sales of a book and accepting free use of 
a luxury car and fort worth condominium 
wright mailed letters to texas constituents last month saying 
the case represents a politically motivated game of sack the 
quarterback 
if they cant injure you and knock you out of the game which 
is their first choice then theyll try at least to batter you 
around enough to spoil your concentration wright said 
the house plans to take up a measure that would establish an 
emergency board to find a way to end the international association 
of machinists strike against eastern approval of the laborbacked 
bill is likely in the house but the senate could prove less 
receptive to the measure which is opposed by the white house 
the democratic chairmen and senior republicans on the house and 
senate budget committees plan to meet through the week with white 
house budget director richard darman in a continuation of talks 
that began last thursday 
the group is seeking agreement on at least the rough outlines of 
a spending plan for fiscal 1990 before congress leaves march 23 for 
its easter recess they will try to find a combination of spending 
restraints and new revenue that would reduce the federal deficit to 
100 billion 
the house education and labor committee on tuesday considers a 
raise in the minimum wage to 465 an hour from its current 335 
it is similar to a plan that already has cleared its committee 
hurdle in the senate 
the plan is advancing under threat of a presidential veto with 
bush calling for a version that includes a lower training wage 
and increases of 30 cents an hour every year for three years 
lawmakers are shooting for house floor action before easter but 
the senate is unlikely to act before april 
elsewhere the senate plans a vote on steppedup job protection 
for federal employees who expose squandering and mismanagement 
under the bill a compromise between senate sponsors and the 
administration reached last week whistleblowers would have to be 
reinstated in their posts if they could show reprisal for such 
actions contributed to their firing or demotion 
stripped from the bill under the compromise was a provision 
approved last year that would have allowed a special government 
counsel to go to court on behalf of whistleblowers 
president reagan pocket vetoed last years version after 
unanimous approval by both houses saying it would result in the 
government filing suit against itself

the us ambassador and a judge 
hailed an armed forces decision to turn nine men linked to the 
massacre of 10 peasants over to civilian authority 
the high command of the armed forces is admitting that their 
earlier versions of the massacre have not held up under 
examination and were wrong scurrilous us ambassador william 
walker said sunday 
but he added it is too early to tell if the development signals 
an end to the militarys traditional immunity from prosecution in 
human rights cases 
the military initially blamed the sept 21 slayings on the 
guerrillas but reversed itself after months of investigation by 
journalists and civilian authorities and pressure from the united 
states 
in a statement sunday the military admitted that soldiers 
massacred the 10 peasants in the hamlet of san francisco it called 
the slayings a grave violation of normal operating procedures 
and said a major a second lieutenant two staff sergeants a 
corporal and four privates will be put at the disposition of 
civilian judicial authorities 
judge alcides guandique of the court in san sebastian that is 
handling the cases also said the admission demonstrates the 
professionalism of the armed forces that they are concerned about 
individual rights and that laws and constitutional principles must 
be respected and enforced 
it demonstrates that there is no law above the law of the 
constitution he said 
no salvadoran military officer has been indicted or tried for a 
human rights abuse despite the torture and murder of thousands of 
suspected leftists or their sympathizers during the nineyear civil 
war the salvadoran military generally denies any involvement in 
rightwing death squad activity 
only eight lowerranking members of the security forces have been 
convicted in human rights cases among them five national guardsmen 
convicted in the dec 2 1980 slayings of four american churchwomen 
the militarys announcement comes a week before salvadorans go to 
the polls to elect a new president for their usbacked government 
outgoing president jose napoleon duarte did not comment on the 
case in a televised speech sunday in which he asked guerrillas of 
the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front to lift a 
traffic ban designed to reinforce a rebelcalled election boycott 
the announcement also came after a year of rising violence on 
both sides in the stalemated civil war that has claimed 70000 
lives most of them civilian 
the united states which provides el salvador with about 15 
million in aid daily has been pressing for action in the sept 21 
massacre the worst mass slaying of civilians in four years 
during a visit last month vice president dan quayle told the 
military high command that the guilty soldiers and officers should 
be found and punished 
the military initially said the 10 victims were guerrillas who 
died in fierce combat with the 5th brigades jiboa battalion 
but witnesses said soldiers from the battalion blew up or shot 
seven men and three women in san francisco after detaining most of 
the residents and accusing them of being rebel sympathizers 
san francisco is a village of about 15 families about 30 miles 
east of san salvador the brigade is based in nearby san vincente 
about 40 miles east of the capital 
after news reports based on interviews with witnesses 
contradicted the first military version the military changed its 
story to say ten detained peasants were killed when rebels ambushed 
a patrol 
finally in a nationally televised speech sunday defense 
minister gen carlos eugenio vides casanova said there was no 
ambush his speech praised the armed forces and contained only brief 
comments on the massacre 
the new version says the peasants were killed after being 
detained for involvement in the activities of subversive 
organizations it said the peasants possessed explosives and 
propaganda 
the armed forces said the major an intelligence officer 
identified as maj mauricio beltran granados ordered the peasants 
killed beltran granados and several other jiboa battalion members 
have been detained 
a source familiar with the investigation said the major had a 
history of involvement in past human rights abuses 
the 5th brigade commander col jose emilio chavez caceres was 
relieved of command during the inquiry the military statement said 
he will be reinstated because his subordinates lied to him and he is 
innocent of wrongdoing

residents of the northern united states were treated to a rare 
display of the northern lights this morning and a scientist 
said there is a good chance of more celestial light shows all week 
clouds blocked the show for many but people in several states 
including colorado new york and delaware saw the night sky glow 
various colors from a whitish green to a brilliant red late sunday 
and early today the national weather service reported 
ron king of radio station ksl in salt lake city described the 
lights which appeared over the great salt lake about 4 am mst 
today as a shimmering cloud in the sky of vivid reds and 
purples that lasted for about a half hour 
the northern lights or aurora borealis are usually visible only 
near the arctic circle 
the phenomenon is believed to result from the interaction of tiny 
charged particles from the sun with gases in the earths upper 
atmosphere 
a solar flare reported thursday described by experts as the 
largest in five years apparently triggered the unusually widespread 
northern lights 
joe allen solarterrestrial expert at the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration in boulder colo said observatories 
from san juan puerto rico to honolulu detected the shower of tiny 
charged particles sunday night 
all of them have a beautiful record of the event it started 
about 630 pm mst sunday and kept increasing over a period of at 
least nine hours he said today 
allen said there was a good chance all week of further displays 
of northern lights across the northern third of the united states 
in delaware on sunday state police received reports from 
residents about strangely lit clouds police concluded it was the 
aurora borealis after checking for reports of military rocket tests 
or power plant problems in the region 
researchers reported that thursdays huge eruption of gas from 
the surface of the sun was followed by another large explosion 
friday morning and three more on saturday all in the same area of 
the sun 
its a very disturbed area probably two to three earths in 
diameter said tom folkers a technical specialist and telescope 
operator at kitt peak national observatory near tucson ariz 
besides causing the aurora borealis solar flares can disrupt 
radio communications

the two reusable solid booster 
rockets that powered the shuttle discovery toward orbit appeared in 
good condition to the crew on the ships that saw them splash into 
the atlantic ocean an official said monday 
the two recovery ships were about 10 miles away from where the 
rockets hit the water 160 miles offshore according to michael 
hardee who works at nasas marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala 
the ships reached the rockets 45 minutes later and circled them 
once before beginning the process of retrieval to tow them in that 
will take at least a day 
the rockets separated from the shuttle 2 minutes 6 seconds after 
liftoff and hit the water about five minutes after that 
after the fuel is spent each casing weighs about 165000 pounds 
the boosters were completely redesigned after the failure of one 
of their joints was blamed for the explosion that destroyed 
challenger after liftoff on jan 28 1986 the new models have 
performed well on the two previous flights

the internal revenue service is auditing the 
finances of 23 television ministries and expects the probe could 
jeopardize the federal tax exemption of some evangelists 
the service is continuing to devote significant examination 
resources to media evangelist cases robert i brauer assistant 
irs commissioner in charge of exempt organizations said in a letter 
to rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the house ways and means 
oversight subcommittee pickle released the report monday 
because of privacy laws the report did not mention the 
ministries by name identifying them only by number brauer outlined 
key issues against the 23 most of which are suspected of not fully 
reporting their income engaging in political activities or 
allowing their earnings to benefit officials of the ministry 
the irs stepped up its examination of tv ministries after the 
wellpublicized sexandbribery scandal at the ptl organization 
headed by jim bakker 
ptl which apparently is ministry no 15 in the report is in 
bankruptcy court where the irs is pressing claims that bakker and 
his associates failed to pay tax on unrelated business income such 
as from rental of ptls satellite network failed to report some 
income and used ptl contributions for their own enrichment 
including acceptance of salaries that the irs contends were 
excessive 
brauer said he expects several of the tv ministry cases will 
move to the final stages of the examination process this year 
we also anticipate that some of these cases will present 
serious issues relating to continued federal income tax exemption 
brauer said 
brauers cover letter said two organizations connected with 
former republican presidential candidate pat robertson have refused 
to provide records of the type that other tv ministries have 
provided voluntarily 
because the freedom council and the national freedom institute 
would not cooperate the letter stated the irs had to go to federal 
court in norfolk va to seek to enforce a summons for the records 
the degree of cooperation received by the service varies from 
case to case and in one case involving a prominent evangelist the 
service has reached agreement on federal tax issues for the years 
1980 through 1983 including payment of substantial federal income 
tax interest and penalties brauer wrote 
here are highlights of the report which was current through dec 
31 
ministry no 1 was engaged in a lifestyle that led the irs to 
believe that some income was not reported acting on an informants 
tip the criminal investigation division prepared a case that has 
been referred to a federal grand jury 
no 4 irs agents are reviewing content of tv broadcasts to 
determine whether they were primarily political 
no 8 a team of auditors and a computer specialist are 
investigating allegations of political activities lobbying and 
personal enrichment from ministry funds 
no 11 as a result of a newspaper story the irs is auditing 
the ministers individual tax return the minister is not 
cooperating 
no 12 a computer picked this ministers return for audit on 
grounds of unsubstantiated deductions the case was closed with 
payment of 3000 tax and penalties 
no 16 the irs has completed review of the books and records 
for this ministry for 1984 through 1986 the chief issue is whether 
taxdeductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefit 
of the founder and his family alleged political activities also are 
being reviewed 
no 20 the ministers personal tax return was audited he was 
alleged to have channeled church assets to personal use the case 
was closed when he reported additional taxable income

joint ussouth korea military 
maneuvers involving about 200000 soldiers begin tuesday amid 
repeated warnings from north korea that the exercises push the 
peninsula closer to war 
the 10day team spirit exercises an annual event since 1976 
will last until march 23 and take place in various parts of the 
country officials from south korea and the united states said 
monday 
as in past years the emphasis will be on improving defensive 
readiness of the two countries the officials said 
president roh taewoo visiting a command post north of seoul 
said the exercises are needed to guard the safety of south korea 
against invasion from north korea 
the latest situations on the peninsula are pointing to the 
danger of a war and a close security alliance between the two 
countries the united states and south korea is really needed 
roh said 
north korea has protested the maneuvers in past years it put its 
army on combat alert over the weekend and issued another protest 
monday 
the tension between the north and the south has been screwed up 
to the highest pitch and a dangerous situation has been created on 
the korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment said 
pyongyangs official korean central news agency 
the peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
capitalist south korea at the end of world war ii when us and 
soviet troops ended japans colonial rule over the region the two 
koreas have remained bitter enemies and fought a war from 1950 to 
1953 
a us military spokesman in seoul said this years team 
spirit involve about 70000 american troops including 43000 
stationed in south korea and 27000 from hawaii okinawa and the 
us mainland 
as in previous years south korea invited north korea and china 
to observe the exercises the two communist nations rejected all 
past invitations and there was no response as of monday 
officials of the united nations command speculated the team 
spirit controversy was behind north koreas request for a meeting 
of the korean military armistice commission the watchdog body set 
up to monitor the 1953 korean war armistice agreement 
north korea asked for a session friday but gave no reason the 
un command proposed it be held saturday 
also monday the south korean government said it spent more for 
us troops stationed in the country than any other nation in the 
world last year 
the report by the defense ministry said an active publicity 
campaign is needed to make washington understand that south koreas 
share of defense burden is greater than those of nato and japan 
according to the report seouls support for the 43000 us 
troops in south korea was worth 22 billion last year 313 million 
more than in 1987

thirtytwo fertilized eggs courtesy 
of kentucky fried chicken are whirling through space aboard 
discovery along with four white rats to test how weightlessness 
affects growth and broken bones 
the projects both designed by students are among five 
experiments to be conducted during the fiveday shuttle mission 
which began monday and is to end saturday 
the chicken embryo experiment developed by college senior john 
vellinger is a copy of one destroyed in the challenger explosion 
jan 28 1986 
vellingers experiment nicknamed chix in space is an 
incubator containing 32 eggs half of which were fertilized two days 
prior to launch and half nine days before 
a copy of the same experiment will be conducted on the ground 
said vellinger a senior in mechanical engineering at purdue 
university the eggs on the ground will be turned to mimic the 
action a mother hen would take to keep the developing yolk from 
sinking 
but in zero gravity the yolks should float in the center and not 
have to be turned said the 23yearold student who first thought 
of the idea as a ninthgrader in lafayette ind 
after the flight half of each group will be opened and the 
remaining half will be allowed to hatch both sets will be studied 
to determine the effects of weightlessness on the growing embryo 
the experiment may one day help scientists determine whether a human 
fetus could develop normally in space vellinger said 
richard m detwiler spokesman for louisville kybased kentucky 
fried chicken said nasa approached the company several years ago 
about sponsoring the project 
it was an exciting educational program worthy of our support 
detwiler said adding tongueincheek and if it helps us crack 
the exterrestrial chicken market then all the better 
detwiler said the company had spent more than 50000 on the 
project vellinger has been a summer intern at the companys 
engineering department 
for the rat experiment a veterinarian removed a small piece of 
bone from the rear leg of 
shortly before liftoff four of the rats were put on the shuttle 
while the others remain on earth 
this is an extremely nontraumatic procedure said student 
andrew fras when asked about using animals for experiments they 
should be carrying on as normal about an hour after the procedure is 
done 
fras a 22yearold medical student at brown university who was 
in high school in binghamton ny when he thought of the idea 
hopes the test will show whether weightlessness and the loss of 
calcium that bones sustain during spaceflights inhibit the healing 
process 
after the flight all eight rats will be killed so the bones 
mending processes can be studied and compared 
the project has been criticized as cruel and unnecessary by 
people for the ethical treatment of animals an animal rights group 
based in washington 
whatever happens to the bones of those rats in space is not 
going to keep people from engaging in space travel said 
spokeswoman mary beth sweetland 
oots grow in space 
researchers are flying samples of the common daylilly and a weed 
named happlopappis gracilis the results may lead to a better 
understanding of plant growth on earth and should provide 
information on how to grow plants on the space station the moon or 
mars 
a device that may be used as a cooling system aboard the space 
station also is being be tested on discovery 
the space station heat pipe advanced radiator element resembling 
a giant slat of a venetian blind is riding in the payload bay it 
consists of two small pipes bored through an aluminum core that runs 
through the center of a 51footlong footwide radiator 
the device uses liquid ammonia that is vaporized by heat 
generated by various shuttle systems the vapor carries the heat the 
length of the radiator through the larger vapor pipe and the 
radiator dissipates into space leaving cooled condensed ammonia 
that can be recirculated 
another experiment the protein crystal growth project has flown 
on several missions crystals can be grown on earth but gravity 
causes them to sink and fuse together 
samples of 15 different proteins are on discovery including 
renin an enzyme that plays a major role in controlling blood 
pressure and porcine elastase an enzyme involved in the 
degradation of lung tissue in people suffering from emphysema 
the crystals could help scientists determine the proteins 
molecular structure and speed development of drugs to combat their 
ill effects

a federal law enforcement official today said 
two middle easternlooking men were in will rogers neighborhood 
looking for the home of the uss vincennes skipper in the weeks 
before a van driven by his wife was bombed 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was 
not clear if investigators had been able to piece together detailed 
descriptions of the two men the information was based on interviews 
with neighbors the official said 
rogers commanded the missile cruiser that mistakenly shot down an 
iranian airliner in the persian gulf last july killing all 290 
people aboard 
rogers wife sharon was driving the van alone friday when the 
bomb exploded destroying the vehicle mrs rogers wasnt injured 
on sunday the fbi appealed for information about the bombing 
we would like to find somebody who saw something very 
suspicious and out of place fbi spokesman gene riehl said 
were looking for people who saw anything suspicious 
investigators remained uncertain today whether the bomb was the 
work of terrorists retaliating for the jetliners downing 
the law enforcement official who said the men were spotted asking 
where the navy captain lived spoke following a report in todays new 
york times that a man of middle eastern appearance asked passersby 
where does the captain live 
the fbi described the bomb as an improvised explosive device 
that wasnt made by the military and may have been homemade types 
of such devices include pipe bombs riehl said 
tom hughes head of the bureaus san diego office said it will 
take a lengthy analysis to determine exactly what type of bomb was 
used 
fbi laboratory experts spent sunday sifting through three drums 
filled with debris collected at the intersection where thken to an undisclosed 
fbi garage riehl 
said 
fbi officials also met sunday with representatives of the naval 
investigative service the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms san diego police and the coers had driven the van earlier friday 
for a regular trip to a 
nearby doughnut shop and he thought he may have been the intended 
target said sen pete wilson rcalif who talked with the captain 
hughes and dennis usery regional director of the naval 
investigative service met sunday with the rogerses they have been 
under the protection of nis agents at an undisclosed location since 
shortly after the bombing 
i think the meeting was more to reassure them a little bit or 
to help them through their trouble riehl said 
usery described the couple as being in good spirits and said 
the security for them would continue indefinitely 
chief petty officer craig huebler a spokesman for the san diego 
naval base said navy officials are awaiting fbi findings to 
determine when the couple will return to work rogers remains in 
command of the vincennes whose home port is san diego and mrs 
rogers is a teacher 
an iranian newspaper sunday blamed the fbi for the bombing 
saying washington tried to implicate iran in the attack to justify 
deportation of iranian students 
riehl declined to comment on the claim but in washington fbi 
spokeswoman kathy kennedy denied it and added we have never made 
any linkage to iran since this incident happened 
we havent gotten to the point in the investigation where we 
could make such a linkage she said 
the englishlanguage newspaper kayhan international linked the 
alleged us plot to western anger at ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
order that novelist salman rushdie be killed for his new novel 
the satanic verses 
the bombing will not be the last attempt to implicate iran 
over the rushdie controversy the editorial said

christian army units and moslem militiamen 
clashed monday in heavy artillery duels across beirut and police 
said one person was injured 
eight mortar rounds fired from moslem west beiruts eein mriesseh 
district crashed into the armycontrolled city harbor forcing 
several merchant ships to sail into open waters a police spokesman 
said 
army troops at the port fired back there was no report of any 
vessel being hit said the spokesman who cannot be identified under 
standing rules 
both sides also battled with machine guns rocketpropelled 
grenades and 106mm recoilless guns in downtown beiruts old 
commercial district straddling the port the spokesman said at least 
one passerby was wounded 
mortar shells also were lobbed into the christian residential 
district of jommaizeh and at the syrianmanned 40story unfinished 
murr tower skyscraper according to the spokesman 
the port bombardment came a few hours after the reopening of 
beiruts international airport which was closed saturday by the 
christian cabinet in lebanons dual government it broke a 
ceasefire that had been declared at midnight 
the rival moslem cabinet had threatened to sever lebanons sea 
links with the outside world in retaliation for the airport closure 
the decision dated march 11 to temporarily close beirut airport 
has been cancelled and flight operations are to resume at once 
said christian public works minister edgar malouf 
the sudden security deterioration that warranted the closure of 
the airport has now ceased to exist malouf said 
about 30 minutes later a jetliner of the lebanese cargo carrier 
transmediterranean airways left for amsterdam another tma plane 
left later for sharjah in the united arab emirates both planes were 
empty airport officials said 
a middle east airlines spokesman assad khorshid said mea 
flights would resume once international insurance companies give 
us the green light 
international insurance companies on sunday advised mea 
lebanons national carrier they had temporarily suspended insurance 
on its passengers and aircraft 
six people have died since wednesday in christianmoslem clashes 
around the city 
the violence was touched off when the army commander gen michel 
aoun who also heads the christian cabinet began enforcing an air 
and sea blockade aimed at illegal harbors operated by moslem and 
christian militias 
hostilities focused on the strategic christianheld town of souk 
elgharb which controls a network of roads leading from druseheld 
mountains to the christian heartland the town is 15 miles southeast 
of beirut 
the deserted summer resort whose 15000 residents fled early in 
lebanons nearly 14yearold civil war is surrounded by druse 
artillery positions 
the conservative beirut newspaper addiyar said a compromise was 
under consideration to resolve the crisis over illegal ports which 
militias use to bring in arms supplies and imported goods sold in 
the areas they control 
according to the report the compromise would include a freeze of 
the port blockade stationing of customs officers and police by the 
moslem cabinet in the harbors and deposits of port taxes at the 
central bank which would handle the money in coordination with the 
christian and moslem cabinets 
the fighting has imperiled efforts to resolve a political crisis 
that has left lebanon without a president since sept 22 when 
president amin gemayels term expired 
minutes before he stepped down gemayel named aoun a fellow 
maronite catholic as head of an interim military cabinet moslems 
and leftists rejected the appointment and pledged allegiance to 
salim hoss a sunni moslem who governed under gemayel

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane testified today that he never told oliver north to lie to 
congress about his activities on behalf of the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
asked whether he discussed with north being less than 
truthful to congress mcfarlane responded 
not per se you do not lie to congress in my experience 
often congressmen do not tell us everything on their agenda 
and the executive branch did not always tell the congress 
everything on its agenda you put your own interpretation on it 
you present the truth as it best explains your behavior 
mcfarlane said he told north that whatever we said would 
engender criticism from the congress and that north agreed 
four of the 12 criminal charges against north are that he made 
false statements or obstructed congress by denying to two 
congressional panels in 1985 that he was involved with the contras 
queries to mcfarlane came in letters from rep lee hamilton 
dind then chairman of the house intelligence committee and 
former rep michael barnes dmd then chairman of the house 
subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs 
testifying for the second day at norths trial mcfarlane 
acknowledged under questioning by prosecutor john keker that north 
did not tell him everything about his involvement with private 
fundraising on behalf of the contras 
mcfarlane said he questioned north in the late summer of 1985 
when congress was asking about norths activities in response to 
news reports about norths activities the inquiries were during a 
twoyear congressional ban on military aid to the guerrillas 
mcfarlane said he questioned north closely about his activities 
because of six memos written earlier by north to mcfarlane 
suggesting that north was deeply involved with the guerrillas 
this was a very thorough kind of discussion the two of us had 
on more than one occasion mcfarlane said i believe i had a 
clear understanding and he was very emphatic in saying at no time 
did i break the law on fundraising 
mcfarlane said north told him he made speeches on behalf of the 
contras but never solicited contributions because as a federal 
employee he was prohibited from doing so 
keker asked mcfarlane whether north told him about his 
involvement with the national endowment for the preservation of 
liberty a taxexempt organization that raised money for the contras 
no responded mcfarlane 
mcfarlane also said north didnt tell him that he was controlling 
the flow of donations sent through nepl to the contras 
the former national security adviser also said north told him 
nothing of his ties to richard miller a public relations consultant 
who funneled money for the contras out of the united states to a 
cayman islands bank account 
mcfarlane said he also questioned north about whether a signal 
had been given to the country of taiwan that the us government 
supported a contribution for the contras from taiwan 
mcfarlane said north told him in the late summer of 1985 that 
nothing had been done 
mcfarlane then testified under questioning from keker that 
north didnt tell him that on aug 19 1985 north had given his 
courier to the contras robert owen a bank account number to which 
the taiwanese government could make a contribution to the contras 
of a sept 12 1985 response to barnes denying national security 
council involvement in contra fundraising mcfarlane said its 
an accurate expression of what colonel north said 
mcfarlane said he discussed with president reagan in a meeting 
attended by vice president george bush the fact that congress was 
asking questions and that reagan never told him to misrepresent the 
facts in responding to the inquiries 
on friday mcfarlane said he told north to do everything you 
can to keep the nicaraguan contras intact during a congressional 
ban on aid to the guerrillas 
mcfarlane said he gave that instruction to north because 
president reagan had directed that the contras be maintained as a 
fighting force despite the aid ban 
north interpreted the policy to mean many many things 
including weapons and i am responsible for that mcfarlane 
testified in norths irancontra coverup trial 
carrying out reagans policy mcfarlane said he told north and 
another thennational security council aide donald fortier to do 
everything you can to keep the contras functioning 
mcfarlane whose testimony was to continue today is at the 
center of four charges alleging that north lied to congress 
it was mcfarlane who signed two letters allegedly prepared by 
north in 1985 and sent to house committees denying that the 
national security council staff solicited money or other support for 
the contras and denying that they offered the contras advice 
north also is accused of preparing responses to a series of 
questions sent to mcfarlane by the house intelligence committee in 
those responses mcfarlane denied that north or other nsc staffers 
helped move supplies to the contras or were involved in fund raising 
north became involved in a private fundraising operation for the 
contras and oversaw a weapons supply operation to the rebels

im just beginning to feel as if ive woken up im not quite 
awake ive been asleep for years 
he praised the airport as something beautiful unsoviet 
stolar who has been trying to leave the soviet union since 1975 
arrived with his wife son daughterinlaw and two grandchildren 
they plan to settle in israel 
in an interview before leaving moscows sheremetyevo airport the 
77yearold stolar said his thoughts today were not of israel but 
of the united states which he left in 1931 
when i left chicago at the age of 19 we were leaving on a 
train at night for new york and i felt as if i was leaving on an 
adventure and i was coming back here i was riding on a taxi coming 
here and didnt feel anything at all said the balding stolar who 
paced nervously at the moscow airport 
stolar said he hoped to visit the united states soon and would 
head straight from israel to chicago 
his 29yearold son michael is an observant jew and 
interrupted an interview in moscow to pray with his father and a 
group of friends who taught themselves hebrew 
anyone jewish around we need a 10th one the younger stolar 
shouted in the bustling departure hall 
jewish law requires the presence of 10 men for prayers and 
stolar had not brought enough friends 
after several minutes a jewish man at the airport agreed to join 
them and a service was conducted in hebrew in front of the currency 
exchange counter 
abe stolar speaking english fluently said he did not consider 
himself a refusenik a soviet jew refused permission to emigrate 
because he always has been a us citizen 
i was an american pure and simple and so i considered myself 
a hostage all these 13 years he said 
stolars struggle had been the subject of highlevel superpower 
negotiations for years and president reagan took a personal 
interest in the case the two sat together at a us embassy 
reception last summer for soviets denied permission to emigrate

russian emigres and ardent communists his father died in josef

state secrets 
the family received permission to leave again in the mid1980s 
but stolars son married and had children creating more problems 
his daughterinlaw was denied permission to emigrate she received 
approval in december

the crackdown on aliens crossing the border from 
mexico into texas has sharply reduced the stream of central american 
refugees reaching the miami area perhaps by as much as half say 
church and immigration officials 
but they agree the us immigration and naturalization service 
decision to detain undocumented immigrants in southern texas rather 
than allow them to leave that area during asylum appeals has not 
stopped the flow of aliens joining friends and relatives in miamis 
hispanic community 
the crackdown has slowed it down slightly but theyre still 
coming said robert fannin district superintendent of the miami 
district of united methodist churches 
officials of the nicaraguan american foundation which helps 
refugees with immigration paperwork say that since the feb 21 ins 
crackdown they have received only 96 requests from people who 
identified themselves as nicaraguans 
its less than half of what it was before said foundation 
president maritza herrera 
immigration officials say its hard to know how many are arriving 
unnoticed 
i cant scientifically quantify the amount because many have 
gone underground said district ins director perry rivkind 
some city officials have estimated that a total of 100000 
nicaraguans could enter the miami area through next fall 
those who do arrive continue to find a community that accepts 
them with open arms although government agencies are limited the 
citys churches still make room for them 
refugees showing up at the shenandoah presbyterian church in 
little havana are fed clothed and housed even though the church is 
feeling the burden 
were stretched to the limit said church official morris 
maxwell but we have no choice 
the churchs pastor the rev william iverson said many refugees 
arrive hungry homeless and ill when you see it firsthand its 
not easy to turn your back he said 
all agree housing is the toughest problem to solve 
after the city moved 300 nicaraguans out of the downtown bobby 
maduro miami stadium earlier this year most of them wound up on 
their feet but about 20 families without work permits are in danger 
of eviction from their apartments 
were checking into it said city manager cesar odio if 
theyre going to be thrown out we have to do something about it 
odio said he hoped to find an additional 4000 from private 
groups that have previously sponsored nicaraguans here

conquering alcoholism 
i sat down one night put a pistol on the table and wrote a 
suicide note larroquette said in an interview in the april issue

this world so i talked myself out of it said larroquette 41

three years before going cold turkey on feb 6 1982 one night i 
said to myself there are no more deals whatever it takes i dont

as designers gear up for the frenetic winter 
readytowear marathon in paris one of frances top fashion 
executives is packing his bags for china where he sees a big new 
market for french clothes 
we have to stay one jump ahead of the game jacques mouclier 
president of the french federation of couture and readytowear 
said in an interview 
fashion affairs are moving steadily eastward with a resurgence 
of individual enterprise in china and the soviet union mouclier 
said 
the readytowear shows start in paris on wednesday 
mouclier is leaving march 24 for beijing and shanghai where 
chinese audiences will get a look at french luxury in shows 
featuring 150 outfits by about 25 french designers 
western markets are nearing a saturation point and the united 
states is slowing up as a giant consumer mouclier said 
well maintain our exports to the usa but i dont see any 
increase he said 
he and other industry experts foresee the big increases coming 
from countries such as south korea 
they are heading the way of japan he said that means they 
will work in the framework of french fashion and become big 
consumers of it 
mouclier himself brought japanese into the french fold when he 
saw they were gaining momentum in design and manufacture 
at the end of the 1970s many japanese were showing in paris 
readytowear shows under the aegis of the french fashion 
federation that meant in theory that they were not blatantly 
lifting french ideas to manufacture solely for their own profit in 
japan 
in the long term he sees china india and the soviet union as 
the major sources of industry and growth beginning with china 
russia is not quite ripe for us yet though they seem to be 
changing fairly rapidly it will take time for us to make real 
inroads there he said the chinese are more adaptable and have 
a history of trade and commerce 
pierre cardin and yves saint laurent have already shown 
individually in china and cardin has manufacturing agreements he 
said 
india has an excellent future as a market but the situation 
there is tricky as well the population is huge of course but 
so far only a certain class is concerned by what were selling and 
theyre dispersed all over the subcontinent the problem is that 
there is no one city center or area for reaching potential 
consumers 
while aiming at market expansion mouclier believes french 
fashion is financially healthy with a 54 million turnover in haute 
couture with 3000 clients readytowear and accessories total 
about 750 million with a regular yearly increase of 10 percent 
he admits the figures are a drop in the bucket compared with 
heavy industry but you cant compare clothes to cars he added

foreign ministers of moslem nations 
began a fourday conference monday with 150 items on the agenda but 
attention fixed on the satanic verses and irans order that its 
author be killed 
the saudi foreign minister opposed irans insistence that 
discussion of the novel and author salman rushdie head the agenda 
referring to iranian response to the book he cautioned against 
this rabid invasion aimed at undermining the islamic faith and 
personality 
by monday no mention of rushdie had been made in conference 
coverage by the governmentguided saudi media 
saudi arabia and other islamic countries have criticized rushdie 
and banned his novel which moslems say blasphemes islam but have 
not supported iranian patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
instruction to his followers to kill the writer 
last year the saudis broke off diplomatic relations with iran 
accusing irans fundamentalist shiite moslem regime of fomenting 
terrorism among shiites in the kingdom 
prince saud alfaisal the saudi foreign minister said monday 
that debate on the palestinian issue and recognition of the 
provisional government organized by afghan guerrillas should have 
precedence on the agenda 
king fahd of saudi arabia opened the meeting of the 46member 
organization of islamic conference with a threeminute speech 
welcoming participants and wishing them success 
ali akbar velayati irans foreign minister did not attend 
mohammad khodadadi head of the foreign ministrys islamic 
organization affairs department represented iran 
khodadadi said rushdies book is the most important issue to be 
debated by the conference as far as we are concerned and told the 
associated press we will press for their support for irans views 
on that score 
rushdie 41 has been in hiding since khomeini pronounced the 
death sentence feb 14 and iranian clerics added a reward of 52 
million he was born in bombay to moslem parents but now is a 
british citizen and has said he does not practice religion actively 
among aspects of the book to which moslems object is a scene in 
which prostitutes are given the names of mohammeds wives and the 
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy koran rather than 
receiving it from allah 
tehran television monitored in cyprus on monday said 190 
members of irans parliament had sent a letter to the organization 
of islamic conference asking that the meeting take a stand on the 
book pleasing to moslems 
shiites dominate iran but make up only 10 percent of the worlds 
1 billion moslems most of whom are of the sunni sect 
several conference delegates described the iranian position on 
the satanic verses as exaggerated and said it could give 
moslems bloodthirsty image they do not deserve 
conference sources speaking privately said no delegation other 
than irans appeared willing to support khomeinis execution order 
most foreign ministers are convinced iran is trying to exploit 
the affair to score propaganda gains said an arab diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
diplomats said moves were under way to persuade iran to drop its 
demand for rushdies death and avoid a confrontation at the meeting 
with sunni moslems led by saudi arabia 
they said some delegations suggested western nations be asked to 
ban the satanic verses and most believed rushdie should be given 
an islamic trial and a chance to repent 
on afghanistan prince saud urged that moslem nations recognize 
the guerrilla government which he said is capable of binding 
together the afghan people in brotherhood and accord 
only saudi arabia sudan and bahrain had extended recognition by 
the time the conference began 
the provisional government based in pakistan is dominated by 
sunni moslems insurgents have been trying to oust the communist 
government in kabul capital of afghanistan since the last red army 
soldiers left the country feb 15 ending nine years of soviet 
military involvement 
sources at the conference said iran probably would raise 
objections to a government dominated by the guerrilla alliance based 
in pakistan and demand a significant role for the eight 
shiitedominated afghan political groups based on its territory 
iran has warned of a possible civil war in afghanistan if demands 
for powersharing by the shiites are ignored 
gulbuddin hekmatyar foreign minister of the guerrilla 
government said it was more interested in recognition than in 
winning afghanistans seat in the organization of islamic 
conference the seat became vacant after the communist coup in 1978 
that started the afghan civil war

the bush administration welcomed israeli 
foreign minister moshe arens for talks today with a plea for efforts 
to reduce tensions on the predominantly arab west bank and in gaza 
secretary of state james a baker said he had a productive 
exchange of views with arens at the state department before the 
israeli official went to the white house to see president bush 
baker said he had suggested various reinforcing and reciprocal 
steps be taken by israel and palestinian arabs who make up the 
overwhelming majority in the territories captured by israel in the 
1967 mideast war 
but baker did not say whether arens had agreed to relax israeli 
authority and to take other measures floated before his arrival in 
newspaper accounts 
arens told reporters that israel wanted to reduce tensions but 
its not easy to do that with violence in the area 
for 15 months palestinian arabs have waged a campaign against 
israeli authority in the violence 396 arabs and 17 israelis have 
died 
we both agreed that the need for progress is of the highest 
priority baker said as he saw arens off to the white house 
despite pressures from arab and western european governments the 
bush administration is moving slowly in formulating a plan for 
mideast peace talks 
its just basically common sense that before you do anything 
that you could consider an initiative youve got to change the 
conditions and lower the level of violence and confrontation a 
us official speaking on grounds of anonymity said sunday 
bush has said he wont be stampeded into offering wideranging 
new peace initiatives in his talks with middle east leaders arens 
will be followed here later this spring by israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and there also will be visits by jordans king 
hussein and egyptian president hosni mubarak 
bush has kept open the us dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization although administration officials have 
expressed concern about recent attacks by palestinian guerrillas 
against israeli soldiers 
both us and israeli officials seem content to use this weeks 
talks to buy time before moving more heavily into the complex 
problems of mideast peacemaking 
arens who is making his first trip to the united states as 
foreign minister has characterized the meetings as gettoknowyou 
sessions rather than a substantive discussion of peacemaking 
strategy 
us officials plan to ask israel to release some of the 
palestinians arrested during the 15month uprising end or limit 
detentions and reopen schools in the territories the new york times 
reported sunday quoting an unidentified senior administration 
official 
it said the us initiatives also would call on the plo to halt 
violent demonstrations in the israelioccupied territories block 
antiisraeli raids from southern lebanon and stop distribution of 
inflammatory leaflets 
the administration official said the aim of the american 
suggestions to both israel and to the plo are to bring about 
confidencebuilding measures on both sides because the israelis 
and palestinians really dont trust each other 
the aim would be to have such suggestions grabbed by one side 
and then have that attract the other he said its not really a 
plan 
but in advance of todays meetings palestinian leaders attending 
a mideast peace symposium in new york denounced the administration 
ideas for calming tensions in the region 
they called on the administration to push instead for a permanent 
solution to the arabisraeli conflict including creation of an 
independent palestinian state 
several leftwing israeli legislators attending the threeday 
symposium at columbia university also predicted that the us 
proposals would fail if they included only interim measures for 
quelling the palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
but yossi sarid a member of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement in israels knesset or parliament said the bush proposals 
show at least that the new administration has a sense of urgency 
about restarting the mideast peace process 
faisal husseini director of the arab studies center in east 
jerusalem and a top palestinian leader in the occupied territories 
called the us suggestions unbalanced unfair 
he said the new us proposals were flawed because they are 
asking us to stop the demonstrations while israel was being asked 
the minimum 
husseini and plo officials at the symposium said the real issue 
is ending israels occupation of the territories captured from 
jordan and egypt during the 1967 middle east war and creating a 
palestinian state 
the intefadeh the arabic name for the uprising is our only 
weapon for continuing the peace plan said nabil shaath chairman 
of the political committee of the palestine national council the 
plos legislative arm what is not negotiable is the final result 
an independent palestinian state sidebyside with the state of 
israel

an air force helicopter crashed and burned 
in the desert on a night training mission killing all 15 people 
aboard authorities said today 
workers at the crash site 25 miles from davismonthan air force 
base recovered the last bodies late this morning after using a crane 
to move the burnedout wreckage said base spokesman capt carlos 
roque 
the vietnamera ch3e jolly green giant helicopter with four 
air force crew members from the base went down on a clear moonless 
night sunday while ferrying 11 army personnel stationed at fort 
bragg nc authorities said 
another helicopter was in the area roque said 
a witness said he saw what appeared to be flames from the 
helicopter before it crashed another said the copters were flying 
so low that you could throw a rock and hit them 
roque said that the cause of the crash was under investigation 
but that the crews nightvision goggles were not a factor news 
reports have implicated the lightamplifying goggles and lack of 
moonlight in previous crashes 
roque said in previous crashes involving the goggles the 
aircraft were on lowlevel flights or close to other aircraft 
in this case they were flying above the minimum faa federal 
aviation administration altitude roque said though he could not 
specify the faa minimum ceiling for the site or the helicopters 
level prior to the crash 
he said the two helicopters sunday night were not close together 
but he had no specific distance 
roque said the helicopter was transporting army personnel from 
fort huachuca to the air forces gila bend gunnery range 200 miles 
apart 
mike skrekas said he saw the crash from his house a few miles 
away 
i looked up and i seen a yellow ball like flames coming out 
of the back he said five seconds later i saw it hit the 
ground and then there was a red fireball 
another nearby resident 31yearold gary williams said he did 
not see the crash but heard two helicopters flying real low just 
before one hit the desert floor 
they were flying so low you could throw a rock and hit them 
he said 
since 1978 37 of 41 army helicopter crashes in which night 
goggles were used occurred when there was not enough moonlight for 
the lightamplifying devices to operate properly the orange county 
calif register reported sunday 
those crashes killed 65 soldiers when mechanically sound 
helicopters flew into mountains oceans lakes trees and power 
lines the newspaper reported 
the armys policy of flying under overcast and moonless nights 
with nightvision goggles never has been cited as a contributing 
factor in a crash military records show 
the ch3e which was most noted for its use in combat rescues 
during the vietnam war is made by sikorsky according to janes all 
the worlds aircraft 
in wartime their mission would be to rescue downed pilots from 
behind enemy lines consequently they do a lot of night training for 
combat rescue besich said

the first woman to serve as nasa 
commentator for the liftoff of a spaceship carrying astronauts said 
monday she was pleased with her performance even though she jumped 
the gun in one of her reports 
i said the ice team had already made their report to 
management lisa malone 27 said in an interview and i thought 
that they had this was one of those times when there was a lot 
going on it was just a few minutes later then they came on and 
gave their report 
malone who sat in the top row of the firing room a few seats 
down from the launch director for discoverys liftoff said it was 
just a matter of time before nasa used a woman as launch 
commentator 
after the launch she was back in her office at the kennedy space 
centers press headquarters where she works as space shuttle 
specialist but instead of analyzing weather and engineering 
reports she was kept busy by reporters asking her to analyze her 
performance 
i think i did alright she said adding that it went more 
smoothly than she expected because the launch team did such a good 
job they made my job easier 
she said she was surprised journalists were asking her about her 
pioneering role as launch commentator 
i guess its because theyve always heard a male voice during 
commentary she said 
there are so many woman newscasters she said i dont 
really consider this job that much different from what theyre 
doing 
as commentator malone explained to the public what took place 
behind the scenes as the countdown clock ticked to zero and the 
shuttle rumbled skyward from its launch pad her job lasted longer 
than she had bargained for as bad weather delayed the liftoff by 
nearly two hours 
malone who was a bachelors degree in journalism from the 
university of alabama in tuscaloosa took part in a workstudy 
program for three semesters at kennedy space center beginning in 
1982 she accepted an offer of a fulltime job as public relations 
specialist with the national aeronautics and space administration 
during her last semester as an intern 
malone edited the space center newsletter spaceport news for 
three years before she was assigned to the shuttle beat 
to prepare for mondays debut malone provided launch commentary 
for some unmanned atlas centaur and delta launches and for the early 
portions of some shuttle countdowns and hired a voice coach

while thousands of enthusiasts 
prepare for the swallows annual return sunday some residents do 
all they can to keep the birds away from their homes 
theyre a pain said mike white who uses his garden hose to 
keep the birds away from his house they arrive at the crack of 
dawn and theyre very noisy i havent seen one yet but all of a 
sudden youll look up and the skies are filled 
its like the birds hitchcock movie i just hope they dont 
try to hit our house this year 
homeowners battle plans include knocking down empty mud nests 
washing walls and displaying inflatable owls but residents dont 
always succeed in keeping the swallows from nesting under the eaves 
of their homes 
i know the swallows are part of the heritage here but im 
taking their nests down said peggy pizzolo 35 we knock them 
down and they keep coming back to build 
mission san juan capistrano the old spanish mission that 
tradition says is where the birds return to each spring cant 
accommodate all of them and it is tough for homeowners to control 
other places the birds choose to build their nests said doug 
willick orange county coordinator of american birds a 
publication of the audubon society 
swallows pick nest sites that offer shade food safety from 
predators and nearby mud and water said bird watcher ricard kust of 
irvine and the birds and their offspring will return to the same 
nest sites year after year 
under the federal migratory bird treaty act the swallows are 
protected by the us fish and wildlife service anyone who tears 
down swallows nests after the birds arrive is subject to a fine of 
500 per nest and a sixmonth jail term said nancy kaufman field 
supervisor for the agency 
and since san juan capistrano declared itself a sanctuary under a 
1974 ordinance no one in town can harm swallows owls hawks and a 
host of other wild birds 
both laws allow homeowners to remove nests after the swallows 
leave for the winter but once the birds return to hatch their eggs 
the nests cant be tampered with officials said although residents 
commonly wash down walls they are not supposed to disturb swallows 
building nests 
the city responds immediately to complaints about homeowners 
who tear or wash down nests illegally but people are probably 
getting away with violations conceded city building official mark 
gibson 
gibson whose office gets three or four complaints a year said 
they rely on people who call in tips on lawbreakers 
some residents are protective of the swallows and said they dont 
mind sharing their living space with them 
i welcome swallows to build a nest on my house any time any 
place said sam allevato who has lived in san juan capistrano for 
13 years whats the harm of a little bird being there for a few 
months

a democrat who was trounced by us rep 
dick cheney in last novembers election said monday he should 
receive his partys nomination for cheneys seat if the republican 
becomes defense secretary 
bryan sharratt said he deserves the nomination because of the 
time and money he devoted to trying to unseat cheney in 1988 and 
that any other democrats who seek it would be opportunistic 
the wheatland attorney who lost the general election race by a 
vote of 118350 to 56527 said he believed there was one major 
reason why he didnt defeat cheney 
and that is that i was running against one of the most powerful 
republican 10year incumbents in the nation he said 
cheney who last fall won a sixth twoyear term as wyomings lone 
member of the house of representatives was president bushs second 
nominee for defense secretary while bushs first nominee former 
sen john tower was rejected by the senate following lengthy debate 
over allegations of heavy drinking and womanizing cheney is 
expected to easily win confirmation 
when that happens it would be up to wyoming gov mike sullivan 
to set a special election within 40 days for the selection of a 
successor to cheney the states republican and democratic central 
committees would each choose a candidate 
other democrats believed interested in the seat are state sen 
john vinich who narrowly lost his bid to unseat incumbent us sen 
malcolm wallop last fall and pete maxfield a former university of 
wyoming professor who lost the democratic senate nomination to 
vinich

attempts to settle the 15yearold louisiana 
college desegregation lawsuit broke down monday and a federal 
official called for immediate public hearings 
theres not an agreement said john kennedy attorney for the 
state i think were all disappointed by that the only thing 
worse than not having a consensus is having a bad consensus 
kennedy would not say what sticking points prevented a settlement 
during the intense negotiations under way since wednesday 
i dont think there has been a complete consensus on any 
issue he said 
the courtappointed special master who must oversee any 
desegregation plan paul verkuil called for the opening of the 
hearing after meeting with lawyers in private for more than an hour 
state sen william jefferson representing southern university 
one of the predominantly black institutions in the state system 
blamed the stalemate at least in part on gov buddy roemer 
he accused the governor of having submarined the process but 
he would not be specific 
the attorneys said they had no idea how long the hearing would 
last or when a decision would be issued 
verkuil has decided to limit the hearing to rebuttal testimony 
to let the different sides dispute the abundant testimony already in 
the printed record the hearing was scheduled to begin last week 
but verkuil postponed it until monday in hopes a trial could be 
avoided 
in the lawsuit the us justice department accuses the state of 
maintaining a longstanding system of predominantly black colleges 
like grambling and southern and predominantly white universities 
like louiana state univesity 
the state southern university the justice department and the 
grambling state university alumni association have four different 
integration plans before verkuil 
the governor insists on consolidating the four boards that 
oversee higher education in the state into one superboard and 
creating a statewide community college system the alumni of the 
traditionally black schools feel that such plans will make it harder 
for underprivileged youngsters to get the kinds of assistance they 
need to succeed at fouryear colleges 
the alumni want to move programs to the historically black 
colleges to promote integration but state and federal officials say 
that approach has not worked in other states 
verkuil is president of the college of william amp mary in virginia 
and a former dean of tulane law school he was appointed by federal 
court to oversee the case

practical than other models the line of suits made its debut monday 
in houston and would be shown later in new york and florida said 
miss williams 
using fabrics that were not available in the 1940s and 1950s 
when her films made her a top box office attraction miss williams 
65 said she created bathing suits that are practical and 
glamorous like the ones she swam in 
we did a lot of surveys she said we discovered a lot of 
women have gotten so unhappy with these high cut bathing suits that 
are practically stripper clothes that they would like a couple of 
models with a skirt back again 
the new suits will not ride up the back of a womans body or fall 
down on top in water said miss williams even the bikinis in her 
collection will not slip on the body she promises 
ive tested them myself miss williams said but she admitted 
that when she goes out to her backyard pool for a daily workout she

leaders of the governing 
national party today adopted a resolution calling for the partys 
new leader frederik w de klerk to replace pw botha as president 
botha 73 who suffered a stroke in january said he plans to 
return to work wednesday and wants to stay in office at least until 
next year despite widespread calls for his resignation 
he said in a televised interview sunday that he would not call an 
early election this year dampening hopes within his party that he 
would step down within a few months and make way for de klerk 
de klerk who succeeded botha as party leader on feb 2 had 
called for the national partys 34member federal council its 
highest body to meet in cape town to discuss the crisis 
de klerk has not disavowed reports that he is seeking either 
bothas early resignation or a formal share of policymaking powers 
the independent south african press association reported today 
that national party officials were angered by bothas refusal to 
call an election this year the latest date for the next election is 
march 1990 
the situation is intolerable and will have to be settled this 
week one unidentified party official was quoted as saying 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp which has 
endeavored to be neutral in its reports on the power struggle also 
said this week would be of decisive importance in the present 
turbulence in the party 
beeld the countrys biggest afrikaanslanguage daily said in an 
editorial today that the time has come for a new political order to 
take hold 
botha said in the television interview sunday that de klerk was 
being misused by some people and insisted there was no personal 
conflict between them 
the star newspaper of johannesburg south africas 
largestcirculation daily said some of de klerks backers were 
dismayed by bothas impressive performance during the interview 
the president looked healthy during his 15minute appearance and 
said he would remain in office out of a sense of duty rather than a 
desire to cling to the position he has held since 1978 
botha indicated he was upset by suggestions that a de klerk 
presidency would open the way for new political reforms saying i 
originated the concept of reform 
de klerk 52 was education minister when he took over as leader 
of the national party he holds solid support from national party 
parliament members he also has won at least tacit backing from 
pronationalist newspapers which view him as more pragmatic and 
openminded than botha 
during bothas convalescence de klerk has suggested in speeches 
that the government is willing to lessen its reliance on racial 
classification as the foundation for political and social structures 
however he has told white voters he will not betray them and has 
affirmed his commitment to segregated residential areas for whites 
who want them like botha de klerk has given no indication he is 
willing to consider full voting rights for the countrys black 
majority

beavers which sustained the pilgrims 
but nearly disappeared from massachusetts during the height of the 
fur trade have made such a comeback in the last half century that 
they are a nuisance 
and a state relocation program has been called off because there 
simply is no corner of the state where the toothy dambuilding 
rodents are not entrenched 
weve run out of places where there arent already beavers 
biologist james cardoza said monday in a telephone interview from 
the massachusetts division of fisheries and wildlife headquarters in 
westboro 
he said it is impossible to estimate the number of beavers in 
massachusetts because of their reclusive aquatic lifestyle but last 
year the division tried to resolve 185 complaints about the furry 
engineers 
massachusetts is not alone 
robert j naiman a beaver expert and director of the center for 
streamside studies at the university of washington said california 
and nevada introduced beaver several years ago and now are having 
second thoughts because of the havoc the critters are playing with 
trout streams 
wisconsin is about to launch a sixmonth beaver hunting season on 
march 15 the largest in state history to try to control the beaver 
population state wildlife and fisheries management spokesman ryan 
groener said beavers damming trout streams and cutting valuable 
timber have driven state wildlife officials to authorize the hunt 
and to pay 750 per pelt 
naiman said tierra del fuego in the southern tip of argentina 
also introduced beavers in 1942 and is now blaming the animal for a 
decline in the trout industry 
witney tilt project director for the fish and wildlife 
foundation of washington dc a nonprofit agency said the beaver 
population in the united states could have been as high as 400 
million before europeans arrived the current population is 
estimated to be as many as 12 million 
the industrious animals helped the states first settlers 
survive cardoza said the beavers were the reason they were able 
to sustain the colony because their sponsors wanted to bargain with 
the indians for furs 
by the revolutionary war however beavers had disappeared from 
massachusetts and most of new england because of yearround trapping

after an absence of two centuries two beaver colonies took hold 
in berkshire county in the 1920s one had drifted downstream from 
northern new england and the other may have been brought to 
massachusetts by a resident who wanted to reestablish the 
population cardoza said 
the animals flourished so much so that in the 1950s a beaver 
hunting season was opened another state biologist tom decker said 
the fourmonth season that ended in february yielded fewer pelts

among some of the biggest beaver headaches in massachusetts was a 
colony in the town of montgomery that drew spectators for years 
until the beavers set their sights in 1986 on a brook flowing under 
main street 
the animals built dams faster than work crews could demolish 
them causing the brook to threaten to overflow the main 
thoroughfare of the town of 500 people and inspiring one resident to

in 1985 an epidemic of the intestinal disease giardiasis that 
affected more than 1000 people in pittsfield was blamed on beaver 
droppings contaminating the city water supply the beavers were 
killed by trappers 
some scientists now suspect however that the beavers were not 
to blame and cardoza says the rodents are often scapegoats the 
potential from human contamination has been vastly overlooked he 
said 
wildlife biologists are advising residents about humane ways to 
sidestep beaver problems without destroying the animals residents 
may kill beavers without a permit only if property damage is serious

legislation to provide financial incentives to 
young people who participate in civilian or military service would 
enhance military recruitment not undermine it as some critics have 
charged the chairman of the senate armed services committee said 
monday 
sen sam nunn dga said the national service legislation he 
and rep dave mccurdy dokla introduced in january is not 
intended to make civilian service more attactive than military 
service 
he said proposed incentives might have to be adjusted to ensure 
that military service remains the most attractive option but the 
net effect of the bill would be an overall increase in young people 
willing to serve their country 
if you create a huge increase in the pool of people who want to 
serve either in civilian or military service it is my firm belief 
that youre going to have more people going into the military not 
less he said 
during a news conference called to announce the us jaycees 
endorsement of the national service proposal nunn and mccurdy 
responded to criticism of their bill 
robbie dawkins national vice president of the group which has 
240000 members aged 21 to 39 said such voluntary national service 
would promote a new spirit of citizenship and commitment 
under the legislation young people who serve two years in the 
military would get 24000 for college or vocational school or for 
buying a house two years of civilian service would net 20000 in 
education or housing aid it would make national service a 
requirement for young people to qualify for federal college loans 
and grants 
rep sonny montgomery dmiss a senior member of the house 
armed services committee and chairman of the house veterans affairs 
committee said last week he opposes the idea because it would draw 
highquality people away from the military by paying them for 
community service 
similar complaints were voiced to a house armed services 
subcommittee last week by grant s green the pentagons manpower 
chief he said the bills lucrative alternatives for civilian 
service or shorter enlistments would reduce recruit quality 
increase training costs and adversely affect the productivity of 
military personnel 
montgomery said armed services would be forced to accept twoyear 
volunteers whether they need them or not he also said the bills 
incentives would undermine the gi bill which provides 10800 in 
education aid after three years of military service 
mccurdy however said the plan would enhance the gi bill by 
providing vocational school or housing benefits to young people who 
serve but dont want to go to college the existing gi bill he 
said offers nothing to such people 
the bottom line is we want to keep having the military be the 
most attractive option nunn said

central american officials this week will 
discuss plans for a un peacekeeping force to patrol the 
nicaraguanhonduran border and other regional hot spots diplomats 
said monday 
the un plan envisions the peacekeepers using speedboats 
allterrain vehicles and helicopters to monitor allegations of 
subversion in the region 
foreign ministry officials and military officers from nicaragua 
el salvador honduras costa rica and guatemala will meet tuesday 
and wednesday at un headquarters to discuss the details according 
to un diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity 
foreign ministry officials from the five central american nations 
agreed in principle in february that a un military observer group 
should check claims that any of the nations is violating another 
the peacekeepers will focus on the nicaraguahonduras border to 
check allegations of raids by the contras or sandinistas and on the 
el salvadorhonduras border said the diplomats 
el salvador says rebels trying to overthrow the government 
operate from clandestine bases in honduras without the knowledge of 
honduran officials 
about 11000 nicaraguan rebels are based in honduras 
the peacekeepers will also monitor the costa ricanicaragua 
border and will use speedboats to patrol the gulf of fonseca which 
links nicaragua honduras and el salvador on their pacific coasts 
according to a copy of the un draft plan obtained by the 
associated press 
each roving team will consist of four military observers in two 
vehicles with at least one group in each of the five nations 
the un plan says they will need allterrain vehicles 
helicopters and a light airplane as well as at least one speedboat 
about 60 pilots drivers and civilian support staff will be 
deployed along with up to 100 military observers the report 
recommends 
canada spain and west germany have already volunteered to 
provide personnel for the force 
unresolved are the issues of whether the military observers would 
have any weapons other than their standard light side arms for 
defensive use and exactly where they will be posted said the 
diplomats 
the draft report calls for the central american governments to 
consider providing armed escorts for the peacekeepers when necessary 
it also asks the governments to try to reach agreements with the 
local rebel forces that the insurgents will not fire on the un 
peacekeepers 
the military observers would not attempt to clean out or relocate 
contra bases in honduras unless the contras invited them to assist 
in their repatriation the diplomats said

twice a year communist east germany 
welcomes thousands of capitalists from around the world to the 
sprawling leipzig trade fair 
but visiting trade officials say that despite an increasing 
interest in trade with the west east germany still is far from 
embracing the reforms needed to encourage joint ventures with 
western countries 
they are afraid that once the west and especially west 
germany gets a foot in the door that theyll buy the whole place 
up said a highranking member of the us trade delegation at the 
fair which opened sunday and ends march 18 
west germany accounts for 64 percent of east germanys trade with 
the west it also is a key source of hard currency for east germany 
which needs convertible currency to buy westernmade goods and 
equipment to modernize its industries 
but according to the west german economics ministry trade 
between the two countries fell last year and appears headed for a 
long period of stagnation 
the slowdown is in part the result of fewer east german goods 
being made available for sale to the west 
the soviet union is now demanding better products from east 
germany at a time when increased exports to the west are needed to 
earn vital hard currency another us trade official said all 
this has to be done while still trying to provide quality goods to 
its national consumers 
east german economists admit privately the economy is facing 
growing pressures 
the days of the guaranteed brotherhood trade agreements with 
other communist countries are passing said an east german 
government official referring to special trade agreements among 
warsaw pact nations 
the official said competition for hard currency sales has grown 
fiercer between east european nations many are scrambling to 
implement reforms and increase western trade ties to shore up their 
economies 
the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that the soviet union east germanys biggest trading 
partner is pressing for delivery of more toprate goods that 
reduces east germanys potential hard currency trading stocks with 
the west 
another senior government official admitted that east germanys 
industrial base is rapidly becoming obsolete 
our industrial infrastructure once state of the art in the 
early 1970s has now outlived its usefulness the official said 
modernization has lagged in part because 80 percent of the 
nations highgrade machinery goods are exported rather than used at 
home said john f nosworthy director general of the londonbased 
machine tool trades association 
nosworthy said east german insistence on reciprocal trade 
arrangements also hinders broader development of importexport 
agreements 
east german restrictions on foreign travel also hinder business 
ties with the west 
those restrictions are aimed in part at preventing politically 
embarrassing and economically damaging defections like the case 
last month of reinhard fichte the head of east germanys renowned 
meissen porcelain factory defected to west germany while on a trade 
fair visit to frankfurt 
it will be difficult for east german authorities to make joint 
venture proposals that are attractive to western partners as long as 
east german managers and engineers are restricted in the type and 
frequency of visits they can make to the partners facilities one 
american executive said 
in order to make a joint venture work you need a smart 
powerful and flexible partner the executive said you dont get 
that here

a second battle of bunker hill is brewing between 
residents of a public housing project and city officials who say up 
to 100 families may have to leave while their apartments are being 
renovated 
the 45 redbrick buildings of the bunker hill housing project are 
clustered just three blocks downhill from the famous monument to 
colonial resistance opened in 1940 they are scheduled for a 30 
million renovation 
but rebellious tenants who have lived through a bitter busing 
battle and the peaceful integration of what had been an allwhite 
enclave say they wont budge 
youll need a bulldozer to get me out one tenant said at a 
community meeting sunday 
were not moving mary e macinnes president of the tenants 
task force declared monday were not leaving charlestown 
macinnes said the complex is a tightknit community with up to 
three generations of families she moved into the bunker hill 
complex with her parents in 1940 she raised eight children there 
teaching two of them at home rather than see them bused and now has 
a 26yearold son living there 
macinnes said tenants want to stay in their apartments during the 
renovations where possible and a guarantee that they will be moved 
to another apartment in the complex if not elderly tenants and 
those with special needs should not be forced to move she said 
we have a lot of family members who have family members in the 
same building who were put there so they could take care of each 
other macinnes said how are you going to relocate these 
people 
william h wright spokesman for the boston housing authority 
insisted that the agency has no choice 
this is not the kind of work that can be done with people 
living in the apartment wright said 
wiring and plumbing dating to world war ii will be ripped out 
walls will be demolished and some roofs will have to be replaced he 
said 
tenants will be given another apartment either in charlestown or 
elsewhere in the city or a subsidized rent voucher and a written 
guarantee that they can move back to the project though not 
necessarily to the same apartment wright said 
attempts will be made to renovate buildings in stages so tenants 
can move to vacant apartments within the complex while others are 
being renovated wright said the bha expects that far fewer than 
100 families will have to leave 
city councilor robert e travaglini on monday blamed the inflamed 
emotions on a lack of communication he said he and mayor raymond 
flynn would meet with tenants tuesday to discuss the project 
flynns office could not confirm the meeting 
macinnes said the tenants resistance to leaving the charlestown 
projects was not racially motivated the projects which began 
integrating in 1984 are now about 10 to 15 percent minority she 
said 
minority families have been as outspoken as whites in opposing 
the move she said 
one woman who has been here less than a year said i love it 
here so were all sticking together on this macinnes said 
louis elisa president of the boston chapter of the national 
association for advancement of colored people which has sued the 
housing authority for racial discrimination noted that bunker hill 
is less integrated than other projects in which relocating families 
would be offered apartments 
elisa said the naacp would review the relocation plan

politburo an activist said 
it was completely jammed for 45 minutes said yuri mityunov

mityunov said radio liberty was jammed monday night as it 
broadcast a report about a demonstration sunday in moscow in honor 
of the 1917 february revolution which toppled russias czardom the 
bolsheviks seized power later that year sweeping away the 
provisional government established in february 
mityunov said an editorial he wrote also was jammed he said his 
editorial accused moscow party boss lev n zaikov a member of the 
politburo of trying to prevent the nomination of his predecessor 
maverick communist boris n yeltsin as a candidate in the march 26 
elections to a new national assembly 
mityunov held the recever of his telephone up to his radio so the 
whine of the jamming was audible 
they used to call this khrushchev music or brezhnev 
music he said referring to former leaders nikita s khrushchev 
and leonid i brezhnev now well have to call it gorbachev

the senate armed services committee announced 
monday that confirmation hearings will begin tuesday on rep dick 
cheneys nomination as defense secretary and one democratic panel 
member expressed hope that the process could be wrapped up by weeks 
end 
meanwhile bush administration officials played down published 
reports about cheneys two draft deferments during the early stages 
of the vietnam war and the fact that the defensesecretary 
designate never served in the armed services 
cheney rwyo requested and obtained two student deferments 
while studying at the university of wyoming where he received a 
bachelors degree in 1965 and his masters in 1966 cheney also was 
married and had a small child in 1966 making him eligible for a 
class 3 hardship deferment 
bush announced friday that cheney would be his nominee for the 
pentagon post one day after the senate rejected john tower a 
former texas senator by a 5347 vote 
the vote capped a bitter partisan debate in the senate where 
lawmakers expressed concerns over allegations of excessive drinking 
and womanizing against tower and his work as a paid defense 
consultant after government service 
the armed services committee and democratic leaders greeted 
cheneys nomination with words of praise and promised to move 
quickly on the confirmation process 
at the hearings scheduled to begin tuesday afternoon house 
republican leader robert michel and sens alan simpson and malcolm 
wallop rwyo will formally introduce cheney to the committee 
said pete williams a cheney spokesman 
sen tim wirth dcolo a member of the committee said he hoped 
that consideration of the nominee could be wrapped up by weeks end 
when the senate begins a twoweek recess 
the more rapidly we get through this the better i would hope 
we could be done by the end of this week wirth said 
cheney spent monday morning in briefings at the white house and 
was expected to go to the pentagon later in the day williams said 
meanwhile house republicans scrambled to fill the gap in their 
leadership that will be left with cheneys departure as minority 
whip cheney was the partys chief house votecounter and 
heirapparent to minority leader robert michel 
rep newt gingrich rga the leader of a band of conservatives 
was the only announced candidate to succeed cheney rwyo but 
republican conference chairman jerry lewis rcalif the no 
3ranking official was mulling over the race also said to be 
considering running were rep edward madigan rill the chief 
deputy whip and rep lynn martin rill who narrowly lost to 
lewis in the conference chairmans race in january 
at the daily white house news briefing deputy press secretary 
roman popadiuk was asked what kind of message cheneys lack of 
military services sends to the members of the armed services 
reports about the subject appeared in mondays washington times and 
over the weekend in the los angeles times 
the nominee is fully aware of the defense issues that are 
relative for this country and he has a deep commitment to the 
defense of this country popadiuk said 
during last years congressional campaign cheneys opponent 
bryan sharratt did not make the republicans lack of military 
service a major issue 
cheney would not be the first defense secretary without any 
military experience to head the pentagon four defense secretaries 
charles wilson neil h mcelroy james schlesinger and harold brown

mayor eugene sawyer declared monday that he would 
not endorse a candidate in next months mayoral election despite 
pleas from jesse jackson and others to support the only black 
candidate in the race 
sawyer the citys second black mayor spurned calls from jackson 
and several local committeemen to help mend a deep rift in the black 
community by backing alderman timothy evans 
evans who did not support sawyer in last months democratic 
primary is running as a third party candidate in the april 4 
election against democrat richard m daley and republican edward 
vrdolyak 
after careful consideration i have decided not to endorse any 
candidate sawyer told reporters in a short statement 
evans spokeswoman deborah scott later downplayed the lack of 
sawyers help in the campaign denying that evans would lose votes 
because of sawyers neutrality 
i dont think its going to impact on turnout either scott 
said people who were saying there was no candidate to inspire 
them in the primary now have a candidate to inspire them in 
evans she said 
daley flanked by a multiracial group of sawyer supporters who 
are now in his camp said later that he could benefit from sawyers 
nonendorsement 
i think him not endorsing anyone is very helpful to my 
campaign sure daley said at a news conference 
sawyer 54 was soundly defeated in the feb 28 democratic 
mayoral primary by daley 46 the cook county states attorney and 
son of the late richard j daley who was mayor for 21 years 
evans 45 bypassed the primary to run as an independent in the 
general election against white candidates daley and vrdolyak 51 
some knowedgeable observers believe that evans lack of support 
for sawyer who also is black contributed to a low primary turnout 
in some predominantly black wards and was a factor in daleys 
primary victory 
jackson has often referred to the evanssawyer split among blacks 
and other allies of the late mayor harold washington the citys 
first black mayor as a civil war 
but sawyer answered no when asked monday if he was bitter 
about evans failure to endorse him in the primary 
all candidates have sought my endorsement sawyer said 
adding that he would do everything i can to ensure a smooth 
transition for whoever is elected mayor

a government official monday reported 
rockthrowing incidents in tibets capital despite a crackdown by 
chinese authorities and he said martial law will continue until 
antichinese protests end 
a chinese businessman in the capital lhasa told state tv he was 
afraid to open his shop because he feared more riots 
the nationally televised news showed police surrounding major 
intersections in lhasa one frame showed an old woman being 
searched another showed several soldiers checking the identity 
cards of bicyclists the report said the city was calm 
the scene was photographed saturday but the official at the 
provincial office of tibet in beijing said troops continued to 
patrol the city 
right now there is no possibility of the order being lifted 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity martial 
law in lhasa will end only when the authorities are assured that the 
situation will stay calm 
martial law took effect march 8 after three days of riots in the 
capital of the remote region 
things have gotten better with martial law said one chinese 
businessman in lhasa interviewed on television but these rioting 
tibetans were very scary i dont dare open the store 
all residents of lhasa are required to have an identity card and 
show it upon request last week the television news said more than 
1000 people had applied for cards in one day 
the official said tibetans defying the crackdown had been dealt 
with harshly and in accordance with law 
he did not say when the rockthrowing incidents occurred but 
sketchy reports reaching beijing said some tibetans attempted a 
protest thursday 
by official count 16 people died and about 100 were injured in 
three days of riots that began march 5 when tibetans tried to 
commemorate the first anniversary of another clash 
on march 5 1988 antichinese protesters clashed with police in 
lhasa and an estimated 24 people died 
although last weeks protests were initially led by buddhist 
monks and nuns later riots during which chineseowned businesses 
were ransacked and chinese bicyclists attacked were headed by 
tibetan youths 
the government apparently ordered the crackdown to avoid more 
protests to commemorate a march 10 1959 uprising against chinese 
rule in which hundreds died and tibets godking the dalai lama 
fled to india 
more anniversaries are coming march 17 is the day the dalai lama 
left lhasa for india in 1959 on march 19 and 20 1959 the chinese 
army used heavy artillery to suppress the uprising 
beijing claims that tibet has been part of china since the 13th 
century tibetans say their homeland was really independent for most 
of that time

the trial of a retired librarian accused of 
killing six people and wounding 10 others in a shooting rampage 
began monday with the prosecution saying the defendant methodically 
shot his victims 
but the defense maintains william cruse is a paranoid 
schizophrenic and is innocent by reason of insanity 
cruse looking frail with unruly gray hair is charged with 
killing six people including two police officers wounding 10 
shooting at 18 others and kidnapping two at two palm bay shopping 
centers during a sevenhour crime spree april 23 1987 
in opening arguments monday before circuit judge john antoon 
both sides agreed cruse suffered delusions and believed his 
neighbors thought he was a homosexual 
a prosecutor said his festering anger triggered the shooting 
spree at the publix and winndixies grocery stores at the two 
shopping centers in the community located in central florida 
but the defense said it was the obsession of a paranoid 
schizophrenic who twisted words and gestures into a sinister plot 
against him believed the whole world was interested in his sex life 
and thought doctors programmed him during surgery to stare at mens 
crotches 
chronic and severe mental illness preexisting brain damage and 
alcohol combined into a very deadly mixture and he lost touch 
with reality said defense attorney paul arlt setting the stage for 
the insanity defense 
the state said cruse bought a highvelocity semiautomatic rifle 
a month before the shooting then bought six 30round clips and 
sufficient ammunition a week before the massacre 
he had control of his weapon at all times said assistant 
state attorney wayne holmes when he needed to bring it to eye 
level and take a marksman stance he did so 
his mental disease in no way justifies killing six wounding 
10 shooting at numerous others and kidnapping two holmes said 
but arlt said cruses psychiatric illness overwhelmed him he 
was totally out of touch with reality 
the trial is expected to last four weeks

an earthquake blamed on blasting in an east german 
potash mine shook both german states on monday injured three east 
german villagers and was felt as far away as switzerland and 
czechoslovakia 
officials said the quake occurred at 202 pm 802 am est 
and lasted 12 seconds the staterun east german news agency adn 
reported damage in five villages along the border with west germany 
minor damage also was reported in west germany 
in the village of voelkershausen east germany 80 percent of 
the buildings were damaged some of them so badly that residents had 
to be preventively evacuated adn said 
adn said the quake measured 55 on the richter scale and was 
triggered by a massive cavein that in turn was caused by miners 
blasting in a shaft at merkers six miles from the border with west 
germany 
the east berlinbased agency said no miners were hurt but 
chimneys fell in five small villages injuring three people it 
reported property damage and power outages in the area and said some 
streets were blocked by rubble 
hesse state radio in west germany quoted an unidentified 
geophysicist in frankfurt as saying it was unusual for mine 
blasting to trigger such a large quake 
the temblor appeared to be the largest on record for that part of 
germany the largest previous one on file in the us geological 
survey national earthquake information center occurred on feb 22 
1953 and measured 54 
bruce presgrave of the us geological survey in boulder colo 
said his office received reports that the quake may have originated 
in a rockburst which occurs when rocks under pressure suddenly fail 
this often happens in mining areas the process of mining removes 
material which may be pressing against one side of rocks which 
remain under pressure from all other directions 
in mondays case adn said a manmade bl geological survey both reported 
readings of 55 
the east german news agency said the quake was centered on its 
territory near the mine west german authorities had placed the 
epicenter between kassel and bad hersfeld in west germany kassel is 
72 miles northeast of frankfurt and 18 miles from the east german 
border 
adn said a chimney fell on a car in vacha injuring the driver 
and the top of a smokestack collapsed on a building in dorndorf 
seriously injuring a man it did not give details on the third 
injury 
it said civil defense units firemen police and volunteers 
helped in cleanup efforts 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorder on a 
seismograph a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage 
the magnitude 68 earthquake that hit soviet armenia last dec 7 
killing an estimated 25000 people released about 90 times more 
energy than mondays tremor in germany

all of texas was under a grassfire alert monday as 
miles of land burned in sparsely populated areas from big bend 
national park to the louisiana border adding to 44000 acres 
blackened since saturday 
no people had been killed but a halfdozen homes and a fire 
truck were destroyed and a dozen head of cattle were killed 
the state forestry service issued the alert until rain which 
the national weather service isnt expecting for days raises 
moisture levels 
it is obvious that the danger is high when we are having fires 
from the louisiana border to the big bend country and north into 
the panhandle area said bruce miles director of the texas forest 
service 
march with its traditional high winds and low humidities and 
cured fuels is always our potentially most hazardous fire period of 
the year he said

thanks monday to moslems who supported his order that salman rushdie 
be killed for writing the satanic verses 
iranian television quoted a statement from the 88yearold 
patriarchs office as saying it was inundated by waves of 
telegrams and letters and pledges of support and readiness to carry 
out the imams order most of them from islamic scholars and leaders 
who organized glorious rallies and protests all of which were 
reported to the imam 
the imam expressed his thanks to all the people for their pure 
feelings which tell of hearts full of faith the statement said 
khomeinis thanks coincided with the opening of a fourday 
conference in riyadh saudi arabia of member nations of the 
organization of islamic conference iran wants the meeting to take 
action about rushdie and the islamic verses which moslems 
believe blasphemes islam

book and western support for rushdie 
arab diplomatic sources said khomeinis death threat had not 
found support at the conference 
he issued the order feb 14 directing his followers to hunt down 
and kill rushdie and iranian clerics offered a reward of 52 
million 
rushdie went into hiding he was born in bombay india to moslem 
parents but now is a british citizen and has said he does not 
practice religion 
moslems say his novel blashphemes islam in a scene in which 
prostitutes are given the names of mohammeds wives and in its 
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy koran rather than 
receiving it from allah 
iran broke diplomatic relations with britain last week because 
prime minister margaret thatchers government would not suppress the 
book 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency said monday people 
in the african nations of niger and zimbabwe support khomeinis 
action it said premier mamane oumarou of niger endorsed the 
execution order and a moslem youth group in zimbabwe had vowed to 
bring rushdie to divine justice

quoted council officials as saying it remained available on request 
prime minister brian mulroney of canada whose government briefly 
halted imports of the novel was in london on monday and said i 
expressed to mrs thatcher the view of my government that it is 
unacceptable for anyone to place a price on the head of a private 
citizen for any reason at all least of all for the expression of a 
literary view 
president richard von weizsaecker of west germany said monday 
that religious tolerance should be the starting point of a middle 
east peace settlement 
at a dinner for visiting president hosni mubarak of egypt he 
acknowledged that rushdies book had offended moslems but said hurt 
feelings were not grounds for violation of national sovereignty and 
legal rights 
west germany is irans biggest trading partner iran imported 
13 billion worth of goods from it in 1987 and sold west germany 
exports worth 560 million 
bonn has joined the 12nation european community in recalling its

dozens of pipes scales and other items were 
arrayed monday at us customs service headquarters as commissioner 
william von raab announced seizures of up to 10 million in drug 
paraphernalia over the past few weeks 
one of the pipes a shiny brass item marked 1695 contained a 
warning this product not intended for illegal use as well as 
more prosaic instructions on how to maintain the gloss finish 
but the warning didnt dissuade the customs service from seizing 
the items in northern virginia last month or from seizing a 
40000squarefoot warehouse full of similar items march 1 in 
nashville 
the tennessee seizure of some 306000 items at the contempo 
products inc warehouse was the largest ever von raab said 
the second largest occurred march 4 at the award distributing co in 
philadelphia he said 
were going to take away from the drug abuser the tools of his 
trade von raab said those who manufacture and distribute such 
products are putting yourself at risk to lose millions of dollars 
of your inventory he said 
the nashville seizure filled eight 48foot containers while the 
philadelphia seizure filled four he said 
even so von raab acknowledged that the amount confiscated would 
probably not have a measurable impact on the drug paraphernalia 
industry he estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
drug paraphernalia is sold annually 
there have been no arrests in any of the recent cases but von 
raab said us attorneys around the country are identifying people 
who might be indicted 
the seizures are part of the paraphernalia interdiction program 
for enforcement known as pipe which von raab created last april 15 
as an outgrowth of the mail order drug paraphernalia act of 1986 
the pipe effort has led to 13 major drug paraphernalia cases 
conducted by the customs service and about 15 million worth of 
such items has been seized thus far the service said in addition 
to nashville philadelphia and northern virginia seizures have 
been made by customs officials in washington new york city

the bush administration asked israel on monday 
to ease its grip on the occupied west bank and gaza while us 
policymakers ponder ways to promote mideast peace talks 
secretary of state james a baker iii broached the proposal in a 
45minute meeting with israeli foreign minister moshe arens and also 
told him the situation in the occupied territories was 
untenable a senior us official said afterward 
while the atmosphere was relaxed baker told arens without 
getting into specifics that a calmer environment was essential to 
create conditions that will allow for direct talks said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
we certainly want to reduce tension arens told reporters 
after meeting with baker but arens added its not easy to do 
that considering the violence in the area at the present time 
however the visiting israeli official also commented i think 
we will find common ground on how to do this 
arens then met with president bush at the white house for a 
halfhour and also with vice president dan quayle 
we didnt arrive at any finalized or defined positions arens 
said afterward i think it is probably premature to expect that at 
this point 
while the days meetings evidently went smoothly arens raised 
questions about the talks the united states is having with the 
palestine liberation organization 
the foreign minister told israeli reporters he had informed bush 
the dialogue would not contribute to the peace process because the 
plo remains engaged in three levels of terrorism against israelis 
in southern lebanon by calling for violence in the territories and 
against palestinians who disagree with yasser arafats organization 
meanwhile marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman said in a 
statement that the administration was seeking new ideas to 
advance the peace process 
president bush emphasized that the united states does not want 
to miss an opportunity for peace in the middle east and still 
believes in direct talks as the best path to peace fitzwater said 
baker described the actions he urged on arens as various 
reinforcing and reciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse the 
tension there he was not specific but even before arens arrived 
published reports said they included release of palestinian 
prisoners and a general easing of israeli control 
next week robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia 
is expected to ask the palestine liberation organization to block 
guerrillas from trying to infiltrate israel 
the parallel appeals to israel and the plo seem designed to bring 
the two sides together eventually the israeli government refuses to 
deal with an organization it accuses of continuing terrorism while 
a plo aide said sunday in new york the us approach was unbalanced 
and outdated 
nabil shaath who was granted a visa by the administration to 
attend a conference at columbia university said we are the only 
occupied people in the world who are being asked to refrain from any 
expression against the occupation thats ridiculous 
baker said he had a productive exchange of views with arens 
at the state department returning the kind words arens said their 
talk contributed to building a basis of understanding between us 
at the same time baker stressed any settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict must address the legitimate political rights 
of the palestinian people 
the plo which asserts the right to speak for all palestinian 
arabs is demanding a state carved out of territory now controlled 
by israel 
for 15 months palestinian arabs have waged a campaign against 
israeli authority on the west bank and in gaza the lands were 
captured by israel in its lightning victory over jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 sixday war 
baker reaffirmed the us commitment to israels security and 
said we can and must find a way to move ahead toward an overall 
settlement 
despite pressures from arab and west european governments the 
bush administration is moving slowly in formulating a plan for 
mideast peace talks 
its just basically common sense that before you do anything 
that you could consider an initiative youve got to change the 
conditions and lower the level of violence and confrontation a 
us official speaking on grounds of anonymity said sunday 
bush has said he would not be rushed by a soviet diplomatic 
initiative in the middle east into offering wideranging new peace 
initiatives in his talks with middle east leaders arens will be 
followed here by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir king hussein 
of jordan and president hosni mubarak of egypt 
bush has kept open the us dialogue with the plo that began last 
december despite a series of attacks by plo guerrillas on israeli 
security positions across the border in southern lebanon 
us and israeli officials seem content to use arens visit to 
buy time before moving more heavily into the complex problems of 
mideast peacemaking 
arens who is making his first trip to the united states as 
foreign minister said there was a solid foundation of 
friendship between his country and the united states 
both arens and baker described the two countries as allies

pakistani allies trying to capture the city of jalalabad and 276 of 
the attackers were killed the soviet news agency tass reported 
monday 
it quoted afghanistans official bakhtar news agency as saying 
afghan army units were in control and reinforcing their 
positions 
the tass review of combat at the eastern afghan city over the 
past 24 hours said 215 rebels and pakistanis were wounded including 
several commanders it did not give casualty figures for the 
government forces for that period 
it claimed that pakistani troops operating with the rebels were 
burning the bodies of insurgents killed in the battle and said that 
enraged other rebels 
tass also said eyewitnesses and prisoners of war reported 
monday that officers and military instructors from pakistan as well 
as the commanders of some opposition groups have issued secret 
orders to finish off wounded who cannot be evacuated 
the order caused anger among the rebels who showed 
disobedience and even armed resistance in some cases it said it 
did not elaborate 
in riyadh saudi arabia a rebel official said the insurgents 
expect to gain control of the country within weeks and then will 
seek war reparations from the soviet union 
gulbuddin hekmatyar foreign minister in a provisional government 
established by afghan sunni moslems spoke at a news conference 
monday on the opening day of a meeting of foreign ministers of the 
organization of islamic conference 
he said the puppet government of marxist president najib in 
the afghan capital of kabul will fall within weeks we are 
prefectly capable of overrunning kabul and jalalabad and other 
regions but we prefer to delay military action in inhabited 
regions we do not want to spill blood any more 
hekmatyar claimed the rebels were pounding the gates of 
jalalabad have shot down two enemy warplanes and will enter the 
city shortly allah willing 
he said a qualified organization would be selected to estimate 
the amount of afghanistans losses as a result of the soviet 
militery intervention and how much moscow should pay us in 
reparations he did not give any figures 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1978 
and had as many as 115000 military peronnel in the country before 
it began a withdrawal early last year the kremlin said the pullout 
was completed last month 
tass in its account of the battle for jalalabad 40 miles west 
of the pakistani border and about 70 miles east of kabul said the 
rebels bombarded the citys residential areas sunday with 12000 
rockets and shells 
it said five people were killed and 15 wounded in barrages sunday 
that caused widespread destruction 
soviet television said sunday the afghan army reported it 
repelled an attack on jalalabad by 14000 rebels backed by 3000 
pakistani advisers 
it said the rebels are determined to capture jalalabad and make 
it the base for a transitional government 
pakistanbased rebels most of whom are sunni moslems declared 
the formation of a provisional government last month 
hekmatyar said eight iranbased rebel groups of shiite moslems 
are ready to join the provisional government 
they have not rejected us they have not opposed us he said 
it is only a question of power sharing and they will send a 
delegation from iran to negotiate with us in pakistan on that 
score 
an estimated 1 billion people in the world are moslems and about 
10 per cent are shiites sunnis form the majority 
hekmatyar appealed to countries to recognize the provisional 
government 
an early recognition of our interim government would shorten 
the duration of conflict and spare a lot of bloodshed in 
afghanistan he said 
only saudi arabia sudan and bahrain had granted recognition to 
the rebel government by the time the riyadh conference began

authorities detained at least 240 demonstrators in 
two cities who likened communism to czarist tyranny and officials 
jammed usfinanced radio liberty on monday as it reported on the 
protests activists said 
the actions marked the widest reported crackdown on demonstrators 
in moscow and leningrad in months and the first jamming of radio 
liberty since the soviets halted the practice last fall under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs program for greater openness 
valery terekhev 40 said he was one of more than 200 people 
detained sunday in leningrad in connection with an unauthorized 
threehour demonstration calling for multipleparty democracy in the 
soviet union 
i think there have never been so many people detained in 
leningrad terekhev said in a telephone interview 
all of those detained were released pending trials set for 
wednesday through friday said terekhev a member of the democratic 
union an independent party that challenges the communist partys 
monopoly on political power 
he said 15 buses brought about 2000 police backed up with dogs 
to round up protesters in leningrad who were demonstrating on the 
72nd anniversary of the 1917 overthrow of the russian monarchy 
terekhev said the date of the demonstration was chosen to show 
that the current totalitarian oneparty system in the soviet 
union should be replaced with a democratic multiparty system and a 
free press just as the 1917 revolution ended czarist 
totalitarianism 
the 1917 revolution took place in february under the oldstyle 
religious calendar then in use 
in moscow about 40 people were detained sunday during a similar 
protest on mayakovsky square said yuri mityunov a moscowbased 
member of the democratic union 
one of the slogans of the multicity demonstrations was 
against the absolutism of the communist party which echoed a 
slogan of the forces that toppled the russian monarchy in 1917 
against the absolutism of the czar mityunov said 
one of those taken away by moscow police sergei grigoryants 
editor of the now defunct magazine glasnost was given a 10day jail 
term said viktor rezunkov another editor of the magazine the 
magazine was raided by police last year 
radio libertys reports on the demonstrations and similar 
protests in the siberian city of irkutsk and the volga industrial 
city of kuibyshev were blocked when soviet authorities suddenly 
began jamming them said mityunov a journalist whose commentaries 
are aired on the radios russianlanguage broadcasts beamed at the 
soviet union 
it was completely jammed for 45 minutes mityunov said he 
said in a telephone interview that the jamming stopped momentarily 
but resumed later monday night 
mityunov said the mass detention of protesters reminded him of 
abuses committed under the russian monarchy its a rebirth of the 
same absolutism he said 
on nov 29 the soviets stopped interfering with the broadcasts 
of radio liberty based in west germany and several other foreign 
radio stations including deutsche welle also in west germany and 
the voice of israel israels staterun station 
mityunov said radio liberty was also jammed monday as it aired an 
editorial he had written he said his editorial accused moscow party 
boss lev n zaikov a member of the partys ruling politburo of 
trying to prevent the nomination of his predecessor maverick 
communist boris n yeltsin as a candidate in the march 26 elections 
to a new national assembly 
mityunov held the receiver of his telephone up to his radio so 
the whine of the jamming was audible 
they used to call this khrushchev music or brezhnev music 
he said referring to past soviet leaders now well have to call 
it gorbachev music 
the communists seized power in russia in november 1917 sweeping 
away the provisional government created to succeed the czar after 
the february revolution

the first housing discrimination lawsuits 
seeking monetary damages authorized by congress under new provisions 
of the fair housing act were filed monday by the justice department 
the separate lawsuits were filed against apartment operators in 
florida and minnesota for compensatory monetary damages under 
provisions enacted last year by congress in the fair housing 
amendments act which took effect sunday 
most discriminatory housing practices have been illegal for 
over 20 years the new act makes them expensive as well attorney 
general dick thornburgh said in a statement after the lawsuits were 
filed 
our new authority to seek damages allows us to provide a 
complete remedy for victims of housing discrimination and the civil 
penalty provision can constitute a signficant deterrent to such 
discrimination thornburgh said 
before the amendments took effect plaintiffs in housing 
discrimination suits filed by private attorneys could only obtain up 
to 1000 in civil penalties 
and under the old law the justice department lacked authority to 
seek any monetary award for a complainant 
the compensatory damages enacted by congress are intended to 
repay plaintiffs not only for the loss of time and money but for 
humiliation and emotional suffering 
in addition property owners can be fined 50000 for the first 
finding of discrimination and up to 100000 for a second violation 
the suit filed in federal court in miami charged that jay howard 
magid and two companies he owns rent america inc and skyline 
rental systems inc discriminate against blacks seeking apartments 
in complexes operated in fort lauderdale 
hal eubanks a property manager was also named as a defendant 
a similar complaint was filed in minneapolis against john and 
arnold klinker who operate two buildings containing 40 apartments

commerce secretary robert mosbacher on monday 
directed that all the governments weather stations remain in 
service while a program to restructure the national weather service 
is developed ending speculation of imminent station closings 
it is not in the best interests of the nation to close any 
weather station until the modernization plan is operational 
mosbacher said 
while the department said there would be no immediate closings 
it said plans to modernize the weather service make some eventual 
closings inevitable 
speculation that the department planned to close down or curtail 
service at some weather stations because of budget constraints had 
prompted criticism from members of congress concerned about cutbacks 
in their home states 
mosbacher said the administrations proposed budget for fiscal 
1990 which starts oct 1 includes a request to finance a 
modernization and restructuring program for the weather service that 
would improve forecasting and weather warning systems 
the new system would include advanced weather radar observation 
automation and a new communications system 
closing any of the stations at this point might reduce service 
to the public when we are in fact working to improve that 
service mosbacher said i intend to work closely with the 
congress to insure maintenance of the quality and coverage of the 
national weather service

more federal funding and he announced a program to reward 
communities that raise more than required to match federal funds 
skinner who was chairman of the chicago area mass transit system 
before joining president bushs cabinet said mass transit needs 
federal help but not as much as it has been getting he also said 
more transit systems should contract with private business for some 
services 
skinner told the american public transit association he would 
lead a push for greater state and local involvement in mass 
transit funding 
if we become too dependent in mass transit upon washington we 
will be subject to their whims we will not control our own 
destiny he said 
skinner said that communities that overmatch federal funds in 
mass transit programs will get a higher priority and faster funding 
from his department 
he also said he would travel to communities which are having 
difficulty raising funds and appear before legislatures or city and 
county officials to appeal for an increased local role 
money would be available to fund experimental projects that 
support local fundraising he said 
skinner also said he would support programs to provide more 
transportation for jobless city dwellers who want to get work in 
suburban areas where jobs are more plentiful 
this administration is going to do everything we can to see 
that people can get those jobs he said

millions of quebec residents were left without 
power in their homes and businesses monday and montreals subway 
shut down when a power failure knocked out electricity to most of 
the province 
the blackout occurred at about 245 am near the james bay 
hydroelectric project in northern quebec and affected about 6 
million residents of montreal quebec city and most of the rest of 
the province 
we dont know the exact cause but usually with this type of 
failure the problem is on a line or in a substation said jacques 
henri couture a spokesman for the provincial electric company 
hydro quebec 
about twothirds of quebec had power restored by noon and crews 
were ordered to work through the night if necessary to restore full 
power in all areas of the province 
traffic lights were knocked out and there wasnt enough power to 
start up the extensive montreal subway system which carries about 
600000 commuters a day service stations couldnt pump gasoline 
because the pumps work on electricity 
residents of quebec including energy minister john ciaccia 
expressed anger at the power company 
this is very upsetting not only for the people but for the 
government ciaccia said of the blackout the third provincewide 
failure since april 
ciaccia said he demanded a meeting with top hydro officials for 
an explanation he said the power failures would affect the 
utilitys credibility in the united states where it has negotiated 
huge sales contracts 
some people blamed the big sales of electricity to the united 
states for contributing to the blackout by straining the system 
theyre selling electricity left right and center to the 
americans and its the people in quebec who are paying for it 
said fernand mathurin assistant manager at a convenience store in 
the gaspe region of eastern quebec 
the outage caused an instant 1200megawatt shortage in new 
england which imports hydro quebec electricity directly from quebec 
and through new brunswick but regional utilities brought operating 
reserves on line within 10 minutes new england power pool spokesman 
william sheperdson said 
after tapping additional generating capacity the power pool was 
shipping 300 megawatts of power back to quebec through power lines 
in northern new hampshire and vermont sheperdson said 
sheperdson and vincent iacopino chairman of new hampshires 
public utilities commission said there was no indication that hydro 
quebecs power sales to new england were to blame for the outage 
the provincial utility now sells only excess power to new 
england though it plans larger guaranteed power sales along 
dedicated lines to new england in the 1990s as it develops more 
hydroelectric resources in the vast james bay complex of northern 
quebec 
but iacopino said the blackout confirms that there has to be 
some strengthening of the canadian system for us to rely on that 
power 
at the fairmount bagel factory in montreal the woodburning 
ovens were working but the bagels werent coming off the line 
because the the doughmaking machines were out 
the rachel farm poultry factory was also having problems 
my workers have been here since 330 am but we cant do 
anything because the plucking machines arent working said a man

former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane testified monday he thought he was following 
thenpresident reagans policy when he withheld from congress 
information about oliver norths activities for the nicaraguan 
contras 
the policy of the president to me was to keep this movement 
together and outside contributions from third countries were not to 
be shared said mcfarlane testifying as a prosecution witness in 
norths trial he was referring specifically to money solicited from 
saudi arabia for the rebels 
in addition prosecutors read into the court record a separate 
mcfarlane statement in which he said he had acted under the 
guidance and emphatic policy instructions of the president 
the statement was made 10 days ago to the judge who sentenced 
mcfarlane to pay a 20000 fine and contribute 200 hours of 
community service for his own part in the irancontra affair 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors but north his former 
aide faces 12 felony counts 
mcfarlane will return tuesday for a third day of testimony 
prosecutor john keker asked him monday if he interpreted reagans 
instructions to permit lies to congress 
no he said 
again and again throughout the day he said that if there is 
blame for norths actions it should be his because he was norths 
superior at the national security council 
mcfarlane added that after leaving government i probably got a 
rise out of him when he offered north a job 
for the first time in weeks of trial north smiled broadly 
mcfarlane said that on two occasions he talked with reagan about 
the millions of dollars contributed for the contras by saudi arabia 
the first time in june 1984 just after congress shut off us 
aid to the guerrillas mcfarlane said he sent a note with the 
presidents daily intelligence briefing book informing the president 
that the saudis had agreed to contribute 1 million a month for the 
contra cause 
good lets just make sure it stays that way mcfarlane said 
reagan told him in a return note 
in february 1985 mcfarlane said he learned from the saudi 
ambassador that the middle eastern country was going to double its 
giving and he again told the president the saudis eventually gave a 
total of 32 million 
if the president of the united states says something like 
lets keep quiet is that a direction to lie to other official 
bodies keker asked 
no said mcfarlane 
he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges involving withholding 
information from congress criminal charges at the core of the north 
trial make similar allegations 
did you ever instruct north to prepare false answers to 
congress he was asked no he said 
mcfarlane left government in december 1985 after accompanying 
reagan in november to geneva for the summit meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
it was in switzerland he said that he got a call from the 
israeli defense minister who was in new york asking his help 
clearing a shipment of usmade hawk missiles destined for iran he 
said he told reagan chief of staff donald regan and secretary of 
state george shultz 
the following may by then a private citizen mcfarlane said he 
went to tehran at reagans request to try to open discussions the 
trip was a failure 
on the way back during a stop in israel colonel north told me 
i shouldnt be disappointed because some of the proceeds of the sale 
of weapons to iran was going to be available for the nicaraguan 
contras mcfarlane said 
were you surprised to hear that keker asked 
yes 
did you ask anything about it 
no i should have 
earlier he testified that north prepared a letter mcfarlane sent 
to congress in 1985 denying that anyone on the national security 
council staff solicited funds for the nicaraguan contras 
previous witnesses at norths trial both private fundraisers 
and contributors have testified that around that time north gave a 
number of briefings emphasizing the needs of the rebels but always 
left the room afterward letting others make the pitch for 
contributions 
mcfarlane said he was troubled by the draft letter and questioned 
north about it 
he said i believe i have not violated the law mcfarlane 
said 
he said he had spoken to many groups and if people said 
i want to help that in each case he said i cant be involved 
and said go to the contra office 
one of the 12 charges against north involves the sept 12 1985 
response sent to thenrep michael barnes dmd who was chairman 
of the house subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs newspaper 
stories at the time were reporting some of norths involvement in 
contra aid and barnes asked for the facts 
none of us has solicited funds facilitated contacts for 
prospective potential donors or otherwise organized or coordinated 
the military or paramilitary efforts of the resistance said the 
mcfarlane letter the government charges that north drafted it

the main political adviser to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said on monday that proposals by the bush 
administration suggesting even an indirect israeliplo dialogue were 
unacceptable 
adviser yossi benaharon said on israel radio if the united 
states can help we will be happy to use its assistance but not 
through a dialogue with the plo 
we do not object to a system of understandings to which we will 
also contribute because we have an interest in creating an 
atmosphere for negotiations he said but we are not ready to 
accept the plo as a partner in any deal 
a new rift developed in israels coalition government over 
israeli and us news reports saying american officials plan to 
propose that israel and the plo take steps to quell the 15month 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
creating an atmosphere for peace talks 
the appeals to both israel and the palestine liberation 
organization appeared aimed at bringing the two sides together 
eventually 
israels government is led by shamir of the hardline rightwing 
likud bloc with the centerleft labor party as an uneasy partner 
shamir brands yasser arafats plo a terrorist group and says 
peace cannot be made with such an organization 
communications minister gad yacobi of the labor party said also 
on israel radio that israel should be responsive to the us offer 
the us readiness to become a mediator between israel and the 
palestinians has to be welcomed by the state of israel yacobi 
said we have to be ready to negotiate a peace treaty or a 
political settlement between israel and the palestinians who live in 
the territories even if they are affiliated directly or 
indirectly with the plo 
cabinet minister mordechai gur also of labor said israeliplo 
talks today can lead to a disaster because the differences of 
positions are so deep 
but he endorsed an indirect dialogue saying a limited program 
of achieving tranquillity by mutual steps can lead to a change 
in the positions followed by elections in the territories 
the likud faction responded in parliament by calling on labor 
ministers to confine themselves to their ministerial duties and 
avoid making irresponsible statements which are damaging for 
israels interests 
foreign minister moshe arens met president bush and secretary of 
state james baker iii in washington on monday the trip is in 
advance of shamirs planned washington visit in april 
since palestinians began their uprising against israeli rule in 
december 1987 the insurrection has killed 396 palestinians and 17 
israelis 
a palestinian saris atawna 30 was found beaten to death monday 
in gaza citys main square and a sign next to his body said he was 
killed for selling drugs and helping israel arab reports said 
the army said the body of a known drug dealer was found and that 
it was investigating 
two palestinian teenagers suffered bullet wounds on monday in 
clashes between soldiers and stonethrowing youths in beit hanoun in 
the gaza strip arab news reports said 
in south lebanon on monday israeli troops killed at least three 
palestinian guerrillas in a gunbattle illuminated by parachute 
flares after a chase through hills near israels border 
it was the second day straight that israeli soldiers fought 
guerrillas in israels selfproclaimed security zone who were headed 
for attacks in northern israel 
mondays political furor was not seen as threatening the 
coalition government as long as its majority including party leader 
and finance minister shimon peres oppose direct talks with the plo 
and see themselves bound by the coalition agreement that rules out 
talks with the organization 
but many senior labor members agree with cabinet minister ezer 
weitzman who said sunday that israel should negotiate under certain 
conditions 
their feelings reflect a shift in public opinion in israel 
according to a december public opinion poll 55 percent of the 
public now support peace talks with the plo

eastern airlines imposed a cutrate pay package on 
machinists workers monday that gives them far less than the wages 
that prompted a 9dayold strike and makes the airline the lowest 
paying of all major carriers 
i think its obvious they dont want anybody to come back to 
work wally haber a general chairman for the machinists union 
said of the new pay scale which applies to union workers who cross 
picket lines as well as new hires 
but eastern continued to display its resolve to fly renewing 
more routes as part of a gradual rebuilding that centers on latin 
american service and cheap northeast shuttle flights 
some wall street analysts said eastern appears likely to expand 
its offprice fare strategy which was so successful last weekend 
that hundreds of people were stranded in airports when they couldnt 
get aboard packed eastern shuttle flights 
at miami international airport people lined up monday to buy 
tickets instead of demand refunds and the company reported steadily 
increasing sales the company has recalled about 100 employees 
mostly reservations agents who were laid off one week ago when 
eastern cut back to 1500 employees 
eastern which on march 9 filed for federal bankruptcy 
reorganization operated 75 flights sunday and aimed for 85 monday 
the company resumed jetliner service between miami and new york 
montreal and san juan puerto rico eastern also has renewed service 
on 13 latin american routes since the strike began march 4 
eastern had planned to resume jetliner service between boston and 
washington on monday but delayed that until thursday company 
spokesman robin matell said the company had to call an audible 
the air line pilots association meeting in washington in 
national executive session to discuss strike benefits for eastern 
members ridiculed the companys credibility and its service plans 
we believe they will be significantly hampered in ever reaching 
these stated goals because they dont have the pilots eastern 
pilots spokesman ron cole said in miami 
the pilots union estimated that by sunday eastern was flying 
only 35 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1040 daily flights 
the pilots union also charged eastern betrayed its trust to the 
flying public by leaving about 550 passengers at airports in 
boston new york and washington over the weekend cole said the 
shuttle service previously has had backup flights available to 
guarantee a seat to every customer 
eastern spokesman james ashlock said all those left in the 
airports overnight were moved out monday morning 
eastern flew about 30000 people during three days of 12 bargain 
fares which monday went up to 49 still less than half the normal 
99 weekday fare 
eastern insisted its advertisements made clear the shuttle 
flights were on a firstcome firstserve basis and said it flew 62 
flights sunday five more than usual on a weekend 
meanwhile the company filed for injunctive relief in the us 
11th circuit court of appeals no timetable was set for hearing 
easterns argument rejected last week by a miami federal judge 
that the pilots walkout is illegal 
an eastern attorney said the company would ask a federal 
bankruptcy court in new york this week to approve the sale of its 
northeast shuttle to donald trump for 365 million 
representatives of the pilots and mechanics unions said they 
would challenge the deal a machinists official also said the union 
was working on its own bankruptcy reorganization plan for eastern 
which could include a buyout of the airline 
the machinists said the new pay rules that eastern announced 
monday make cuts much deeper than the 150 million in concessions 
demands that spurred the machinists strike 
haber said mechanics pay would drop from the current 1883 to 
14 an hour with new hires receiving a minimum 10 an hour ramp 
service agents also called baggage handlers would go from 1560 
to 1154 with new hires receiving 10 machinists janitors who 
receive 1321 an hour would drop to 825 with new hires getting a 
minimum 5 
overtime holiday and night differential pay are also slashed 
haber said 
haber said the new rules go beyond what the management was 
entitled by law to impose when the strike began because they are 
worse than the companys final contract offer there have been no 
negotiations since the strike began 
haber said the package would make easterns pay scales lower than 
continental currently the lowest among major carriers and like 
eastern a subsidiary of texas air corp 
although texas air chairman frank lorenzo has insisted that 
eastern will survive bankruptcy and return as a major carrier haber 
said continental is already moving into eastern routes 
so hes taking money out of his left pocket and putting it into 
his right pocket haber said weve got to figure out a way to 
put a hole in his pocket 
eastern officials acknowledged that they imposed the new pay 
rules but dismissed the unions concerns about them

a young man shot and killed his 
halfsister and his halfbrother and then took his own life in a 
high school courtyard monday officials and news reports said 
samir doulim fired at abil jbali and jbalis sister ilham jbali 
both in their 20s for unknown reasons before turning his pistol on 
himself police reported 
the french news agency agence france presse quoted unidentified 
police sources as saying the argument was a family quarrel 
possibly of a religious character the agency quoted unidentified 
students at the school as saying the two young men reproached ilham 
jbali for dating a nonmoslem all three were of moroccan origin 
abil and ilham jbali were rushed from paul langevin lycee in this 
paris suburb to two paris hospitals and the sister died several 
hours later officials said 
the brother died several hours after his sister agence france 
presse quoted hospital officials as saying 
assistant prosecutor michele requin said that because the gunman 
was dead there would be no criminal investigation that might 
explain his motives 
police initially reported incorrectly that the brother and sister 
were killed immediately at the school and that the gunman fled 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
drama began at about 2 pm when the two young men accompanied ilham 
jbali to school after stopping at a local cafe 
when they reached the school samir doulim pulled out a pistol 
and began firing at his companions the sources said he then turned 
the gun on himself 
staff members answering the phone at the school said they were 
uncertain about the details of the incident and referred all queries 
to police

president didier ratsiraka was 
winning a slight majority in election returns monday night a 
dramatic reversal from previous votes in which the socialist leader 
ran up huge majorities 
all three opposition candidates blamed the 52yearold 
presidsents policies for economic decline on the island off 
southeast africa interior ministry figures released after about 
half the 55 million votes had been counted gave the president 562 
percent 
in the 1982 election ratsiraka got 80 percent of the votes and 
he won a 1975 referendum on his presidency with 95 percent 
he must finish with a majority this time to avoid a runoff with 
the leading challenger as expected manandafy rakotonirina of the 
proletarian movement party was in second place with 2889 percent of 
the vote 
no major incidents were reported during the balloting sunday 
ratsiraka had denied an opposition request to allow foreign 
observers but the federation of christian churches said it would 
monitor the vote in case of fraud 
final figures were not expected for several days because of 
transport and communications problems on the indian ocean island of 
226658 square miles 
the ruling military chose ratsiraka as president in 1975 he 
broke many ties with france the former colonial power and with 
other western countries and set the nation on a socialist course 
nationalizing many foreignowned industries 
natural disasters ranging from cyclones to droughts beset the 
island and with the economy near bankruptcy in 1982 ratsiraka 
began restoring economic ties with the west 
he and his opponents in this campaign all claimed they had the 
support of western governments and lending institutions

a roman catholic church that was closed 
to end a protest by dissident polish parishioners will be reopened 
with warnings that troublemakers could be arrested a parish 
corporation member said monday 
the corporations fivemember executive board which includes 
bridgeport bishop edward egan voted privately friday to reopen 
predominantly polish st michael the archangel roman catholic 
church probably by sunday which is palm sunday said edward 
tulinski sr one of two lay members of the corporation 
weve been away from home too long tulinski said 
the church has been closed since feb 18 when church officials 
called police into the church to end a weeklong sitin staged by 
about 200 parishioners who were upset by the transfer of a popular 
polish priest the rev roman palaszewski 
on the advice of the corporations lawyer signs will be posted 
threatening the arrest of anyone who attempts to occupy the church 
or start any activity not authorized by the pastor the rev john 
bambol tulinski said 
the dissidents have held prayer vigils outside the church each 
sunday since the closing they have charged that bambol engineered 
palaszewskis ouster because he was too active in the polish 
community they also questioned bambols commitment to maintaining 
the churchs polish character 
bambol and his supporters have blamed much of the unrest on 
recent immigrants from poland and church officials have refused to 
meet with the dissidents 
henry chmiel one of two parishioners arrested when they refused 
to leave the church vowed to continue the protest despite the 
arrest warning 
ill be the first to get arrested again he said

to meet with an attorney this week she said 
but monsignor nicholas v grieco a spokesman for egan said the 
protesters demands remain nonnegotiable palaszewksi will not be 
returned to the church and bambol will not be removed 
tulinski said church officials did not publicize fridays meeting 
or announce plans to reopen the church because they did not want it 
to become a media event a letter was sent to registered 
parishioners

reopened and referred questions to the church rectory where the

who said months ago that he wanted to retire announced on monday 
that he expects president bush to name a new space agency leader 
within two weeks 
i think he bush will have a successor named hopefully next 
week or the week after fletcher said in an impromptu news 
conference following the launch of space shuttle discovery 
fletcher said he had been in contact with the white house and is 
getting a little anxious about my situation im a lame duck so 
to speak 
the national aeronautics and space administration chief blamed 
the delay in announcing his successor in part on the fight between 
the white house and the senate over the failed appointment of former 
sen john tower to be secretary of defense 
they bush administration officials got tied up with john 
tower and a lot of other appointments he said ive been 
assured of course i was assured it would be february that in a 
week or two there would be somebody new 
fletcher has twice served as nasa administrator he first held 
the job in the 1970s and then took it again in the aftermath of the 
challenger disaster in 1986 
asked if he thought nasa had improved since the space shuttle 
blew up and killed seven astronauts 
you bet i do he said im really proud of the team they 
have come a long way

mutilation and false imprisonment in the november 1986 
torturemurder of carla lenz 17 the sister of his wife emily 22 
the verdict sets up the second phase of webers trial which will 
focus on the defendants sanity in the death of miss lenz and the

miss lenz

to begin tuesday 
i dont have any reaction to the verdict said attorney john 
reid who along with lawyer james lex defended weber 
county district attorney paul barnett said he was obviously

a senator complained on monday that japanese 
contractors rigged bids at the us naval base of yokosuka on tokyo 
bay and were let off too lightly by the japanese government 
sen frank murkowskiralaska was testifying at an investigation 
of access to japanese projects for american construction firms the 
hearing conducted by the office of us trade representative carla 
hill was required by the trade act of last summer 
the bidding on projects at the us base is supervised by 
japanese nationals employed there and im told that american 
contractors have been unable to win any contracts murkowski said 
in an interview afterwards 
i would think we would have enough americans there to supervise 
the bidding 
after the investigation president bush may have to decide 
whether or not the us construction industry has been hurt by 
japanese practises and if so what retaliation if any he wants to 
take 
murkoswki said that last december the japanese fair trade 
commission fined 70 japanese firms for rigging bids on projects at 
yokosuka and issued warnings to 70 others he quoted a book on the 
japanese industry by koji tatezawa as saying that the japanese 
construction ministry refused a recommendation from the commission 
to ban the firms for six to nine months from bidding on official 
projects and banned them only for a month that ended jan 8 
murkowski said 
one wonders how this type of penalty is going to effectively 
deter firms from engaging in dango which he defined as a system 
for rotating the winning bid among japanese firms 
he recalled that last may japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga and 
commerce secretary william verity exchanged letters on making it 
easier for us firms to enter the japanese construction market 
significant barriers nevertheless remain murkowski said 
the only way these barriers can be removed is through a 
commitment by the japanese government to expand the coverage of the 
arrangement and to devote more resources to the enforcement of laws 
prohibiting anticompetitive practices such as dango he concluded

government of undermining the institutions and democracy he 
also pointed to a banking scandal in which papandreou and senior 
cabinet ministers were accused of raking in millions in payoffs 
deputies from papandreous panhellenic socialist movement cheered 
and applauded when speaker yiannis alevras announced the voting 
result the socialists control 157 seats in the singlechamber 
parliament 
after the vote papandreou announced that three socialist 
deputies who abstained would be dismissed from the party 
of 278 deputies in the chamber for the vote 123 voted for 
censure the socialists picked up a vote from an independent deputy 
new democracy with 111 seats received support from independents 
and a small conservative splinter group the communists with 10 
seats abstained 
in a speech during the debate papandreou indirectly accused the 
cia of helping the greek banker involved in the multimilliondollar 
scandal to flee the country 
the prime minister rejected a us state department statement 
denying that a selfproclaimed cia agent ever worked for the 
intelligence agency 
the statement issued by the united states embassy that mr 
mailis was not part of the cia is unacceptable papandreou said 
the purported agent tom mailis told a parliamentary 
factfinding committee last week that bankerpublisher george 
koskotas was a cia agent trying to undermine greece 
mailis has not been available for further comment 
the state department in a statement issued sunday through the 
us embassy in athens said that neither he nor the others he 
reportedly has alleged to work for the cia now work or ever have 
worked for the cia 
in whose interest was it to allow koskotas to flee greece in 
the united states he has the entire media available to him to attack 
the government so again i ask in whose interest was it to make him 
flee papandreou said 
he reiterated a call for koskotas immediate extradition from the 
united states and threatened painful consequences if koskotas 
was not sent to greece before june elections here 
i will tell you about the consequences before the elections and 
they will be painful he said 
last week papandreau hinted at consequences for the united 
states on saturday he made a reference to his governments decision 
to shut down one of four us military bases in greece he said 
talks on a new bases agreement were continuing but that their 
bases time of stay in greece is running out daily 
koskotas fled greece last november after being indicted in a 200 
million fraud forgery and embezzlement scandal 
he was arrested in the united states and is in a salem mass 
jail awaiting an extradition hearing 
koskotas 34 has alleged that papandreou and senior cabinet 
members authorized plans to siphon millions of dollars from the bank 
of crete while koskotas was chairman he also claimed they received 
millions of dollars in payoffs 
most of his allegations were reported in the march 13 issue of 
the us news magazine time 
mitsotakis leader of the opposition new democracy party accused 
papandreou of not replying to the allegations and described his 
charges of cia involvement a childrens story 
it is not the foreign and domestic centers that are 
destabilizing greece mitsotakis said adding that you 
papandreou are the one that has turned greece into a banana 
republic 
mitsotakis said his party submitted the censure motion because 
the government was undermining the institutions and democracy 
he also charged that socialist officials were deeply involved 
in the koskotas affair 
the conservative also accused papandreous government of being 
involved in illegal arms shipments to the sandinista government in 
nicaragua and to iran and iraq when those two countries were at war 
i believe the arms scandals are much larger than the koskotas 
affair mitsotakis said 
papandreous only response was to say that mr mitsotakis went 
overboard tonight with his lies and slander

national security adviser brent scowcroft who 
made at least 527894 last year as a private consultant and 
speaker has removed himself from decisionmaking affecting some 70 
us companies including such corporate giants as general motors 
and general electric 
scowcrofts government disclosure form required under provisions 
of the ethics in government act of 1978 also shows the retired air 
force general was unable to specify for whom he provided services as 
a hired consultant for kissinger associates 
in an letter about his financial reporting form scowcroft told 
white house counsel c boyden gray that former secretary of state 
henry a kissinger who heads kissinger associates denied my 
request for a list of the clients for whom i worked scowcroft 
reported receiving 293300 for his services to kissinger 
scowcroft said that under my contractual relationship with 
kissinger associates i worked for the company not directly for its 
clients 
scowcroft has at least temporarily removed himself from decisions 
involving dozens of companies in which he has a financial interest 
the list reads like a virtual whos who of corporate america 
including several major defense contractors and hightechnology 
giants such as ibm lockheed corp the rand corp and aerospace 
corp scowcroft received over 16000 in consulting fees from 
lockheed for example he also got 50000 to perform as a 
consultant to the national council for peace and security 
the disclosure form showed scowcroft has extensive bank and stock 
holdings because officials are required under the law only to list 
the valuations of assets in monetary ranges the form indicated that 
scowcrofts holdings in 1988 were worth between 1079000 and 
3265000 
scowcroft reported liabilities ranging from 200002 to 500000 
because a part of his income came from interest and dividends 
which also needed only to be listed in value ranges scowcrofts 
report showed he earned between 527894 and 649994 
in the letter to gray scowcroft said he intends to place my 
common stock holdings in a qualified blind trust over which 
hell have no control and he would authorize the trustee to sell 
off my stock in companies that perform services that could create a 
conflict or an appearance of a conflict with my duties 
in the meantime he said i am recused from all matters that 
have a direct and predictable effect on or affect the financial 
interests of the entities identified in the disclosure form 
given the industry and sectorwide effect of most matters that 
come before the assistant to the president for national security 
affairs the letter said i plan to request a waiver with 
respect to any of my interests that are not so substantial as to 
affect my actions in matters involving broad policy issues 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said white 
house lawyers are reviewing scowcrofts holdings to determine which 
of the 70 companies could be taken off the recusal list 
the disclosure form also showed that scowcroft formally national 
security adviser to president gerald r ford and later a member of 
the presidential commission that investigated the irancontra 
affair was a hot commodity on the mashedpotato circuit 
scowcroft reported earning 53751 in speaking honoraria 
including appearances before such diverse audiences as the hightech 
giant trw the bonneville knife amp fork club of salt lake city and 
lawrence livermore laboratories 
scowcroft whose national security post pays about 89000 a 
year also received 49452 last year for his membership on various 
corporate boards

the state welfare department was given 
temporary custody monday of an 8yearold child taken from the home 
of a selfstyled inventor who claimed he married the girl and 
her mother on orders from god 
chancery judge glenn barlow held there was probable cause the 
child had been neglected and abused by joseph newman of lucedale 
the girl taken from newmans home last week after he announced 
the marriage in a lengthy statement in which he described 
himself as a messenger from god will remain in welfare department 
custody pending a final hearing march 28 
newman claimed in a more than fiveyear legal battle with the 
us patent office that he had built a machine that produced more 
energy than it consumed in february 1988 a federal judge upheld 
the patent offices refusal to grant a patent saying there was 
insufficient scientific evidence to support newmans claim 
barlow serving as george county youth court judge also ordered 
that the girls 3yearold brother be taken from their mother and 
placed in the care of the welfare agency pending a hearing later in 
the week 
newman threatened to file suit against all those responsible for 
removing the child 
this is going to go a lot greater than right here said 
newman 52 who claims to follow all major religions 
newmans statement said he had followed gods orders by 
marrying his secretary anne mizelle harrell 30 and her 8yearold 
daughter the child was removed from newmans home friday by george 
county sheriffs deputies 
newman said a recent religious conversion led to his revelation 
that god wanted him to marry ms harrell while he was still legally 
married to his wife of 14 years ellen newman mrs newman moved to 
her parents home in alabama after newman declared he was marrying 
the child 
he said he has not had sexual intercourse with the child i 
told her that if there is any sexual relations between me and that 
child god will tell her when and she should not feel pressured 
he said 
sexual relations with a child under 14 constitutes capital rape 
which carries the penalty of death or life imprisonment in 
mississippi 
an attorney for mitchell harrell the childrens natural father 
said after the hearing that harrell would seek custody of the girl 
and boy

labor leaders said they expect brazils 
major cities to be brought to a complete halt on tuesday at the 
beginning of a 48hour general strike called to protest frozen wages 
jair meneguelli president of the radical left central workers 
union predicted on monday that the strike will be the biggest 
this country has ever seen and will keep millions of workers 
off their jobs 
it will be the third general strike since brazil returned to 
civilian rule in 1985 a december 1986 strike was only partially 
successful and a strike in august 1987 failed completely 
this year the two labor movements have put aside their 
rivalries and we are much better prepared meneguelli said 
the strike has been planned for weeks by his union and the more 
moderate general workers central the two largest and most militant 
labor organizations in this continentsized nation of 144 million 
people 
of brazils 60 millionstrong work force the two organizations 
claim to represent nearly 35 million workers 
meneguelli and joaquim dos santos andrade president of the 
general workers central appeared together at a news conference 
monday 
we will stop all economic activity in sao paulo south 
americas largest city and brazils industrial and financial center 
with 10 million people rio de janeiro porto alegre belo 
horizonte and many other cities meneguelli said andrade nodded 
in agreement 
marilia goncalves news media spokeswoman for the labor ministry 
said by phone the government would respect the workers right to 
strike and that everything indicates it will be a peaceful 
movement 
the wage freeze is part of a government economic package 
introduced jan 15 aimed at controlling runaway inflation of more 
than 1000 percent 
the measures included a freeze on prices and brought inflation 
down from a rate of 287 percent in december to 36 percent for the 
first 11 days in february the latest period for which figures are 
available 
but meneguelli said the wage freeze cut workers buying power by 
up to 49 percent and we want it back 
the government agrees that purchasing power dropped but it 
still has not calculated by how much miss goncalves said 
the sao paulo state federation of industries said the general 
strike was aimed exclusively at destroying the economic package 
which despite its errors was the only viable way to stop a process 
of hyperinflation that threatened to lead brazil to chaos

the former chief of the star wars research 
program urged the pentagon upon his retirement to embrace a new plan 
for an antimissile defense system relying on thousands of 
brilliant pebbles floating in space 
lt gen james a abrahamson who retired at the end of january 
wrote in an end of tour memo dated feb 9 that the concept known 
as brilliant pebbles offered both improved performance and 
dramatic cost reduction he said the total cost could be 25 
billion far less than previous estimates 
i believe that with continued effort and innovation a 
brilliant pebbles concept that meets phase 1 joint chiefs of staff 
requirements can be proven in two years with deployment starting 
three years later abrahamson added 
this could be accomplished for less than 10 billion 
the brilliant pebbles program has been disclosed previously and 
is based on research underway at the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory the idea is to devise a small cheap light satellite 
that carries its own small computer sensors and propulsion system 
thousands of these tiny satellites could then be boosted into 
space encircling the globe if the soviet union launched nuclear 
missiles against the united states or its allies the brilliant 
pebbles could home in on the missiles exhaust plumes and rocket off 
to destroy the missiles by colliding with them 
while the program has been detailed previously abrahamsons 
ringing endorsement of the work had not been reported the center 
for peace and freedom a conservative washingtonbased think tank 
that has promoted star wars released a copy of abrahamsons memo on 
monday 
lt col edwina palmer a spokeswoman for star wars said the 
pentagon would have no comment on the matter 
abrahamson is traveling but he did write what is known as an 
end of tour report to acting defense secretary william h taft 
iii the spokeswoman said that report was a private 
communication and the pentagon has nothing to say on the matter 
she added 
abrahamsons successor lt gen george l monahan jr is 
scheduled to testify on tuesday on star wars before a house 
subcommittee 
the star wars program known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative is a research effort to develop lasers and other exotic 
weapons that could automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired 
at the united states launched by former president ronald reagan 
the united states has so far spent about 16 billion on the effort 
the pentagon just recently estimated that a phase i star wars 
system using both groundbased and spacebased weapons and sensors 
would cost about 69 billion abrahamson in his memo said the 
brilliant pebbles program was exciting because it offered greater 
opportunities for an earlier and more affordable sdi deployment 
to complete a phase 1 system built around brilliant pebbles 
abrahamson said the pentagon would need to spend only about 11 
billion on a new spacebased sensor system and about 4 billion on a 
new command and control ground complex 
thus an entire sdi phase i system should not cost more 
than approximately 25 billion he concluded 
the retired threestar air force general also argued in his 
report to taft the pentagon should increase the size of the staff of 
the sdi organization as research moved to development that the head 
of star wars be a fourstar general instead of a threestar officer 
and that he be given more direct control over the various projects 
and that negotiations be opened with congress to obtain an up 
front agreement on star wars funding for the next two years 
locking in totals that would not be tampered with

a 60yearold woman was sentenced monday to 
20 years to life in state prison for selling a halfpound of cocaine 
to an undercover police investigator 
the defense attorney for martha weatherspoon objected to the 
sentence as a little harsh noting that his client would be 80 
before she is eligible for parole 
at her age it is life said the lawyer hurclee maye 
weatherspoon a syracuse resident was convicted in january of 
firstdegree criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance 
and other drugrelated charges 
she admitted to selling 8 ounces of cocaine last october for 
8000 but claimed she was only acting as a delivery person for 
20yearold darryl gibbs of brooklyn her codefendant 
however gibbs was acquitted of all charges after claiming he 
went to weatherspoons residence to buy drugs not sell them 
assistant district attorney richard southwick asked judge walter 
gorman to impose the maximum sentence of 25 years to life 
southwick said weatherspoon was involved in a fairly 
sophisticated narcotics distribution system that used electronic 
pagers and stash houses

a bill that would virtually ban the 
sale of more than 40 types of assault weapons in california 
including the one used to kill five schoolchildren was approved 
monday by the assembly without a vote to spare 
the measure was sent to the senate by a 4138 vote the bare 
majority needed for approval in the 80seat lower house after a 
sometimes heated twohour debate 
the assembly action means that both houses of the legislature 
have now passed bills to restrict access to the weapons the senate 
overwhelmingly approved a broader proposal last thursday 
but the author of the assembly bill assemblyman mike roos said 
supporters of the two measures face still face ticklish obstacles in 
getting one of the bills to gov george deukmejian who has 
indicated support for roos proposal but not the senate version 
its not downhill he told reporters after the vote its 
going to be vote by vote every time i change a line in the bill 
its a reason for people to drop off 
roos said he had lost some support for the bill over the weekend 
because of lastminute pressure from gun groups who want to prevent 
california from becoming the first state to ban assault weapons 
the two bills were introduced in january after a deranged 
drifter patrick purdy opened fire at a crowded stockton 
schoolyard killing five young students and wounding 29 others as 
well as a teacher 
purdy sprayed more than 100 rounds across the playground using a 
semiautomatic version of the ak47 an assault rifle that police say 
is becoming increasingly popular with street gangs 
roos bill started off as identical to the bill sponsored by 
senate leader david roberti which includes a general definition of 
assault weapons but roos bill was restricted in committee to cover 
about 36 models of rifles eight types of pistols three types of 
shotguns and nearly identical weapons 
the assembly measure with few exceptions would bar the 
manufacture importation sale giving or lending of the assault 
weapons after next jan 1 use of one of the weapons in a felony 
could result in a fiveyear prison sentence enhancement 
adults who legally possessed the weapons before next oct 1 could 
keep them if they registered them with the state anyone who wanted 
to legally obtain one of the guns after sept 30 and keep it after 
jan 1 would have to obtain the same type of permit required for a 
machine gun 
only about 350 machinegun permits are in use now in the state 
after next jan 1 an assault weapon could only be sold to a 
licensed gun dealer or to someone out of state under the bills 
provisions 
differences between the roos and roberti measures will probably 
be ironed out in a twohouse conference committee roos said 
assuming that the bills make it through the opposite house

thousands of newspaper readers in san francisco chicago and 
springfield ill on monday found mockups of their favorite 
dailies spouting antiwar harangues printed by groups protesting 
us policy in el salvador 
groups in the three cities said they placed fake front pages 
around actual copies of the papers in vending machines officials at 
all three papers denounced the imitations and at least two were 
considering legal action 
at first glance the fake front pages appeared to be the real 
fronts of the chicago tribune the san francisco chronicle and the 
springfield state journalregister but readers got a surprise on 
closer examination 
the fake chicago tribune had the newspapers masthead but 
contained stories with headlines proclaiming us at war in el 
salvador and death squad activities tribune officials said 
the other phony newspapers had similar headlines 
blearyeyed commuters in san francisco might not have immediately 
noticed that their newspaper was called the chornicle not the 
chronicle but they may have done a doubletake at the 
frontpage apology from chornicle editors for the newspapers 
coverage of el salvador 
a news release delivered to the associated press in san francisco 
said 100 members of a group called the citizens against the us war 
in el salvador put out more than 10000 copies of the phony papers 
to get out the truth about the situation in el salvador 
we believe that actions like this can contribute to building a 
political movement in the us that can stop the war in el salvador 
and support selfdetermination for the salvadoran people the news 
release said 
in illinois a group calling itself the people for a free el 
salvador claimed responsibility for the ploy 
the baltimore sun and the arizona daily star were the targets of 
similar stunts in january 
a tribune spokeswoman ruth ellen roguski said the bogus front 
page was placed on thousands of newspapers in the city and in state 
editions circulated in springfield 
ms roguski said the tribune assumed the protesters merely placed 
a coin in the vending machines to gain access to the newspapers 
while the right of free speech and political protest is 
understood and appreciated tampering with the front page of the 
tribune interferes with and distorts our mission as a newspaper and 
our right to do business the tribune said 
the tribune will take every legal step possible to prosecute 
the people responsible and prevent any reoccurrence 
steve fagan editor of the state journalregister said the phony 
front page placed around his newspaper had the headline us 
continues to wage war in el salvador a box on the page disclaimed 
any affiliation with the newspaper 
fagan said about 30 of the newspapers 200 street boxes were the 
target of the protesters 
we view this as a childish prank as well as an incident of 
vandalism and criminal trespass fagan said the worst part of 
it is this is an unwarranted intrusion on our readers 
jessie knight vice president of the san francisco newspaper 
agency which handles printing and distribution functions for the 
chronicle said he would be meeting with attorneys to see if 
criminal or civil action could be filed against those responsible 
we think that its certainly something that we want to stop 
from happening knight said 
in chicago leslie schuld of the committee in solidarity with the 
people of el salvador applauded the effort but did not take credit 
there has been little in the press about what is happening down 
there schuld said the tribune in particular hasnt been 
covering the death squad activities adequately

attorneys defending two cambodian 
immigrants who killed a german shepherd puppy for food say the two 
are innocent because the animal was killed humanely 
sokheng chea 32 and seng ou 33 both of long beach 
acknowledged they killed the 4monthold puppy late last june they 
hit it over the head with a blunt object slashed its throat and 
began skinning it 
but police alerted by a neighbor who heard the dogs yelps 
arrived and arrested the men 
chea and ou went on trial last week in municipal court for 
misdemeanor cruelty to animal charges which carry a maximum penalty 
of one year in jail and a 2000 fine 
the trial is being watched by both asian community leaders and 
animal rights groups 
the defense says the dog was killed humanely in a way consistent 
with contemporary slaughterhouses while the prosecution says the 
killing was a crime because it was done in an unnecessarily cruel 
way 
if the dog had been some other kind of animal like a chicken 
or a duck or a pig these people wouldnt be in court said joe 
beason an attorney representing chea while americans consider it 
completely acceptable to go out and shoot a deer those same hunters 
would disapprove of killing a dog for food 
but prosecutor sarah lazarus said we intend to prove that this 
was cruelty its cultural to the extent that each segment of our 
society has its own cultural customs but some of those customs can 
be woven into the fabric of our society and others cannot 
judge bradford l andrews ruled last week that killing a dog for 
food is not in itself illegal and the prosecution must prove the 
dog was maimed wounded tortured mutilated or tormented in a 
manner beyond that required to prepare it as food 
chea and ou have refused comment until the case is over 
local asian leaders said dogs and cats are considered delicacies 
in some southeast asian countries and fear publicity from the case 
may result in intensified antiasian bias at least one death threat 
has been received by the defendants

the bush administration is expected to ask 
congress for more than 50 million in additional humanitarian aid 
for the nicaraguan contras to ensure their survival until early next 
year us officials said monday 
the existing 27 million program which provides for food 
clothing shelter and medical services expires at the end of the 
month the request is likely to be sent to capitol hill before the 
lawmakers begin a twoweek spring recess this weekend 
later contra leader adolfo calero told reporters after a meeting 
at the state department he was informed that the administration 
request would be 40 some odd million dollars 
as described by officials speaking on condition of anonymity the 
request is part of a broad array of activities by the new 
administration designed primarily to achieve a democratic outcome in 
nicaragua through a bipartisan approach by the administration and 
the congress 
if the sandinista government shows a willingness to establish 
westernstyle democracy the administration is prepared to move 
toward more normal trade and diplomatic relations with nicaragua 
alternatively the administration has prepared a list of 
potential punitive measures if the sandinistas do not allow a 
democratic system to take root 
more than 10000 contras are assembled in honduras at camps near 
the nicaraguan border 
some members of congress are prepared to try to link any new aid 
program for the contras to their resettlement in nicaragua or in 
third countries this would be consistent with the wishes of the 
five central american presidents who last month called fo the 
drawing up of a plan within 90 days for the demobilization of the 
rebels 
in return nicaraguan president daniel ortega promised to move up 
national elections from november 1990 to february 1990 the 
administration wants the contras to remain intact until after 
elections as an incentive for the sandinista government to ensure 
opposition forces are treated fairly during the electoral process 
us officials who asked not to be identified said they are 
worried that the hondurans may be too eager for the demobilization 
of the contras to underscore the administrations concern robert 
kimmitt the state departments thirdranking official was in 
tegucigalpa on monday to explain the us position to honduran 
leaders 
he did not plan to visit other central american countries but 
the special us envoy for central america morris busby was in the 
region last week sounding out the presidents of the four countries 
friendly to the united states el salvador guatemala costa rica 
and honduras 
the united states asked honduras on monday to let the contras 
remain in honduras for another year the new york times reported 
the appeal was made by kimmitt the new undersecretary of state 
for political affairs during a meeting in honduras with president 
jose azcona hoyo the newspaper reported in its tuesday editions 
alluding to the steppedup pace of central american diplomacy 
state department spokesman charles redman said monday its a very 
intensive and fastpaced process thats going on 
meanwhile the fate of the contras was the subject of a meeting 
monday in washington between honduran diplomats and contra 
representatives 
a honduran statement issued after the meeting said the meeting 
was part of a process of consultations with all parties on how to 
achieve both democracy in nicaragua and the reintegration of the 
nicaraguan resistance into nicaraguan society 
on tuesday united nations officials will hold further 
discussions on the creation of an international force with a mandate 
to report on violations of border security in central america

some senior federal judges think the taxpayers 
are getting a bargain from the semiretired jurists even though 
dozens accept pay raises after they stop all judicial work 
but other senior judges are concerned even angry that 
colleagues take pay boosts without working a third group is 
satisfied with current pay levels for semiretired judges but 
believes that younger fulltime judges deserve more money 
an associated press survey conducted in february and march of 
the nations 277 senior federal judges found that 48 or 17 percent 
no longer do any judicial work nevertheless they remain eligible 
and in most cases eager for any pay raises granted to active 
judges the survey was undertaken because the government refuses to 
release its own data on the workload of individual senior judges 
the ap found most judges reduce their workload when they take 
senior status many give up criminal cases some drop complicated 
civil cases nevertheless they handle 10 to 15 percent of the total 
federal court workload which is considered a godsend by their 750 
active colleagues

the bush administration is prepared to ease the 
us trade embargo against nicaragua and take a number of other 
conciliatory measures if that country shows it is serious about 
holding fair elections next year according to us officials 
under such circumstances the administration also would be 
prepared to upgrade diplomatic relations with nicaragua including 
the exchange of ambassadors the officials said the two countries 
have not been represented at the level of ambassador in each others 
capital since last july 
the list of possible gestures toward the sandinista government 
numbers about 20 according to the officials who asked not to be 
identified 
alternatively the administration has prepared a potential list 
of punitive measures of similar length if nicaraguan opposition 
forces are not given what us officials perceive to be an equal 
chance in the balloting which probably will be held next february

massacred 10 peasants in september and says nine soldiers will stand 
trial in the case

but he added that it is too early to tell if the development 
signals an end to the militarys traditional immunity from

this article is brought to you by saab 
well maybe not but corporate meddling in popular culture is 
reaching new levels promotional hooks are moving from movies 
television and sports to rock concerts stage plays ice shows and 
even novels and board games 
power city a new hollywood book by former entertainment 
industry publicist beth ann herman is sprinkled with mentions of 
both maseratis and the rodeo drive boutique giorgio but it wasnt 
lifelike detail it was marketing 
when power city was published a beverly hills maserati 
dealer threw a 15000 party for it and giorgio gave it a window 
display 
in the new la game players move around a board in miniature 
porsches stopping at trendy southern california restaurants such as 
spago and stores such as la eyeworks were just a little store 
on melrose avenue and we just saw the game as the right thing to 
do said store spokeswoman ruth handel 
each company offered a fee to be on the board anywhere from 
2500 to 15000 depending on its placement on the game board 
said game creator steve hutchinson porsche paid 45000 to get 
its cars in the game 
by being featured in the glitzy power city maserati can 
enhance its reputation as a stylish coveted plaything in one of its 
top markets as one character says in the book it was by far his 
biggest toy his maserati biturbo i made life bearable in la 
the uniqueness of the promotion was very attractive to me 
michael savod maseratis vice president of sales and marketing 
told adweek magazine said stan friedman who organized the tiein 
i think it did as much if not more for maserati than for the 
book 
herman certainly isnt the first author to hype brand names in a 
novel and glamorize products of the rich for hungry readers judith 
krantz harold robbins and jacqueline susann all laced their best 
sellers with enough names of cars furniture champagnes designers 
jewelry and such to fill all of rodeo drive 
but while entertainmentoriented promotional gimmicks cant 
replace traditional advertising they can make products stand out in 
a crowded marketplace 
entertainment marketing is becoming the phrase of the 80s 
there are so many opportunities said sam baldoni president of 
the baldoni entertainment marketing firm 
sponsorship of sports has gotten so cluttered that you now move 
into the next arena thats available entertainment said jack 
macdonough vice president of brand management for anheuserbusch 
producers of the tvs michelob presents sunday night 
the beer company insists the night belongs to michelob on 
television and in pop music concerts it tries to prove the point 
to make pepsi the choice of a new generation the softdrink 
giant has spent millions marrying the soda to pop music superstars 
gloria estefan lionel richie and michael jackson whose recent 
bad tour was sponsored by pepsi now it has joined mca home 
video in an et the extraterrestrial rebate deal with 
promotional displays for a 5 payback in more than 60000 stores 
theres a slick tv commercial and a potential pepsi cost of 55 
million 
we really are looking for that warm association between pepsi 
and the worlds best family entertainment movie right now said 
pepsi spokesman tod mackenzie ideally et and pepsi will 
become synonymous 
to reward user loyalty pinkerton tobacco co will spend more 
than 1 million sponsoring the red man golden blend country concert 
series which will appear in 25 cities this spring at each stop 
pinkerton will cart out more than 150 store displays in certain 
situations said steve greil we might even lose a few thousand 
dollars but the goodwill is priceless 
cooperative tieins between two companies can be especially 
costeffective and provide instant national visibility 
universal studio tours and usair have joined to promote 
universals theme parks in california and florida usair is going 
to get a lot of exposure for not spending any additional money and 
we will too said gordon armstrong executive vice president of 
corporate sponsorship for universal studios 
in one of the stranger product promotions the california 
raisins balancing on skates have signed on with an ice capades 
tour the hope is that the people who enjoy death spirals and toe 
loops also hunger for dried fruit 
in the ice show the raisins sing and dance and become 
entertainers said jack morrow whose applause inc works with 
various companies to produce california raisin memorabilia 
including pencils halloween costumes lunch boxes pajamas and

whenever 7yearold seif hashim 
spots israeli troops approaching this west bank village he grabs a 
rock pulls a checkered arab keffiyeh over his face and runs into 
the street shouting the armys coming 
seif and his grade school friends belong to the palestinian 
cubs a group linked to the palestine liberation organization 
they set up barricades and throw stones at soldiers in the narrow 
alleyways of this village 66 miles north of jerusalem 
my job is to get the soldiers if they come into the village 
explained seif his big blue eyes flashing there are about 45 
kids in my gang some are older than me theyre 8 
leaning back in his chair seif added in a highpitched voice 
that he supported nayef hawatmehs procommunist democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine 
i want to be a plo guerrilla when i grow up he said or a 
dentist increasingly palestinian children some as young as 5 
and 6 are at the forefront of violent clashes with troops in the 
occupied territories sixtyone children 16 and younger have been 
killed out of a total of about 390 since the start of the 15month 
uprising casualties among youngsters are on the increase according 
to united nations figures 
one reason for the involvement of increasingly younger children 
is that many of the older youths who spearheaded protests are in 
jail or in hiding from the israeli security forces 
the phenomenon has prompted charges from defense minister yitzhak 
rabin that palestinians are putting children in the front lines of 
confrontations to win international sympathy and portray israeli 
troops as ruthless 
this is the major problem israel faces palestinian 
protesters surrounding themselves with kids and women at the 
front rabin told visiting us jewish leaders recently 
he said clashes with stonethrowers make up 90 percent of the 
violent incidents in the west bank and gaza strip and 60 percent 
of these involve children from the age of 6 to 14 or 15 rabin 
said 
children have participated alongside adults and older youths in 
protests since the start of the palestinian revolt but increasingly 
children some as young as 5 are taking on israeli troops alone 
the soldiers are now facing situations where the only targets 
are young kids said an international relief worker who declined 
to be identified that has changed the equation of the conflict 
according to un figures in the first six months of the 
uprising that began in december 1987 65 children 15 or under were 
shot in the occupied gaza strip by the second six months the 
number of young shooting victims had increased nearly fivefold to 
307 of the total 21 died of their wounds in gaza 
in january 61 of the 129 shooting casualties in gaza were 15 and 
under according to the arabrun human rights information center in 
east jerusalem three of the children died of their wounds 
the centers jan abu shakr estimated that hundreds of under16 
youths had been detained during the uprising but said fewer than 100 
were currently held israeli army spokesmen stressed no one under 12 
could be jailed 
in tamoun seif and about 400 boys 5 to 12 years old belong to 
the cubs which has no relation to nonviolent scout groups each 
week the children participate in antioccupation marches 
broadcasting nationalist slogans through megaphones and carrying 
outlawed palestinian flags and pictures of plo chairman yasser 
arafat through village streets 
children are organized by uprising leaders well aware of the 
propaganda value provided by children facing heavily armed soldiers 
we are teaching these kids to be active resisters said 
shehad gharaybeh 30 a youth organizer the personality of the 
child is formed in the early years these children will be stronger 
than us they are the plos plan for continuing the struggle 
also punishing children is a sensitive issue for the israeli 
army we know that and it is something we use he added 
two boys 9 and 16 have been killed in tamoun in the uprising 
that began in december 1987 and 13 children have been wounded the 
youngest shooting victim was ziad omar sharat 7 a member of seifs 
cubs group who was wounded in the arm in november 
the marches are nice but i prefer clashing with soldiers 
said riad omar mohammed sharat 13 brother of ziad im not 
afraid of soldiers they have weapons and we have weapons our 
weapons are firebombs and stones 
shafiq masalha a clinical psychologist at bir zeit university in 
the west bank said the children were not fully aware of the dangers 
they faced 
these children cannot really imagine themselves being injured 
or killed he said in an interview they dont calculate the 
risk in advance they dont really understand the risks 
seif disagrees he said he knows what a martyr is 
being a martyr means that i was attacking the army with stones 
and i was hit by a bullet my family could not get me to the 
hospital in time because the army blocked the road so i died on the 
road then the other boys had a march in the village for me thats 
a martyr 
afterward you go to paradise

a planned south american highway 
hailed 25 years ago as a route to progress and development is now 
making headlines as a potential opening to environmental destruction 
even to increased cocaine trafficking 
the 695mile road to link the remote western brazilian amazonian 
state of acre with peru and thence to the pacific ocean still does 
not exist 
many brazilians believe foreign forces including president bush 
have aligned themselves against the road despite denials from 
washington and elsewhere brazilians are telling outsiders to mind 
their own business 
they say the acreperu road eventually must be built 
the highway idea was born in 1963 when president fernando 
belaunde of peru announced and started to build the marginal 
jungle road on the undeveloped eastern slopes of the andes 
connected to lima perus capital on the pacific the ultimate idea 
was to link the pacific to the atlantic by land 3650 miles across 
south america via brazil 
brazil and peru in 1978 signed an amazon cooperation treaty in 
which the road was listed as a goal but nothing in fact was done to 
build a usable highway between rio branco the capital of acre and 
the peruvian border 560 miles west perus jungle road stopped at 
pucallpa 135 miles from the brazilian frontier 
the road suddenly gained attention in february when gov flaviano 
melo of acre said he would seek japanese financing for his side of 
it supposedly the japanese would be interest because it would give 
them easier access to amazon timber a product they need 
previous amazonian highways in brazil financed in part by the 
world bank have led to widespread cutting and burning of the 
tropical rainforest thus aggravating the greenhouse effect and 
potentially provoking major changes in the earths climate 
angry headlines such as the highway george bush doesnt want 
appeared in the brazilian press gov melo in nationwide newspaper 
ads denounced what he called the unacceptable aggression on the 
part of foreign governments regarding internal brazilian affairs 
he said acre needs an outlet to end its centuriesold perverse 
and unfair isolation 
brazilian and japanese diplomats later denied there was any 
current plan to fund the acreperu road 
the state department in washington said bush was not involved 
with the highway an official who asked not to be named said that 
despite concerns over amazonian deforestation the us government 
does not have an established position on the road and its not even 
clear there is going to be a road 
still paulo tarso flecha de lima the no 2 man in the brazilian 
foreign ministry and foreign minister guillermo larco cox of peru 
told a recent meeting of amazonian countries in quito ecuador the 
proposed highway is a priority development project 
it is desirable and beneficial larco cox said without 
highway links we cannot have south american unity 
the brazilian embassy in tokyo said that although reports of 
japanese financing were untrue the acreperu highway is a hope 
for the future 
brazils interior minister joao alves told the associated 
press all of a sudden brazil is being painted as a villain 
destroying nature this is hypocrisy the united states and europe 
already destroyed their forests so they shouldnt be giving us 
lessons 
brazil is a poor country economic development is a question of 
survival he added we are convinced that we can achieve 
development without destroying the environment 
peru despite its official stand is not enthiastic about 
completing its side of the highway 
for one thing the opening of jungle lands in peru led to an 
influx of peasant farmers who became successful by growing coca the 
basic ingredient of cocaine peru has pledged to the us drug 
enforcement administration and other international organizations 
that it will stop the spread of coca plantations 
for another peru is faced with severe economic difficulties and 
cant afford to finish the road at least not now

japan has become the worlds largest donor of 
foreign aid but critics say billions of dollars will be wasted 
unless it improves the way it dispenses the aid to the third world 
the impact of japanese development aid on the environment also 
has come under fire the most recent example being what tokyo 
labeled incorrect reports that it would fund a highway westward 
through the brazilian rainforest to peru and the pacific 
the foreign ministry said neither the government nor private 
japanese interests would pay for the amazon project but the 
criticism voiced by environmentalists and sen albert gore jr 
dtenn was an indication japan will have to watch carefully how 
it spends the huge sums earmarked for development aid 
japan which itself is still repaying loans from the world bank 
only recently increased its aid budget helped by the doubling of 
the yens value since 1985 
the united states for decades the largest donor has cut its aid 
budget while japans official development assistance has risen 
dramatically from 745 billion in 1987 to an estimated 1095 
billion in fiscal 1989 which begins april 1 
washington now in second place in providing nonmilitary aid 
spent 878 billion in 1987 the last year for which a breakdown of 
us aid is available 
without violating its constitutional ban on military assistance 
japan has responded to us calls to support washingtons strategic 
interests said robert m orr a foreign aid expert and professor at 
the tokyo branch of temple university of philadelphia 
in line with us policy japan has increased its aid to 
critical areas like pakistan turkey jamaica el salvador and 
honduras he said 
officials and critics alike however say japan must improve the 
quality of its aid to promote stability in the third world 
the development assistance committee of the parisbased 
organization of economic cooperation and development said in 
december that japans projects should be more costeffective and 
avoid disrupting local communities and the environment 
it added the japanese should give easier terms on loans and do 
more to help the poorest nations 
having pledged over 50 billion in aid in the fiveyear period 
ending in 1992 japan acknowledges difficulties in managing its aid 
only 1500 personnel run the programs the united states has more 
than twice as many and most western donor nations have much larger 
staffs relative to their aid funding 
we face major problems in implementing foreign aid due to 
limitations on personnel said shigeo iwatani foreign ministry 
senior assistant for economic cooperation 
we are gradually increasing our staff but government hiring is 
strictly limited and few specialists are available 
the policy of rotating officials every few years prevents the 
training of aid experts said another senior foreign ministry 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
japan should learn from the united states perhaps by setting up 
the equivalent of the us agency for international development and 
academic programs to train aid professionals orr said 
foreign ministry officials readily acknowledge that due to 
inadequate staffing the government relies on japanese trading 
companies to identify aid projects 
they have a very extensive information network if they come up 
with a good project why should we reject it the senior official 
said 
involvement of the private sector has fueled accusations 
however that japan uses aid to give its businesses a foothold in 
third world markets 
japanese companies share in aid contracts fell from 59 percent 
in fiscal 1981 to 38 percent in fiscal 1987 
trading companies naturally favor lucrative contracts to build 
roads dams and bridges but orr said such projects shift the focus 
of aid away from basic human needs 
japan doesnt make environmental impact statements so projects 
have been carried out despite environmental damage he added 
takaaki yasuoka of sophia universitys institute for social 
justice in tokyo said japan should share its talents and skills with 
the third world instead of building expensive projects 
japan provides aid to many countries but its just investment 
it doesnt meet the needs of the poorest people he said its 
as if we have no empathy for their misery 
yasuoka who has traveled extensively to observe japanese aid 
projects described a hospital built with japanese money in the 
african nation of somalia 
it was useless he said the expensive equipment couldnt 
be used due to electrical outages but there was a chinese clinic 
nearby staffed by 200 chinese doctors and nurses if such a poor 
country can send people we should send people too 
inadequate followup is another major problem that virtually 
invites corruption yasuoka said 
he cited a case in which the philippine government of president 
corazon aquino charged that seven japanese companies participating 
in aid projects paid 45 million in kickbacks in 19751976 to 
thenpresident ferdinand e marcos the companies have denied the 
allegations 
japans emphasis on loans over grants which officials say 
reflects its belief in promoting selfsufficiency has had the 
opposite effect on some countries orr maintained 
yen loans are not all shiny and sweet he said indonesia 
is really struggling to repay its debt most of which is in loans 
from japan is that development 
sensitive to these charges japan has cut interest rates on loans 
and raised the proportion of grant aid which now stands at 60 
percent of the total compared to the us ratio of 92 percent 
according to the foreign ministry 
in the next fiscal year 37 new aid officers will be hired and 
the government has pledged to improve its project identification and 
assessment 
by raising grants japan could increase support to schools 
clinics and agricultural and other technical training programs to 
aid the poor orr said 
the key to success is to develop a corps of trained specialists 
to make sure aid works

jesse jackson was not among allies anything 
but so when they lectured him on political science he lectured 
right back 
in the resulting standoff the edge belonged to jackson the 
twice and future candidate for the white house 
the issue is not just who leads us but who needs us the 
black leader from chicago told establishment democrats who know 
well that they badly need him to stand a chance regaining the 
presidency in 1992 
it was all quite polite but the lines were clear at the 
democratic leadership council conference this past weekend centrist 
and conservative democrats organized the council four years ago 
after the landslide defeat of walter f mondales ticket in an 
effort to turn the party toward what they consider the voter 
mainstream 
jackson does not accept their map of the mainstream 
he suggested there was more to be learned about the next 
presidential election on the eastern airlines picket lines than in a 
seminar at a philadelphia hotel 
jackson told the council that white airline pilots who make 
140000 a year are on his side now because he went to their sides 
i am one of the few people around this table who has a net gain in 
white supporters he told the conference of democratic workers and 
officeholders i understand how to get white votes 
jackson and the democratic leadership council stand on opposite 
sides in the argument over a route back from five defeats in the 
past six presidential elections 
after a campaign in which republicans made the word liberal 
into a political curse most of the democrats at the philadelphia 
conference want a change in the message and a move toward the 
middle jackson insists that the party can win by mobilizing its own 
constituency and sticking to its own message 
the council called in a political science professor for advice 
and he said the problem is with swing voters not with turnout 
william a galston of the university of maryland said if everyone 
eligible had voted in 1988 president bush would have been elected 
by an even wider margin 
democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the 
electorate said sen sam nunn of georgia sen charles s robb of 
virginia said democrats have to win back the middle class and cant 
afford the us against them perception he said has taken hold 
galston said that to have a chance the 1992 nominee must be 
fully credible as commander in chief must respond to the majority 
of voters who favor the death penalty and a generally tougher stance 
on crime and must reassure the middle class 
jackson listened politely but if there had been an exam on the 
galston lecture he would have flunked 
he offered his summation outside the conference room if we are 
all things to all people we become rather illdefined indecisive 
kind of like warm spit 
at least jackson was there listening and talking to democrats 
who know that his power will remain their problem he ran first in 
13 states and second in 33 in contests for democratic delegates in 
1988 and he shows no signs of slowing 
nunn said that despite their differences i also acknowledge 
him to be one of the people in the country who has the largest 
following and the people who support him are an extremely 
important element in the democratic party 
important enough that none of the establishment democrats picked 
a real fight over jacksons stance back home in chicago where he is 
supporting a thirdparty black candidate against richard m daley 
the democratic nominee for mayor 
robb did mention it saying jacksons refusal to support the 
primary winner could be a problem for him in 1992 jackson insists 
that the presidential primary elections and party caucuses should 
choose democratic presidential nominees without intervention by 
party leaders 
let the primary process determine the winner in 1992 jackson 
said in philadelphia 
but in discussing the chicago race jackson said he had supported 
daley twice in other elections and hes not endorsed me once 
you should support people who support you jackson said 
noting that some of those who criticize him now have refused to 
support black nominees in the past what is sacred are 
relationships honorable reciprocal relationships what is sacred 
is not the primary 
thats a line that may be replayed when presidential primaries 
are again the issue

pat sajak says he judges the success of his 
new latenight talk show not by the ratings but by the happy faces 
of cbs big shots 
you can drive yourself crazy looking at the ratings numbers 
every day and comparing yourself to everyone else said sajak i 
mainly go by the cbs executives if they smile and stay out of our 
way i know things are going well 
cbs executives have a lot to smile about the pat sajak show 
made its debut jan 9 and things are going very well 
sajak of course is not giving johnny carson of nbcs tonight 
show anything to worry about and probably never will but thats 
not the point and never was the biggest fallacy about latenight 
programming is the assumption that youre failing miserably if 
youre not beating carson or at least breathing down his neck 
the bugbear sajak had to overcome was previous latenight 
programming on cbs a hodgepodge of original shows reruns and 
movies not only were cbs ratings trailing far behind carson and 
abcs nightline but many affiliate stations were also dumping 
the shows to run their own 
the rating for the cbs latenight shows in december was 33 
while carson had 55 and nightline 49 in its debut week sajak 
outdistanced all the competition part of that was due to curiosity 
after two months sajaks ratings have leveled off and the show 
now runs behind carson by at least two ratings points in the last 
ratings week carson had a rating of 57 nightline 53 and 
sajak 34 in the february sweeps carson got a 56 rating sajak 
35 
the good news is that the ratings are ahead of the previous 
latenight programming 
i feel very good about where we are now sajak said in a 
telephone interview i dont want to sound selfsatisfied or smug 
but i like the look of the show were going through an evolutionary 
process we dont have meetings and say lets change this or that 
but a year down the road we can look at our shows and say theyre 
different 
as for the ratings i really dont keep up with them they go 
up they go down after the first few weeks to make sure people were 
watching i stopped checking were just out to improve what cbs had 
in this time slot before were starting a talk show from scratch 
were not taking viewers away from johnny carson but we are 
attracting people who previously havent been watching network 
latenight shows 
meanwhile carson renewed his contract with nbc for another year 
im having a ball carson told nbc entertainment president 
brandon tartikoff it will be carsons 28th year as host of the 
tonight show 
sajak said he is not trying to break new ground ive said many 
times were out to do a strong traditional talk show he said 
i dont think theres anything we should be doing that were not 
doing weve tried some things that havent worked like asking 
people in the audience about their worst date but our outofstudio 
stuff has worked great 
the sajak show is seen on 195 stations some defecting cbs 
stations have returned to the fold but a few like detroit and 
atlanta do not carry the show in those cities the sajak show is 
broadcast by independent stations sajak has 95 percent of the cbs 
stations while carson has 99 percent of the nbc stations 
sajak still goes to nbc on weekends to tape wheel of fortune 
but he said he has not run into carson both carson and david 
letterman whose nbc latenight show is against the last halfhour 
of the pat sajak show wished sajak well when he launched his 
show

editors note geraldo rivera figures hes the most scrutinized 
person on national tv and he may be right he likes to think of 
himself as an innovator and hes certainly that whatever one 
thinks of the controversial talk show host geraldo has a 
growing following capitalizing on an ageold fascination with 
criminals deviants and misfits 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
we come to you today from the stage at times 
square studios in manhattan where well be bringing you one of the 
most provocative pop culture phenomena of our time 
geraldo rivera has been called the pt barnum of talk show 
hosts and the pecks bad boy of television news 
people magazine called him insufferable the washington 
post denounced his last special as teleporn los angeles times 
critic howard rosenberg says he doesnt believe a thing he sees 
geraldo do 
tell us briefly geraldo in your own words what is it about you 
that so affronts so many in your profession 
i think envy and jealousy plays a part theres a feeling that 
i somehow gypped my way to the top ive gone too far gotten too 
big ive defied all their notions i shouldve failed a dozen times 
by now 
he should have failed but in the 19 years since his television 
debut he has earned more than 150 prizes including three emmys and 
a peabody and his popularity with viewers has never flagged 
the thing about geraldo is that hes passionate about what he 
does says suzanne falterbarns a freelance writer in the 
audience during a recent studio taping of his syndicated daily talk 
show geraldo 
theres no passion on tv anymore everything is canned 
processed fake entertainment geraldos show is kind of 
fascinatingly morbid because its so dark you get to experience a 
little of your own darkness 
not so says critic tom shales of the washington post hes an 
emotional cheerleader who tries to sway audiences in a very facile 
and sleazy way i call him the great panderer because he keeps 
searching for cheaper more sordid more sensational topics at best 
he is embarrassing 
despite the reviews the investigative news group he formed in 
1986 with his wife brother and one employee has grown to 30 people 
with tribune entertainment it produces his live specials and his 
talk show the fastestgrowing program in syndication geraldo 
jumped 67 percent in the national nielsen ratings over the past 
year capitalizing on an ageold fascination with criminals 
deviants and misfits 
geraldo also is developing a weekly series the 
investigators and has just announced plans to buy up tv stations 
with five other prominent hispanics 
yet he remains the punch line to an industry joke heard about 
the geraldo rivera home game a lifesize cardboard cutout of 
geraldo and a folding chair 
hes a target of everyone from cartoonist garry trudeau to johnny 
carson and johnnys nights off bring no reprieve tonight show 
guest host jay leno finds him equally hilarious 
geraldos law degree has proven invaluable much of his career 
has been spent defending himself against charges of distorting the 
news of using drugs of denying his heritage by calling himself 
jerry rivers or conversely of changing his name to geraldo 
rivera to cash in on ethnic hiring trends 
he pleads innocent to all counts 
im the most scrutinized person on national tv everything i 
say everything i do is xrayed nine ways to sunday 
no story is worth a career not only is my own honor at stake 
but its the knowledge that everything i do is examined 
hes convinced that the fuss concerns style not substance and 
that one day some biographer probably someone not yet born 
will show me as a person who brought innovation to television 
the geraldo style explosive confrontational the antithesis of 
the detatched professional mirrors his offcamera personality 
long after the guests have gone home geraldo is still geraldo 
a hispanic dudley doright a reallife equalizer other men walk 
the dog geraldo patrols the bowels of central park with a black 
labrador named spike 
these are not postures he says he wishes he could wear a 
sincerity meter 
it was always there the selfassuredness the cockiness 
says marty berman executive producer of geraldo they met at 
new yorks wabctv which persuaded geraldo to trade poverty law for 
the eyewitness news 
berman became his film editor in 1970 nobody else wanted to 
work with him not only was he arrogant berman says he was 
fearless hed walk into a shooting gallery in the bronx like youd 
walk into a coffee shop hes still very difficult very demanding 
but now hes running a grownup organization 
cc dyer a geraldo producer is his fourth wife fourth 
and final geraldo says the onetime notorious womanizer has 
finally removed the sign that had long been a fixture on his bedroom 
door abandon hope all ye who enter here for the first time 
hes wearing a ring 
geraldo is warmer in person than he seems on tv he laughs more 
and pontificates less and hes forever trying to get people to eat 
he seems happiest when they do 
he is half puerto rican and half jewish one of five children of 
lilly friedman and cruz rivera cafeteria workers who married over 
her parents objections he speaks fondly of his mother who lives 
in a house he bought her in florida and reverentially of his 
father who died in 1987 
my mom is very stereotypical very jewish very oyvey my 
father was a very loving sensitive vulnerable hispanic gentleman 
geraldo grew up in a bluecollar section of long island a 
social politician his compulsion to prove himself is rooted in 
childhood when i fought i was proving myself to the street kids 
when i did well in school i was proving myself to the smart kids

geraldo hopes to have another child he and cc live in 
manhattan but are househunting upstate they started after a 
pregnant doctor was murdered at bellevue hospital i said this is 
too much 
of course the geraldo show with its lineup of neonazis 
hookers and adolescent murderers isnt exactly a romp in the park 
geraldo is good people but i dont know how long ill be able 
to do this says alexander johnson a thoughtful young producer 
whos screening hours of kiddie porn for an upcoming show 
geraldo understands too many seamy stories and the world 
becomes a place held together with wire hangers spit and chewing 
gum thats not an accurate view of the world but some of it sticks 
to you even after the shower 
he tries to end every show with solutions and occasionally he 
serves up lighter fare nudists female mudwrestlers atuff on geraldo 
still its impossible not to take the job away from the 
studio the more i hurt the more i feel thats our edge its a 
net positive 
he makes no apology for crying on camera a habit that dates back 
to his early days at wabc where less than two years into the job 
there he tackled the biggest story of his life he shed many tears 
before he was done 
it began with a call from dr michael wilkins an acquaintance 
who had just been fired by willowbrook state school on staten 
island then the nations largest institution for the mentally 
retarded 
he had a key he knew what time the guards changed when i 
could get inside i asked what i would find he said children 
being abused 
that night wilkins accompanied geraldo and a cameraman to 
willowbrook where they filmed five minutes inside one of the 30odd 
buildings then the cameraman went outside and threw up 
geraldo said i am not going to give this up i am going to 
come back and come back and come back until this is cleaned up 
wilkins recalls 
fifteen years and countless stories later willowbrook closed 
i hear him getting panned but i can only relate to him as i 
knew him says wilkins now in private practice in kansas city mo 
i do see that same spark that i think is a person with a 
gibraltar of integrity and a feeling that he has a mission other 
than selfaggrandizement i do think that otherwise i would be 
angry 
geraldos reporting on willowbrook won him the george foster 
peabody award and catapulted him to the abc network he joined the 
entertainment division then the staff of 2020 
i remember willowbrook like it was two minutes ago like i 
remember my fathers death i still have nightmares about the smell 
the sound it was the most dramatic thing that ever happened to me 
it is the happiest circumstance of my life that changing the world 
is what made me successful 
it was also what had drawn him to journalism in the first place 
at columbia university school of journalism where wabc sent him for 
a crash course he came to regard reporting as a vehicle for change 
among his professors was fred friendly he impressed me with 
the nobility the morality says geraldo journalism was bigger 
than clark kent big it was paul revere big 
he never wanted to be tom brokaw he wanted to bring grim 
reality not pinstriped sensibility to the small screen he became 
the ghettocrimepunishment reporter i was always 
staggeringly selfconfident in street situations he says with his 
usual modesty 
the swagger survives along with arrogance passion and pride 
my fatal flaw he concedes 
it was that pride that cost him his network job in 1985 roone 
arledge pulled a 2020 segment on marilyn monroes relationship 
with the kennedys and geraldo threw a tantrum a less impulsive man 
might have stopped to consider that he had not yet signed his new 
contract before publicly mouthing off at the boss 
i died of massive mostly selfinflicted wounds he wrote in 
the april 1986 issue of esquire 
his obituary was premature he soon attempted a comeback as a 
freelancer with the mystery of al capones vault 
the gangsters vault opened with much fanfare on live 
television came up empty mortified geraldo went into hiding 
setting off on what was to be an epic voyage aboard his 44foot 
sloop the new wave 
he came ashore in a hurry after learning that al capones 
vault was the highestrated nationally syndicated show of all time 
five specials and one talk show later he is philosophical about 
the career turn that has made him more of an outsider than ever he 
isnt exactly unhappy but neither is he free of regret 
ideally i want to be sorting through the ashes trying to find 
truth id like to be challenging institutional politics or 
reporting on the budget deficit or the middle east 
but a lot of what im doing is really righteous stuff they 
wont remember me for the chippendales or prostitution they are 
going to remember me for the stories that made a difference 
he remains unrepentant about his most recent thrashing by the 
critics over a geraldo episode in which his nose was broken by 
a flying chair a former boxer he maintains it was a righteous 
fight 
the frontpage headline of the nov 4 new york post geraldo 
bloodied in tv riot hangs in his office so does the key to 
willowbrook

editors note whiskey is the lifeblood of lynchburg tenn a 
true onecompany town the town that jack built jack daniel 
practically everyone in all of moore county in fact owes their 
livelihood to that venerable distillery but to buy a bottle of 
their favorite liquor they have to drive to nearby coffee county

the moore county chamber of commerce has 
no office no telephone all of its documents reside in one thin 
file folder on a closet shelf in miss mary bobos boarding house 
lynne tolley the chambers current president and also the 
boarding house hostess shrugs 
we dont really go after new industries she says oh if 
somebody asks we answer but were not looking not a bit 
in chambers of commerce across america of course such a 
viewpoint borders on heresy but in this corner of the remote and 
rolling foothills of the cumberland mountains in middle tennessee 
the consensus seems to be that one industry is sufficient whiskey 
lynchburg the moore county seat is the home of the jack daniel 
distillery 
in warehouses atop the ridge above jack daniels hollow or 
holler as it is pronounced hereabouts 47 million gallons of 
tennessee sippin whiskey reside in charred oak barrels aging the 
ripe stuff is bottled daily and new barrels filled 
to the people of lynchburg and moore county that is quite a 
reservoir of security 
there are in america oneindustry towns socalled where the 
economy relies heavily on a dominant employer but a researcher 
would be hard put to find another place in the nation where the 
population of an entire county depends for its livelihood directly 
or indirectly on a single industry and as industries go not a 
very large one at that jack daniels work force runs about 350 
ten years ago says moore county judge donald ray i would 
have said dependence on the distillery was 100 percent now it is 
somewhat less but not much some people who live in moore county 
now work in adjoining counties there are only so many jobs to go 
around 
but without jack daniels the county would be in a terrible 
situation every family in moore county that has been here a long 
time has some member or close relative involved with jack daniels 
if only as a pensioner 
today moore county 131 square miles all hilly with a 
population of 4510 or about 34 souls per square mile has only 
one center of commerce lynchburg 
the city and county government are one the county has no doctor 
no lawyer no railroad no interstate highway no river no motel 
it has one post office one state park one bait shop one 
undertaker one pool hall and one traffic light which according to 
the sheriff is where most accidents happen because people dont 
seem to have the hang of having to stop and wait 
jack daniels influence extends far beyond the distillerys 
studiously quaint buildings and stone fences and crystalclear 
creek beyond its payroll and pensions even beyond the pint of 
whiskey that goes with every employees paycheck on the first friday 
of every month good friday as it is known here 
every cash register in lynchburg benefits mightily from the 
300000 tourists a year the distillery draws but it doesnt stop 
there 
back in the hills for example every farmer relies exclusively 
on the distillerys mash byproduct called slop for cattle feed 
the thin soil in these hills wont grow row crops says ray 
all it will produce is cattle 
with few exceptions though the populace appears more than 
content with its lot and why not 
unemployment is lower than any adjacent county and per capita 
income at 15928 among the highest in rural tennessee and 
because the distillery has been here through good times and bad 
since 1866 nobody has the least fear that jack daniels will ever 
figuratively speaking go on the rocks 
back when reagor motlow the grandnephew of jack daniel himself 
was president of the company his promise was that anyone in moore 
county who wanted a job could have one at the distillery he lived 
up to that he also said anyone who didnt want a job was welcome to 
leave the county theres that too 
there is that says ray but in all my time in moore county 
i have never known the distillery to throw its weight around or 
interfere in any election or any county decision not so much as a 
speeding ticket 
but there is also the experience of 1985 that was long after 
reagor motlows death and long after he and his three brothers in 
1956 sold the company to the huge brownforman distillery in 
louisville ky it was the year jack daniels laid off onefifth of 
its work force the reason given was an increase in federal taxes 
which the company by itself couldnt meet 
there is no evidence that brownforman has interfered in jack 
daniels policies they know better than to kick a pulling mule 
said one longtime employee roger brashears but for the past four 
years there has existed in lynchburg an uncommon element of 
uncertainty 
and back in the hills cattle raisers dependent on that 
highprotein slop are uneasy because of a study the company made in 
1984 just before the layoffs when it was looking for new revenue 
it showed that a drying process many distillers use to recover 
spent mash would allow the company to sell it on the open market for 
nearly 10 times what it makes distributing the wet product to local 
farmers who come by and pick it up themselves 
these are undercurrents in an otherwise tranquil sea 
the company keeps the same lowkey image locally as it reflects 
in its magazine ads just country folks doing unhurried work in a 
tiny little town where things dont seem to have changed very 
much

lynchburg has stayed at a steady population of about 600 for 
years the visitors actually do see oldtimers in bib overalls 
sitting on benches around the town square whittling swapping coon 
dogs from the back of pickup trucks they are not company props 
on the square the lynchburg hardware and general store and the 
white rabbit saloon are two main tourist attractions both are owned 
by the distillery and neither is what it says it is 
lem motlow jack daniels nephew heir and successor the father 
of reagor motlow built the general store in 1921 oldtimey wares 
from that era horse collars and salves and such still decorate its 
shelves and walls but they are not for sale coca cola is for 10 
cents in a bottle the only items the store sells in earnest are 
jack daniel souvenirs 
as for the saloon it too has kept its oldfashioned decor it 
serves sandwiches and lemonade it hasnt sold anything stronger 
since 1909 when tennessee went dry 11 years before prohibition 
the irony is that lynchburg the town that jack built and all of 
moore county is still dry well so is most of bourbon county 
ky the nearest liquor store from here is in nearby coffee county 
yes coffee and anyone in bib overalls on the square will tell you 
the door of that store is at a distance from lynchburg of 123 miles 
and 14 steps 
jack daniels also owns miss mary bobos boarding house just off 
the square it is a charming old whitecolumned home which dates 
from 1867 but it is not a boarding house not since miss marys 
death at age 102 six years ago 
yet it contributes much to lynchburgs downhome mystique rather 
than let it go to ruin jack daniels bought it lynne tolley a 
greatgrand niece of jack daniel himself serves noonday dinner 
there to 65 guests daily southern fare of course fried okra 
cheese grits vegetables from the garden out back iced tea 
if such operations can be assigned to jack daniels advertising 
budget other benefactions seem as pure as the ironfree water that 
gushes out of cave spring at a constant temperature of 56 degrees 
yearround which is why uncle jack as he is known to one and all 
in moore county built his distillery here in the first place 
the lynchburg library as modern and wellstocked as any in an 
affluent american suburb was a gift of the motlow family so was 
the land for the motlow state junior college the countys only 
institution of higher learning the countys only ambulance was a 
gift of the distillery so was its fire truck 
it was the distillery that matched a 260000 federal grant for 
the sewer system when the county courthouse was falling down in 
1968 the distillery rebuilt it 
they do things like that all the time without making a fuss 
about it says carl payne the moore county executive if the 
high school needs something it cant handle like band uniforms or 
whatever they go to the distillery and somebody writes a check 
jobs at the distillery are the most coveted in the county at the 
retirement party for one oldtimer herb fanning it was discovered 
that he hadnt taken a vacation in 20 of his 33 years at jack 
daniels since you do for a living what most people would pay to 
do he said why should you go on vacation and pay not to do it 
another longtime employee clarence rolman 86 said they pay 
good and if theyve got a job for one hand they usually put two on 
it 
rural colloquialisms abound in moore county which is about as 
rural as you can get 
lynchburg is its only incorporated city a dozen or so 
communities nestle in the countys hills and hollows turkey 
creek charity buckeye possum trot owl hollow marble hill some 
of which in the long ago had maybe a oneroom schoolhouse maybe a 
store a church a cemetery 
in the old days uncle jack built many of those churches of 
whatever sect and saw to the upkeep of the cemeteries his 
benevolence became a tradition 
talk about rural many small towns in america boast that their 
citizens dont bother to lock their doors in moore county they 
dont even bother to lock the jail 
almost 100 percent of our crimes are committed by someone from 
out of the county says sheriff mark logan whose father and uncle 
were sheriff before him 
we have a state park with a big lake some people who go there 
get into burglaries into drunk driving into auto theft into drugs 
but within the county we dont have many problems i pulled up 
a few marijuana plants last year but thats about it no i dont 
know of any moonshine stills although my father busted a few 
logan incidentally leaves the keys in his patrol car overnight 
when there is crime in moore county says ray it is 
usually of a personal nature and the families resolve it among 
themselves nobody files a lawsuit or tries to get anybody arrested 
the people in our communities are so in touch with one another 
and with their pattern of life it would be difficult foolish 
really for someone to commit a crime if a strange car should pass 
down one of those back roads the sheriff will get a call 
we dont necessarily raise perfect citizens its just that any 
of our citizens who would normally get in trouble in moore county go 
elsewhere to do it 
the areas serene hills and uncluttered blacktop roads are 
alluring to many of the visitors who come to see the distillery 
every weekend during the summer says carl payne the county 
executive three or four people will stop in and ask me about land 
for sale for a retirement place quite a few from other states have 
retired here 
because of its remoteness its also small wonder the chamber of 
commerce doesnt bother to try to lure new industries 
we dont really want anything that would change the nature of 
moore county or at least i dont says payne i want our peace 
and quiet and clear streams and clean air to stay just the way they 
are 
what we do need and our tourists need he adds with a sigh 
is a place where you can buy a drink

this remote corner of the cumberland 
hills is not a likely place for major industries to want to locate 
and the way jack daniels distillery happened to get here is not apt 
to be repeated 
jasper newton jack daniel was born in 1846 the last of 10 
children when he was six his widowed father hard pressed sent him 
off to live with a neighbor dan call call ran a store on louse 
creek and needed an apprentice for his black slave nearest green 
who was a superb maker of the stores most prominent product 
whiskey 
dan call was also a preacher 
when jack daniel was 14 a traveling evangelist named lady love 
borrowed dan calls pulpit and told dans congregation that their 
pastor had better decide whether to preach or make whiskey because 
in the eyes of the lord he couldnt do both 
jack bought dans still on credit and went in business 
when the civil war ended he moved his still a few miles to a 
lovely spring outside lynchburg brought with him nearest greens 
son george and prospered 
a new federal law in 1866 required all distilleries to register 
with government tax collectors and jack daniels became the nations 
first it is celebrated as a national historic site as americas 
oldest registered distillery

editors note hollywood insiders are betting that rain man 
will dominate this weeks oscar presentations but there are no 
clearcut favorites for several acting awards so unlike last year 
there is considerable suspense in this years kentucky derby of 
filmdom 
</TEXT>

americas film industry honors its own at the 
61st academy awards on wednesday night and its likely that rain 
man will make a big splash 
leading the field with eight nominations the crosscountry 
odyssey of two disparate brothers appears to be the favorite to 
capture the best picture oscar with dustin hoffman the frontrunner 
for best actor and barry levinson for best director 
rain man has the double advantage of being generally but not 
unanimously praised by the critics and embraced by the public 122 
million gross in 80 days 
the other major categories look as unpredictable as a horse race 
for 2yearolds critics awards have been scattered over a wide 
field providing no hint as to favorites 
the uncertainty of the outcome should add excitement to wednesday 
nights telecast in contrast to last years nosurprise awards the 
event returns to the shrine auditorium despite the wave of protest 
over traffic gridlock and poor sound a year ago the los angeles 
police and the sound engineers have promised to do better 
the academy also seems resolved to restore glamour to the oscar 
presentations producer allan carr la cage aux folles will 
stage the awards like a broadway show with marvin hamlisch 
providing the downbeat in the orchestra pit after 17 years of 
directing the awards marty pasetta has been replaced by jeff 
margolis who has attracted good ratings with the american music 
awards show 
the oscarcast will have no emcee instead a bevy of couples 
companions costars and compadres will present the awards among 
them demi moore and bruce willis melanie griffth and don johnson 
kim novak and james stewart sammy davis jr and gregory hines 
goldie hawn and kurt russell farrah fawcett and ryan oneal bo 
derek and dudley moore kiefer and donald sutherland 
the nominees for best picture the accidental tourist 
dangerous liaisons mississippi burning rain man 
working girl offer a wide range of subject matter but they 
have one thing in common all were released last december 
this has brought renewed claims that movies released earlier in 
the year have less chance of winning hollywoods big prize history 
seems to bear that out since 1934 when films became eligible on a 
calendaryear basis 18 december releases have won as best picture 
the tally november 9 october 5 september 4 august 3 july 3 
only 11 movies released in the first six months of the year have 
been picked as the best interestingly the only january release to 
take the top prize was the classic casablanca first seen in los 
angeles on jan 2 1943 for oscar eligibility a film must play at 
least one week in an la theater 
academy president richard kahn offers an explanation the major 
serious films are traditionally released in the last three months of 
the year summer is now reserved for lighthearted escapist 
entertainment thats the way movies are dealt out to the public 
that doesnt mean that movies released earlier in the year 
dont have a chance as best picture the godfather came out in 
march annie hall was an april release other early releases 
the sound of music march patton february but 11 of 
the last 17 bestpicture winners were released in november or 
december 
theres no question that a yearend release enhances the 
possibility of oscars observes publicist booker mcclay who has 
conducted campaigns for et the extraterrestrial out of 
africa and this years gorillas in the mist for universal 
pictures 
at the end of the year academy voters may have 30 pictures to 
see they are much more likely to be attracted to the new movies 
than to return to those they have seen early in the year its hard 
to generate interest in movies that were released eight or nine 
months earlier you have to book a theater on the west side so the 
film is available to academy members meanwhile the new releases are 
attracting all the excitement 
mcclay cited et as a classic example of a picture that 
came out too early it was released in june of 1982 and unanimously 
hailed it did fabulous business and seemed a cinch to win the oscar 
but six months later big campaigns focused on the new 
pictures gandhi was given an 18million marketing budget it was 
heavily screened and everything was centered on the gandhi theme 
making it seem like something more than a spectacular film the 
result et did not win 
john flinn who has conducted academy publicity campaigns for mgm 
and paramount agrees its much tougher to promote a picture 
released early in the year he says the december pictures have 
all the ad strength and publicity behind them and academy members 
are naturally affected 
mcclay adds studios are on the horns of a dilemma if they 
hold an important film until december they are faced with interest 
charges if they release the picture too early they lessen chances 
of an award 
but given the eternal lure of the oscar and the ego satisfaction 
involved chances are that academy hopefuls will continue crowding 
into los angeles theaters during the month of december

its a wretched year for predicting who will

editors note along with their goat the midshipmen of the us 
naval academy are proud defenders of their cows cows yes as the 
young men and women prepare for a career at sea they consume 
veritable oceans of fresh rich milk all produced at the academys 
own farm even some west point cadets concede that the navy has them 
licked in the dairy department 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
almost 80 years after a typhoid outbreak 
made officials wary of the local milk supply the us naval academy 
is still running its own dairy to put milk on the midshipmens 
tables 
the cows dont graze on this picturebook campus by the severn 
river but down the road a few miles is the 865acre us naval 
academy farm which they share with bill the goat the middies 
longhorned mascot 
the fresh rich milk they produce is much in evidence in king 
hall the cavernous wardroom or dining hall where the entire 
4500member brigade takes its meals they empty nearly 2500 of the 
blueandgold halfgallon cartons daily 
but there havent been any typhoid epidemics in trendy annapolis 
lately so why is the academy still milking its own cows 
i guess tradition says todd dander 21 a second classman 
from dallas thats what everything is around here tradition 
several others speculated that it was cheaper for the academy to 
get its milk from the source bypassing the middleman 
but the civilians who run the 950000ayear farm where they 
milk 175 to 250 holsteins and raise 250 calves dont claim to be 
underpricing the competition they acknowledge the staff of 16 is 
larger than typically found on a dairy farm of similar size but 
they insist that they are only milking cows not taxpayers 
the dairy is selfsufficient relying on sales to the 
midshipmens mess not federal appropriations says rh pete 
peterson who has run the farm since 1982 first as a navy 
lieutenant commander and since retiring in 1984 as the civilian 
farm manager 
he bristles at any suggestion the naval dairy is a white elephant 
or as a recent newspaper headline suggested a prime candidate 
for the budget ax 
and like many great events n naval warfare academy officials 
point out that this battle has been fought before and the middies 
dairy won a decisive engagement 
the battle erupted in 1966 when the department of defense faced 
with complaints from maryland and virginia milk producers suggested 
shutting the dairy and selling the farm 
but the house armed services committee rose to the defense of the 
middies milk supply and determined that if the farm were sold the 
money would revert not to the us treasury but to the midshipmens 
store fund which lent 25000 to start the dairy in annapolis in 
1911 two years later congress lent 155000 to buy the property in 
gambrills md 13 miles from the academy 
some bright genius wants to close this dairy over at 
annapolis this will be done over my prostrate body the late rep 
l mendel rivers dsc the autocratic committee chairman barked 
at a hearing in october 1966 
we have developed a grade of milk over there that is wonderful 
absolutely wonderful declared rivers there is no reason to 
dispose of this property no reason on earth it is owned by the 
young men over there 
none of the 16 people who staff the farm is a civil servant all 
except a secretary live on the farm where the workday for the 
milkers and herders begins before dawn 
because its not a selfowned operation where you work until 
you drop we have more employees than a farm this size would take in 
a private commercial operation says peterson a former supply 
officer looking every bit the farmer in wellworn jeans boots 
plaid shirt and dekalb cap 
the midshipmens mess orders 1282 gallons a day paying 166 
for each gallon of the 2 percent butterfat milk the dairy also 
mixes orange juice iced tea and other fruit drinks for the middies 
the blueandgold cartons decorated with anchors and the naval 
academy insigia are stamped not with the last date of use but the 
date the milk was packed fresh from the cow usually two days 
before it winds up on the midshipmens tables 
upperclassmen talk wistfully of the milk shakes they used to get 
from the cream skimmed from the milk peterson says the academy 
recently restored homemade ice cream to the menu 
of a halfdozen midshipmen stopped at random as they strode the 
campus pathways between classes all but one knew the origin of 
their milk 
ralita hildebrand 18 of beaver creek ohio said i knew 
after plebe summer started because everybody made such a big deal 
about bringing the milk cartons home for parents weekend all the 
parents wanted to take a milk carton back 
if commercial dairy farmers once looked askance at the naval 
farm its neighbors in anne arundel county now welcome it as a green 
barrier against development says jack merritt the farm 
superintendent 
there is much more widespread and vigorous sympathy for us 
staying here simply because the alternative appears to be another 
48000 houses says merritt 
jim reeder director of member relations for the maryland and 
virginia milk producers cooperative says the 166 that the 
academy pays for its milk is probably a competitive price 
reeder says the dairymen would still prefer that the academy buy 
milk from them but we havent made any effort at all since that 
time in the 1960s to do anything about it 
thats just fine with the middies 
i always take a halfgallon up from the table says kevin 
harris 19 a third classman from alexandria va who stores it in 
the communal refrigerator in his company wardroom they leave some 
out for us if we want to take it up 
mike metzger 21 a first classman from crofton md who 
attended high school just down the road from the farm says the 
dairy also serves another important purpose we need the farm to 
keep bill the goat there 
the academys longhorned mascot lives in a pen near the milking 
parlor its fence is topped with barbed wire to thwart kidnappers 
from west point who often try to liberate the goat before the 
armynavy football game 
west point cadet capt adam such 22 of el paso texas who 
spent a semester at the naval academy last year and returned 
recently for a leadership conference spoke with envy of the 
midshipmens copious milk supplies 
the stuff we get doesnt taste as good he says honestly 
we dont get enough dairy products theres ice cream here i would 
like to see that kind of stuff with us 
but the west pointer added i dont know if having your own 
farm is the answer

editors note innumeracy the inability to deal comfortably 
with the fundamental notions of number and chance is a word of 
fairly recent coinage that hasnt yet found its way into american 
dictionaries its also the title and subject of a new book by a 
mathematics professor who plays an entertaining numbers game 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
quick whats the difference between 1 
million 1 billion and 1 trillion 
youre in trouble if you respond with something like whats 
the difference when the figures get that high 
if you think the empire state building is about a mile high 
plead guilty again 
youre an innumerate 
help however is at hand 
meet the oxymoronic john allen paulos a witty mathematics 
professor who quotes philosophers devours novels once did a 
standup comedy act in a philadelphia club and passionately hopes 
his fifthgrade math teacher reads his latest book hes also a man 
who doesnt think the world would be a better place if we were all 
able to work quadratic equations 
come to the fifth floor he instructs a visitor and go to 
roomthis is rather embarrassing given the subject of the book 
but its either room 540 or 542 
a huge poster of bertrand russell one of his idols looks over 
his shoulder as he works a pyramid of blue and magenta empty 
hawaiian punch cans fun to move around in different configurations 
rests quietly now in a garish display on his windowsill 
paulos a 43yearold temple university professor has written 
innumeracy mathematical illiteracy and its consequences a book 
whose title would not compel the average reader to snap it off the 
shelf but its fun and paulos tells you its ok to skip the tough 
parts 
one of the tough parts is the title itself the word 
innumeracy which means the inability to deal comfortably with 
the fundamental notions of number and chance has been in usage in 
england since the 1950s paulos says he first came across it 
several years ago in an article in scientific american 
it will be in american dictionaries soon he says dan 
rather has used it a few times and thats got to be an imprimatur 
but back to that first question throughout the book paulos has 
a knack of breaking things down into easily grasped units 
he wants people to have a sense of the vast difference among the 
members of the illion family he suggests you look at it this 
way one million seconds takes about 11 days to tick by a billion 
seconds would take almost 32 years a trillion seconds equals 32000 
years 
paulos says he sometimes asks his freshman students how high the 
empire state building is 
i dont want them to go and look it up he says i just 
want to know about their sense of proportion and scale i would 
consider 1000 feet a correct answer even 2000 feet because its 
in the range actual footage is 1200 feet but if a student said 
50 feet or a mile he has no sense of what a mile is what a mile is 
like straight up in the air 
paulos who teaches freshmen as well as graduate students is a 
recognized expert in symbolic logic computer languages and 
artificial intelligence born in denver he grew up in milwaukee and 
describes himself as a bright kid but very shy 
this is a book for educated people he says 
paulos notes that he once accompanied his wife a former french 
teacher turned romance novelist to the doctor to learn more about a 
minor procedure she was facing 
within 20 minutes the doctor said there was only a 
milliontoone shot of something going wrong that it was a 99 
percent safe procedure and then he said that it usually went quite 
well he says when paulos tried to explain to the physician that 
he just said three entirely different things he was met with a grim 
stare and incomprehension 
even in their areas of expertise people just use numbers not 
knowing what they mean he says 
paulos has met with blank stares before when he did the comedy 
club act one of his jokes had to do with the sign suggesting 
citizens put litter where it belongs paulos pointed out that if 
people did that it would no longer be litter it would be garbage 
litter he pointed out is litter only when it is littering 
not too many chuckles 
actually most of it went quite well but some of it was a 
little too cerebral for the club he says 
he also gets blank stares when he quips that something selling at 
a fraction of its normal cost probably is and that the 
fraction is 43 
his quixotic quest is serious he feels that innumeracy 
contributes to a lack of skepticism and lack of critical thinking 
which leads to poor life decisions

people should know for instance that when they see a headline 
that says something like 1 million american children kidnapped every 
year that its simply not true he says 
innumerates if i can use that as a noun tend to personalize 
things and overvalue coincidences he says they dont have a 
sense of how unrare coincidences are so they read entirely too much 
into them 
these are the people he says who get involved with numerology 
astrology and such largely because they dont understand the laws 
of probabilities nor do they think critically do they ever wonder 
how many times the psychic was wrong rather than boasting about the 
one time he was right 
paulos has many funny examples in his book such as the wisconsin 
legislator who opposed daylightsaving time on the grounds that that 
much more sun would fade the curtains and the carpets faster 
he blames math teachers the social acceptability of even 
intelligent men and women rather proudly flaunting their innumeracy 
and a general unawareness of how important these things are in a 
society that is rapidly becoming more and more scientific and 
technical 
he has no patience with people who proclaim they do not have a 
head for numbers 
anyone can master the elements of mathematics paulos says 
the unfortunate thing is that some of it is kind of ugly its 
like learning to parse a sentence thats not fun but its 
necessary to get to the fun things like literature before you play 
with patterns and structures and have fun with math you have to go 
through the ugly part too 
he partially blames the math teachers who lack imagination as a 
fifthgrader he was very proud to have computed the era earned run 
average of one of the worst pitchers the milwaukee braves ever had 
a 135 he showed it to his teacher the teacher told him to go sit 
down announcing authoritatively that the highest possible era was 
27 
at the end of the year the milwaukee journal published all the 
eras and since this guy had been kicked down to the minors and not 
pitched again there it was in black and white 135 
when confronted with this the teacher though dead wrong told 
paulos to sit down 
i hope that martinet is reading my book paulos says his 
idea of teaching math was getting students to sit down 
paulos also wrote two previous books mathematics and humor 
and i think therefore i laugh as well as various newspaper and 
magazine articles he is negotiating a contract to write a 
syndicated weekly column on problems great and small sort of a 
paulos on numbers and probabilities rather than a william safire on 
usage 
paulos is also concerned about a blind faith in numbers he 
stresses that the human assumptions must be correct before the math 
is good 
he points out that even the most basic one and one is two is 
not correct if the assumptions are wrong his example one cup of 
popcorn plus one cup of water does not equal two of anything it 
equals one and onehalf cups of soggy popcorn 
the book published by hill and wang is an alternate book of the 
month club selection and has received generally good reviews 
paulos did get one irate call from a fundamentalist because of a 
section in which he is trying to make the point that by numerically 
looking at things even in literature certain inconsistencies crop 
up one example is the description of the flood in the book of 
genesis paulos starts calculating and the figures he comes up with 
show the rain came down at a rate of 15 feet an hour for 960 hours 
certainly enough he points out to sink a modern aircraft carrier 
much less an ark with a bunch of mangy animals rocking the ship 
as part of his overall reform he would like newspapers and 
magazines to start using figures differently he argues that the 
mathematical expression 739842 x 10 to the 10th power is more 
comprehensible and legible than seventythree billion nine hundred 
and eightyfour million and twohundred thousand actually most 
newspaper computers arent equipped with scientific notations and 
the style would be for that figure 73984200000 
or did you ever wonder how many cigarettes are smoked each year 
in the united states paulos answer 5 x 10 to the 11th power 
translation newspaper style 500 billion 
well he cant always be right his probabilities are just better

editors note florida is a paradise lost for many newcomers who 
had visions of an idyllic retirement in the sun mentalhealth 
experts have begun paying more attention to a malaise that has come 
to be known as the florida syndrome often manifested by 
stressrelated ailments such as depression and chronic anxiety as 
one doctor put it its the reality of florida versus the 
fantasy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in travel brochures and the songs of 
jimmy margaritaville buffett florida is a palmfringed haven 
from the rat race where ordinary troubles dissolve under a blazing 
sun 
but many newcomers are still hunting for paradise among the 
impersonal sprawl of shopping plazas and trafficclogged 
thoroughfares 
i came here with stars in my eyes says francis greene a 
28yearold construction equipment salesman who relocated from 
philadelphia in september i ended up with an ulcer in my 
stomach 
in a state of transplants 780 a day by census estimates 
greene is one of the many rejections say psychological experts and 
counselors 
recently more attention is being paid to the malaise that can 
beset florida newcomers 
experts say working families are confronted by demoralizing 
commutes uninviting condominium complexes and the anxiety of random 
violence in a state where cashandcarry gun purchases are still 
possible 
retirees they say can face isolation and boredom others simply 
drop out 
i call it the florida syndrome says dr dean j rotondo 
director of the neurological laboratory at fair oaks hospital in 
delray beach about 45 miles north of miami its the reality of 
florida versus the fantasy 
rotondo believes the funk is particularly strong in the 60mile 
urban strip between miami and west palm beach where a nearly 
twofold population boom in the past 20 years has overburdened roads 
and sent developers to the fringe of the everglades in search of 
land 
stressrelated ailments such as depression and chronic anxiety 
are the most common manifestations of florida syndrome says 
rotondo a native of new york city 
i like many people came here thinking that if i had a problem 
i would just go to the beach he says well you can only go to 
the beach so much when people come down here and find all the 
problems they left behind and sometimes they are worse whats 
left is a lot of disillusionment and irritability 
dr joyce glasser a psychological counselor in fort lauderdale 
says the normal stress of moving is sometimes amplified in florida 
because relatives and friends are often left behind 
theres always an adjustment process after a move says 
glasser who came from chicago in 1977 what we have here is 
people facing all these new ways of doing things it hits some 
people quite hard 
in dr cesar benarroches counseling sessions some newcomers 
fret over the crime reports of a homicide every 64 hours and a lack 
of convenient public transportation some are even haunted by the 
peninsulas flatness and air conditioners blasting on christmas day 
you have to deal with florida as it is not like you imagine it 
should be says benarroche a former yale university professor 
but accepting the urbanized florida is particularly difficult for 
the elderly who may have toiled during their careers with visions 
of an idyllic retirement in the sun says irwin i isaacs a fort 
lauderdale psychologist 
what greets many retirees he says is domestic friction and the 
aura of death 
you have these large retirement villages and each week theres 
someone dying says isaacs who conducts seminars for disenchanted 
elders in south florida you just make a new friend and then they 
are dead it can be very disturbing 
isaacs who moved to florida from suburban nassau county near new 
york city says many retirees in his groups often cant cope with 
the fulltime presence of a spouse 
heres the person you dreamt of spending your life with and all 
of a sudden you say i think i hate them he says 
still there are some who find the warm breezes sweep them right 
off the mainstream 
al ackerman 32 came to miami from chicago in 1984 seeking to 
make a stake in the real estate market 
he now does odd jobs in the keys and occasionally hops a sailboat 
to the nearby bahamas 
the only florida syndrome i ever had was a hangover from too 
much rum he said one recent afternoon in key largo 
he then started to hum a jimmy buffett tune

timothy daly believes that if youre going to 
be an actor you also have to be a people watcher 
i watch people i listen to people i make up stories about 
people says daly who stars in the new cbs series almost 
grown 
i live in new york city and whats so wonderful is that if you 
have to research a character all you have to do is walk out the 
door 
he recalls having a role as a blind man once and found a blind 
man on the streets 
i followed him around for a while he says he didnt know 
i was there so he wasnt selfconscious 
almost grown is a drama that takes norman foley daly and 
suzie long foley eve gordon through three decades of courtship 
marriage and divorce they travel back and forth through their 
lives as though in a time machine triggered by the music of a 
particular era their relationship attitudes and roles vary with 
the times 
foley is program director for a radio station so there is 
constant music to trigger the flashbacks 
its interesting that when we go back in time the characters 
remember it with a different perspective he says he may 
remember a time as happy she may remember it as sad the story is 
usually told from my point of view but sometimes its eves or 
sometimes its albert machlins who plays eves brother 
daly says he was approached about the series by david chase one 
of the executive producers they had previously worked together on 
an episode of alfred hitchcock presents 
at first i was very skeptical because of the different ages i 
had to play daly says all the people ive seen in miniseries 
who put shoe polish in their hair how was i going to be accepted as 
a 40yearold 
its a real acting job its more fun you get to wear wigs and 
costumes and switch periods its a great part 
its the second series for daly six years ago he played a doctor 
in ryans four which lasted only a few weeks on abc he was in 
the miniseries ill take manhattan and in january starred in the 
cbs movie red earth white earth his feature films include 
made in heaven and the upcoming love or money and 
spellbinder 
daly grew up in suburban rockland county northwest of new york 
city his father was actor james daly and his sister is tyne daly 
formerly of cagney amp lacey he has two other sisters who he says 
were spared from acting careers 
thank god i wasnt a professional kid he says it allowed 
me to have my life and little bit of innocence one of the things 
thats really important for an actor is to live thats what actors 
do reflect life if you spend your life on a sound stage you dont 
get a clear picture of whats going on in the world 
daly says he feels he became a professional actor when he got his 
equity card in 1978 
i was going to play with my dad in equus on a summer stock 
tour he says he died the day we were to start rehearsals 
kevin mccarthy took over the role i have bittersweet memories about 
it i had worked once before with my dad in jenny kissed me at the 
bucks county playhouse they wrote in one line for me id always 
miss the curtain calls because id be out back skipping rocks on the 
river 
he has never worked with his sister tyne there was some talk of 
a role on cagney amp lacey but the show rarely used guest stars 
i took acting very seriously daly says in my family the 
stage was hallowed ground my mother was also an actress in the 
fourthgrade play the other kids would have adoring parents taking 
pictures id get notes you upstaged yourself 
dalys wife actress amy van nostrand recently had a guest role 
on almost grown and costarred with tyne daly in a tv movie 
called kids like these 
they met while playing opposite each other in sam shepards 
buried child in 1981 at trinity repertory theater in providence 
ri they have a son sam who will soon be 5

for much of his career in broadway musicals 
james brennan has been paid not to perform 
you could find his name in tiny type in the playbill usually 
beneath a sentence solemnly proclaiming understudies never 
substitute for listed players unless a specific announcement is made 
at the time of the performance 
from good news to so long 147th street to i love my 
wife to little me to singin in the rain to me and my 
girl brennan has stood by or covered roles terms used to 
describe that unsung hero of live performance the understudy 
now in a reaffirmation of classic broadway folklore the 
understudy has become the star brennan has taken over the leading 
role in me and my girl the longrunning british musical about a 
cockney scamp who inherits a title and money but almost loses his 
girlfriend because of his newfound wealth 
the day of my first performance here in new york my wife drove 
me by the marquee and i looked at it he says i had a double 
feeling all at once i was saying i cant believe it but i also 
thought to myself yeah it looks just like everybody elses name 
did up there 
the 38yearold brennan has been part of the me and my girl 
company since the show opened in 1986 he was the standby for its 
original star robert lindsay and then for lindsays replacement 
jim dale 
it was the best job in new york brennan says i could come 
in to work and check in at half hour before curtain time and then 
go to the theater or go to a restaurant or talk with a friend or 
read a book or do a crossword puzzle and i did all that 
during lindsays ninemonth run brennan never went on for the 
star but he played the role for about six weeks during dales 
20month engagement replacing a big name can be unnerving for a 
performer who must face the wrath of disappointed theatergoers 
expecting to see someone else 
there is a good understudy mentality and a bad understudy 
mentality brennan says you have to disregard the groans and 
the displeasure that the audience exhibits at the beginning of the 
evening and hold onto what you know the curtain call will be at the 
end of the evening 
i remember going through a time when i thought how can i live 
up to what the audience expects he adds but you get over 
that its not your job to worry 
brennan originally took the job with me and my girl because 
he had heard the lead role was terrific 
i also heard that bob lindsay was magic he adds i thought 
i could learn something from him which in fact was the case 
last fall brennan replaced tim curry in the national touring 
company of the show playing three months around the country before 
coming back to the starring role in new york 
because we have good producers they tried to find someone with 
a boxoffice name he says they didnt find anybody who fit all 
the requirements of the role and still had boxoffice impact 
so brennan was chosen for the demanding part now he has thrown 
himself into a regimen a lot of rest and a lot of food so hell 
have enough strength to get through the marathon workout but its 
something he has worked for all his professional career 
born and raised in newark nj he remembers discovering theater 
programs an aunt had brought back across the hudson river from 
manhattan and he recalls lobbying to see either the music man 
or gypsy he didnt get to either one but the theater bug had 
bit 
in high school brennan appeared in a musical every year the 
director robert hayes also ran a summer theater in beach haven on 
the jersey shore 
he asked me if i wanted to be an apprentice there after my 
sophomore year of high school brennan recalls in newark 
theres not a lot to do in the summer so i did i was there five 
years all summer 
brennan majored in theater at rutgers university and after 
graduating went out on the road with a long national tour of no 
no nanette starring june allyson and later virginia mayo 
the director was donald saddler who later cast brennan in the 
chorus of a revival of the 1927 college musical good news since 
then he has never stopped working in the theater his stints have 
included roles in a revue rodgers and hart and in 42nd 
street two shows where he didnt have to understudy anyone 
brennan also has been back to beach haven to direct for hayes and 
has worked for the new amsterdam theater company directing and 
choreographing such old musicals as cole porters jubilee and 
jerome kerns sally 
i find that everything is sort of a chain in show business 
brennan says and ive been very lucky

this is the first in a series of periodic reports 
by the associated press on economic social and political turbulence 
that has turned south america into a continent in crisis this 
report is on venezuela where rioting over price increases focused a 
spotlight on the mass of poor who were left out while others 
prospered in an oil boom 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
oil in the last decade has made some 
venezuelans very rich but millions of them stayed very poor 
hillside shantytowns known as ranchos never vanished in 
fact they multiplied as oil gushed up and dollars rushed in but 
mansions of the wealthy became more sumptuous and their inhabitants 
more frivolous 
not only did they import scotch whisky they also imported water 
from the scottish highlands to go with it 
and so on feb 27 11 days after newspapers ran accounts of 
caracas wedding of the century a reception for 3500 guests 
200 of them flown in at their hosts expense from as far away as 
tahiti the ranchos exploded 
their protests of increases in bus fares and the prices of 
gasoline and other basics turned into the bloodiest civil unrest in 
venezuelas recent history by official count at least 256 people 
were killed and 2000 wounded other quarters say the death toll 
might have exceeded 300 
the luxury of the few has become an insult to the misery of the 
masses said a postriot document of the roman catholic church 
among the most conservative in latin america 
president carlos andres perez who returned to office in january 
after a term in 197479 called the five days of violence a struggle 
of the poor against the rich 
he later modified his remark but the original intent remained 
illustrative of what went wrong venezuelas oil wealth had not 
filtered down to the masses 
resentment among the poor grew stronger as real wages steadily 
shrank by as much as 30 percent since 1980 putting health care and 
housing out of reach of the poor an estimated 41 percent of 
venezuelas 18 million people live in slums 
but for the rich life did not change as the economy weakened 
with the collapse of oil prices 
the wedding of mariela cisneros daughter of oswaldo cisneros 
president of pepsicolas venezuelan subsidiary and gonzalo 
fernandez from a prosperous business family reflected highclass 
life in venezuela guests were served imported scotch vintage 
french wines and the finest delicacies from abroad 
perezs own inauguration called the coronation to which 
dozens of world leaders including vice president dan quayle and 
fidel castro were invited gave the illusion of a return of that 
the happy days of affluence which reached a high point during his 
first administration 
overwhelmed by wholesale promises during last years election 
campaign people expected nothing but bonanza said anibal romero 
professor of political science at simon bolivar university in 
caracas it has been a sudden and bitter awakening for all of 
them 
as the worlds eighthlargest oil producer venezuela for years 
provided its people with latin americas highest standard of living 
subsidizing everything from eggs to limousines oil allowed 
government after government to conceal the ills of a developing 
nation 
we were falsifying the economy because oil allowed us to do 
so the novelist and essayist arturo uslar pietri was quoted as 
telling the caracas newspaper el universal it led people to 
believe prices wouldnt go up that the government would subsidize 
them 
a lifestyle supported by oil wealth made possible all kinds of 
economic eccentricities 
until early this decade venezuela imported most of its food 
including potato chips pears and cherries from the united states 
but the poor did not benefit significantly from those affluent 
years according to official figures as of last year four out of 10 
venezuelans lived in the adobe and brick ranchos on the slopes 
ringing caracas and other major cities 
an accusatory crown of thorns the roman catholic church 
called them in a housing study published before the riots 
in the churchs postriot document published march 9 archbishop 
jose ali lebrun and 20 other priests assailed what they called the 
widening gap between poor and rich and said venezuelas 33 
billion foreign debt should not be the burden of the poor 
we remind economic and political leaders that they have a duty 
to give examples of austerity and honesty so that the terrible 
burden of sacrifices the country must make because of its foreign 
debt will not be borne by weak and poor sectors alone the 
document said 
nearly half of caracas 4 million people live in ranchos most 
migrated from rural areas and neighboring colombia seeking a better 
life as a result of economic policies that for years neglected the 
countryside in favor of urban and industrial growth subsidized by 
oil 
perezs remarks blaming the riots on a class struggle stirred 
furious protests from the private sector 
you who are leading the nation for the second time should 
be proud that there still are rich people said fedecamaras a 
business association in an unusually harsh letter to perez it 
would be incomprehensible to have only poor people after the 
gigantic resources oil has provided us 
it is dangerous to defy poverty perez responded 
but it was his governments economic measures that led to the

bissau guineabissau ap two years ago bissaus bandim market 
was a ramshackle collection of empty stalls today it is so full and 
busy that sellers of goods and produce have spilled out into the 
highway that runs by it 
local merchants and traders from neighboring senegal and the 
gambia here on africas northwest shoulder haggle with milling 
crowds from behind counters full of rice fruits and vegetables 
meat fish and brightly patterned bolts of cloth 
prices are much higher than those at poorly stocked staterun 
armazens do povo stores but supplies are plentiful 
the day i arrived two years ago there was not one bottle of 
beer in the country said anne williams of the us agency for 
international development illustrating the dearth of things then 
she had brought food and other supplies with her but now relies on 
the local markets for her needs 
the new bounty is due in most part to the governments decision 
in late 1986 following along with other african countries in 
similarly precarious straits to cast aside some of the basic 
marxist concepts it adopted after independence from portugal in 1974 
and liberalize one of the worlds poorest economies 
it lifted price controls and trade restrictions at the behest of 
the international monetary fund and the world bank and stamped out 
blackmarketeering all in one swoop the measures have taken hold if 
the bandim market is any test 
state control of the economy was the norm for many african 
nations guineabissau among them following independence from 
european colonizers 
ghana tanzania nigeria zaire and the ivory coast are all in 
the process of divesting stateown companies and looking for buyers 
in the private sector 
of the five former portuguese african colonies sao tome e 
principe the island nation off gabon has taken the greatest 
strides to shed marxist economic trappings dissolving controls and 
opening up markets to private buyers and investment 
mozambique and angola other former portuguese colonies that 
adopted marxist economics are moving toward liberalization but the 
transition is hampered by guerrilla wars that disrupt their 
economies 
nowadays bissauans with money can dine on grilled shrimp and hot 
piripiri sauce at the galeao restaurant and dance at discos 
like the tropicana and tabanca 
pigs and chickens still scrabble around the open sewers of poorer 
areas but children playing in the shade of long corrugated iron 
verandahs show few of the signs of malnutrition so widespread two 
years ago 
after a long bloody struggle for independence from portugal the 
partido africano da independencia da guine e cabo verde paigc 
under the leadership of luis cabral embarked in 1974 on a 
thenfashionable road of marxistinspired development via 
industrialization 
but by 1980 after channeling investment away from agriculture 
and toward largescale industrial projects like an auto plant that 
closed down when parts ran out and the cumere agroindustrial plant 
that never got off the ground guineabissaus economy was in ruins 
a series of droughts drastically reduced rice production and 
food supplies lessened as the population grew 
cabral was ousted by the military in a november 1980 and prime 
minister joao nino vieira took over 
manuel dos santos his minister of state for commerce economic 
coordination and tourism says liberalization of trade has brought a 
change in the quality of life as well as financial improvement 
essential goods have always been available but only on the 
black market he said now theres hardly a black market to 
speak of 
dos santos said he expects to bring inflation down from its 
current annual rate of 50 percent to 15 or 20 percent by years end 
since 1986 guineabissaus economic growth has averaged more 
than 5 percent a year a reversal of the days when it figured on the 
minus side 
today a kilo 22 pounds of guineangrown rice costs about 
1000 guinean pesos 50 cents in the bandim market but a housewife 
in search of something rarer must pay twice that much for a single 
carrot 
thats expensive in what is still one of the worlds 15 poorest 
countries its annual per capita income is about 190 
but the government hopes two recent accords with portugal 
designed to guarantee the convertibility of the peso into other 
currencies and to set up a commercial bank to finance small 
businesses should help increase trade and prosperity 
in addition to making more funds available from lisbon peso 
convertibility should halt a considerable flow of goods out through 
senegal where traders make their deals in cfa francs which is 
backed by the bank of france cfa french initials for african 
financial community francs are the currency of former french 
colonies in africa and the currency is pegged to the french franc 
which made it more reliable than the peso 
according to dos santos 70 to 80 percent of trade is now 
controlled by the guineabissaus private sector two years ago he 
said it was just the contrary 
diplomats and others say the loosening of economic reins in 
guineabissau is likely to bring more through less radical 
liberalization in the political sphere 
the government is expected to approve a simplified foreign 
investment code it will be followed by a revised constitution 
that though falling short of a shift toward a multiparty system 
will allow more popular participation in government 
in addition to strengthening ties with portugal prime minister 
vieira has managed to continue to receive aid from many other 
countries eastern and western to help support his population of 
nearly 1 million people 
theres still a huge international aid effort going on here 
and guineabissau is one of the darlings of the aid agencies said 
robert collingwood delegate of the european economic community in 
bissau 
aid workers say guineabissaus attraction is due in part to its 
success in swallowing bitter imf and world bank austerity medicine 
including a sharp devaluation of the peso and massive cuts in public 
spending 
the current foreign debt stands at about 270 million on which 
the country pays an annual debt service of 289 million 
humanitarian organizations have always had a romantic sympathy 
for the paigc as guineabissau was one of the few african countries 
to actually fight for its independence said one aid official he 
also said agencies are attracted by guineabissaus small area 
about the size of connecticut and massachuetts combined that makes 
experimental projects easy to supervise 
the countrys main export cash crop cashew nuts a recent 
introduction on world bank recommendations accounted for more than 
half the 15million in exports last year 
dos santos says fishing is guineabissaus best hope since it is 
on the atlantic ocean 
it could provide us with the most resources in the shortest 
time and could make up about 50 percent of our exports 
but it needs more fishermen boats and equipment 
bissaus pindjiguiti port is still a sleepy place the country 
exported only about 500000 worth of fish last year 
the united states has provided a 300000 coastal surveillance 
system to help prevent poaching in guineabissaus waters 
what we really need are more fishing boats with production 
facilities on board and better training said dos santos

bissau guineabissau ap women are responsible for one 
guineabissaus economic successes 
with help from the united nations development program more than 
1400 women work about 123000 acres of land on the outskirts of 
bissau growing tomatoes lettuce and other vegetables that 
supplement their families basic rice diet and provide extra income 
when sold in the market 
the problem is that it works too well and they actually produce 
too much said ursula king who has worked as a un development 
officer for guineabissau mali and sierra leone what they need 
is food processing to preserve the stuff and get some value added 
smallscale industries are the way to go said rosemary 
galli coauthor of guineabissau politics economics and 
society 
they give people jobs and promote trade between villages 
instead of just with the city of bissau or senegal

lets free associate paris lovers springtime 
chestnut blossoms couples kissing in a sidewalk cafe the city of 
light evokes vivid images like that but none is more enduring than 
that of the eiffel tower which turns 100 years old this month 
the tower built by alexafel has become the most 
beloved of french landmarks but it was not always so 
in fact back in 1887 people living around the tower work site 
were appalndre gustave eifled by the giant and disgraceful skeleton 
engineers 
warned it would collapse and a lawsuit tried to halt construction a 
newspaper headline exclaimed the tower is sinking 
but la tour eiffel eiffel tower in french soared aove it all 
surviving to become the definitive symbol of paris 
its true the public was a little mistrusting in the 
beginning they were afraid and fought the tower said janine 
yiatman eiffels great granddaughter 
but parisians it seems understand the human need for the 
superfluous the tower constructed at the entrance to the 1889 paris 
universal exposition on the the seine river across from the 
trocadero survived as a filigree iron homage to the industrial 
revolr 
all of this he accomplished in two years two months and two days 
with a crew of only 200 men and he kept within his 16million 
budget 
building the 555foottall washington monument in contrast took 
36 years 
i should be jealous of the tower eiffel once said shortly 
before his death in 1923 its more famous than i am 
eiffel was 53 years old when his design was selected from 120 
others by a government wanting to build a monument expressing the 
countrys recovery from a humiliating defeat in the francoprussian 
war and its achievements in the industrial age a mere 100 years 
after the french revolution 
an exhibit at the tower which will run through september tells 
the story of the towers origin and explores the life of the 
masterful engineer who wielded iron in entirely new ways 
eiffel designed locks for the panama canal and crafted the 
internal iron skeleton using cross bracing for the statue of 
liberty he built bridges worldwide using a system of pilings that 
could support tons of metal and concrete at unprecedented heights 
eiffel employed these same techniques in creating his ladder to 
the sky 
since world war i the tower has served as a radio and 
meteorological post and recently was fitted with television 
broadcasting equipment but its utilitarian value is secondary to 
its role as a beautiful perch 
more than 123 million people have gone up to have a look around 
in the past 100 years and the view has never failed to incite the 
imagination 
one man tried to fly from it and was killed when his wings 
failed in 1923 a bicycleriding journalist careened down the steps 
from the top floor to the ground a moutaineer scaled it in 1954 and 
in 1984 two englishmen parachuted from it 
a new zealand man jumped headfirst from the towers second level 
with an elastic cord tied around his feet in 1987 and bounced back 
he wanted to bring the sport of bungy jumping to paris and 
felt the tower was the right place to do it 
i mean its such a beautiful place was all he said to 
reporters as the police whisked him away 
in the same whacky spirit tightrope walker philippe petit will 
inch his way along a wire high above the seine on aug 26 to 
commemorate the centenary 
petit known for balancing between new york citys world trade 
towers will carry a copy of the universal declaration of the rights 
of man across the river on a 400foot tightrope connecting the 
second level of the tower with the palais de chaillot 
other festivities include a sound and light show at the tower 
june 17 and an evening of films at the cannes film festival in may 
featuring what the poet guillaume apollinaire called the 
shepherdess of the clouds 
in the early 1980s the tower had a facelift that included new 
elevators a museum a post office and a spectacular new 
292000watt lighting system that replaced the old floodlights the 
new lights illuminate the tower from within creating a pale gold 
tracery against the night sky 
the restaurant jules verne reached by its own separate 
elevator in the tower was remodeled at the same time and now 
reservations are needed a month in advance for dinner in the chic 
grayandblack room with the spectacular view 
while thousands of words are being written about the tower in 
french newspapers and magazines this year the most eloquent tribute 
may have been written decades ago by the french architect le 
corbusier who said the tower was the sum of its creator its time 
and its place 
everywhere and among the humble as among others he wrote 
the tower is in everyones heart as a sign of a beloved paris 
beloved sign of paris

inside a small motor home joanne 
pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse mary perez inserted a needle 
into the vein above her forearm drawing blood into a tube for a 
diabetes test 
as her daughters watched pierluissi 24 said it was for them 
as much as for herself that she agreed to be tested for the deadly 
killer of hispanics 
i was concerned because they said an aunt of mine had it and i 
just wanted to come for the checkup all of our family is going to 
go through the program to make sure that if we have it that well do 
something about it 
twelve million americans have some form of diabetes but it is 
most prevalent among minorities especially native americans blacks 
and hispanics hispanics are three times as likely to develop 
diabetes as the general population and 40 percent of the 700000 
victims in texas are mexicanamerican 
more than 150000 americans die from diabetes each year another 
150000 deaths are diabetesrelated according to the american 
diabetes association 
no one really knows what sparks it but researchers believe 
hispanics could hold the key san antonio the nations ninth 
largest city with a population that is 50 percent hispanic is 
becoming the base for diabetes studies 
researchers take a customized mobile home to neighborhoods to 
randomly check hispanics and anglos for the disease which deprives 
the body of insulin and can lead to complications affecting the 
heart kidneys eyes and nerves 
san antonios hispanic makeup led dr ralph defronzo to abandon 
his prestigious position as a yale university diabetes researcher 
and persuade his fourmember team to relocate to the university of 
texas health science center 
an epidemiologist at the center dr michael stern has devoted 
10 years to studying hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study 
of type ii diabetes 
type ii the most common form develops mostly in obese adults 
over 40 who also may have a family history of the disease in obese 
diabetics the body has too much insulin because it is burning more 
fats than sugars 
type i diabetes usually develops among adolescents and requires 
that they have daily injections of insulin 
stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him 
closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease 
a genetic marker might identify people who are susceptible which 
could lead to a screening test he said then you could go out and 
zero in on the genetic susceptibles and you can be more intense on 
your recommendations to them and you could also study that group 
stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the 
fatsaturated foods common to the diets of lowincome hispanics 
fewer would get the disease 
we use the term double jeopardy for mexicanamericans he 
said we dont know why when they get diabetes they have a more 
severe form of the disease whether its a biological difference or 
is it that they are not getting as good medical care 
but the interesting thing is that upperincome 
mexicanamericans do not have the same risk as lowincome 
mexicanamericans it may be that the gene is there but for some 
reason it may not be expressed in the upperincome mexicanamericans 
also mexicanamericans tend to have more body fat in their 
upper torso and we can see that as related to diabetes 
between 1979 and 1988 stern and his staff studied more than 
5000 people and found that 387 of 2905 hispanics had the disease 
or 133 percent compared to only 87 of 1780 anglos or 48 percent 
researchers believe that poor hispanics diets of cheap 
processed foods lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention 
either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors increases 
their risk of acquiring diabetes 
the study is in its followup stage to see if diagnosed diabetes 
patients have changed their lifestyle and have sought medical care 
teresa castro 54 whose diabetic husband died at age 37 went 
through the screening eight years ago she was told that because of 
her weight 254 pounds she had hypertension and was at risk of 
diabetes doctors put her on a strict lowfat diet and she lost 26 
pounds 
i went to the screening because they called and said it was 
free thats why i went to it because being poor i couldnt afford 
to go to the doctor for this type of checkup she said my 
mother has diabetes and they tell me i might have diabetes too but 
i dont know too much about it 
i feel ok but they tell me that one year you can be ok and the 
next year it can be totally different 
defronzo who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by 
canadian and japanese diabetes associations says his unit at the 
health science center will try to use many of sterns patients for 
research that will include work for lipha chemicals which makes an 
antidiabetic drug called metaforim that improves the bodys ability 
to respond to insulin 
the problem with type ii diabetics is not that they dont make 
enough insulin they dont respond to the insulin defronzo said 
what wed like to do is make them more responsive and this drug 
will do that 
the drug is widely used in europe canada and mexico and should 
be approved by the food and drug administration in several years for 
us use he said 
educating elementaryschoolage children about healthy diets 
would help reduce the number of diabetes cases defronzo said if 
you have a 65yearold mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her 
to go out and jog five miles monday wednesday and friday she is 
going to laugh at you 
so you have to design an exercise program that is compatible 
with the patients lifestyle and it is something they can do

aly elshiekh envisions astronauts on a 
threeyear trip to mars knitting themselves a space station 
using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels beams boxes 
and practically any other shape 
we believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and 
the machinery were developing they would be able to literally make 
the space stations they will need as they go said elshiekh a 
mechanical engineer at working in north carolina state universitys 
textiles school 
elshiekh and his students are developing machinery to braid long 
strands of ceramic fibers such fibers bonded with epoxy also will 
form heat shields and many of the parts in the vessel that carries 
people to mars the parts will withstand speeds of 50000 mph and 
temperatures of at least 4000 degrees 
while much of his work relates to the mars mission research 
center here elshiekh sees a big future for composite materials 
like ceramic fibers 
the day may very well come when you are driving around with car 
engine parts of ceramic fiber he said adding that the 
vibrationdamping properties of the materials also would make them 
good for torsion bars in cars 
we also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric 
in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods he 
said it is stronger than steel does not rust and would not wear 
away the road would not deteriorate 
the fibers including kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests 
also could be used to make some body parts and elshiekh is working 
with duke university researchers on ceramic stents collapsible 
braces for arteries 
elshiekh who got his degree in mechanical engineering in his 
native egypt first saw applications of the ancient art of braiding 
to space travel in the 1960s when he was at the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
the monkeys they were sending into space then came back dizzy 
and they could not understand why nasa sent us films to try to 
figure out why this was happening what we finally discovered was 
that they were using twisted ropes for the parachute on the capsule 
when the parachute opened the ropes would untwist and that 
would make the capsule spin on the way down it was the spinning 
that made the monkeys dizzy so we suggested they change to braided 
ropes 
elshiekh was working in other textile projects until two years 
ago when a friend suggested he turn to developing automated 
machinery for ceramic fiber a year later nasa began setting up 
research projects on a manned mars mission and his work in ceramic 
fibers got their attention 
the possibilities are limitless said elshiekh who can 
produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have 
openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them the 
big problem is cost and thats why were working on this automated 
machinery 
using scrap parts and whatever materials he could find he has 
designed and built two computeroperated braiding machines 
by hand we can make an inch of this every hour he said 
pointing to a oneinchsquare column of braided carbon fiber with 
automation we can turn out 36 inches every 15 minutes and we can 
do it uniformly done by hand there is always a difference in the 
braid from person to person

opposition parties today demanded that prime 
minister noboru takeshita resign after members of his governing 
liberal democratic party admitted reciving money from the company at 
the center of a stock scandal 
three lawmakers said they received gifts of 8000 to 31000 in 
july and august from recruit co an information services 
conglomerate 
recruit allegedly provided bargainpriced stocks in a subsidiary 
to about 150 politicians and business leaders in exchange for favors 
japanese newspapers and television stations today quoted an 
anonymous source with connections to recruit as saying the company 
gave a total of 300000 to 15 members of parliament including a 
current cabinet member shortly after opposition parties launched an 
investigation last summer into the scandal 
opposition parties charged the gifts were hush money to lawmakers 
linked to recruit and they demanded the takeshita administration 
resign to take responsibility for the scandal 
the three liberal democratic lawmakers vice secretary general 
hajime ishii masao endo and kenichiro otsubo said they returned 
the money the names of the other members of parliament who 
reportedly received gifts of money were not immediately known 
it is outrageous if such money was received after the recruit 
scandal surfaced said shun ohide of the japan socialist party 
the largest opposition group we will intensify our pressure on 
prime minister takeshita to either resign or dissolve parliament and 
call an election 
government spokesman keizo obuchi said in response to the news 
reports we conducted a thorough investigation of all current 
cabinet ministers last year and understand that no one in the 
current administration was involved in such a deal since last 
summer i would like to believe in the result of the probe 
prosecutors have arrested 12 people on suspicion of giving or 
taking bribes or violating securities laws in the scandal 
no politicians have been arrested but disclosures of alleged 
influence buying have eroded public support for takeshitas 
16monthold government polls indicate public disapproval ratings 
for takeshitas administration have soared to about 60 percent while 
his approval ratings have plunged to about 20 percent 
the scandal has aggravated the anger of rural voters long a 
bastion of support for the liberal democratic party who resent 
concessions to us demands that japan open its farm markets 
although it refuses to allow rice imports japan agreed under 
us pressure last year to end quotas on imports of beef and citrus 
products 
some analysts predict an upset in july elections for half of the 
upper house of parliament where the liberal democrats hold 143 of 
the 251 seats a severe setback would endanger takeshitas chances 
next october to win another twoyear term as party president and 
prime minister 
analysts say however that washington will still be dealing with 
the liberal democrats next year regardless of takeshitas fate 
successive scandals have failed to shake the liberal democrats 
grip on power with the exception of 10 months of socialist 
government from 1947 to 1948 the party and its predecessor have 
governed japan since world war ii 
the scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in japan 
since former prime minister kakuei tanaka was accused in the 
lockheed affair in 1976 
tanaka was convicted of taking a 2 million bribe after the us 
aircraft company admitted it spent 121 million to advance its 
sales in japan

the stock market headed higher today continuing 
its rebound from a surprise late last week in the governments 
monthly employment report 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1875 to 230089 in 
the first half hour of trading 
gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 397 up 227 down and 
427 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 2222 million shares as of 10 
am on wall street 
when the labor department reported friday morning that the 
unemployment rate had fallen to a 15year low in february stocks 
and bonds initially sold off on the news 
the reasoning was that strains on the capacity of the labor force 
might intensify inflationary pressures and tend to push interest 
rates higher 
but stocks began a steady recovery friday afternoon finishing 
the session with only a moderate loss 
that apparently encouraged traders and created a general belief 
that the market was ready for a new assault on the 2300 level 
where it bogged down on two occasions last week 
among actively traded blue chips merck gained to 64 american

the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 
95 to 16580 at the american st new yorks laguardia 
airport before she returned home to boston today im not so sure 
if it was worth it it was a good idea in theory 
easterns threeday offer of rockbottom fares on the 
washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle attracted 8000 passengers 
friday 11000 saturday and 12500 sunday said john siefert vice 
president for the shuttle 
although fares went up to 49 today eastern said it would honor 
through friday the 12 tickets sold over the weekend after friday 
prices will return to 69 on weekends 99 on weekdays and sunday 
evening 
about 250 passengers were stuck at laguardia late sunday 200 
failed to get on flights from bostons logan airport and at least 
100 were turned away at washingtons national airport many spent 
the night at the airports and took the first shuttle flights out 
this morning 
the first two went out full so im hoping we got most of 
them said rosa r williams shuttle manager at national airport 
on sunday night eastern employees had given stranded shuttle 
passengers peanuts and decks of cards 
pickets outside the eastern terminal in boston today took note of 
stranded passengers with a sign that read pay 12 and sleep at 
the terminal 
on sunday the bush administration reiterated its determination 
to stay out of the 10dayold strike by easterns 8500member 
machinists union 
we are not in the business of running eastern airlines or 
negotiating the contract for labor transportation secretary 
samuel skinner said on cbs face the nation 
eastern trumpeted the reopening of flights to seven latin 
american cities sunday as a new start for the troubled airline 
which filed for bankruptcy protection last week after most of its 
3600 pilots honored picket lines 
the carrier launched 75 flights sunday and hopes to boost that 
number to 140 a day by the end of the week compared with a 
prestrike schedule of 1040 a day spokesman robin matell said 
debbie mcloughlin of new york planned to spend the night at 
easterns terminal in boston its got to be an adventure 
mcloughlin said im a scab though with the 12 flight i took 
advantage of a good thing 
most of those left at laguardia were promised a seat on an 
eastern flight this morning or flew on pan ams rival shuttle said 
port authority police lt alexander harvey 
when eastern said thats it these people went over to pan 
am said harvey whose agency runs the airport pan am added a 
flight to washington and chartered two buses to boston he said 
david hess a spokesman at washingtons national airport said 
some passengers waited five hours for seats about 40 were spending 
the night at the airport 
eastern maintained that passengers knew what they were getting 
into when they bought the cheap tickets 
those people were not stranded we advertised the flights were 
on a firstcome firstserved basis matell said im sorry they 
have to wait for the next flight but they should have gotten there 
earlier 
one pilot on a picket line at logan said he held no animosity 
toward shuttle passengers but he questioned easterns strategy in 
slashing fares 
theyre trying to warm the house by burning the furniture to 
keep people coming said pilot dennis caldwell 
easterns unions have accused frank lorenzo chairman of eastern 
parent texas air corp of trying to cannibalize the airline pilots 
and flight attendants have honored machinists picket lines which 
went up when the union refused to grant 125 million in concessions 
to the airline 
in miami atlanta and other cities sunday dozens of offduty 
delta air lines pilots walked picket lines with eastern employees in 
the first major public show of support from workers at another

hundreds of people who bought 12 tickets on eastern airlines 
northeast shuttle headed home this morning one day late after 
getting stranded in three cities when there were no bargainbasement 
seats for them on planes 
nightmare of nightmares was how catherine holtz 24 
described her night sleeping on the carpet at new yorks laguardia 
airport before she returned home to boston today im not so sure 
if it was worth it it was a good idea in theory 
easterns threeday offer of rockbottom fares on the 
washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle attracted 8000 passengers 
friday 11000 saturday and 12500 sunday said john siefert vice 
president for the shuttle 
although fares went up to 49 today eastern said it would honor 
through friday the 12 tickets sold over the weekend after friday 
prices will return to 69 on weekends 99 on weekdays and sunday 
evening 
about 250 passengers were stuck at laguardia late sunday 200 
failed to get on flights from bostons logan airport and at least 
100 were turned away at washingtons national airport many spent 
the night at the airports and took the first shuttle flights out 
this morning 
the first two went out full so im hoping we got most of 
them said rosa r williams shuttle manager at national airport 
on sunday night eastern employees had given stranded shuttle 
passengers peanuts and decks of cards 
pickets outside the eastern terminal in boston today took note of 
stranded passengers with a sign that read pay 12 and sleep at 
the terminal 
on sunday the bush administration reiterated its determination 
to stay out of the 10dayold strike by easterns 8500member 
machinists union 
we are not in the business of running eastern airlines or 
negotiating the contract for labor transportation secretary 
samuel skinner said on cbs face the nation 
eastern trumpeted the reopening of flights to seven latin 
american cities sunday as a new start for the troubled airline 
which filed for bankruptcy protection last week after most of its 
3600 pilots honored picket lines 
the carrier launched 75 flights sunday and hopes to boost that 
number to 140 a day by the end of the week compared with a 
prestrike schedule of 1040 a day spokesman robin matell said 
debbie mcloughlin of new york planned to spend the night at 
easterns terminal in boston its got to be an adventure 
mcloughlin said im a scab though with the 12 flight i took 
advantage of a good thing 
most of those left at laguardia were promised a seat on an 
eastern flight this morning or flew on pan ams rival shuttle said 
port authority police lt alexander harvey 
when eastern said thats it these people went over to pan 
am said harvey whose agency runs the airport pan am added a 
flight to washington and chartered two buses to boston he said 
david hess a spokesman at washingtons national airport said 
some passengers waited five hours for seats about 40 were spending 
the night at the airport 
eastern maintained that passengers knew what they were getting 
into when they bought the cheap tickets 
those people were not stranded we advertised the flights were 
on a firstcome firstserved basis matell said im sorry they 
have to wait for the next flight but they should have gotten there 
earlier 
one pilot on a picket line at logan said he held no animosity 
toward shuttle passengers but he questioned easterns strategy in 
slashing fares 
theyre trying to warm the house by burning the furniture to 
keep people coming said pilot dennis caldwell 
easterns unions have accused frank lorenzo chairman of eastern 
parent texas air corp of trying to cannibalize the airline pilots 
and flight attendants have honored machinists picket lines which 
went up when the union refused to grant 125 million in concessions 
to the airline 
in miami atlanta and other cities sunday dozens of offduty 
delta air lines pilots walked picket lines with eastern employees in 
the first major public show of support from workers at another 
airline our company has made a moral and economic commitment to

holding company has had to writeoff riverfront investments in 
january the corporation said it would writeoff 407 million in

billion bank holding company 
the company did not specify which loans in its portfolio would be 
written down or written off 
the company also said it has rescheduled its annual shareholders

centaur partners has pledged to appeal a 
judges order blocking a special pennwalt corp shareholders meeting 
and says it is determined to take over the chemical company 
a statement issued sunday by the investment company also said the 
groups 110pershare tender offer scheduled to expire march 20 
remains in full force and effect 
on friday us district judge robert s gawthrop iii declared 
centaur demands for the special meeting invalid centaur had hoped 
to use the meeting to replace the board of directors with takeover 
proponents 
centaur had received enough signed demands from stockholders to 
force the meeting late this month under state law 
in invalidating centaurs call for the special meeting gawthrop 
cited a provision included in the groups solicitation to 
shareholders 
centaur which owns about 13 percent of pennwalts outstanding 
shares had said the call would be voided if a court decided the 
shareholders were part of a controlling group of the company 
pennwalt opposed the demand for the meeting arguing the 
shareholders were part of a controlling group as defined by the 
state business code and financially liable to any stockholders 
unhappy with the centaur offer 
gawthrop agreed with pennwalt 
no one is going to risk that said stuart h savett one of 
the attorneys representing shareholders in the case if you are 
part of the control group you may be liable 
for pennwalt the court ruling was the first significant skirmish 
it has won since centaur made its first tender offer in december 
in the statement sunday centaurs principals abbey j butler 
and melvyn j estrin called the ruling a temporary setback 
centaur began buying pennwalt stock last spring by december the 
investment group announced an offer of 100 a share for the almost 7 
million outstanding shares centaur did not own 
in february the group raised its bid by 10 on friday the stock 
closed on the new york stock exchange at 11850 up 50 cents 
pennwalt has repeatedly refused to meet with centaur and has said 
it will explore other options that could include the sale of the

sears roebuck and co will significantly reduce 
the instore presence of both its financial services and real estate 
operations but expand its insurance outlets a spokesman said today 
the number of dean witter reynolds financial service outlets in 
sears roebuck stores will be reduced by half from about 300 to 
about 150 and virtually all the coldwell banker real estate 
offices in about 220 stores will be converted into marketing and 
referral booths said sears spokesman doug fairweather 
operations at the companys 824 instore allstate insurance 
offices will be bolstered however he said 
sears the nations largest retailer recently underwent a round 
of costcutting and adopted a low pricing policy in an effort to 
regain market share fairweather said there would be few savings in 
this latest move 
the way in which we cover these markets has simply changed 
he said 
weve already experienced a very very sharp growth since 
getting both dean witter and coldwell banker at the end of 1981 now 
that theyre on the map it makes more sense to emphasize the local 
offices as the places to do business and use the store space just 
for referrals 
dean witter has expanded to a total of 650 outlets from just 350 
when sears first acquired it and the number of account executives 
has grown to 8000 from 4800 coldwell banker has increased from 
about 413 offices in 73 residential markets to nearly 2100 in 298 
markets 
in financial services you do most of your business on the 
phone and most people go to a neighborhood office when theyre 
looking to buy a house fairbanks said 
insurance seems to be the one business where both the timing 
and paperwork factors still make an instore outlet an efficient 
service he said 
fairweather said there would be a minimal effect on both 
personnel and sears bottom line as a result of the changes 
most of the people who staffed the instore offices came one 
day or so each week from a local office anyway he said now 
theyll just be spending more time at the other office

louis v gerstner jr the president of american 
express co was named monday as chairman and chief executive 
officer of rjr nabisco inc the food and tobacco giant that became 
the prize in an epic takeover battle last year 
analysts said gerstners immediate tasks would include addressing 
rjrs declining domestic tobacco market share and giving its 
employees a sense of direction in the wake of the takeover which 
heaped billions of dollars in new debt on the company 
rjr nabisco agreed to the record 2453 billion leveraged buyout 
by the firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co following a bitter fight 
against a group led by former rjr chief executive f ross johnson 
gerstner 47 faces a personal challenge in moving from a giant 
financial services company where he spearheaded such innovations as 
the american express platinum card to a manufacturing company 
but although gerstner has little experience in manufacturing 
analysts said his administrative and marketing skills should ease 
his move into rjr nabisco 
a backgroundin a specific industry is immaterial said 
lawrence adelman a tobacco industry analyst with dean witter 
reynolds in new york whats more important is being a good 
manager 
obviously its a different business but my understanding is 
gerstner is a very marketingdriven person said marc cohen an 
analyst with sanford c bernstein in new york some of that is 
transferrable 
gerstner joined american express in 1978 as president of the 
american express card division the next year he was named president 
of the travel related services group responsible for american 
express cards travelers checks and travel service offices 
when travel related services became a subsidiary of the company 
in 1982 gerstner became its first chairman and chief executive 
officer he became president of american express in 1985 
during gerstners career at american express the companys card 
membership rose from 86 million to 307 million and the company 
introduced its popular platinum charge card and american express 
optima credit card 
cohen said gerstner probably should decide quickly what changes 
if any should be made at rjr due to the buyout the company already 
has indicated it would sell some lines of business to deal with 
antitrust concerns raised by the federal government but the extent 
of any further restructuring which could involve other 
divestitures or employee cuts largely is unknown 
i would think those moves must become clarified as soon as 
possible to comfort the employees who might be involved cohen 
said hes got to calm the troops and give a sense of direction 
thats an issue there 
gerstner also must develop strategies to address rjrs loss in 
tobacco market share cohen said 
cohen said rjrs market share dropped to 318 percent in 1988 
from 325 percent in 1987 had rjr maintained its market share it 
would have meant almost another 125 million in revenue he said 
but adelman said rjrs decline did not represent a panic 
situation 
hes not walking into a troubled situation adelman said 
kkr partner henry r kravis making the announcement monday 
cited gerstners distinguished record of leadership at an 
organization of comparable size and quality to rjr nabisco 
gerstner issued a statement saying he was delighted to take the 
helm of a company with such a rich history as rjr nabisco he 
promised to work to further improve the company grow it and make 
it a creative and exciting place to work 
gerstner was not immediately available for further comment 
among rjr nabiscos operating companies are rj reynolds 
tobacco nabisco brands del monte foods and planters lifesavers 
american express chairman james d robinson iii said he would 
assume the additional duties of president at american express after 
gerstners departure 
american express also announced that aldo papone president and 
chief operating officer of travel related services would replace 
gerstner as chief executive officer

european finance ministers monday 
welcomed the new strategy offered by us treasury secretary 
nicholas brady to deal with the staggering foreign debts of 
developing nations 
the ministers of the 12nation european economic community 
however put off endorsing the plan until they had time to study it 
further 
it is a turning point said spanish finance minister carlos 
solchaga it is a change in the way we deal with the debt 
problem 
he said the developed nations will have to work with poorer 
nations on a casebycase basis to help solve the problem which 
will require a lot of imagination and cooperation 
the ministers meeting in a regular monthly session issued a 
statement saying they agreed with brady that the problem contains 
economic political and social elements and welcomed the openness of 
his approach 
they said they considered with interest the suggestions 
offered by brady and agreed that they merited thorough study 
bradys proposal marks a major shift in us debt policy by 
calling for an approach that emphasizes debt forgiveness to deal 
with the massive problem it endorses voluntary efforts on the part 
of commercial banks to forgive part of the 400 billion they are 
owed by the big debtor countries such as brazil mexico and 
venezuela 
it also calls on the international monetary fund and the world 
bank sister financing agencies to help provide guarantees for the 
remaining debt owed by poorer countries 
the united states had been following the baker plan which 
opposed writing off the third worlds debts to foreign creditors 
instead it urged commercial banks to boost their lending to poorer 
nations which agreed to make major changes in their economies for 
example by fighting inflation or bolstering a weak currency the 
plan was drawn up in 1985 by thentreasury secretary james baker 
who is currently secretary of state 
the finance officials said that voluntary debt or debt service 
reduction on a casebycase basis can play an important role in the 
success of sound economic plans 
they also urg if necessary ake changes in their regulatory and 
fiscal rules if necessary to enable commercial banks to reduce the 
debts 
solchaga noted that in many industrialized countries there are 
no regulations that would allow commercial banks to forgive the 
debts such measures should be adopted he said so the debt problem 
can be solved more easily 
the ministers statement also said developing countries must 
adopt deep economic reform policies if their economies are to 
expand at a lasting pace 
efforts to reverse capital flight must be strengthened it 
said both targets will include and be buttressed by increased 
openness of markets industrial countries should similarly ensure 
open and growing markets 
the ministers statement will be part of discussions at the 
spring meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank 
early next month in washington 
the foreign debt of developing countries registered a staggering 
13 trillion at the end of 1988 brazil is the third worlds 
largest debtor with 110 billion in loans followed by mexico with 
107 billion

the settlement reached monday between the 
justice department and the teamsters union removed a huge albatross 
from the neck of the nations largest union the unprecedented 
threat of being taken over by the federal government 
teamsters leaders now can try to settle a bitter internal 
dispute although any such effort could be complicated by provisions 
of the settlement giving 16 million rankandfile teamsters a 
direct voice in picking the unions hierarchy 
for the government the settlement provided a vehicle through 
which it can investigate with union officials alleged wrongdoings 
by teamsters and review local union elections which prosecutors 
believe long have been influenced by organized crime 
lost by the government was the chance to test whether the scope 
of federal racketeering laws includes a government takeover of an 
entire union and a rhetorical war in which the former us attorney 
for the southern district of new york rudolph giuliani accused 
teamsters leaders of making a devils pact with the mafia and 
vowed to oust them from their jobs 
both sides had reason to claim victory the teamsters for 
keeping their union out of court trusteeship and avoiding months of 
testimony about its alleged mob ties the government for winning 
dramatic union election reforms that could put the current 
leadership at risk when members directly elect a new teamsters board 
in 1991 
we havent seen all the details as yet but on the surface it 
looks good said ken paff the leader of teamsters for a 
democratic union a dissident group that has lobbied for direct 
elections it has always been our position that we should use 
democracy to clean up any corruption not government intrusion 
the settlement in the suit brought by giuliani allows all 11 
teamsters who remained as defendants in the case and three others 
who settled last week to keep their seats on the unions executive 
board a group still bitterly divided eight months after jackie 
pressers death brought william mccarthy to the helm of the union 
after an intense power struggle 
that battle was for the most part waged out of the public eye 
but disputes between mccarthy and his backers and those aligned 
with weldon mathis the no 2 teamsters official who lost to 
mccarthy despite pressers endorsement became public during 
pretrial wrangling leading up to mondays settlement 
mathis and two other board members struck settlement deals with 
the government last week and at the same time challenged a january 
board resolution that prohibited members from settling with the 
government if they wanted to keep their seats 
when called into court by the government to defend the policy 
the mccarthyled board rescinded it but not without taking a swipe 
at mathis and the other two by taking the unusual step of releasing 
a board resolution calling their actions self serving and an 
impediment to the unions defense 
that any member of the board would settle defied the statements 
of mccarthy who in the january issue of the unions magazine said 
every single member of the general executive board is committed to 
fighting the insulting accusations and personal attacks that have 
been leveled against us 
later that month at a board meeting to discuss an initial 
government settlement offer there were shouting matches between the 
feuding factions according to participants 
the internal struggle now returns to the secretive teamsters 
board room where mccarthy has the upper hand of a majority but must 
now keep in mind the election reforms 
the board now is chosen by delegates to teamsters conventions a 
process the racketeering suit alleged was heavily influenced by 
organized crime figures the settlement gives all union members the 
opportunity to vote by secret ballot in board elections after 
convention delegates nominate candidates 
no matter who wins he now will have to be responsible to the 
membership paff said

fliers who took advantage of eastern airlines 12 
shuttle fare this weekend took risks along with the striketorn 
airline industry analysts said monday 
the slashed fare lured more passengers than eastern had bargained 
for stranding hundreds of people in airports in new york boston 
and washington 
but analysts noted all bargains include risks and for eastern 
owner frank lorenzo this one was better than the spectre of flying 
his airline with empty seats 
eastern had to get the consumer back even though it did 
inconvenience people it was worth it said paul karos airline 
analyst at first boston corp in new york 
although oneway fares went up to 49 this week starting monday 
eastern said it would honor through friday the 12 tickets sold over 
the weekend after friday prices will return to the normal 69 on 
weekends and 99 on weekdays and sunday evening 
the cutrate weekend fare in effect friday through sunday was 
intended to show the airline is still in business despite the 10day 
old walkout by eastern machinists and the sympathy of most pilots 
while it drew 31500 passengers many were as surprised as eastern 
when it ran out of seats to take the bargain hunters home 
an estimated 550 people were unexpectedly grounded sunday in the 
three cities linked by the shuttle 
created by eastern in 1961 the shuttle normally offers hourly 
service between boston new york and washington pan am corp which 
runs a rival shuttle between the three cities did not match 
easterns special fare 
seats cant be reserved on either the eastern or pan am shuttle 
but they are normally guaranteed even if it means wheeling out 
another plane 
but with last weekends unusual deal eastern warned in advance 
that there would be no backup flights although the crush forced the 
airline to bring out its biggest jets and five backup flights 
anyone unable to return on the weekend was allowed to fly home free 
through wednesday as long as they took an eastern flight between 10 
am and 3 pm est 
the gimmick went down well with some industry observers 
they wanted to provoke a public reaction and they did they 
just didnt think deeply about it said mark daugherty airline 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new york 
buyer beware whenever there is a good deal the buyer has to 
assume a certain amount of risk he said 
flying full planeloads on easterns shuttle also helps keep up 
appearances for real estate developer donald trump daugherty 
suggested 
trump agreed in october to buy the eastern shuttle and is 
awaiting clearance for the 365 million deal from a bankruptcy judge 
since eastern filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors last 
thursday 
bruce nobles president of trump shuttle inc liked the bargain 
fare it was a smart idea in this circumstance nobles said from 
his new york office

if you want to open a software store in the big 
city it helps to have a background in selling shoes or groceries 
or clothing or arts and crafts for that matter 
personal computers arent just for techies anymore and software 
retailers have learned that if they want to sell to a mass market 
they have to adopt the marketing techniques that work for more 
mundane products 
software etc is carrying that concept to new heights this week 
with a hypefilled store opening on manhattans fifth avenue that 
was heralded monday with ads covering the back pages of all four 
sections of the new york times 
analysts described software etcs splash as a sortie in its 
escalating battle for market share with rival egghead inc which 
runs egghead discount software stores 
this used to be a maandpa industry now its just so 
competitive these companies need to create market dominance said 
teresa y lotzgesell an analyst at ragen mackenzie inc in seattle 
among the celebrities scheduled to make appearances at software 
etcs opening this week were william gates chairman and cofounder 
of microsoft corp earl weaver former baltimore orioles manager 
andrew tobias personal finance writer roger rabbit the toon and 
hacksaw jim duggan of the world wrestling federation 
the amazing kreskin selfproclaimed mind reader appeared 
monday so did major wild bill stealey of microprose software 
who demonstrated his flight simulation software on a video wall made 
of 16 television screens in a 4by4 array 
the crowds reminiscent of a good day at bloomingdales warmed 
the hearts of the retailminded executives of software etc 
we cant wipe the grins off our faces said jordan levy who 
joined the company last year as director of marketing this is 
like a real retail store not like a computer store 
softwareonly stores scarcely existed in the early 1980s but 
they are catching on quickly in part because their bulk buying 
allows them to offer low prices and take business away from other 
outlets such as computer hardware stores 
the proliferation of software titles demands the kind of shelf 
space that is only available in a softwareonly shop software etc 
said its fifth avenue shop carries more than 2000 titles from 
desktop publishing to video games 
according to a survey of large companies by computer reseller 
newslast year about 40 percent of the personal computer software 
they bought was through softwareonly stores while 27 percent was 
through computer hardware stores 7 percent was by mail order and 7 
percent was direct from the software publishers 
software etc has the most outlets of any chain about 240 
while egghead leads in revenue 
egghead is a public company based in issaquah wash while 
minneapolisbased software etc is privately held and does not 
announce sales or profit figures smaller chains include software 
city babbages and walden software 
all the store chains are increasing the support they give 
customers such as having fulltime people demonstrating software 
thats part of the userfriendly attitude which is subsidized in 
some cases by the software publishers 
the top people in the chains are retailers not technologists at 
egghead chairman and founder victor d alhadeff used to sell shoes 
at a seattle department store while president and chief executive 
stuart m sloan also holds down a job as chairman of an upscale 
supermarket chain 
at software etc levy used to sell computers wholesale stan 
hirshman the vice president of store operations used to work at 
banana republic the gap and tj maxx and dick fontaine the 
president and chief executive came from b dalton booksellers and 
michaels stores a dallasbased retailer of arts and crafts and 
hobby items 
both chains as well as their smaller rivals are trying to take 
the fear and loathing out of buying computer software 
this has been the kind of business where its made people 
scared of the product levy said were creating theater in 
here were going to have music were going to have rock n roll

white house and treasury department officials 
are reviewing a plan to protect fragile regional economies from the 
quick sale of billions of dollars of real estate repossessed from 
failed savings and loans 
the plan was developed by former deputy treasury secretary rt 
mcnamar who presented it to bush administration officials last week 
according to an outline prepared by mcnamar and obtained by the 
associated press it would create state or local real estate 
liquidation trusts the trusts would issue bonds backed partly by 
the federal government and partly by state or local governments and 
use the money to buy distressed sampls real estate from the federal 
government 
the trusts would be independent of local government and would 
hire staff who would manage the properties with the goal of selling 
them at the highest price possible over 10 to 15 years trust 
managers compensation would be based on longterm performance of 
the properties under their care 
white house and treasury department officials on monday did not 
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment mcnamar who 
started a merchant banking firm in los angeles after leaving the 
reagan administration said in a telephone conversation these are 
just some preliminary ideas weve been working on they are very 
consistent with president bushs program and may or may not be 
useful 
the mcnamar proposal could be warmly received from members of 
congress from energyproducing states such as texas where 
alreadyweak real estate markets could be driven into a tailspin by 
the quick sale of repossessed property 
sen timothy wirth a democrat from colorado where savings 
institutions and local economies have been hard hit by energyprice 
problems said he had not reviewed the plan but he said it could 
prove to be a worthwhile mechanism for holding real estate off 
distressed markets 
its imperative that the authority given to the sampl 
liquidators include safeguards against property dumping clearly 
this has to be left to the discretion of federal regulators but 
they have to understand the fragility of some economies he said 
in a telephone interview monday 
according to wirth sampl regulators now control about 75 billion 
in repossessed property jerome blank of the national association of 
realtors told the senate banking committee on friday that after all 
insolvent sampls are closed or sold to new owners the us 
government will become the largest landowner in the united 
states and will have to dispose of over 150 billion in real 
estate 
other legislators particularly in the house may not welcome the 
mcnamar proposal members of the house banking committee over the 
past year and a half have bitterly complained about the performance 
and quasiprivate structure of the federal asset disposition 
association an agency set up by sampl regulators to manage 
repossessed real estate and bad loans 
critics say real estate disposal is best handled by a government 
agency less subject to industry influence and directly under the 
oversight of congress the mcnamar outline would put the real estate 
outside the direct control of the federal government 
bushs plan for restoring the savings and loan industry calls for 
selling 50 billion in bonds over the next 2 years and using the 
money to sell or merge insolvent institutions 
mcnamar would use a portion to credit enhance some portion 
perhaps 20 percent of the local real estate trust bonds which 
would also be backed to a similar extent by the sponsoring state or 
local government 
the rest of the interest and principal would be paid off by 
selling the repossessed real estate but the proposed mechanism 
would allow 10 to 15 years to sell the property while the bush 
plan as it stands would sell all property within five years

on the new york mercantile exchange the april contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil jumped 53 
cents to close at 1903 a barrel the last time the nearmonth

contract closing 54 cents higher at 1863 a barrel 
product prices continued to rise breaking through key technical 
levels analysts said 
the april contract for unleaded gasoline rose 138 cents to 
settle at 5316 cents a gallon while heating oil rose 116 cents to 
close at 5235 cents a gallon other contract months also posted 
strong gains 
analysts said a fire in a crude oil pump unit on a processing 
platform forced the closure of norways north sea ekofisk complex 
including seven crude oil fields

surrounding cables and forcing the shutdown analysts said 
the seven fields produce an average of 250000 barrels a day of 
crude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of gas 
phillips petroleum co of norway which operates the complex 
indicated the complex could be reopened within the next few days 
it was a strong day said jim fiedler vice president in 
charge of energy brokering for edampf man international futures 
inc fundamental news about ekofisk moved the market but there 
was an underlying strength before that 
traders said prices picked up steam as they broke through key 
technical levels that the market had resisted in recent weeks 
demand for oil products particularly heating oil have posted 
gains recently and continued strong in the wake of reports that 
european refiners were reducing refinery runs and product

crude oil futures climbed monday including a late surge as the 
april contract for the benchmark west texas intermediate grade 
smashed through two key resistance levels and closed above 19 
on other markets copper took a pounding following reports that 
stocks at the london mercantile exchange rose rather than declined 
from the previous week grain and soybean futures posted modest 
gains on technical buying and spillover strength and frozen pork 
belly futures continued drifting lower as the underlying cash market 
hit nineyear lows 
the energy futures runup began with reports that operations at 
norways firedamaged ekofisk complex in the north sea which 
produces about 250000 barrels of oil daily would be down for at 
least another day 
additional support came when nonopec oilproducing nations 
whose share of the world market exceeds opecs announced plans to 
unilaterally cut another 290000 barrels from their daily output 
admittedly those were small bits of news but theres been 
strength underpinning for the market for a while said jim 
ritterbusch vice president of trading and research for 
chicagobased carson petroleum co 
when the april contract topped 1892 last years high it set 
off one wave of technical buying a decision based on chartprice 
comparisons and another wave followed when the market crashed a 
second important resistance level at 19 
ritterbusch said he believes the energy futures will continue to 
rise 
the last time we got to 19 was almost two months ago and that 
was because there was a trading squeeze on when the time came time 
for delivery of the feburary contract this is a little different 
whenever you set new highs in an uptrend he added the 
line of least resistance is to the upside 
crude oil settled 7 cents to 53 cents higher on 
betterthanaverage volume on the new york mercantile exchange with 
the contract for delivery in april at 1903 a barrel heating oil 
which also managed contract highs in the nearby months were 72 
cent to 116 cents higher with april at 5235 cents a gallon and 
unleaded gasoline was 90 cent to 177 cents higher with april at 
5316 cents a gallon 
copper was 39 cents to 51 cents lower on the comex with march 
at 1427 a pound 
the pressure came with news from london mercantile exchange 
officials that copper stocks were up 1775 tons from the previous 
week putting total stocks at 87525 tons 
thats still a relatively low level said analyst bette 
raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc in new york but 
some of the trade were looking for a decline and when no fresh news 
came along to buoy it up it just kept easing lower 
the precious metals except for platinum were a model of 
consistency platinum was 680 to 760 lower at the new york merc 
with march at 54240 a troy ounce at the comex gold was 10 cents 
lower to 10 cents higher with march at 39440 a troy ounce silver 
was 1 cent to 18 cent higher with march at 6078 a troy ounce 
there was little fresh news in the grain or soybean markets but 
technical buying led to an upswing in the soybean pits that spilled 
over into the grains 
most of the technical buying took place in the may contract 
which had traded in a range between 760 and 780 a bushel in 
recent sessions it settled 13 cents higher closing at 782 
wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents higher at the chicago board of 
trade with the contract for delivery in march at 438 a bushel 
corn was cent to 1 cents higher with march at 277 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with march at at 209 a 
bushel and soybeans were 7 cents to 13 cents higher with march at 
768 a bushel 
livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly lower at the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle was 45 cent lower to 07 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7812 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 25 cent lower to 40 cent higher with march at 8120 cents a 
pound live hogs were 17 cent lower to 18 cent higher with april 
at 4362 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 03 cent to 40

the miller brewing co has withdrawn college 
newspaper advertising supplements that were intended to capitalize 
on the rollicking atmosphere of spring vacation but instead sparked 
complaints of sexism 
more than a million copies of the supplement titled beachin 
times were to run in 67 college newspapers across the country to 
promote millers springbreak welcome centers in daytona beach 
fla and south padre island texas 
but after receiving criticism from some college newspapers and 
being censured by the wisconsin student association at the 
university of wisconsinmadison miller announced feb 24 it would 
withdraw the supplement 
as soon as we heard the reaction we took immediate steps to 
try to stop it said robert bertini a miller spokesman but he 
said miller was able to stop the inserts only in 10 papers 
for the 57 newspapers that already used the supplement miller 
sent each an apology through a letter to the editor 
the 16page insert includes advice to women to never trust a 
guy who uses an opening line like thats a greatlooking bathing 
suit but itd look better on my motel room floor 
the supplement has a page on why i are a college student 
gives such reasons as better than working six years of high 
school was enough so i can learn to write gooder and 
unbelievable babes which was listed three times 
we think we blew it in terms of the tone and the content of the 
publication bertini said it was intended as a humorous 
takeoff we did not intend it to be offensive or inappropriate 
the insert ran in late february in the daily cardinal newspaper 
at uwmadison the next day the student association censured miller 
and urged students to boycott miller products until the 
milwaukeebased company apologized for the material 
many people in the wsa office found it offensive said 
michael olds assistant university affairs director for the student 
government organization different womens groups found it 
extremely offensive

a former federal prosecutor and private eye 
whose agency was retained by investment banking firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc misrepresented himself as working for a house 
subcommittee investigating corporate takeovers the subcommittee was 
told monday 
the allegation before the house energy ad commerce committees 
oversight and investigations subcommittee was made by william g 
bertain a eureka calif lawyer involved in a pending suit over 
the 1985 drexelassisted takeover of pacific lumber co by maxxam 
corp of houston 
bertain told the subcommittee that john gibbons a former 
assistant us attorney in california and now a private investigator 
for kroll associates had told him on five occasions last year that 
he was seeking information about maxxams chairman charles hurwitz 
on behalf of a congressional subcommittee 
in one of the conversations taped by bertain at the request of 
the subcommittees staff gibbons said he was working for the 
oversight and investigations panel chaired by rep john dingell 
dmich bertain testified 
part of the tape of that conversation in bertains office was 
played at mondays hearing the latest in a series dingell has held 
concerning drexels assistance in corporate takeovers by 
underwriting highyield junk bonds 
drexel agreed in principle in december to plead guilty to six 
charges of securities law violations and pay a record 650 million 
fine largely in connection with its relationship to nowimprisoned 
speculator ivan boesky 
the securities and exchange commission also has alleged that 
drexel violated securities laws in maxxams takeover of pacific 
lumber the largest private holder of redwood timberland in 
california 
the pacific lumber takeover was structured by drexel through a 
300 million bank loan arranged by irving trust co of new york and 
a 450 million junk bond offering sold by drexel 
gibbons declined monday to answer specific questions from 
subcommittee members saying he had received the panels subpoena 
only a week ago and had not had adequate time to prepare 
he said he was not aware that his conversation with bertain in 
bertains office last dec 19 had been taped until this past weekend 
but gibbons boss jules kroll principal owner of the detective 
agency told reporters after the hearing it is totally 
inconceivable that gibbons had misrepresented himself and 
predicted that he would be vindicated at a continuation of the 
hearing next week 
my man was set up by bertain and others to get our files 
said kroll whose agency specializes in corporate takeover 
investigations and includes among its clients several major 
investment banking firms in addition to drexel 
included in the subcommittees subpoena to gibbons were demands 
for copies of any documents regarding drexel boesky maxxam 
hurwitz five other companies and matters involving securities 
and takeover laws in the pacific lumber takeover 
last october bertain filed a 225 billion lawsuit against 
maxxam and drexel on behalf of former stockholders in pacific lumber 
the subcommittee did not establish monday that gibbons was 
working for drexel when he sought bertains assistance steven 
anreder a spokesman at drexels headquarters in new york said he 
could not establish immediatedly if gibbons was working on behalf of 
his company at the time 
but dingell said he would refer to the justice department 
evidence of anyone representing themselves as working on behalf of 
the subcommittee when they were not

after attracting throngs of bargainhunting 
fliers with a 12 northeast shuttle fare over the weekend 
striketorn eastern airlines could be ready to expand its cutrate 
strategy observers said monday 
but although fare cutting could produce rates as cheap as 49 
oneway tickets between new york and florida analysts say 
discounts are unlikely to be widespread 
i dont think youre going to see a lot of matching by 
competitors said edward starkman an airline analyst for 
painewebber inc 
like the 12 shuttle fare further cutrate ticket promotions 
would be an attempt to preserve market share during the crippling 
strike by easterns machinists union and walkouts by its pilots and 
flight attendants 
eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors last thursday citing a cash crisis stemming from the 
strike that began march 4 
analysts say easterns likeliest fare move would be to offer 
cheap flights to its primary market of florida as travelers begin 
flocking south for easter and spring break industry speculation 
points to a 49 oneway ticket between new york and florida which 
would be about half the prevailing discount fare 
but experts cautioned that any farecutting probably would be 
shortlived and unlikely to be matched by miamibased easterns 
competitors furthermore some travel agents may refuse to sell the 
cheap tickets 
easterns rivals in the lucrative florida market notably delta 
air lines already are booked to near capacity on those flights 
starkman and others said 
well have to take a look at each individual fare action 
said jackie pate a spokeswoman for delta at its atlanta 
headquarters 
united airlines spokesman charlie lopez in chicago said that 
carrier would reserve judgment until eastern actually introduced any 
new fares 
eastern wouldnt say whether it was considering launching the 
fares and officials declined to comment on how the airline would 
provide enough planes to meet demand if such a promotion was staged 
hundreds of passengers were stranded in new york washington and 
boston airports sunday night when eastern could not get enough 
planes in the air to accommodate the throngs that bought 12 shuttle 
tickets 
we will approach each market on an individual basis we have 
not indicated what our fare plans are said company spokesman 
robin matell in miami 
if eastern does slash its florida fares some travel agents say 
they wont offer the tickets fearing the risk to passengers of 
flying on a strikebound carrier and a possible deluge of refund 
requests if flights are cancelled 
i cant afford to have clients come back to me with 
complaints said david perelman president of dms travel in 
manhattan its a great deal if you can get on a plane 
suzanne jensen a spokeswoman for uniglobe travel international 
inc in vancouver british columbia said some of the companys 
franchised travel agents would sell the cutrate tickets only if 
customers insisted but would not provide refunds 
sharply discounted fares have been used in the past by airlines 
that have been hit with strikes and wanted to reclaim market share 
analysts said 
frank lorenzo who controls eastern and continental airlines 
through texas air corp put continental into bankruptcy in 
september 1983 fired striking employees and offered cheap fares to 
any destination a few days later 
continental remained operating as a lowprice carrier although 
the rockbottom fares were offered only for a few weeks 
analysts say they dont expect eastern to stick with a discount 
strategy for long because the company cant afford it 
eastern has been unprofitable even with normal fares said 
louis marckesano an airline analyst with janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia 
a 49 oneway fare between new york and florida would be roughly 
the level where eastern could break even assuming that planes were 
full marckesano suggested

the state petroleum monopoly pemex has 
canceled a leasing contract with a private mexican company and 
announced it will build up its own fleet of oil tankers 
the board of directors of petroleos mexicanos sa decided to 
cancel the contract with flota petrolera mexicana sa at a late 
sunday meeting because they arent consistent with current policy 
the oil company said in a press release published in mondays 
newspapers it offered no further explanation 
but the independent newspaper excelsior quoted unnamed sources as 
saying cancelation followed a series of irregularities observed 
recently with that company an editorial in the government 
newspaper el nacional linked it with accusations of corruption 
within the petroleum monopoly and its union 
neither newspaper went into details 
flota petrolera mexicana sa owned by isidoro rodriguez a 
businessman with close ties to several former pemex directors had 
been leasing two tankers to pemex since nov 29 1985 
the powerful oil workers union has claimed the contract leasing 
the tankers antonio j bermudez and antonio dovali jaime signed 
shortly before mario ramon beteta stepped down as pemex director to 
run for government of mexico state was illegal 
union leader joaquin hernandez galicia claimed the lease price of 
195 million each was too high and corruption was involved beteta 
denied any wrongdoing and accusations flew back and forth for more 
than three years 
the attorney generals office the comptroller general pemex and 
a special commission in the chamber of deputies said their 
investigations found no wrongdoing 
hernandez galicia and 50 other oil union leaders were arrested in 
a government crackdown jan 10 five were released for lack of 
evidence 
the longtime union boss and the other 45 face charges ranging 
from homicide to illegal weapons possession and fraud 
in an editorial monday el nacional called pemexs cancellation 
of the contract a drastic correction to the problem and praised 
the monopolys decision to build its own tanker fleet 
leasing those tankers was part of a system of enclaves that 
created suspicions made pemex lose credibility and strengthened 
interests that had nothing to do with pemex the editorial said

corp on monday announced a merger agreement under which the 
japanese firm would buy the direct marketing company for 395 
million in cash 
the 28pershare bid by yamanouchi which bought shaklees

we will not be competing on it jacobs said they have a 
chance to do very well we wish them a lot of success

monday as shaklees stock shot up 925 to close at 4737 a share

teamsters union officials reached a tentative 
laborreform settlement monday that prosecutors said would end years 
of alleged mobster influence through permanent reforms including 
the first direct election of top union leaders 
the settlement announced just hours before the start of a trial 
on a lawsuit to oust the unions allegedly mobdominated leadership 
was reached at 130 am monday in manhattan after roundtheclock 
weekend negotiations 
attorney general dick thornburgh announced the terms of the 
agreement in washington saying it will give the government the 
tools to clean up this union and return control to rank and file 
union members 
according to the justice department the tentative agreement is a 
compromise that calls for three courtappointed watchdogs to oversee 
the union which would continue to be run by its leaders 
the overseers would be appointed for three years by us district 
judge david n edelstein with the joint approval of both sides one 
would investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption another 
would administer disciplinary action and the third would oversee 
elections 
the settlement was subject to edelsteins approval the judge 
deferred acting until tuesday saying the 30page document which he 
received at monday afternoon was very complicated 
at a press briefing in new york the lead prosecutor in the case 
assistant us attorney randy mastro said that once approved by 
edelstein changes the under the settlement will be incorporated 
into the teamsters constitution in perpetuity 
the justice departments lawsuit sought to oust the unions top 
leadership as the culmination of the governments decadeslong 
battle to force reform on the 16 millionmember union 
using federal racketeering laws the justice department also 
sought a courtappointed trustee or committee to oversee the 
nations largest union and impose a series of reforms it was the 
first time the government tried to seize control of an entire union 
thornburgh told reporters in washington the settlement contained 
roughly the same kind of remedy that was sought in the lawsuit 
however james t grady the teamsters general counsel said 
that in exchange for the agreement none of the unions ruling 
executive board members would have to resign and no courtappointed 
trustee or administrator would run the union on a daytoday basis 
the members are assured there is a mechanism in place to remove 
those persons alleged to be conducting improper activities said 
grady the goals of a clean and democratic union are consistent 
with the goals of the current leadership 
grady said the union agreed to introduce constitutional 
amendments for direct election of top union officers at its 1991 
convention what mastro called sweeping election reforms 
all teamsters international union officials will be directly 
elected by the membership in secret ballot thats never happened 
before said mastro 
he noted that whether the amendments were approved in 1991 was 
irrelevent because the reform is automatic by virtue of this 
decree 
the lawsuit filed last june claimed the teamsters leadership 
had been dominated by organized crime which deprived union 
members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering and a 
campaign of fear that included 20 murders dozens of bombings 
beatings bribes extortion and theft 
twentyfive of 26 reputed mob figures originally named as 
defendants have been convicted of teamstersrelated crimes such as 
extortion through threats of union problems embezzlement of union 
funds and illegal labor payoffs 
most however were dismissed from the case when they either 
agreed or were ordered to drop any involvement with the teamsters 
five including convicted colombo crime family boss carmine 
junior persico have been severed from the case and will be 
tried later 
teamsters president william j mccarthy was among the 11 
remaining individual defendants in the case 
mastro said that in addition to the union itself the 
international brotherhood of teamsters chauffeurs warehousemen and 
helpers of america the 11 individual defendants had signed the 
agreement 
on sunday the union ran a full page ad in the new york times 
condemning the government lawsuit teamsters are not the only ones 
on trial the ad asserted so is the american system of 
justice 
last week three members of the teamsters executive board 
including weldon mathis the unions secondranking official agreed 
to a settlement three other vice presidents reached settlements 
last month that left 11 board members including mccarthy and the 
union itself as defendants 
that got us moving grady said of the mathis settlement 
when he filed the lawsuit in june thenus attorney rudolph 
giuliani accused the teamsters leadership of making a devils 
pact with organized crime giuliani said the lawsuit was an 
attempt to take back the union from the mafia 
the governments move was roundly criticized by congressmen and 
labor leaders the aflcio which allowed the teamsters to rejoin in 
1987 after a 30year rift over corruption called the lawsuit a 
clear abuse of the governments prosecutorial power 
court papers noted that four teamsters presidents since the 1950s 
have faced federal felony charges and three were convicted david 
beck for embezzlement james jimmy hoffa for obstructing justice 
and mail fraud and roy williams for trying to bribe a us senator 
the fourth jackie presser the unions president at the time the 
lawsuit was brought died while under indictment on embezzlement 
charges

eastern airlines will sharply cut pay of machinists 
who cross union picket lines and will offer reduced wages to any 
workers hired to replace strikers the airline and union said monday 
the pay reductions made under work rules the troubled airline 
says it can impose during a strike were disclosed as eastern 
continued trying to expand its active routes and otherwise rebound 
from the 10dayold crippling walkout by machinists pilots and 
flight attendants 
this package would make eastern the lowestpaid in the industry 
compared with major carriers said wally haber a general 
chairman for the machinists union i think its obvious they dont 
want anybody to come back to work 
under the new pay rules eastern would cut mechanics pay from 
the current 1883 to 14 an hour with new hires receiving a 
minimum 10 an hour baggage handlers would go from 1560 to 
1154 with new hires receiving 10 and pay for machinists 
janitors would drop from 1321 an hour to 825 with new hires 
getting a minimum 5 haber said 
overtime holiday and night differential pay are also slashed 
haber said 
eastern which filed for federal bankruptcy protection from 
creditors last thursday had sought 150 million in concessions from 
the machinists before the strike to stem a continuing tide of 
financial losses the machinists walked off the job after 17 months 
of fruitless negotiations 
haber said pay under the new rules is lower than the companys 
final contract offer and therefore illegal he said the machinists 
international organization in washington had been asked to review 
the work rules to determine if the union would challenge the cuts 
im sure that if they have a complaint theyll have a lawyer 
address it said eastern spokesman james ashlock this is the 
way we intend to function in those job categories 
haber said the package would make easterns pay scales lower than 
continental airlines already among the industrys lowest both 
carriers are owned by texas air corp 
in other developments monday 
eastern appealed a us district court ruling rejecting the 
companys claim that its pilots walkout in sympathy with the 
machinists constituted an illegal strike 
air line pilots association executives met in washington to 
discuss strike benefits for eastern members alpas leadership also 
was expected to discuss actions pilots at other airlines could take 
to support strikers 
a temporary injunction that prevented employees of other 
airlines from honoring machinists secondary picket lines expired at 
midnight monday the union said five airlines northwest united 
usair piedmont and twa sought an extension of the order by us 
district judge john pratt in washington dc 
eastern said it was aiming for at least 85 flights a day as it 
resumed jetliner service between miami and new yorks la guardia 
airport montreal and san juan puerto rico 
however the pilots union estimated that by sunday the airline 
was flying only 35 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1040 
daily flights the union estimates eastern has fewer than 200 
pilots of 3600 before the strike

a federal judge refused monday to dismiss 
claims that one of genentech incs major products an 
antiheartattack drug violated a rival firms patent 
us district judge marilyn hall patel ruled that abbott 
laboratories had produced enough evidence to go to trial on the 
question of whether its 1983 and 1985 patents were adequate to 
produce an artificial protein 
patel however also allowed genentech a south san francisco 
biotechnology company to make new legal attacks on abbotts patent 
including claims that it was not a new or useful formula and that 
abbott had committed fraud on the us patent office 
but her refusal to dismiss abbotts claims makes a trial more 
likely in a suit that poses a serious threat to genentech patel set 
a tentative trial date of january 1991 
genentechs suit filed last year seeks to stop abbott from 
claiming that genentech had violated its patents for an artificial 
protein abbott responded by countersuing genentech for patent 
infringement 
abbott first patented the substance in 1978 using a derivative 
of human kidney cells to produce the protein its patents in 1983 
and 1985 involved genetic engineering techniques 
genentech using a different process produced a similar 
substance called tpa which it sells commercially as the heart 
disease prevention drug activase abbott has not marketed its 
product commercially 
in pretrial proceedings genentech has contended that abbotts 
patent is invalid arguing it was not reliable or specific enough to 
enable others to duplicate the product by using the formula as 
patent law requires any product that could be produced from 
abbotts patent would not resemble tpa closely enough to justify a 
suit for infringement genentech argued 
but patel ruled that abbotts scientific evidence contradicted 
genentechs claims sufficiently to raise factual disputes that could 
be resovled only in a trial 
the judge did not allow genentech to back its claims with its own 
scientific testimony because of her december ruling that genentech 
had tampered with one of abbotts witnesses 
patel found that a genentech scientist had approached an abbott 
scientist improperly and tried to persuade him to change his 
testimony and that the action had been agreed to or winked at 
by genentech lawyers she prohibited genentech from using statements 
by three scientists in support of its challenge to abbotts patents 
and also disqualified three genentech lawyers from the case

although treasury secretary nicholas bradys 
debtreduction plan has been well received internationally the 
white house reserved judgement on it monday 
no final decision has been made in terms of an approach to 
third world debt deputy press secretary roman popadiuk told a 
white house briefing 
bradys plan which he unveilled in a speech friday has as its 
central element the partial forgiveness by commercial banks of the 
410 billion in debt run up by developing nations most of them in 
latin america 
the plan represents a major shift in administration thinking 
it would supplant a strategy developed by former treasury 
secretary james a baker iii now the secretary of state that 
ruled out debt forgiveness and called instead for new loans by banks 
to countries that institute economic reforms 
this previous strategy known as the baker plan produced 
little in the way of new bank loans however in his speech friday 
brady all but conceded that the past strategy had failed to solve 
the debt crisis 
the brady plan has received generally favorable reviews both at 
home and abroad but disagreement remained within the govrnment over 
details administration sources said 
deputy treasury secretary david mulford said monday that bradys 
points were put forward as ideas and suggestions for debate 
among countries and institutions and not as a definite plan 
in a briefing on the proposals for foreign reporters mulford 
insisted bradys plan enjoyed broad support within the bush 
administration 
asked about reports of disagreements with the federal reserve 
system which is independent of the administration mulford said 
im not aware of any deep division between us on these 
suggestions 
mulford said it would be our hope that policy changes will be 
in place within a matter of some months to cut the debts and 
interest payments of third world countries 
still on friday and again on monday the white house appeared to 
be going out of its way to put some distance between itself and the 
new proposal 
secretary brady had a number of ideas he presented those 
ideas the president was aware of those ideas popadiuk said 
and he said while brady as treasury secretary speaks for the 
administration on such matters no final decision has been 
reached by bush on whether to embrace the approach 
popadiuk said the outline that brady offered remains under 
consideration 
while remaining noncommittal popadiuk characterized the brady 
proposal as one that builds on the baker plan rather than 
repudidating it 
a white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said that baker had signed off on his successors propsal 
brady isnt out there alone on it the official said 
the official said that the main reason for the delay in giving 
the proposal official white house blessings was that the plan needed 
to be mulled over further by aides and by interagency groups 
bradys plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding 
debt by using money from the world bank and the international 
monetary fund as collateral 
the plan also envisions that some of the debt will be swapped by 
banks for bonds of lower face value
