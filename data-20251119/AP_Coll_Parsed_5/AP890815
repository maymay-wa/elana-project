the japanese have gone wild over fourwheel 
drive vehicles and on that score they have shed their prejudices 
against american automobiles 
the americanmade jeep is the mark of prestige 
churning up mud bouncing over dirt moguls mucking through boggy 
sinkholes enthusiasts careen around a 55acre fourwheeldrive 
playground in the shadow of mount fuji 
the equivalent of a ski resort for dirt vehicles the 
paybytheday motosu highlands course is flourishing because herds 
of fourwheeldrive vehicles were banned from tearing up mount fuji 
itself 
but the fourwheeldrive vehicle also has become a status symbol 
in tokyos highfashion harajuku district where urban dandies 
cruise around in chrometrimmed jackedup jeeptype vehicles with 
the tops down festooned with macho but unused heavyduty winches 
and fog lights 
and in affluent residential neighborhoods housewives load 
groceries into jeep cherokees parked next to mercedes benzes and 
saabs 
in a country eager for evermorestylish ways to spend newfound 
cash fourwheeldrive recreational vehicles have become the 
ultimate japanese yuppie vehicle and the american jeep is the one 
to own 
while other american cars are deemed mediocre by the japanese 
jeeps evoke an image of american wideopen spaces and outdoor life 
that many japanese long for says nobuyoshi fukushima editor of 4x4 
magazine 
chrysler jeep sales have doubled in japan for three years in a 
row but they still totaled only 500 in 1988 
the vast majority of fourwheeldrive cars on japanese roads are 
still domestic models such as the mitsubishi pajero or isuzu big 
horn and many vehicles with the genuine jeep insignia were built by 
mitsubishi which bought the technology from the willis overland co 
more than 20 years ago before jeep manufacturing was taken over in 
the united states by american motors corp and then chrysler 
fourwheeldrive vehicles are the fastestgrowing segment of 
japans auto market for the past few years jeeptype sales have 
grown 20 to 30 percent annually or three times as fast as the 
entire car market estimates fukushima one in 11 of the 67 million 
cars produced in japan last year had fourwheel drive 
recreation vehicles are part of a growing leisure industry fueled 
by rising incomes and longer vacations skiers surfers and scuba 
divers also are avid drivers of jeepstyle vehicles but 75 percent 
of fourwheeldrives in japan never leave city streets their appeal 
is atmospheric rather than functional 
jeepstyle vehicles with power steering leather seats stereos 
adjustable suspensions and automatic transmissions sell fast and 
dealers say theyre getting bmw tradeins from buyers 
the topoftheline us jeep cherokee costs about 35000 in 
japan more than double the price of many smaller japanese 
jeepstyle cars 
this is really a luxury car for welltodo buyers mostly 
professionals in their late 30s or 40s says masayuki sakamoto 
director of marketing for chrysler japan sales ltd 
masaaki kuroiwa who has been selling jeeps and jeep parts for 
more than 20 years from a cluttered suburban garage finds the fad a 
little ironic 
theres no need for these cars in japan nowadays he said 
theres hardly any place to really drive them its just a 
fashion people like them with all kinds of shiny accessories stuck 
on its a way to spend money 
kuroiwa fell in love with jeeps when they were the only vehicles 
that could get around in a devastated japan just after world war ii 
as a child he admired the powerful olivegreen vehicles driven by 
american occupation troops 
after the us occupation forces left japan their jeeps 
continued to serve as allround vehicles especially on rough 
country roads but they nearly disappeared in the 1960s when many 
were shipped to poorer countries for another lifetime of service 
now kuroiwa and others are buying vintage american jeeps as 
collectors items from the philippines where they are still widely 
in use 
in kuroiwas lot yuichi tanaka 45 proudly pats the hood of his 
wellpreserved jeep which is exactly as old as he is 
its won a lot of jeep beauty contests he said

he was a lawyer investment banker professor and 
editor and only 32 when the plane he was in crashed in the 
mountains of ethiopia 
but friends remember ivan tillem as a selfless man who overcame a 
poor troubled childhood to use his wealth to help others 
especially the young from disadvantaged children in brooklyn to 
starving children in africa 
when everyone else was talking he was out there doing said 
neal schnall his roommate on a 1986 trip to ethiopia 
tillem was on the plane that crashed aug 7 in southwestern 
ethiopia killing 16 including us rep mickey leland of texas 
tillem an orthodox jew had worked on behalf of ethiopians jewish 
and otherwise since 1986 helping establish a poultryfarming 
enterprise 
you cant save the world but you can save one corner of it 
and in ivans case several corners said barbara ribakove gordon 
executive director of the north american conference on ethiopian 
jews 
it was very typical of him that helping ethiopia meant not 
just sitting in new york and writing checks but going there going 
to visit jewish villages putting drops in childrens eyes 
tillems resume looked like that of someone twice his age 
chairman of the pacific financial corp professor at stern college 
at yeshiva university where he was on the board of trustees 
publisher and editor of the jewish almanac which he subsidized to 
keep it affordable 
its hard to believe that one guy could do all these things 
schnall said he used to say i dont have time to sleep ive 
got things ive got to do 
among those things were establishing a scholarship fund for poor 
students at yeshiva university and a fund for retarded and 
disadvantaged children at ohel childrens home in brooklyn 
he had almost an obsession to make a difference said 
longtime friend dennis rapps executive director of the national 
jewish commission on law and public affairs where tillem once 
practiced civil rights law 
as tillem wrote in his preface to the jewish almanac hunger 
despair homelessness blindness deprivation enslavement and 
hopelessness exist alongside tranquility order and privilege 
and jews should work to improve the ratio 
that is tikkun hoalam repairing the world for the world 
can and should be different than it is he wrote 
he listened to what others had to say and spoke quietly said 
karen bacon dean of stern college for women but he was so 
imaginative in his ideas 
and all of them were directed toward solving problems of 
humanity social problems political problems he had ideas for the 
subways for ethiopia for haiti for everybody 
the money for all this came from canny investments pacific 
financials latest venture is atlantic air a passenger airline out 
of atlantic city nj 
he gave away most of his money said abe bayer director for 
international affairs for the national jewish community relations 
advisory council 
tillem seldom spoke of his childhood friends said though it was 
known his parents divorced and that he lived in a series of foster 
homes before a rabbi in queens took him in as a teenager he was 
unmarried 
you got the sense that he had a thing for children that what 
happened to him wouldnt happen to anyone else said rapps 
he was a very strange and enigmatic fellow bayer said i 
dont want to gloss this over he was a loner a restless 
imaginative and tortured soul and it was shaped by a very poor and 
traumatic childhood

the farm crisis hot line is disconnected 
but officials say farmers and university of illinois advisers who 
help them are wiser because of rural route 
the unique program ended this summer after 3500 farmers called 
its tollfree number seeking confidential advice about their 
financial problems 
rural route which received 22 million in state and federal 
funds over four years has left both farmers and advisers better 
prepared for the future said peter bloome assistant director of 
the university cooperative extension service 
they have a vivid memory of a recent event that will make them 
more cautious he said farmers also have learned that farming is 
a business and that they have a value and worth that has nothing 
to do with that occupation 
rural route also taught university advisers to be aggressive in 
looking for solutions to farmers economic problems and preparing 
farmers for their future in agriculture or in some other occupation 
if necessary said bloome 
some wanted to pretend the men in trouble were older poorly 
educated smaller farmers who were laggards at accepting 
technology he said the opposite was true they were young 
welleducated and progressive 
the hot line was unplugged july 1 although the services remain 
available 
calls had dropped to one a day or less said bloome the 
overall financial picture for farmers was much improved and 
farmers need for anonymity seemed to be less 
when the first call came into rural route on march 18 1985 
farm income was down debt and operating costs were up and many 
farmers felt a serious economic pinch 
bills and stress mounted foreclosure loomed for some there 
was an increase in alcohol abuse family discord divorce and 
suicide but many troubled farmers refused to seek help because of 
pride and fear of ridicule in their communities 
farmers were referred to counseling centers around the state or 
advisers always from another county were dispatched to their 
farms

regarding his possible involvement in the disappearance of a fourth 
girl 7yearold masami yoshizawa of saitama state who vanished 
last october

allegedly taking nude photographs of a 6yearold girl he was 
charged with indecent assault in the case 
miyazaki was rearrested friday on charges of kidnapping and 
killing nomoto who he told police made fun of a deformity in 
his hands her torso was found near a public restroom in a cemetery 
northwest of tokyo on june 11 police discovered the girls skull 
thursday at a location miyazaki led them to 
under japanese law prosecutors have a maximum of 20 days to 
collect evidence against him before releasing him or bringing 
charges 
in the most brutal murder case in postwar crime history 
miyazaki finally confessed he killed the other two the japan 
broadcasting corp reported 
the new development appeared on the front pages of all the major 
japanese papers reporters have been camping out in front of 
miyazakis house as well as the victims homes 
in his confession statement miyazaki said on aug 22 i 
picked up mari drove her to a mountain where i strangled her to

his car stripping her clothes off and throwing her in the woods

described the series of abductions as murder for pleasure 
this case involved abnormal sexual desires especially toward 
little girls sadism obsession for dead bodies and objects oda

this communist land of comparative 
plenty long a magnet for soviet bloc citizens seeking consumer 
goods and comfortable vacations also is becoming an escape route to 
the west 
on sunday night a dozen young east germans who spent the weekend 
outside the west german consulate in hopes of reaching the west 
crawled into their sleeping bags for another night on the sidewalk 
police drove by now and then but did not disturb them 
across the danube river a new interior ministry committee was 
examining requests for refugee status from 10 applicants a soviet 
citizen a czechoslovak and eight stranded somalis 
three refugee camps for 1400 people are being built outside 
budapest they are primarily intended for ethnic hungarians from 
romania but officials say the camps will be open to all europeans 
who can prove they face persecution at home 
one of the young east germans said we still dont know whether 
well make it but the way west is a lot easier from hungary than 
from east berlin 
hungary began welcoming romanian refugees in january 1988 
breaking an agreement with the communist ally to return its citizens 
who sought asylum 
about 17000 romanians most of them ethnic hungarians have fled 
to hungary in the first instance of one warsaw pact country giving 
sanctuary to citizens of another on grounds of persecution 
hungarys decision to take in refugees from romania put a further 
burden on the already strained relations between the two allies 
hungary has long maintained the estimated 17 millionmember 
ethnic hungarian minority in romania is subject to discriminatory 
policies hungary also has expressed concern over a romanian plan to 
demolish villages and resettle the population hungary fears that 
this could destroy ethnic culture and traditions 
romania rejects the charges as interference in its internal 
affairs 
hungarian officials said in recent interviews the country will 
not change its new border and refugee policies just to avoid 
tensions with allies 
in may hungary began dismantling barbed wire and other barriers 
on its border with austria since then at least 1500 east germans 
with few chances of travel to western europe have tried to cross 
into austria illegally through hungary 
hundreds succeeded and have gone on to west germany other 
hundreds who failed have gone underground in hungary or sought 
asylum on west german diplomatic property 
police col karoly nagy urged all people who are in hungary 
illegally to leave but also told reporters none would be forcibly 
deported 
a government official said privately because this decision 
expands the possibility for the east germans to go to the west 
illegally its clear that this decision is not among those that the 
east germans are happy about 
the new refugee policy which could provide asylum to any east 
european who proved persecution is likely to disturb hungarys east 
european allies even more 
on march 14 hungary became the first soviet bloc country to join 
the un convention on the rights of refugees which took effect 
june 12 
it commits authorities not to return anyone to a country where 
his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race 
religion nationality or political opinion 
some western countries have applied the convention broadly 
giving asylum to most citizens of soviet bloc countries 
the interior ministry insists hungary does not want to become a 
conduit to the west but officials formulating new laws to conform 
with the convention say all cases will be heard 
if an individual meets the criteria of the geneva convention 
then we will definitely grant him refugee status because if we 
decided to accept something we have to carry it through said 
laszlo albrecht deputy head of the ministrys refugee section 
i cannot speak for the czechoslovak or east german governments 
but in case they disapprove what can we do 
under new laws taking effect in october each applicant will be 
heard by a refugee camp panel albrecht said a refugee who is 
rejected may appeal to an interior ministry committee then demand a 
court hearing 
albrecht said other countries of permanent residence would be 
sought for most refugees other than ethnic hungarians indicating 
most would come from the east and go west 
its clear that not too many swiss citizens are going to ask 
for refugee status from us he said and smiled

six months after the soviet military 
withdrawal president najib remains in power the usbacked 
guerrillas who oppose him are feuding and both superpowers are 
increasing arms deliveries 
the united states and soviet union have said they want a 
political settlement of the 11yearold civil war but talks in 
stockholm two weeks ago produced no breakthrough and summer fighting 
has continued 
when the last soviet troops crossed the oxus river border feb 
15 journalists in kabul awaited the imminent arrival of the moslem 
guerrillas as predicted by western diplomats who had closed their 
embassies and left 
six months later with najib in office and his communist 
government denying rumors of an attempted coup in july there is no 
expectation of guerrillas capturing kabul or any key provincial 
capital 
western embassies remain closed however soviet bloc and asian 
diplomats in kabul say that is more indicative of us opposition to 
reaching a deal with najib than to fear of the rockets that fall on 
the city almost daily 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said monday that 
najib who uses only one name has proved his government can defend 
itself and is not the kind of soviet puppet the united states 
expected to fall 
najib has offered to hold elections under un supervision for 
a broadbased coalition government but insists his party 
participate the guerrillas reject that participation 
we want a political settlement amani said war brings 
nothing but the killing of innocent civilians and further 
destruction of our country the war option cannot solve anything 
rockets are a daily threat in this milehigh capital ringed by 
mountains some unofficial estimates say they hit civilian targets 
98 percent of the time and military targets only 2 percent 
un sources said 281 people were killed and 745 wounded nearly 
all civilians by rockets and a car bombing between june 25 and aug 
1 
residents generally blame the rockets on the guerrillas and on 
the united states which pays for them but more and more they also 
are holding the government and soviets responsible 
both sides buy rockets and we hate both of them said salah 
an 18yearold student as he walked through rubble that had been a 
friends home 
i think now its time the great powers the soviet union and 
the united states must accept some type of solution for 
afghanistann said esmatee wardak president of the womens 
committee 
washington and moscow agreed to act as guarantors of the 
unmediated accords of april 1988 between afghanistan and 
neighboring pakistan which provided for withdrawal of soviet 
soldiers and an end to outside involvement 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet forces entered the country in december 1979 
each side has accused the other of interfering the united states 
says the soviet union is shipping arms to najibs government at the 
rate of 25 billion to 3 billion a year nearly double the figure 
before the withdrawal 
the united states has promised the guerrillas new weapons with 
which to disable airport runways and counter highaltitude bombing 
by the afghan air force 
lt gen abdul haq ulumi of the afghan supreme military council 
said last week the soviets were supplying with new mig29 fighters 
and the latest sukhoi27 ground attack jets to defend against a 
possible pakistani attack 
at least 3 million afghans have fled to pakistan afghanistans 
eastern neighbor which najibs government accuses of direct 
involvement in the war guerrillas use border cities and refugee 
camps as bases and supply points 
peter tomsen a us envoy to the guerrillas appointed by 
president bush predicted a major guerrilla offensive during the 
fighting season which lasts until november but it has not 
materialiized 
the end is clear he told a congressional committee last 
month resistance will prevail 
tomsen said little of the guerrillas failure to capture the 
provincial capital of jalalabad after months of siege and an attack 
july 9 by one of the seven guerrilla groups based in pakistan on 
another 
members of the gulbuddin hekmatyars group hezbiislami which 
has received the most us aid were reported to have killed 30 
field commanders and fighters of the rival jamiatiislami 
compounding the effections of factionalism has been the 
reluctance of some field commanders to fight some say they resent 
not being included in the exile government formed earlier this year 
and are unwilling to risk their men for it 
najib has emphasized national reconciliation offering autonomy 
to local commanders who make peace will him 
on monday he met with 60 former guerrillas who came over to the 
government and said those who were fighting come together just 
like two brothers beside each other 
the government has yet to win over any major guerrilla commanders 
amani the foreign ministry spokesman said monday the security 
belt around kabul was being extended to prevent longrange rockets 
from reaching the city 
he said the zone now about 20 miles would be enlarged to 
between 25 miles and 40 miles depending on terrain amani said the 
government expected the guerrillas to start using longrante 
rockets those now in use have ranges of 20 miles or less

a giant 18footlong alligator is living 
in lake okeechobee boaters and fishermen claim but a state 
wildlife expert says he doubts it 
it looks monstrous bigger than our boat and we have a 
19footer rebecca dunn who has been fishing on the lake with her 
fishingguide husband since 1966 said recently 
we see it all the time said mrs dunn who said she believes 
the alligator is a female she throws her food up in the air way 
up then catches and eats it mostly fish and birds 
mrs dunn has named the alligator hendrietta for hendry county 
one of five counties surrounding lake okeechobee which is about 100 
miles northwest of miami and at 700 square miles is floridas 
largest lake 
bass fisherman sonny pease said he saw the creature sunning 
itself on shore with its tail curled around itself like lady 
godivas hair 
pease said that when he took his boat closer to the gator he 
kept repeating oh my god that alligator is long nobodys going 
to believe this 
when he got within about 200 yards of the big reptile it started 
swimming toward his 18foot boat 
it was all of my boats size pease recalled 
an 18foot alligator would break floridas longest alligator 
record by nearly 4 feet 
however wildlife biologist mike jennings of the state game and 
fresh water fish commission in gainesville said an 18footlong 
alligator would be highly improbable 
the longest gator caught since records were first kept in 1977 
measured just over 14 feet and weighed 714 pounds and was trapped 
last month in the apalachicola river southwest of tallahassee 
trappers estimated it was 100 years old 
the heaviest gator caught in april near gainesville weighed 
1043 pounds and was 13 feet long it took a tow truck to lift it 
and three scales to weigh it 
that was a very healthy gator jennings said i wouldve 
questioned it if i hadnt seen it myself 
the giant gators real length may be determined after sept 1 
when floridas monthlong alligator season starts 
every hunter who has a permit will be going for him said 
peases 22yearold son keith

valvano spent more time dodging questions than answering them at a 
tournament of champions basketball doubleheader news conference 
the four representatives of the tournament teams nc state 
pittsburgh ohio state and oklahoma state gave brief speeches 
monday to start the news conference 
when it was his turn to take the podium valvano immediately made 
reference to the ongoing saga at his school 
i can now say no comment in seven different languages he 
joked 
valvano had kept his public appearances to a minimum since the 
release of personal fouls a book authored by peter golenbock 
which contains allegations of wrongdoing in the nc state 
basketball program 
on monday he coined a phrase which ended up being his only 
answer to questions on the subject 
i will comment on that at the appropriate time he said 
a few minutes later however a determined reporter asked another 
question involving the controversies surrounding the university 
you really want to talk about this dont you asked valvano 
unless you think the appropriate time was in seven minutes 
thats still the answer 
valvano has denied the charges against him but the university of 
north carolina system formed a commission that conducted an 
investigation into nc states athletic program 
details of the report are to be released aug 25 at a meeting of 
the unc board of governors in chapel hill 
despite the occasional testiness valvano did joke some

noriega will step down and who will govern the country after sept 1 
the opposition is demanding that its victory in the may 7 
presidential elections be recognized so it can take power when the 
current terms of acting president manuel solis palma and the 
legislature expire at the end of august 
it also wants noriega to relinquish his post as chief of the 
panamanian defense forces which makes him the countrys de facto 
leader 
international observers said noriega had the election annulled 
when it became apparent the opposition was winning he has resisted 
more than a year of us and opposition pressure for his ouster 
ever since he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1988 in 
florida 
the opposition on monday however refused a government proposal 
that the two sides join in demanding an end to us military 
maneuvers along the panama canal said romulo escobar bethancourt 
head of the government delegation to the talks no reason for the 
opposition refusal was given 
last week there were at least 10 incidents between panamanian and 
us troops near the panama canal 
an organization of american states mission that is mediating the 
talks is to present another progress report on aug 23 the last 
meeting between the two sides was last friday

a police detective haunted for years by the 
supposedly accidental death of a 17monthold boy is resting easier 
since his reopening of the case led to the arrest of the boys 
stepfather for murder 
the suspicious death of adam walford nine years ago was 
particularly troubling to lt larry adams because adam was virtually 
the same age as his own son david 
i guess over the years ive always thought about adam walford 
never getting a chance to grow up and do the things david has 
done said adams a 16year veteran of the police force in the 
eastern kansas town of emporia 
on aug 19 1980 adam walford died of severe head injuries 
suffered at his home despite indications of abuse the death was 
ruled an accident 
a new investigation started by adams led to the arrest saturday 
of the boys stepfather gurney gerald bartley the 38yearold 
truck driver posted 25000 bond and was released on a charge of 
seconddegree murder bartley is scheduled to appear wednesday in 
lyon county district court 
nine years ago thensgt adams was one of two detectives 
assigned to investigate the childs death 
bartley told detectives he was in the house with adam when he 
heard a thud he said the boy had fallen off a 3inch step in a 
doorway between two rooms after bartley telephoned for help the 
boy was taken to a wichita hospital where he died three days later 
just a few days before adam had been taken to an emporia 
hospital emergency room for an ankle injury he also had numerous 
bruises adams said 
police a doctor and relatives all suspected the boys injuries 
were not an accident 
but sedgwick county forensics pathologist dr william eckert 
somehow had been given a wrong description of bartleys story when 
he performed the autopsy he ruled that adams injuries probably 
were caused by the type of accident he believed bartley had 
described the county attorney decided there wasnt enough evidence 
to prosecute and the case was closed 
authorities would not say what description the pathologist was 
given because prosecutors plan to use it as evidence in the trial 
in 1986 adams received permission to reopen the investigation 
he reinterviewed dozens of people including the boys grandparents 
and mother who was at work when the injury occurred the mother 
stephanie craver subsequently divorced bartley and remarried and 
now lives in georgia 
the entire family suspected abuse from the very beginning i 
think thats what led to the divorce adams said craver has been 
very supportive and felt something had happened to her son and 
did want the investigation open he said 
investigators also uncovered a new witness a longtime friend of 
bartley who told officers that bartley told her he was disciplining 
adam when the injury occurred 
finally adams and lyon county attorney rod symmonds decided to 
view the boys autopsy which had been videotaped as a training 
exercise it was something adams had avoided doing the first time 
around 
i just did not want to see a 17monthold cut up he said 
i should have done it though that was my job 
the viewing proved crucial showing that eckert had been given 
wrong information 
adams contacted eckert and after reviewing the evidence the 
pathologist changed his mind his new report blamed the boys fatal 
injuries on an assaultive scenario 
i cant explain the feeling i got inside of me when he called 
it a homicide adams said all these years i knew it was a 
homicide and now i had an expert forensic pathologist calling it a 
homicide 
armed with that report confirmation from two other pathologists 
and the new witness the county attorney decided to prosecute 
bartley for seconddegree murder 
im just ready to put it to sleep and let adam walford rest 
adams said i can just put this file someplace and not have to 
look at it again

many minorities infected with the aids virus 
are not seeking new lifeprolonging treatments because of a lack of 
information and distrust of the medical establishment doctors and 
social workers say 
poor blacks and hispanics are underrepresented in aids clinical 
trials where experimental therapies are tested and they often dont 
seek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for free 
medical care said aids caseworkers attending a government 
conference on aids and minorities 
theyre not as welleducated about prevention and they dont 
have a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latest 
drug thats being tested in a clinical trial in their area said 
dr gina brown an assistant attending physician in obstetrics and 
gynecology at harlem hospital 
also the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them into 
medical research she said many hear only that the treatments like 
azt make patients sick and dont understand that the drug can 
cripple the aids virus said brown also a clinical instructor at 
columbia presbyterian hospital in new york 
one way to include more minorities in clinical trials would be to 
move the trials out of the academic medical centers and into the 
neighborhoods many conference participants said monday 
because much of the research on new drugs is being conducted at 
universities clinical trials are often set up in a way that 
excludes poor people said keith cylar a clinical social worker and 
activist with the aids coalition to unleash power known as act up 
often services like transportation and day care are not considered 
he said 
dont put the trials on madison avenue or at new york 
university put them in harlem he said 
as of a month ago 7096 people with aids were participating in 
clinical trials sponsored by the national institute on allergy and 
infectious diseases the chief aids research institute at the 
national institutes of health among them were 557 blacks 731 
hispanics and 427 women 
aids activists helped start the move to communitybased testing 
and the federal government is preparing to distribute 6 million in 
the fall to groups that want to expand or begin such programs 
p clay stephens an aids services worker from boston attending 
the conference dismissed the oftenheard reasons researchers give 
for excluding women and intravenous drug users the fastest growing 
segment of aids cases from clinical trials they are unreliable 
because they dont always show up for treatments 
well are they not coming in because theyre at their methadone 
clinic thats a very valid place for them to be she said did 
the woman not come in because her child was sick 
those concepts of noncompliance are often covers for our poor 
design based on having dealt with other middleclass people who can 
plan ahead and are in control of their lives in terms of scheduling 
and resources she said 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan whose 
department is sponsoring the conference told the opening session 
that the government and local communities must do a better job 
targeting aids prevention messages to minorities 
he said the messages must be culturally relevant and 
sensitive but he added that community standards must be 
respected in educating about the disease that is often transmitted 
through sexual contact 
as of july 31 the total number of americans diagnosed with aids 
reached 102621 of whom 59391 have died since july 1 1981 
according to the centers for disease control 
blacks who comprise 12 of the us population represent 26 
percent of adult aids cases in the united states and 53 percent of 
pediatric cases he said hispanics who make up 7 percent of the 
nations population represent 15 percent of adult cases and 23 
percent of pediatric cases

industrialist armand hammer pardoned by 
president bush for making illegal campaign contributions to richard 
nixons 1972 campaign says the presidents action reinforces his 
faith in the american legal system 
white house spokesman bob hall confirmed monday night that bush 
had pardoned the 91yearold hammer and nine other people whose 
names were not released the white house usually does not announce 
its action on pardons 
hammer who pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976 released news 
of his pardon in los angeles 
having spent my lifetime fighting injustice this vindication 
reinforces my abiding faith in the american system of justice he 
said in a statement issued monday through his occidental petroleum 
corp i deeply appreciate president bushs action in clearing my 
name 
hammer spent several years seeking a pardon and there had been 
speculation that president reagan would grant one in his last days 
in office 
hammer originally pleaded guilty in washington to a criminal 
information filed by the watergate special prosecutor to three 
misdemeanor charges of making 54000 in illegal contributions to 
the nixon campaign 
but the judge threw out the plea after hammer wrote a 20page 
letter to his probation officer blaming former montana gov tim 
babcock an occidental corp vice president for the contributions 
babcock was convicted of concealing that hammer was the true 
source of the money 
in 1976 hammer left a hospital bed in a wheelchair and hooked to 
a cardiac monitor to enter another plea in a los angeles court 
im pleading because im guilty he told the judge at the 
time 
hammer was sentenced to a years probation and fined 3000 the 
judge said he spared hammer a prison sentence because of his 
precarious health 
hammer was a selfmade millionaire by the time he graduated from 
columbia university medical school at 23 having taken over his 
fathers pharmaceutical business four years earlier 
after graduation hammer went to the soviet union to negotiate a 
business deal and wound up with a concession for an asbestos mine 
and a pencil factory 
proud of having met every soviet leader since lenin hammer has 
devoted much of his fortune to collecting great art research on 
cancer and promoting world peace 
hammers money sent american physicians to treat victims of the 
chernobyl nuclear disaster in the soviet union in 1986

better times on the farm are boosting sales of 
new tractors and other machinery the agriculture department says 
another reason for the increased sales is the relative scarcity 
of good used machines for years because of tight finances farmers 
had to do with what they had thus says the departments economic 
research service many farmers who might be in the used market are 
turning to new models 
sales in all categories of new farm machinery are expected to 
expand in 1989 the agency said in a report farmers appear to 
be continuing a trend toward using larger tractors 
analysts said sales of fourwheeldrive tractors are expected to 
grow the most this year up 65 percent from 1988 followed by a 23 
percent increase for the larger twowheeldrive models those of 
more than 139 horsepower 
sales of combine harvesters and hay balers are also expected to 
gain about 22 percent each this year 
overall farmers are forecast to spend 62 billion to 67 
billion on machinery this year the third consecutive annual 
increase report said last years expenditures rose to 603 
billion from less than 58 billion in 1987 and 46 billion in 1986 
machinery sales rose to a record of almost 12 billion in 1979 
before sliding seven consecutive years to the 1986 level 
weather conditions weakened sales growth in 1988 but are not 
expected to play a significant role this year the report said 
higher net cash income lower real interest rates and reductions 
in outstanding debt began boosting farm machinery expenditures in 
1987 and will continue to increase sales through 1989 
rising land values also are improving farmers financial 
standings enabling them to replace aging farm machinery 
another factor this year is a larger planted acreage triggered 
in part by last years droughtreduced harvests and rising market 
prices of some of the major commodities 
an expansion in planted acres increases the return a farmer 
receives from the machine because it is used on more acres the 
report said furthermore greater planted acreage makes machine 
down time more costly because more acres must be worked within the 
same time frame

a defensive war against africanized honeybees 
has helped slow the northward march of the insects across mexico 
the agriculture department says 
popularly called killer bees by some including movie 
writers the migrating bees were expected to reach the southern 
united states in 1987 or 1988 then maybe 1989 or 1990 
but department officials now say the bees wont reach the rio 
grande valley of southern texas for another 18 months or later 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said monday that a joint project 
with mexico has delayed the bees arrival and should give 
researchers and beekeepers enough time to study the bee and learn 
how to manage it 
the africanized honeybee is the hybrid offspring of european 
honeybees and pure african queen bees brought to brazil in 1956 for 
research the african queens escaped and began interbreeding with 
native honeybees 
africanized bees have been migrating northward since then and 
were found in southern mexico in 1986 today they are about 400 
miles south of the us border near tecolutla veracruz mexico 
although the venom of africanized bees is no more potent than 
that of the european bees that are common throughout the united 
states the hybrids can be more dangerous because of their 
aggressiveness and the likelihood of them stinging in greater 
numbers 
besides the notoriety as a fierce pest around humans and animals 
the africanized honeybee also is feared by many commercial 
beekeepers for what it might do to their industry 
glosser said his agency began working with the mexican government 
two years ago in a cooperative program to control the africanized 
bees 
the program includes the detection and tracking of the bees as 
they near the us border trapping and destruction of swarms to 
reduce their numbers and efforts to alter the bees genetically to 
they pose less of a threat 
program personnel in mexico have hung almost 60000 traps in 
the last 18 months and have caught more than 11000 swarms of 
africanized bees glosser said thats millions of africanized 
bees that will never reach the united states 
the project in mexico also uses requeening to reduce the 
transfer of africanized traits to regular honeybee colonies 
beekeepers are encouraged to select queens from desirable genetic 
stock and mark them with a bright paint so that its easy to tell if 
they are in the hive if an unmarked queen is noted that female is 
replaced with a marked queen known to be of good genetic stock

average of 535 in april the report said 
for workers hired by contractors there was no national wage rate 
available however workers in california were reported at 580 per 
hour compared with 645 in april and 574 a year earlier in july

eastern airlines officials say they are 
changing some of their business procedures after agreeing to pay a 
75000 fine for alleged federal consumer violations 
the department of transportation said monday that the financially 
hobbled carrier agreed to pay the civil penalty to avoid costly 
litigation but was not conceding guilt the alleged violations 
occurred in 1986 and 1987 
it could take the government years to pocket the funds however 
because eastern has been under the protection of federal bankruptcy 
laws since march 9 five days after the strike against the carrier 
began 
when a bankruptcy judge approves a schedule for repaying 
creditors the payments might take years 
the dot charged the airline with taking more than the required 
seven days to issue creditcard refunds to customers it also 
accused eastern of not informing some consumers that flights listed 
by the carrier were operated by independent commuter airlines with 
agreements with eastern 
eastern officials said little about the settlement but 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the company had changed our 
procedures to better comply with dot regulations 
dot officials said eastern uses an express delivery service to 
speed the shipment of refund claims to its miami headquarters 
northwest airlines agreed to pay a 325000 fine in november 
1987 the largest ever continental airlines like eastern a 
subsidiary of texas air corp agreed to pay a 250000 penalty for 
similar charges in june 1987 
eastern filed a reorganization plan with the federal bankruptcy 
court july 21 its goal is to emerge from reorganization by the end 
of this year 
under the agreement with the dot the government would receive 
its payment after all creditors have been repaid but before 
easterns debts to texas air are repaid 
if the agreement isnt approved by the court by nov 30 it would 
be voided and the government would have to renew its efforts to 
press its case against eastern 
sam podberesky a dot assistant general counsel said the fine 
could be repaid in the next few months or could be delayed until 
sometime in the 1990s 
typically he said fines levied against financially healthy 
airlines are paid within anywhere from 15 days to two years claims 
against carriers in bankruptcy can take years he said 
eastern which operated 1100 flights daily before the strike 
operated 350 flights monday and planned to increase that to 390 
tuesday ceremsak said

rep mickey lelands crusade against hunger 
will live on despite his death says house speaker thomas s foley 
but there appears to be no obvious successor to carry the torch 
there will be a determination on the part of members of the 
house to work for those goals that mickey leland sought to achieve 
the alleviation of hunger and suffering here and in africa and 
elsewhere in the world foley said monday 
however foley dwash didnt say who would become chairman of 
the house select committee on hunger the panel leland founded in 
1984 leland a texas democrat died in a plane crash last week 
while on a factfinding mission in ethiopia 
foley aide jeff biggs said a new committee chairman was not 
expected to be named until next month when congress returns from a 
monthlong recess 
lelands efforts were credited with getting 800 million in 
relief for victims of famine in africa 
whenever a member wanted to do something on hunger they would 
go to him miranda katsoyannis chief of staff of the hunger 
committee said monday this committee served as a focus the 
congress became more sensitive as a result 
leland parceled out responsibilities and several members of the 
committee were leaders in specific areas katsoyannis said 
the senior member is rep tony hall dohio who shared lelands 
concern for hunger in the third world rep gary ackerman dny 
another committee member was one of lelands closest associates and 
among the first to go to ethiopia to strengthen search efforts last 
week 
rep byron dorgan dnd is known for his work with the hungry 
of central america while rep mike espy dmiss has been a leader 
in nutrition efforts among the rural poor of the united states rep 
albert bustamante dtexas is known for his work on hunger problems 
among the hispanic poor 
seniority rules dont apply to select committee chairmanships 
which like standing committees are made by the speaker 
select committees dont act on legislation but do initiate 
studies hold hearings and influence other committees to make 
changes or additions to the federal statutes 
select committees at their best offer us a flexibility and a 
sense of focus that we may otherwise not find in our standing 
committees house republican leader bob michel of illinois said 
during debate in february on whether to continue the committees 
leland said during the same debate that his committees work was 
extensive during the 100th congress 
thirtytwo hearings nine basic human needs seminars and 
numerous briefings were held nine reports were published and 
monthly status reports on international and domestic hunger were 
issued and widely distributed he said 
the house select committee on hunger was instrumental in setting 
up the child survival fund part of the us foreign assistance 
program it also provided impetus to expanded research into the 
effects of vitamin a on child mortality

several members of congress are making a new 
bid to curb the pentagons power to stop exports of hightechnology 
goods but defense officials say the limits are needed to keep 
equipment out of communist hands 
rep les aucoin dore and others say the commerce department 
should oversee shipments of goods with both military and civilian 
uses as long as the goods are not being sold to the soviet union 
china or other communistruled countries 
i think it makes sense said rep sam gejdenson dconn who 
heads the subcommittee on international trade in the house foreign 
affairs committee i cant commit myself now but ill be glad to 
look at a proposal 
supporters of the commerce department on the issue include sens 
john heinz rpa and alan j dixon dill and rep doug 
bereuter rneb 
members interested in changing the trade rules worry that the 
defense department is overzealous in blocking exports they see us 
business losing sales to foreign competitors when more sales are 
needed to reduce the trade deficit at the current rate the trade 
deficit will be 111 billion this year 
the defense department however has told the general accounting 
office its work on export licenses has resulted in denial of 
license application to known diverters in pacific basin countries 
at an estimated value of approximately 200 million 
sensitive goods shipped to allies have sometimes reached soviet 
hands the japanese government found that toshiba machine co had 
sold the soviets sophisticated machinery capable of silencing 
submarine propellers at one point some members of congress showed 
their anger by destroying a toshiba radio with hammers on the 
capitol lawn 
when congress returns from vacation next month aucoin and other 
advocates of the change will sound out opinion in both houses 
aucoin represents a district where there are many hightechnology 
companies 
the new effort in congress would not keep the pentagon out of 
decisions on exports that go directly to communistruled countries 
or on exports of purely military goods 
the countries on which the pentagon would continue to have its 
say include cuba hungary bulgaria czechoslovakia poland east 
germany romania alania north korea mongolia vietnam laos and 
cambodia 
the house voted last year to let the commerce department oversee 
exports to noncommunist countries of technology with nonmilitary 
uses but the senate would not go along 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher won a decision from president 
bush against the pentagon last month on a similar issue enabling 
american manufacturers to ship higherpowered computers to the 
soviet union as well as to other countries despite public 
opposition from defense secretary richard cheney 
we did have a difference inside the administration on this 
question bush told reporters at the time this will not 
endanger the legitimate national security needs of this country

the united states pledging to keep talking to 
the palestine liberation organization despite deep policy 
differences says it aims for a mideast agreement with israel that 
promotes palestinian political rights 
a conciliatory statement issued monday in washington and tunisia 
sought to repair the recent rift between the bush administration and 
yasser arafats group while also urging the plo to approve an 
israeli election plan 
the statement by us ambassador robert pelletreau jr said the 
united states seeks a settlement based on israel giving up territory 
in exchange for peace also listed as firm principles in the 
us statement were security and recognition for israel and 
palestinian political rights 
the statement did not say how those rights would be expressed 
our immediate task is to find a practical means to 
translate these principles into political reality it said 
the plo demands a state on the israeliheld west bank and in 
gaza us policy opposes statehood and would have israel and 
palestinians negotiate an arrangement acceptable to both sides 
the palestinians should have a chance to determine their own 
future in negotiations with israel as well as to run their daily 
affairs said a us official who demanded anonymity 
meanwhile richard boucher a state department spokesman pledged 
the united states would keep talking to the plo to try to get 
negotiations started 
we dont expect a breakthrough in each particular meeting 
boucher said in announcing that the talks begun last december had 
resumed in tunisia its an ongoing process 
the department last month accused the plo of attaching 
unacceptable conditions to its provisional approval of an israeli 
proposal for elections on the west bank and in gaza one was the 
demand for statehood 
the bush administration supports the israeli proposal to choose 
elected palestinian representatives for negotiations as the best way 
to get talks started the plo however has denounced the proposal 
as a ploy to block palestinian statehood 
last week the department again criticized arafats organization 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said a statement adopted by fatah the 
main plo faction raised questions about the plos commitment to 
accommodation understanding and peace 
delegates to a fatah meeting in tunis where the plo maintains 
its headquarters had approved a resolution calling for 
intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms of 
battle to put an end to the israeli occupation of palestinian 
territories 
on monday the department took a different approach through both 
spokesman boucher and envoy pelletreau 
boucher said pelletreau had met in tunisia with a plo delegation 
headed by yasser abdrabboo and again sought a positive 
palestinian response to the israeli election proposal 
we continue to believe that through an israelipalestinian 
dialogue progress can be achieved in moving the process forward to 
elections and peace negotiations he said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir while disapproving of us 
talks with the plo proposed elections to select palestinians who 
would negotiate temporary and limited selfrule with israel after 
five years israel palestinians egypt and jordan would negotiate 
an overall settlement of the arabisraeli dispute 
the lengthy statement by pelletreau called mondays session 
serious and probing while offering assurances to the plo that 
the bush administration seeks to foster political rights for 
palestinians 
there is a road to peace in the middle east it said we 
are suggesting that the next but not the last milestone on that 
road is an election in the occupied territories 
in tunis abdrabboo said he expected the discussions to continue 
in the near future and said an international peace conference 
was the best introduction to establish an effective peace

the bush administration is upset that the 
soviet union ignored two highlevel us appeals to change its plans 
to test a longrange missile that passed near the hawaiian islands 
there was no danger but there is always a risk however 
slight a us official said monday after fridays 8000mile 
flight of an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile was 
disclosed 
the missile didnt pass over land while flying over the island 
chain but a us official said the point of the complaint was that 
it was too close for comfort 
the missile was launched from the tyuratam installation deep in 
the soviet union and splashed down some 1250 miles south of oahu 
officials said 
two us officials told the associated press the missile had 
passed over waters between two tiny hawaiian islands neckar and 
nihoa a third official confirmed that the soviets conducted the 
test friday despite us appeals that it posed potential political 
and safety problems 
the soviets announced aug 7 that they intended to conduct a test 
between aug 11 and aug 21 but neither of the two private us 
appeals to deputy ambassador serge chetverikov nor the test itself 
were made public 
its somewhat disturbing the soviets didnt take our concerns 
into account a us official said monday there was no danger 
but there is always a risk however slight it might be that 
something would go awry that is why we felt it was inappropriate 
assistant secretary of state raymond r seitz and his deputy 
curtis w kamman held separate meetings last monday and tuesday 
with chetverikov to complain that the missile was likely to pass 
over the hawaiian island chain before splashing down in the ocean 
seitz and kamman are the senior officers in the state 
departments bureau of european and canadian affairs 
the us government expressed its deep concern to the soviets 
over the planned test and asked that it be modified a us 
official said 
chetverikov returned to the state department on wednesday to say 
the test would be conducted strictly over water not over any us 
territory he said it would involve only international airspace and 
water 
we did not find that response persuasive or sufficient because 
the soviet missile test would pass over the hawaiian island chain

a legal issue but an issue of political and safety considerations 
once again we strongly urged the soviets to reconsider their 
plans 
two years ago in a similar situation the soviets revised a 
missile test near hawaii when the reagan administration objected 
in the us appeals to the soviets the planned test was 
described as a provocation said another us official who also 
requested anonymity

most fronts although there have been recent disagreements over us

tenure marked a steady expansion in ussino relations until the 
massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing is ending his 
tour with meetings and parties 
clues to how the administration and corporate america view china 
two months after troops marched into tianamen square may be found in 
the attendance at ambassador han xus farewell reception at the 
chinese embassy on wednesday 
han has invited an array of officials businessmen academic 
experts and diplomats chinawatchers will size up the 
representation and observe which members of congress on vacation 
for the august recess return to washington for the affair 
president bush said after the tianamen square massacre that 
relations with china were important and that dialogue would continue 
in the hope that chinese leaders would end repression 
however the president said it would not be business as 
usual suspending military and toplevel exchanges 
han 65 has made farewell visits to secretary of state james a 
baker iii four other cabinet members and other senior officials no 
meeting is scheduled with bush who knew han xu when he headed the 
us liaison office in beijing

meeting said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler

preserve and develop uschina relations 
han in meetings with us officials since june has faithfully

said uschina relations had been moving ahead until june but he 
said the united states had continued to communicate with han 
how are you going to tell them youre upset about things if you 
dont talk to them he asked nothing has altered our dismay 
about events but the way to express that view is to have contacts 
at a sufficient level so you know youre getting through

supporters and detractors of richard c breeden 
agree his nomination as chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission could define the bush administrations response to the 
internationalization of financial markets 
president bush on monday named breeden point man on the new 
multibilliondollar plan to bail out the savingsandloan industry 
to head the fivemember sec 
hes an important member of the bush team it seems to me that 
bush has placed a high priority on the sec said lee polson 
executive director of the north american securities administrators 
association a national organization of statelevel securities 
regulators 
joseph r hardiman president of the national association of 
securities dealers said breeden would be one who would be readily 
acceptable to the securities industry and one who would readily 
resolve the issues facing the industry 
the white house announcement ended speculation about a successor 
for sec chairman david s ruder who announced in may that he was 
stepping down 
the sec post requires senate confirmation 
sen christopher j dodd dconn chairman of the securities 
subcommittee said the challenges faced by the commission include 
growing internationalization of financial markets and whether the 
sec will have adequate resources in the 1990s 
i look forward to the committees hearings on mr breeden and 
to the opportunity they will afford to closely examine the bush 
administrations plans in a number of key areas dodd said in a 
statement 
created in 1934 during the depression the sec oversees 
securities markets and regulates the sale of stocks bonds and other 
securities as part of its mission to keep the markets honest while 
protecting investors 
most recently breeden served as one of the architects of the sampl 
restructuring legislation submitted in february and guided it 
through congress the final plan a sweeping rewrite of banking laws 
and the largest singleindustry government bailout was signed into 
law by bush last week 
securities industry leaders and republicans generally hailed 
bushs choice but some senate democrats were less enthusiastic 
i think its a splendid appointment said roderick m hills 
a former sec chairman under president ford 
its going to be a very hard time at the commission in these 
next few years said hills now in private legal practice in new 
york the focus is going to be different our companies are going 
to seek capital abroad and foreign companies are going to be seeking 
capital here 
sen donald w riegle jr chairman of the senate banking 
committee also praised breedens intelligence and work on the 
savings and loan bailout but said he brings a limited direct 
market experience to this critical assignment and that is a matter 
of some concern when the sec faces a time of epic challenge 
breeden a 39yearold lawyer and banking specialist said 
through an aide he will not speak with reporters until after his 
senate confirmation 
breeden whose job as presidential assistant for issues analysis 
made him something of a white house trouble shooter also helped 
fashion administration policy for dealing with the alaska oil spill 
breeden was deputy counsel to vice president bush from 1982 to 
1985 
earlier he was a securities specialist with a new york law firm 
and between government assignments worked in the washington office 
of a houston law firm 
he was also directed a task force on deregulation headed by bush 
as vice president and wrote the panels report on the deregulation 
of financial services 
but polson said he saw no irony in a former deregulators 
appointment to a major regulatory agency 
when chairman ruder was picked he was widely characterized as 
a deregulator too said polson i dont think its useful in 
determining how hes going to perform as chairman of the sec 
bush announced he would nominate breeden to the commission seat 
held by charles c cox whose term has expired after breedens 
confirmation by the senate bush would immediately designate breeden 
as the new chairman 
ruder said monday he plans to resign effective sept 30 unless 
breeden is confirmed before that his resignation would create 
another vacancy on the commission

the bush administration says a breakthrough on 
negotiations for the release of american hostages in lebanon most 
likely is months away 
we think generally the progress has been significant white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday 
however fitzwater said he would not equate progress on the 
diplomatic front with the eventual release of the hostages 
those two elements are a long way apart so i would not compare 
the two he said 
fitzwater said the united states had gleaned considerable 
amounts of information from contacts with other countries asked 
if information was being received from iran he replied from all 
sources 
the united states does not have diplomatic relations with iran 
but has been communicating through thirdparty contacts such as the 
swiss government 
asked what he meant by significant progress fitzwater said 
were not prepared to say but it is in the general issue of 
understanding the problem better improving relations and hopefully 
to get some kind of break down the road 
i think were looking at a longterm situation months not 
weeks 
fitzwater declined comment on a statement by irans spiritual 
leader ayatollah ali khamenei that iran will never hold talks with 
the united states shortly before khamenei made his statement iran 
renewed an offer to help free the hostages 
fitzwater said the contradictory statements typifies why we 
would not like to react to every comment that is made

his voice which is similar to his fathers from now on will be 
heard on songs that are a lot more raw and a lot more opinionated 
lyrically 
ive used my shyness in the past to avoid issues and keep my 
opinions quiet im not tired of being nice but there is more to me 
than that he said 
lennon hopes his third album mr jordan will help him 
recover from his second album the secret value of daydreaming 
which he called a disaster 
lennons first album valotte won him a grammy nomination 
for best new artist 
lennon said that during the the 1986 release of daydreaming 
he was pressured and contractually obligated to write a hit in a 
short period of time 
since then he said he changed management and stopped doing 
drugs 
im not the dumb kid i was two years ago he says a lot of 
decisions hadnt been made in my best interest and i felt like i 
was being packaged in one way it was because of my ignorance and 
naivete i havent got a cent of what i earned from my first two

outrage over drugrelated crime has spawned 
calls for more police and prisons but a school for judges hopes to 
teach jurists to wage war on drugs with treatment rather than tough 
jail terms 
the national judicial college is launching an instructional 
program to show judges how to handle criminals who have drug 
problems 
theres an onslaught of drugrelated cases coming into the 
courts right now across the country said thomas russell 
assistant dean of the renobased institution 
what were trying to do is teach judges patterns of drug use 
and about evaluation and treatment programs so they dont just order 
criminals to be locked up every time 
one judge in each state has been invited to enroll in the 
inaugural oneweek program which begins sunday russell said at 
least 44 judges selected by each states chief judge plan to attend 
the course will become a regular offering next march at the 
judicial college whose alumni range from local judges to supreme 
court justice sandra day oconnor 
the school offers short courses mostly lasting one to four 
weeks they range from basic instruction for new appointees to the 
bench to retraining for experienced jurists the private school 
located on the university of nevadas reno campus is funded by 
state and federal grants as well as tuition 
chicago circuit court judge michael getty one of the main 
instructors for next weeks course said he aims to teach jurists to 
recognize when it would be better to sentence a criminal to 
treatment instead of prison time 
neither the penitentiary nor probation by themselves are an 
adequate response to this countrys drug crimes problems getty 
said 
in chicago for example getty said judges sometimes sentence 
nonviolent criminals who have drug problems to residential or 
nonresidential treatment programs along with community service 
the recidivism rate for treatment programs is not as high as if 
you send them to prison he said from that point of view these 
types of programs are a tremendous success 
that message appears to stand in contrast to increasingly 
strident calls for tougher law enforcement 
last week us attorney general dick thornburgh outlined the 
bush administrations 1 billion crimefighting package including 
harsher penalties for the criminal use of guns ending plea 
bargaining in such cases hiring more investigators and prosecutors 
and doubling space in federal prisons 
getty said drugusing criminals who commit violent crimes must 
pay through incarceration 
im not advocating that all drug offenders not go to prison 
he said but there are a significant number who ought to be placed 
in treatment programs rather than prisons 
according to the national conference of state legislatures 62 
percent of the 605000 people in state and federal prisons in 1988 
used drugs regularly before they were incarcerated 
of those 27 percent used drugs daily according to donna 
hunzeker criminal justice program manager for the national 
lawmakers group twentytwo percent were under the influence of 
drugs while committing the crime for which they were sentenced to 
prison she added 
the studies show that drug use accelerates criminal behavior 
ms hunzeker said 
russell the assistant dean said he hopes that by treating 
people for drug problems crime can be reduced 
part of the solution to reducing the high crime rate is to find 
the problems and deal directly with them russell said the role 
of the judge will be to recognize when the problem is drugs

a panamanian bank was ordered to pay the united 
states canada and switzerland a record 5 million fine after 
pleading guilty to federal charges that it laundered 411 million 
for a south american cocaine cartel 
banco de occidente of panama where two managers allegedly 
conspired with the medillin cartel entered its guilty plea monday 
before us district judge william c okelley 
the 5 million fine was the largest ever imposed by a federal 
court against a bank for drugmoney laundering said us attorney 
robert l barr jr the conviction was the first of its kind 
involving a foreign bank with no us operations 
the guilty plea resulted from a plea bargain between prosecutors 
and the bank which had faced a maximum penalty of fines totaling 
105 million and forfeiture of an amount equal to assets identified 
as cocaine proceeds 
canada and switzerland which helped in the twoyear 
investigation dubbed operation polar cap each will receive 1 
million of the fine attorney general dick thornburgh announced in 
washington the finesharing arrangement was the first of its kind 
thornburgh said 
this international cooperation in the war against drugs sends a 
message to drug traffickers everywhere that it is going to be harder 
for them to hide their illgotten profits and easier for us to 
recover them attorney general dick thornburgh said 
the bank pled guilty because of the activities of two people in 
one branch office said william richey of miami an attorney for 
the bank 
richey said drugprofit transfers slipped through the bank 
unnoticed because the bank exists to transfer funds its a trade 
bank 
according to prosecutors the general manager and a commercial 
manager at a banco de occidente of panama branch were bribed by 
members of the medellin cartel the colombian ring reportedly 
accounts for up to 80 percent of the cocaine entering the united 
states 
the bank is a subsidiary of banco de occidente of cali colombia 
the money was sent out of the united states and laundered 
through wire transfers transactions used routinely to exchange 
large sums of money 
to conceal cocaine profits the money launderers posing as 
jewelry dealers exchanged goldpainted lead bars among themselves 
to generate phony gold bullion transactions assistant us attorney 
wilmer parker iii said during mondays hearing 
parker said informants and undercover us drug enforcement 
administration agents posing as money launderers penetrated the 
medellin cartel and met several times with its leaders 
the significance of this case cannot be overestimated said 
barr we have dealt a significant blow certainly not a death 
knell but a significant blow to the ability of the cartel to meet 
its major problem in this country what to do with the vast 
amounts of cash 
the bank pleaded guilty to one count of aiding cocaine 
trafficking through money laundering and to one count of conspiracy 
to defraud the united states 
acting under the agreement the bank on monday paid by check the 
2 million of the fine being split by canada and switzerland the 
bank agreed to pay the remaining 3 million over the next four years 
okelley noted that banco de occidente of panama lists a net 
worth of only about 7 million 
he said the fine represented a substantial share of the banks 
capital the court has some question as to the ability of the bank 
to survive a penalty more severe the judge said 
the general manager william guarin and the commercial manager 
clara garcia remain under indictment 
part of the fine will be applied to a special federal fund 
allowing the money to be used for prison construction and antidrug 
expenses 
under legislation enacted in 1986 the united states can seize 
property owned or under the control of narcotics traffickers even 
when the actual profits are no longer available for seizure 
moving the assets of illegal drug trafficking out of one bank 
account and into another can no longer cover up the illegal act 
thornburgh said it is like fingerprints that cannot be brushed 
away

mickey lelands widow could take over her 
husbands house seat almost without opposition but some politicians 
are pondering a race for the post if she chooses not to run 
observers say 
so many people know her personally and out of respect for 
mickey and her she could walk in jack carter harris county 
democratic party chairman said of alison leland 
in the great southern tradition its the wife who would come 
forward said robert stein a political science professor at rice 
university if mickey lelands wife is in there youre not going 
to have anyone running against her 
mrs leland is a 30yearold investment banker with shearson 
lehman hutton observers also noted that she is two months pregnant 
and has a 3yearold son 
i would think her first concern is her health and child 
stein said 
members of lelands family have remained in seclusion since the 
wreckage of his plane was found sunday in a remote area of ethiopa 
she is a very strong young woman but she has been badly 
shaken said the rev william lawson a family friend all in 
all she has been extremely courageous and she has taken it 
extremely well 
gov bill clements has not made a decision on a special election 
date it must be held on or before nov 7 
if mrs leland chose to succeed her husband she would not be the 
first 
in october 1972 a plane carrying hale boggs a louisiana 
democrat and then house majority leader crashed in alaska boggs 
wife lindy was elected to his seat in 1973 and continues to serve 
if mrs leland chooses not to run for the seat three houston 
councilmen with ties to leland are among the most likely candidates 
observers said 
rodney ellis a former top leland aide and close friend was 
viewed as the strongest candidate stein said other potential 
aspirants include anthony hall a friend who lost a 1978 runoff 
against leland and ben reyes another leland friend who went to 
ethiopia to be close to the search 
everybody in houston is reluctant to discuss this out of 
respect for mickey and his family carter said but the 
practical side is that of the people who have looked at the district 
before the two named most are hall and ellis 
ellis is out of his office this week and has not discussed 
running for the seat said rhonda belt his office coordinator hall 
said it was inappropriate to comment on a possible race this soon

gary dotson finally cleared of a rape that his 
onetime accuser later said she invented says hes bitter over the 
agony the legal system put him through 
its a good system but mistakes happen dotson said monday 
after a judge overturned his conviction i have my bitterness 
yes it has been hard to deal with 
after the judge acted prosecutors dropped charges that could 
have led to a new trial saying they could not win the case again 
as the hearing ended dotson turned and smiled at his relatives 
in the audience then heaved a sigh of relief 
its over dotson told reporters as they say this is the 
first day of the rest of my life 
dotson was convicted in 1979 of the rape and aggravated 
kidnapping of cathleen crowell webb and was sentenced to 25 to 50 
years in prison dotson had served six years of the sentence when 
mrs webb now a harrisville nh homemaker said she invented the 
1977 attack because she feared she had become pregnant by her 
boyfriend 
i forgave her a long time ago ive no animosity against her 
dotson said as far as im concerned today my name has been 
cleared 
mrs webbs attorney john mclario said she was pleased with the 
dismissal of charges and wondered why something like this wasnt 
done long ago 
she trusts that it will be put to rest and she naturally wishes 
the best for gary mclario said she is very sorry for the part 
she had in this unfortunate situation when she came forward in 1985 
she never anticipated it would be a fouryear odyssey 
circuit judge thomas r fitzgerald granted dotson a new trial 
based on genetic tests which prove his semen could not have made the 
stain in mrs webbs underpants the key in his conviction 
prosecutor gayle shines moved to dismiss the charges against him 
citing conflicts in mrs webbs statements and the difficulty in 
disputing the genetic test ms shines also said it was uncertain 
that dotson would have to spend more time in jail if convicted again 
ms shines said the state absolutely does not owe dotson an 
apology 
he was tried by a jury of his peers she said i dont 
believe a mistake was made 
but dotsons attorney thomas breen said the only conclusion was 
that dotson was falsely convicted 
garys going to have to live with the horror of knowing that he 
was incarcerated all those years for a crime he never committed 
breen said 
dotson 32 who married and became a father since his release 
was paroled last august after recurring minor problems with the law 
returned him to prison 
he has two months left in an alcohol and drug treatment center 
and said the program has changed his life 
its hard for us to take a look at ourselves dotson said 
i feel more confident in myself for the first time in 12 years i 
can take responsibility for my own actions 
he plans to attend college this fall and train to be a drug and 
alcohol counselor he said 
when mrs webb recanted her testimony gov james r thompson 
granted dotson clemency saying his punishment had been sufficient 
but the governor refused to pardon dotson saying he did not believe 
ms webbs reversal 
i wish him well thompson said after mondays hearing i 
hope he will be able to conquer his alcohol dependency and live a 
normal and productive life

a judge ruled that genetic tests linking a 
doublemurder suspect to a slain pregnant woman and her toddler are 
inadmissible as evidence at trial 
state supreme court justice gerald sheindlin on monday urged 
lawyers in previous dna cases to reexamine their trial records to 
see if appeals were warranted on the basis of his opinion believed 
to be the first of its kind 
genetic tests have been used in at least 80 cases of rape and 
murder in 27 states 
sheindlin found that a genetic testing company lifecodes corp 
had failed to properly perform dna tests 
the tests were ordered after joseph castro who is charged with 
killing a pregnant woman and her 2yearold daughter told police in 
a statement that blood found on his wristwatch was his 
experts witnesses concluded that the blood on the watch was not 
castros blood but said the tests showing the blood was that of the 
slain woman were not conducted properly 
sheindlin said the flaws made the lifecodes test inadmissible as 
evidence 
the testing laboratory failed in several major respects to use 
the generally accepted scientific techniques and experiments for 
obtaining reliable results within a reasonable degree of scientific 
certainty the judge said 
ed mccarthy a spokesman for district attorney robert johnson in 
the bronx borough said the prosecution conceded there was a flaw in 
the testing 
vilma ponce and her daughter were murdered on feb 5 1987 a 
trial date has been set for sept 11

engineers will get their first look at the 
damaged hull of the exxon valdez after the crippled tanker goes into 
drydock for a ninemonth repair job 
the exxon valdez was scheduled to be moved during the afternoon 
high tide today from pier 6 at the national steel and shipbuilding 
co to the dock from which it was launched in 1986 said nassco 
spokeswoman debby torbol 
actual repairs were likely to begin in september because it will 
take time to remove water from the repair dock so the ship can be 
examined in detail 
i suspect there will be a twoweek period in which the only 
people in there will be lawyers and engineers said nassco senior 
vice president al lutter 
repair costs are estimated at 25 million but the shipyards 
director of support services dick grothen said the price tag could 
change after a thorough inspection of the damage 
dockmaster frank russell a veteran of more than 40 dockings 
said he will coordinate the vessels movement by using up to eight 
tugs while monitoring the tankers position through a team of divers 
and surveying instruments 
the 166foot wide valdez which spilled about 11 million gallons 
of crude in alaskan waters when it hit a reef march 24 in prince 
william sound must squeeze inside a dock with just three feet of 
clearance 
its the first time nassco has done this russell said 
exxon shipping co officials have said they plan to return the 
987footlong tanker to service possibly under a different name 
after repairs are completed 
nearly onethird of the ships bottom either is gone or has been 
severely weakened and 24 brackets had to be welded to the hull so 
the tanker wouldnt collapse under its own weight in drydock 
after being towed 2000 miles from prince william sound the 
exxon valdez waited offshore for three weeks after officials 
detected oil slicks around it before the ship could navigate the 
42footdeep channel of san diego bay divers removed massive steel 
slabs that dangled from the hull as far as 70 feet below the surface 
the ship finally arrived at nassco on july 31 
though booms have remained in place since then to contain 
possible spills nassco officials say no discharges or slicks have 
appeared

the chief of the abenaki indians said a 
judges decision to grant the group fishing rights is one step 
toward winning back land claimed by the tribe 
this victory is for fishing rights said tribal chief homer 
st francis now well be fighting for our land 
the ruling by vermont district judge joseph wolchik recognized 
the abenakis aboriginal fishing rights dating back 11000 years 
it dismissed fish and game violations filed two years ago by the 
state against several tribe members the state contended the 
tribespeople had no right to fish without the state license required 
of other people 
the abenakis number about 2500 and live primarily in 
northwestern vermont 
wolchik said the state failed to prove the tribe abandoned or 
ceded their missisquoi homeland or that their aborginal rights were 
extinguished by either an express act or an act clearly and 
unambiguously implying any sovereigns intent to extinguish those 
rights 
accordingly the missisquois aborginal right to fish in their 
missisquoi homeland continues to exist today he wrote 
although the ruling dealt only with the issue of fishing rights 
gabor rona the tribes lawyer said what makes this so monumental 
for the abenakis is that the issues the court needed to address and 
did address in this fishing case are precisely the same as would be 
addressed in a land claim 
but it was not clear whether the special status that wolchik 
granted the tribe would translate into anything more than the right 
to fish 
the judge found the abenakis do not meet the federal definition 
of a dependent indian community a finding that could impact any 
future land claims 
the available evidence leads this court to conclude that 
neither the missisquoi homeland or any part of it is indian 
country the judge said the thrust of the evidence is that the 
missiquoi community is thoroughly mixed if not blended into the 
nonnative american community 
andrew eschen an assistant attorney general said that while the 
abenakis had contested the states criminal jurisdiction over the 
tribe wolchik found the state does have jurisdiction 
st francis said he would push through the united nations for 
total autonomy for the tribe 
the abenakis trace their tribe back to 9300 bc in recent 
decades they have begun pushing to assert their right over land in 
northern vermont 
the fight has split the tribe itself with one faction favoring 
more militant stands such as tribal courts schools and law 
enforcement that faction led by st francis is in power today 
the case originated in 1987 when abenakis held a fishin on the 
banks of the missisquoi river in swanton more than 30 people were 
charged with fishing without a license or failure to display a 
license

authorities took into custody today a 
south korean student and a new yorkeducated korean priest who 
crossed the border from north korea to dramatize national 
unification efforts 
twentyyearold im sukyong nicknamed the flower of 
unification held the hand of the rev moon gyuhyon as they 
crossed the border at panmunjom officials said 
ms im and moon were taken into immediate custody and flown to 
seoul by police helicopter where she was reportedly sneaked into 
seoul national university hospital for a checkup and is expected 
later today to be turned over to the national intelligence agency 
the hospital would not confirm the report but it was ringed by 
riot police who blocked the entrance of reporters the priest was 
under arrest officials said 
government officials said ms im and the priest would be charged 
with violating national security laws for making illegal trips to an 
enemy country 
the two were detained by south korean officers assigned to the 
un command as soon as they walked across the border at panmunjom 
the truce village in the demilitarized zone separating the two 
koreas officials said 
the united nations a signatory to the 1953 korean armistice that 
ended their bloody war has jurisdiction over the southern half of 
the truce village 
speaking to a rally of about 70 people in the northern sector of 
panmunjom ms im said her return across the border was intended to 
promote the reunification of the korean peninsula divided since 
1945 the officials said 
i hope my act will contribute to advance the unification of 
south and north korea she was quoted as saying korea is one 
forever and we must work to unify our fatherland 
north korean news reports received in tokyo said the south korean 
radical student was cheered by tens of thousands of people today 
when she left the border town of kaesong for the truce village 
taking into consideration the firm determination of ms im to 
return to south korea with ardent desire for unification our side 
decided to open the door of our area at panmunjom and will 
thoroughly guarantee their safety the north korean reports said 
in seoul about 1000 people including about a dozen foreigners 
marched in downtown seoul shouting drive out yankees who block 
unification and safe passage for miss im the unification 
flower 
south korean officials said about 3000 riot police were deployed 
along the road leading to panmunjom to block a possible attempt by 
radical students and dissidents to march to the border 
in a speech marking koreas liberation from japan president roh 
taewoo asked that the communist north immediately resume all 
channels of suspended dialogue 
north korea must realize that the only thing they can gain by 
agitating the extremists and radicals within our society and by 
enticing a few of them to secretly visit pyongyang is the abhorrence 
of our people roh said 
dialogue between the two koreas has been sporadic but meetings 
have been held the last year in an effort to improve relations the 
talks however bogged down after secret trips to the north by a 
south korean dissident clergyman a lawmaker and the student ms im

a man found guilty of murder 
counterfeiting and west virginias largest bank heist had been 
convicted only once before this summer but the courts decided he 
was no stranger to crime 
judges on monday bypassed a federal act under which john p mccoy 
could have been eligible for leniency and gave him the stiffest 
sentence in the memory of prosecutors in southern west virginia 
us district judge charles haden ii sentenced mccoy to life in 
prison plus 43 years on robbery murder jail escape and 
murderforhire charges 
mr mccoy is certainly one of the most if not the most 
dangerous criminal in the district us attorney michael carey 
said there are other people who have had the potential but hes 
the one who had it all come up in the same summer 
mccoy 43 was convicted in june of staging west virginias 
largest bank robbery and with killing a federal witness 
in july he and his girlfriend were found guilty in a 
counterfeiting plot that made 800000 in bad bills 
this month he and three others were convicted in a jailescape 
and murderforhire scheme 
he told preposterous stories to three separate juries hes a 
pathological liar said assistant us attorney ben bryant 
theres no act that this man wouldnt do this man should set no 
foot in public for the rest of his life 
federal judge robert staker who handled the counterfeiting 
trial imposed a nineyear sentence to run concurrent with hadens 
penalty mccoy of slaters branch ky was fined a total of 
262500 
the mccoy case challenged the limits of the sentencing guidelines 
act of 1987 established to help trim jail populations and grant 
leniency to newcomers to the world of crime 
mccoy with only a 1982 mail fraud conviction behind him began 
the summer eligible for leniency under the guidelines 
the sentence imposed by haden is the stiffest in memory in 
southern west virginia carey said the district doesnt have 
complete records on sentencings 
mccoy maintained his innocence and claimed bryant had a vendetta 
against him because he used legal knowledge gained in prison to help 
others 
in addition to robbing the matewan national bank branch at 
kermit mccoy was convicted of intimidating federal witnesses and of 
killing russell davis an accomplice in the robbery in 1987 
coconspirator harold d boonie runyon 39 of forest hill 
ky pleaded guilty to the killing and testified for the government 
against mccoy runyon was sentenced last month to life plus five 
years 
mccoy and his girlfriend debbie farley 36 used a color 
photocopying maching to make what federal agents said were 
relatively poor copies of us and canadian currency 
mccoy and three others including his 21yearold son kennis 
were convicted two weeks ago of hiring a man to kill witnesses and 
family members no one was killed or injured mccoy also was 
convicted of concocting a jailescape plot that failed

the official communist party daily pravda today 
blasted extremists and growing nationalist hysteria in the 
baltic region for labor unrest that is now its seventh day in 
estonia 
openly antisoviet groups have become activized in the three 
baltic republics and a situation is building up of nationalist 
hysteria the newspaper said in an unsigned commentary 
in two other soviet areas threatened by labor unrest the 
caucasus republics of georgia and azerbaijan officials said today 
that all was quiet 
estonias communist party chief called monday for russian workers 
in his tiny republic to end the strike and negotiate differences 
but in the estonian capital of tallinn strike committee member 
mikhail lysenko said today that thousands of russian workers at 
about 50 factories stayed off the job to protest a new law that 
tightens residency requirements for voters and candidates 
pravda aimed its criticism at the law rather than the strikers 
saying the passage of discriminatory acts has an extremely 
destabilizing influence on the political situation 
pravdas comments reflected moscows unease with the grassroots 
nationalist movements that have swept the baltic republics of 
estonia latvia and lithuania 
the movements known as peoples fronts have moved from focusing 
on support for president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms to narrow 
nationalist positions pravda said 
it complained that the fronts had taken to attacking the 
communist party for neglecting the interests of nonrussian 
populations and that certain forces were pushing for complete 
secession from the soviet union 
pravda also criticized the baltic movements for sending 
emissaries around the country to spread their ideas and using 
foreign ties more and more often for the same destructive goals 
it proposed political dialogue as the only means of defusing the 
situation 
estonian party chief vaino vyalyas said monday that dialogue had 
not succeeded in resolving the strike but that he was not ready to 
give up 
we met with strike committee representatives and they later 
said they were not satisfied with the results if so lets continue 
the talks vyalyas said in an estonian television interview 
staterun moscow radio said the estonian law will take the right 
to vote away from more than 100000 nonestonians in the republic of 
16 million people 
the new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the same 
district for two years or anywhere in estonia for five years 
candidates must live in the same place for five years or in estonia 
for 10 years 
vyalyas admitted the rights of estonias minorities whom he did 
not identify but presumably including russians had not been taken 
into account this is our mistake and it must be corrected he 
said 
estonians say residence requirements for voters and candidates 
are legitimate measures used around the world 
but one strike leader said if americans had a similar law they 
would have to wait five years to be able to vote after moving from 
one state to another 
the strike has already cost millions of dollars moscow radio 
said 
the striking russians most of whom work in heavy industrial 
plants also object to a new national decision to give estonia free 
rein over its economy the workers are demanding that factories with 
a predominantly russianspeaking labor force remain the property of 
the national government rather than be handed over to estonia

a navy petty officer has filed suit to 
collect the 100000 life insurance benefit of a shipmate who died 
as a result of the april 19 gunturret blast aboard the uss iowa 
the lawsuit filed monday in us district court in miami seeks 
payment of a 50000 doubleindemnity policy to kendall truitt from 
amex life assurance co of san rafael calif according to ellis 
rubin of miami truitts attorney 
truitt now stationed at mayport naval station near jacksonville 
is the sole beneficiary of the policy held by his fellow gunners 
mate clayton hartwig one of 47 sailors killed in the iowa 
explosion 
the life insurance company has refused to pay the claim on 
hartwigs death until the navy completes its investigation into the 
accident rubin said 
they are waiting for the navys report and they said the navy 
is indicating they have circumstantial evidence that it might have 
been a suicide rubin said 
amex a division of american express would not comment on the 
lawsuit 
amex had two months to pay the benefit from the filing of the 
loss which occurred june 12 rubin said 
i think they will settle with us as soon as the navy report 
does not reach the conclusion there was a suicide and it wont 
rubin said 
we are very upset that the navy report is taking so long to 
come out either the navy is planning a whitewash or a coverup i 
dont know which of the two thats why it is taking so long 
rubin said 
news reports after the explosion indicated that investigators 
suspicious of the life insurance policy at one point were focusing 
on truitt but rubin said in june that naval investigative service 
agents had apologized to his client for news leaks suggesting that 
truitt was involved in the explosion 
last month nbc news reported that the navy had determined that 
the explosion aboard the iowa was the result of sabotage by a 
suicidal sailor 
nbc said the navy investigation reached that decision after 
ruling out mechanical malfunctions accidental detonation 
electrical flaws and all other technical causes for the explosion 
navy spokesman lt greg smith said july 19 that the conclusion of 
suicide was not based on official reports of the navy

flag but a us senator said there was political pressure to agree 
to the measure 
the 200yearold former home of the supreme court was the setting 
monday for the senate judiciary committees second hearing on what 
action if any should be taken in response to the supreme courts 
june decision that flag burning represents protected political 
speech 
the bush administration and leading republicans in congress 
support a constitutional amendment that would permit states to 
outlaw destruction of the flag 
but a philadelphiabased federal judge and two constitutional 
historians asked the committee monday to show restraint 
flag burning while carrying powerful emotional weight is not a 
serious enough offense to merit the curtailment of freespeech 
protections said federal judge louis pollak the former dean of the 
university of pennsylvania law school 
i urge you not to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the bill 
of rights not to celebrate that anniversary by submitting a 
proposed amendment which would dilute protections of the first 
amendment pollak said 
the session was considered an official judiciary panel hearing 
even though sen arlen specter rpa and chairman joseph biden 
ddel were the only members present the hearing was held at the 
200yearold former city hall which housed the us supreme court 
from 1791 until 1800 
fiftythree senators have agreed to sponsor a constitutional 
amendment specter said noting that there is a considerable 
political downside to not going along since so many americans 
were outraged by the high court ruling 
i confess to being one of those who was indignant at the court 
decision specter said still specter said he would prefer that 
congress simply pass a bill outlawing flag desecration biden agreed 
proponents of the amendment argue that such a sweeping statement 
is needed because a bill might not pass constitutional muster with 
the high court an amendment would require a twothirds majority 
vote in the house and senate and ratification by threequarters of 
the states 
i would like to see the congress of the united states take the 
third option of doing nothing pollak said doing nothing may be 
the hardest of the options the judge said 
specter replied i disagree with you judge pollak that doing 
nothing may be the hardest thing to do we are experts at that 
law professor stanley kutler of the university of wisconsin and 
history professor michael parrish of the university of 
californiasan diego urged congress not to overreact 
kutler compared the flag issue to prohibition which came about 
with the 18th amendment and was later repealed in both cases he 
said emotion ruled

frederik w de klerk has 
stirred both hope and doubt about his ability to lead south africa 
toward a peaceful solution of its racial conflicts 
the 53yearold education minister who was sworn in today in 
pretoria as acting president is known as an affable pragmatist who 
seeks to avoid ideological labels 
he became leader of the governing national party in february 
narrowly defeating a cabinet colleague in a parliamentary party 
caucus 
our goal is a new south africa a totally changed south africa 
he told parliament at the time white domination insofar as it 
still exists must go 
later de klerk said white security can never be built on 
injustice toward others things will have to change drastically and 
quickly 
after several years of black protests and increasing world 
sanctions against south africa during pw bothas rule many whites 
saw de klerk as representing a new and more conciliatory generation 
of national party leaders 
they welcomed the vision of a nation in which as he put it 
all reasonable people align themselves behind mutually acceptable 
goals 
helen suzman who pioneered antiapartheid views among parliament 
members said of de klerk people are being too optimistic if they 
think he is going to throw fundamental policy overboard but i think 
hes pragmatic and intelligent he realizes that change is 
absolutely inevitable 
black leaders said they suspect de klerk will pursue largely 
cosmetic changes their suspicions were strengthened by his refusal 
to accept a oneman onevote system that would give power to the 
black majority and by the national partys platform for general 
elections sept 6 
the platform supports the idea of group social and political 
rights which has helped preserve segregated neighborhoods and 
schools under the apartheid system of racial separation 
de klerk practiced law before entering parliament in 1973 he 
held several cabinet posts beginning in 1978 and in 1982 took the 
powerful job of national party leader in the transvaal south 
africas most populous and wealthiest province 
he is married with three children and his wife marike once 
described him as a charmer with many broken hearts left after 
him 
fw as he likes to be called comes from a long line of 
politicians beginning with his greatgrandfather a senator his 
brother willem quit as editor of rapport the largest 
afrikaanslanguage newspaper after being criticized for 
increasingly liberal views on race reform 
the brothers have differed over politics but have said they 
never let those differences affect their close family relationship 
south african analysts picture de klerk as a centrist careful 
not to alienate either conservatives or liberals in the national 
party 
if as expected the party wins the sept 6 elections de klerk 
will become president with the same task as botha to meet black 
demands for civil rights and still reassure the minority whites 
their way of life will not be destroyed 
tom sebina of the banned african national congress guerrilla 
movement said recently de klerk and botha are pieces of the same 
carcass if the meat is bad the meat is bad

a marine has filed a 55 million suit against the 
us navy charging that malpractice forced his wife to have a blood 
transfusion that left her infected with aids which she passed on to 
him and their son 
martin gaffney 40 a chief warrant officer at the south weymouth 
naval air station contends that navy doctors mishandled his wifes 
pregnancy in 1981 resulting in a stillbirth and the need for a 
transfusion 
at the time little was known about aids and donated blood was 
not routinely screened for the virus but gaffneys suit which is 
scheduled to go to trial aug 21 in federal court says the 
transfusion would not have been needed had doctors properly treated 
his wife mutsuko 
mrs gaffney died of aids in 1987 shortly after the lawsuit was 
filed the gaffneys son johnny was born with aids and died in 
1986 at the age of 13 months 
the only member of the family to be spared infection was their 
6yearold daughter maureene gaffney himself has tested positive 
for the virus although he has not yet shown any symptoms 
marianne bowler an assistant us attorney who is representing 
the navy declined to comment on the case 
gaffneys attorney jaclyn mckenney said navy investigators 
traced one of the units of blood that mutsuko gaffney received to a 
discharged marine 
a deposition from the blood donor identified as john doe in 
court records shows he has refused to be tested for aids because he 
fears the result might prevent him from getting jobs and health 
insurance 
mrs gaffney was under the care of doctors at long beach naval 
hospital in california when she delivered the stillborn baby four 
weeks overdue the doctors had declined to induce labor earlier or 
to perform a caesarian section to deliver the baby the lawsuit says

environmental activists from massachusetts to 
california took to the treetops to voice their opposition to logging 
in the countrys remaining virgin timberlands 
protesters set up camps in trees to coincide with the first of 
four hearings by the us fish and wildlife service on its proposal 
to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species 
environmentalists say the owl requires oldgrowth forests for its 
habitat the forestproducts industry says many logging and mill 
jobs would be lost if the owl is protected by setting aside forest 
in protected zones 
this is obviously spotted owl week throughout the northwest 
said darryl cherney an earth first spokesman involved in the 
protests near ukiah calif the timber crisis is culminating to 
such an extent right now that nows the time for action 
earth first known for putting spikes in trees to discourage 
logging said its aerial occupations had protesters sitting on 
3by6foot platforms suspended in trees they were equipped with 
food water and other gear and supported by ground crews cherney 
said 
the protests began sunday or monday in washington oregon 
california colorado new mexico and massachusetts cherney said 
others were planned in british columbia georgia and montana some 
protesters said they were prepared to stay in the trees for weeks 
jay ward 31 lodged himself 50 feet high in an evergreen outside 
us sen mark hatfields office in portland ore he said he had 
enough food and water to last at least four days 
portland was the site monday of the first hearing at which a top 
official in the us forest service said the spotted owl can survive 
without being listed as a threatened species under federal wildlife 
protection law 
hal salwasser deputy director for wildlife and fisheries said 
his agency is managing timberlands with the aim of ensuring the 
owls longterm survival 
although the hearings were supposed to center on the biological 
concerns of the owl many loggers testified about the economic 
consequences they feared if logging is restricted federal judges 
already have halted timber sales in the region because of lawsuits 
filed by environmentalists 
to tell you the truth im scared to death said scott hall 
as he held his 3yearold son adam in his arms hall a 
superintendent for high cascade lumber in skamania county wash 
said his mill is expected to run out of logs and jobs in 
november 
cherney said the demonstrations were not just about the spotted 
owl but included concerns over forest resources in general 
if someones sitting in a secondgrowth tree our message is 
let some of these secondgrowth forests become oldgrowth forests 
he said 
in washingtons mount bakersnoqualmie national forest three 
demonstrators climbed trees in the goodman ridge timber sale in an 
attempt to stop logging said janine blaeloch an earth first 
spokeswoman in seattle 
gary cordova a forest service spokesman in portland said he 
knew of no agency policy for dealing with such protests and that 
decisions were made at the scene 
we dont want to violate anyones constitutional rights to free 
expression but we also want to guarantee that logging 
operations are able to continue he said

national party leader fw de klerk 
was sworn in today as south africas acting president a day after 
he and other cabinet members forced the resignation of pw botha 
in a news conference immediately after taking the oath of office 
de klerk praised the ousted botha who was in power for 11 
tumultuous years as one of south africas greatest leaders 
his greatest gift to south africa is the fact that he has put 
our country on the road to fundamental reform that he has 
successfully started pulling south africa out of its deadend 
streets and that he guided us in the direction of a totally new 
dispensation de klerk said 
shortly after being sworn in at the union buildings by chief 
justice michael corbett de klerk said he planned to convene a new 
parliament on sept 13 a week after national elections he is 
expected to be chosen by an electoral congress the next day to serve 
a full fiveyear term as president 
botha had attacked de klerk personally in what was seen as a 
bitter and undignified farewell speech broadcast on national 
television monday night specifically botha said he opposed de 
klerks plans to make an important diplomatic trip to zambia later 
this month 
de klerk defended himself in a television interview immediately 
following bothas speech and said the 73yearold presidents 
departure was in the best interest of south africa 
botha with his partys support initiated south africas first 
halting steps of race reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
though his efforts slowed considerably after nationwide black unrest 
erupted in 1984 
after his swearingin de klerk said of botha his place in 
history among the great leaders that our country produced is already 
assured 
there is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a new era 
in south africa and southern africa the 53yearold de klerk 
said history offers us a unique opportunity for peaceful 
solutions 
i trust that the people of south africa will show the courage 
and vision required to break the cycle of conflict tension and 
isolation that has gripped us for so long he said we want to 
build a new south africa in which all people participate in 
decisions affecting their lieves at all levels 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu a leading critic of the 
national party said of de klerk all he is doing is giving a new 
face to apartheid tutu said the transition is just a change of 
initials from pw to fw 
but tutu said from his cape town office that he felt sorry for 
botha 
he looked a pathetic figure here we saw a coup they didnt 
use guns but they certainly put pistols to his head 
in general de klerk and the other cabinet ministers were more 
sympathetic to botha than the public and news media today 
the banned united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition said the leadership change will make 
little difference to south africas 28 million blacks 
the cabinet members told botha who suffered a stroke jan 18 to 
use his health as an excuse for resigning 23 days before the crucial 
polls 
but the defiant botha said his health was not the issue 
i am not prepared to leave on a lie botha said he told the 
cabinet 
botha showed no emotion or signs of ill health when reading his 
20minute resignation statement from a desk at his official 
residence in cape town 
after all these years of my best efforts for the national 
party and for the government of this country as well as the 
security of our country i am being ignored by ministers serving in 
my cabinet botha said 
botha nicknamed the great crocodile for his feared temper 
and sometimes ruthless manner seldom appeared in public following 
his stroke 
botha insisted he was not a sulky old man but he never 
offered congratulations to de klerk who replaced botha as party 
leader in february 
bothas behavior became increasingly erratic in recent weeks 
last month he refused to attend a farewell banquet planned by the 
national party to honor him 
he did however appear unannounced at a provincial party 
congress forcing de klerk to give up his seat at the head table 
de klerk a lawyer who appears to share bothas vision of limited 
and gradual race reform has spoken in vague terms of dismantling 
more apartheid laws 
however he has not promised any specific changes on major 
apartheid issues such as powersharing with the black majority or 
desegregating schools and neighborhoods 
de klerk was party to the disastrous policies of the government 
under pw bothas rule the united democratic front said in a 
statement the mass democratic movement demands the government as 
a whole resigns so that democracy and peace may be established once 
and for all 
pw botha who met with four black african leaders last year 
worked hard to increase south african contact with the rest of the 
continent but he had said it was inopportune to meet with 
president kaunda at this stage because the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement is based in zambia and is 
planning to disrupt the september elections 
the national party which has ruled south africa for 41 years is 
expected to lose ground to both the antiapartheid democratic party 
on its left and the hardline segregationist conservative party on 
its right

a man arrested in connection with the kidnapping and 
slaying of a 5yearold girl has confessed to killing two other 
girls in a series of cases that have brought fear to tokyo suburbs 
police said today 
in a society remarkably free of crime the brutality of the 
murders in an area northwest of tokyo has shocked many japanese and 
dominated news and television reports 
the cases however also have drawn attention to the many 
animated films available in japan that show violence and scenes of 
undressed girls and comic books involving crime the suspect 
tsutomu miyazaki said he collected them 
miyazaki the 26yearold son of a printing shop owner was 
arrested friday in the kidnapping and killing of 5yearold ayako 
nomoto two months ago on sunday police said he confessed to 
killing two 4yearold girls mari konno and erika namba 
police said they also were questioning miyazaki about whether he 
was involved in the disappearance of a fourth girl 7yearold 
masami yoshizawa missing since october 
miyazaki was first arrested july 23 for allegedly forcing a 
6yearold girl to let him take nude pictures of her during 
questioning he admitted to having killed ayako and directed police 
to a wooded area where her skull was found police said 
police said miyazaki told them he had picked up ayako in his car 
but became angry when she made fun of a deformity in his hands 
and strangled her he then took her body to his room where he 
chopped off her head hands and feet they said her torso was found 
northwest of tokyo on june 11 
i cannot control myself when i see a young girl newspapers 
quoted him as telling police 
since miyazaki confessed last week to murdering ayako an army of 
reporters has been stationed at his house police headquarters the 
victims houses and murder sites 
when questioned teachers told reporters miyazaki seldom stood 
out and left little impression on them acquaintances described 
miyazaki as a quiet loner who bragged about his collection of nearly 
4500 videotapes including many animated films 
one of miyazakis videotapes chiniku no hana flower of 
blood and flesh has a plot that resembles ayakos murder 
investigators said in it a man follows a girl in his car kidnaps 
her and then dismembers her in his apartment 
police quoted miyazaki as saying he picked up mari in his car and 
drove her to a mountain where i strangled her to death i took 
two pictures of her in the car i burned her with other things in 
the front yard at my house i put her bones and ashes in a box and 
put it at the front door of maris home 
in february when the box was found letters were sent to maris 
family and to the newspaper asahi shimbun signed with the female 
name yuko imada in the letters the writer claimed to have 
killed mari out of frustration from being unable to bear a child 
investigators said monday they had discovered that yuko imada 
was the name of a female detective in a 1988 comic book who solved a 
case involving a poisoned salami in a supermarket police said they 
believe miyazaki wrote the letters because of his interest in comics 
and animated films 
police said miyazaki told them he had kidnapped erika strangled 
her in his car stripped off her clothes and left her in a forest 
mitsuyoshi maniwa a psychology professor at shizuoka university 
said miyazaki was unable to distinguish between reality and fiction 
because of his overwhelming interest in horror and animation videos 
through images and advertising comic books magazines and 
videotapes men are taught to look at women as objects said chie 
kanematsu editor of a newsletter published by kodo suru onnatachi 
a group fighting exploitative images of women this is the 
environment japanese children grow up in 
under japanese law prosecutors have up to 20 days to release him 
or bring charges

the ability to taste bitterness may be a 
natural defense against poisoning says a prominent taste researcher 
for one thing bitterness and toxicity tend to appear together 
strikingly often although there are exceptions said linda 
bartoshuk of yale university 
for another scientists have found that the tongue contains more 
than one kind of sensor to detect bitterness she said that would 
make sense if the system were set up to detect multiple types of 
poisons she said 
bartoshuk discussed research in taste monday at the annual 
meeting of the american psychological association 
bitterness and sweetness are detected when substances bind to 
specialized proteins while saltiness and sourness are sensed in a 
different way she said 
she demonstrated the multiple types of bitterness detectors by 
having audience members taste postagestampsized squares of paper 
impregnated with a substance called 6npropylthiouracil about half 
the audience tasted it as bitter the other half sensed no taste at 
all 
yet everybody in the audience could have tasted the bitterness of 
quinine bartoshuk said so the two kinds of bitterness are picked 
up by different sensing proteins she said 
the ability to taste the chemical on the paper is determined 
genetically she said about twothirds of the general population 
are tasters on this test she said 
tasters find swiss cheese more bitter than nontasters do she 
said they also perceive sugar placed on the front of the tongue to 
be twice as sweet as nontasters do she said 
nontasters find caffeine less bitter and so are not likely to 
notice the difference between regular and decaffeinated coffee she 
said 
just what difference the responsible genes make in the taste buds 
is not clear but perhaps tasters have some bitternesssensing 
proteins that nontasters lack she said

rep larkin smith went to washington with a 
hardline stance against crime gained in 22 years of law 
enforcement and in his short house tenure he impressed colleagues 
with his knowledge of the law 
the bodies of the freshman republican congressman and his pilot 
were found monday in the wreckage of a singleengine plane that 
crashed sunday night in a denselywooded area of the desoto national 
forest in south mississippi 
the grayhaired exsheriff won a seat on the house judiciary 
committee because of his law enforcement experience despite a 
republican tradition of appointing only lawyers to the panel 
because of his background and hardworking manner he gave every 
indication of becoming a star said alan coffey chief republican 
counsel for the house judiciary committee 
gov ray mabus ordered state flags to be flown at halfstaff 
saying smith had dedicated his life to public service a date 
has not been set for a special election to fill his seat 
president bush expressed regret in a statement read by white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater congressman smith was just 
beginning a promising career in the congress it said 
searchers had to bulldoze their way to the thickly wooded crash 
site after rescuers spotted the wreckage of the singleengine cessna 
177 from the air 
smith 45 and his pilot 58yearold chuck vierling of gulfport 
had left hattiesburg sunday evening for a 90mile flight to 
gulfport smith had thrown out the first baseball at the dixie youth 
world series 
the planes engine appeared to have been dead when it crashed 
said dr michael west deputy medical examiner for neighboring 
forrest county west said there was no sign of fire or smell of 
gasoline at the crash site

plane crash earlier sunday the wreckage of a plane carrying rep 
mickey leland dtexas and 15 other people had been found in

to a remote village 
he had emerged as one of the real leaders in the freshman class 
of the 101st congress said rep gv sonny montgomery 
dmiss who had joined smith at the youth baseball series 
our last conversation at the series was talking about the loss 
of congressman leland and i told larkin that he should be careful 
in traveling and performing his duties 
smith had cosponsored legislation to strengthen federal drug law 
enforcement and criticized drug czar william bennett for backing an 
import ban on semiautomatic assault weapons 
he once took fellow judiciary committee members to an fbi 
shooting range to demonstrate his belief that shotguns were just as 
dangerous as assault weapons he claimed 90 percent of crimes were 
committed with pistols and shotguns

soldiers drove public buses to get 
workers to offices today at the start of a daylong strike called by 
sinhalese radicals protesting the continuing deployment of indian 
troops in sri lanka 
shops in colombo were closed and hundreds of employees began 
returning home because most offices and businesses were not 
functioning soliders in camouflage uniforms patrolled the city and 
policemen were posted at major intersections and near bus stops 
at least seven people were killed by sinhalese radicals today and 
monday according to military officials the officials who cannot 
be identified under briefing rules said the victims included two 
soldiers ambushed early today in the central town of nuwara eliya 
the other killings were in the sinhalesedominated south they 
said 
the strike coincides with the 42nd anniversary of indias 
independence from britain at least two colombobased newspapers 
refused to carry special supplements to mark the occasion sources 
in the dailies said on condition of anonymity 
the call for the strike came in posters signed by the national 
workers federation which the government describes as a radical 
group 
the posters in the sinhalese language denounced the presence of 
an estimated 43000 indian soldiers deployed in the northeast to 
oversee a 1987 peace accord aimed at ending a tamil insurrection for 
an independent nation 
the ultranationalist front says the indian troops compromise the 
countrys sovereignty it also says the government has made too many 
concessions to the tamil militants who began their separatist 
campaign in 1983 
the tamils argue they are discriminated against by the sinhalese 
who comprise 75 percent of the population tamils are 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people 
president ranasinghe premadasa on june 1 asked india to withdraw 
its soldiers but so far india has pulled out only 2200 troops and 
the results have failed to appease the extremists 
india has said a quick withdrawal of troops could lead to more 
violence but that it will withdraw soldiers in phases pulling them 
all out by february 
sinhalese extremists have killed at least 4000 people over the 
past two years according to the government about 11000 other 
people have died in the 6yearold tamil revolt

killed 16 convicts who had taken 15 members of a religious group 
hostage in an escape attempt and murdered five of them including a 
teenager 
the bloody assault ended a threeday standoff at the metropolitan 
district command detention center and came five hours after the 
convicts tried to flee by using hostages as shields 
during the attempted break five hostages escaped but a 
16yearold female captive died along with one convict officials 
said the remaining 15 inmates then retreated to the jail compound 
brig gen mariano baccay the regional military commander said 
officials decided to storm the jail after the escaped hostages told 
them some captives had been slain 
in all five hostages died baccay said none died in the police 
assault 
the hostages were seized sunday during religious services at the 
downtown jail in davao city 610 miles southeast of manila 
one of those slain was missionary jacqueline hamill 36 of 
sydney australian who had been working in davao city since last 
month cecilia so a nurse at davao doctors hospital said miss 
hamill was pronounced dead on arrival after the assault 
all the hostages were members of the joyful assemblies of god a 
protestant group that conducted a prison ministry the inmates 
including murderers asked for a getaway vehicle and gave 
authorities a 4 pm deadline to meet their demand 
maj antonio inciong of the militarys civil relations service 
said miss hamill and other female captives were sexually molested by 
their captors officials said about nine of the hostages were women 
military and civilian negotiators had been holding talks with the 
inmates since late sunday in an effort to peacefully resolve the 
crisis 
but about 10 am today military spokesman maj wilfredo garcia 
said the inmates announced they were leaving the detention center 
with their prisoners 
the hostage takers started firing when they broke out garcia 
said heavy firing ensued 
convict leader mohammed naser samparani a former air force 
soldier serving a 27year sentence for murder was killed in the 
attempted escape along with hostage julieta verzosa 16 
after the first burst of gunfire the inmates remained holed up 
inside the compound until the military attacked before the assault 
reporters could see four bodies three male and one female stacked 
up in the area controlled by the inmates it appeared the four had 
been slain after the breakout failed 
on monday former rep jesus dureza who was negotiating with the 
gunmen said samparani threatened to waste all my bullets into the 
australian unless officials provided the convicts with a getaway 
vehicle 
there were conflicting reports about how the hostage drama began 
justice undersecretary silvestre bello said the convicts overpowered 
a guard and then looted an armory for weapons 
but the rev jamuel ducurme who had attended sundays prison 
services said the incident began after samparani a prison trusty 
asked to take food to the wife of a soldier who lived next to the 
jail 
samparani returned a few moments later with an m16 rifle fired 
warning shots and seized the hostages ducurme said the pastor said 
he was allowed to leave 
police said most of the inmates were believed to have been from a 
group that escaped in april from the davao penal colony and seized 
several hostages to protest conditions at the prison 
they surrendered after being promised they would be transferred 
to the muntinlupa prison in a manila suburb but the promise was 
never fulfilled 
officials said later the promised transfer could not be carried 
out because the inmates faced additional charges in davao city in 
connection with the penal colony escape

a study of the skeletons of 268 
indians buried in the 17th century on amelia island shows they were 
overworked and underfed by their spanish masters scientists say 
but the researchers are puzzled because the indians lived longer 
than ancestors who were better fed and didnt have to carry burdens 
for the spanish said rebecca saunders supervisor of the 
archaeologists 
the study of the bones she said showed that the guale and 
yamasee indians diets were nutritionally deficient and that they 
suffered from arthritis in their vertebrae and feet indicating they 
had carried many heavy loads 
what we have learned from this is that both the guale men and 
women were used as bearers by the spanish ms saunders said in 
mondays florida timesunion in jacksonville 
the remains were unearthed at the sites of two mission 
graveyards excavation began four years ago when a backhoe clearing 
land for a house uncovered a graveyard 
researchers found that many of the indians lived to what was then 
the ripe old age of 40 ms saunders said the indians who lived in 
the area in the 1400s ate better but rarely reached that age 
its a contradiction that we have not been able to solve 
said ms saunders who is writing a dissertation on the missions for 
the university of florida 
ten archaeologists from the university plan to excavate areas 
where once stood the house where the franciscan missionaries lived 
their cookhouse and a circular structure that might have been part 
of the mission village 
the scientists also will attempt to locate the site of the

northeast in the apriljune period 
the median price of a home in the san francisco bay area the 
most expensive market was 265700 the realtors said compared 
with peoria ill which had the lowest median price of 47700

for less 
the realtors said their quarterly survey of sales of previously 
owned homes showed a seasonally adjusted annual resale rate of 372 
million units down 31 percent from the januarymarch quarter 
nar president ira gribin said the sales reflected a lagging 
response to drops in interest rates that began in may 
it took some time for the market to turn he said now the 
people who can afford to get in the market are househunting 
but gribin said the survey also indicates that home ownership is 
slipping further out of reach for firsttime buyers in areas with 
expensive housing 
highcost areas are losing their entrylevel market he said 
and in some highcost markets mortgage rates are forcing buyers to 
purchase lessexpensive homes 
washington dc was the only area outside of the west coast and 
northeast ranking near the top of the price list the nations 
capital had a median price of 139900 
ranked second in the median price list behind san francisco was

massachusetts highest court reinstated murder 
charges against a man accused of killing a detective despite what 
the justices called contemptible and disgusting police 
misconduct in the case 
police cheered the decision monday by the supreme judicial court 
that albert lewin can be tried for the 1988 slaying of sherman 
griffiths but defense attorneys said the ruling would encourage 
police to fabricate evidence 
three boston detectives threw the murder investigation into 
turmoil last spring when they admitted they had created a fictitious 
informant to obtain a search warrant for the drug raid in which 
griffiths was shot 
in march superior court judge charles m grabau dismissed the 
murder charge against lewin 33 saying police had prevented a fair 
trial by repeatedly lying about the informant 
writing for the majority in the high courts 42 ruling justice 
herbert wilkins said in order to express its outrage at the 
reprehensible police conduct in this case society need not punish 
itself by freeing a man who may be guilty of murder in the first 
degree and other serious crimes 
wilkins said the contemptible and disgusting misconduct by 
police officers in blatant violation of their sworn duties would 
not prevent a fair trial 
griffiths 36 was shot to death as he tried to break in the door 
of lewins apartment lewin has been in jail for more than a year 
awaiting trial 
the three officers who testified about the fictitious informant 
have been suspended pending a perjury investigation 
police commissioner francis m roache applauded the courts 
decision saying he was happy for griffiths widow that lewin would 
be brought to trial 
he said boston police officers are ordinary human beings who 
work under extraordinary pressure 
a lawyer for lewin patricia garin said the ruling sets a 
precedent for toleration of massive perjury by the police and it 
vindicates them in their anything goes strategy 
harvey silverglate cochairman of the massachusetts association 
of criminal defense lawyers said the decision will make it 
increasingly likely that police will be allowed to frame innocent 
citizens 
in two dissents chief justice paul liacos and justice ruth 
abrams said the majority opinion essentially condoned police 
misconduct 
because of the officers lies the defendant languished in jail 
while court proceedings continued with what the court has 
characterized as perfidious police conduct abrams wrote

president wojciech jaruzelski today called 
for a joint meeting as soon as possible of the countrys major 
political leaders to find a rational solution for the deepening 
governmental crisis 
solidarity leader lech walesa meanwhile said he is willing to 
serve as prime minister if society wants it 
earlier walesa welcomed gen czeslaw kiszczaks decision to give 
up trying to form a government as one of polands two minor parties 
endorsed walesas bid to form the next government 
the developments came one day after kiszczak offered to resign as 
prime minister in the face of opposition from solidarity and urged 
instead that procommunist peasant party leader roman malinowski 
form a coalition government that would include both communists and 
the free trade movement 
solidarity has rejected such offers previously saying only a 
government headed by the opposition and dominated by noncommunists 
will have the credibility necessary to solve polands political and 
economic problems 
jaruzelski expresses his concern over the deepening instability 
of polands political and economic situation a communique on the 
states pap news agency announced 
the president intends to appeal to representatives of the main 
political forces in the country for participation in a joint meeting 
devoted to seeking rational solutions as soon as possible pap 
said 
polands economy particularly is in disarray with industrial 
production falling shortages of basic commodities common its 
foreign debt at a burdensome 39 billion and growing and rising 
inflation 
associates have said that under such conditions that walesa 
himself might be willing to serve as prime minister 
in a statement issued by walesa today he said 
gen kiszczaks declaration expressing readiness to resign 
was received by myself as resulting from a feeling of responsibility 
for poland and a step opening new possibilities to solve the 
current government crisis 
walesa who is not a member of parliament said his offer of a 
coalition government of solidarity the peasants and the democratic 
party is today the only chance to change the course of events 
dangerous for the country 
such a government he said would be a government of national 
responsibility nominated with respect for the rights of the polish 
president 
walesa apparently was referring to the constitutional rights of 
the newly elected jaruzelski to control foreign policy and the armed 
forces presumably solidarity would nominate for the defense 
interior and foreign ministries only candidates acceptable to 
jaruzelski 
despite those assurances the prospect of a solidarityled 
government has alarmed both the communist polish united workers 
party and the soviet union which has said it could be destabilizing 
both for poland and europe 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek has said the 
party also fears a solidarityled government would purge a large 
segment of the nomenklatura party functionaries who hold tens 
of thousands of government and management posts 
the nomination of malinowski a noncommunist but long allied 
with the communists was apparently the partys effort to offer an 
alternative to a solidarityled government that polands east bloc 
and party hardliners could not accept 
the resignation of a communist premier because the opposition 
will not endorse his bid to form a government and the plausible 
attempt by solidarity to form a government against the wishes of the 
polish and soviet communist parties demonstrates how radically 
east bloc politics have changed 
such events would not have been thinkable even a year ago 
malinowski has not publicly replied to kiszczaks suggestion that 
he form the government but he already faces opposition from 
solidarity and from within his own party among others 
if solidarity would succeed in its push to win the prime 
ministers post it would be the first noncommunist government in 
the east bloc since the late 1940s 
kiszczak elected prime minister on aug 2 said he would contact 
jaruzelski and ask him to draw proper conclusions from the 
situation 
faced with the difficulty of winning a majority in parliament 
despite opposition from the solidarity caucus that makes up 35 
percent of the chamber the longtime interior minister blamed 
walesas proposal for prolonging and complicating the problem of 
forming a government 
walesa announced aug 7 that he wanted to form the solidarityled 
coalition his representatives commenced talks thursday with the 
peasant and democratic parties which hold the balance of power in 
parliament amid signs the discussions were going positively 
in essence the peasant and democrat parties once regarded as 
little more than communist fronts have been thrown into the role of 
kingmakers because neither the communist party nor solidarity has an 
absolute majority in parliament

james molyneaux leader of the largest protestant party the 
ulster unionists and democratic unionists party leader rev ian 
paisley used the day for a first meeting with the new secretary of 
state for northern ireland peter brooke the british cabinet member 
responsible for the province 
molyneaux and paisley said they had emphasized the opposition of 
unionists who support continued british rule to the 1985 
angloirish agreement that guaranteed the irish government a formal 
consultative role in the running of the province 
we completely disillusioned the secretary of state that the 
unionist leadership was weakened in the protest and fight to end the 
agreement paisley said 
the mainly catholic ira says the angloirish agreement makes no 
difference to its guerrilla the ira wants to unite the 
predominantly protestant province with the 95 percent catholic 
republic of ireland under socialist rule 
the anniversary and the preceding weekend passed without any 
additions to northern irelands sectarian death toll which has 
surpassed 2700 in 20 years 
security forces had feared the ira would attempt a significant 
attack to mark the date 
on monday a highranking officer of the royal ulster 
constabulary contended that the violent incidents were spurred by 
news media attention given to the anniversary 
i am honestly convinced that the presence of camera crews is 
keeping this going said chief inspector ian williamson there was 
no evidence he said that the incidents had been part of any larger 
pattern by any of the provinces illegal paramilitary groups

two cosmonauts will blast off sept 6 
to reman the orbiting space station mir after a fourmonth lapse 
dictated by finances and technical delays space officials announced 
today

viktorenko and engineer alexander a serebrov will include a ride 
outside mir in a new space motorcycle 
serebrov a veteran of two earlier space flights and viktorenko 
who flew once before are to blast off the night of sept 6 aboard a 
soyuz rocket from the baikonur space center in the republic of 
kazakhstan officials said 
mir the showcase of the soviet space program was launched in 
february 1986 though designed to be permanently manned it was 
vacated april 27 when three cosmonauts rocketed back to earth 
officials have said it was vacated to save money and because two 
new modules for the station were not ready 
the soviet space program has come under fire recently for heavy 
spending at a time when the country is suffering a 192 billion 
budget deficit and shortages of food and other basic consumer goods 
a 20ton module containing the space motorcycle a new space 
shower and a new hatch for space walks will be launched in october 
and attached to mir serebrov told a news conference in star city 
the cosmonaut trainin center 25 miles east of moscow

us space shuttle astronauts the soviet unit can travel 495 feet 
from mir for up to three hours 
alexei a leonov deputy director of gagarin cosmonaut training 
center at star city and a former spaceman told reporters he had 
worked with soviet engineers to develop a space motorcycle in the 
early 1970s but the project deemed unnecessary and canceled 
a second module with equipment to grow crystals in the 
weightlessness of space is to be launched in february serebrov said 
the 20ton mir already has one module attached to it and a space 
observation laboratory 
balandin and cosmonaut anatoly y solovyov are to join viktorenko 
and serebrov aboard mir in early march officials told reporters 
mir had been manned for a total of 880 days by four crews since 
its launch cosmonauts vladimir titov and musa manarov broke space

the army said today that a shiite moslem cleric 
kidnapped by israeli commandos is being held under administrative 
detention which allows people to be jailed without being charged or 
tried 
in damascus syria irans foreign minister said israel must 
unconditionally release the cleric sheik abdul karim obeid and 
indicated iran will not use its influence to free hostages in 
lebanon until obeid is free 
israels military censor meanwhile asked police to open an 
investigation into a report in the sunday times of london and the 
washington post that two of three israeli soldiers missing in 
lebanon are dead said eitan haber spokesman for defense minister 
yitzhak rabin 
the jerusalem post reported today that an extensive investigation 
was underway to pinpoint the source of the report cabinet ministers 
will be investigated as well it said 
an army spokesman said obeid the lebanese cleric kidnapped by 
israeli commandos on july 28 is being held for six months under an 
administrative detention order signed by chief of staff lt gen dan 
shomron he did not say where obeid was 
israel accuses obeid of coordinating attacks by the moslem 
fundamentalist hezbollah on israeli troops in south lebanon 
administrative detainees generally palestinians are usually 
allowed to have a lawyer and appeal their detention but the army 
spokesman who is not identified under military regulations would 
not say if obeid had such rights 
obeids abduction july 28 worldwide attention after a radical 
shiite group in lebanon claimed to have killed an american hostage 
marine lt col william r higgins in retaliation 
israel has demanded the release of three israelis missing in 
lebanon as well as 16 foreign hostages in exchange for obeid and 
other shiite moslem prisoners the hostage held longest is terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati today dampened hopes 
his country might use its influence with kidnap groups to free the 
hostages 
we hope that sheik obeid will be released he said after 
arriving in syria for talks on the lebanese war this release 
should take place without any prior conditions no talks no 
discussions before sheik obeid is released 
on sunday the front pages of israeli papers carried headlines 
quoting the sunday times story that two of the three missing 
israelis were in fact dead 
the story said intelligence officers questioning obeid have 
concluded that the two infantrymen died of wounds soon after their 
car was ambushed in south lebanon in february 1986 
israels chief army spokesman brig gen ephraim lapid did not 
confirm or deny the report but said the government considers its 
soldiers to be alive unless it is given documentary proof to the 
contrary 
in another report on the hostage affair the independent of 
london said monday that obeids abduction had sabotaged sensitive 
overtures by israel to iran and the hezbollah to free the prisoners 
the paper said the inner cabinet appointed a threeman team to 
negotiate with the hezbollah that consists of uri lubrani chief 
coordinator of israeli policy in lebanon gen ran goren head of 
the armys manpower branch and ori slonim a tel aviv lawyer and 
confidante of rabin 
the team had opened new channels with iran and the hezbollah 
via two palestinan shiites who have close links with teheran the 
paper said frustrated by the slow progress of negotiations israel 
kidnapped obeid it said 
it said rabin expected the kidnapping to hasten the negotiations 
but instead hezbollah broke off the contacts in anger 
rabins spokesman haber refused to comment on the independent 
report other officials also declined to comment saying the issue 
was sensitive 
one security source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
report was nonsense

an air fare skirmish has intensified into a war 
as major us airlines extend bargains on summer travel into the 
historically weak fall season 
trans world airlines started the move sunday announcing it was 
cutting roundtrip fares by as much as 160 to lure passengers in 
the fall twa also said it would lower certain international fares 
into next spring 
the reductions were matched monday by pan american world airways 
usair united airlines northwest airlines continental airlines and 
eastern airlines in markets where they compete with twa 
american airlines and delta air lines went one better by matching 
the cuts for all the mainland us cities they serve not only those 
where they compete with twa 
spokesman jim brown in dallas said american would match twas new 
fares to europe on a competitive basis delta spokesman jim lundy in 
atlanta said early today his company had not yet decided on cuts for 
international fares 
pan am also cut fares across its entire overseas network except 
for the soviet union said spokeswoman elizabeth manners in new york 
the reduced fares are available for domestic flights from sept 9 
to dec 15 and for international flights from oct 1 to may 21 
reservations must be made by sept 1 
air fares had been steadily rising in recent months amid strong 
passenger traffic and may have peaked for awhile industry analysts 
say continental started a round of cuts aug 2 when it reduced to 
75 each way its weekend fares through labor day on most nonstop 
flights and lowered transcontinental weekend fares to 100 each way 
i think traffic is strong enough that the new discounts can 
put on some incremental passengers its free money said kevin 
murphy an airline analyst at morgan stanley amp co 
an unusual arrangement in the latest farecutting allows one 
change in travel dates discount fares normally prohibit such 
changes in addition a lowest fare guarantee ensures that if 
fares are reduced further after a ticket is purchased passengers 
will be refunded the difference 
twa wants to stimulate traffic during the historically weak 
fall travel period and passengers who act now will be getting a 
great deal robert cozzi twas senior vice president of 
marketing said in a statement 
the offer covers more than 100 cities worldwide he said 
examples of twas new roundtrip fares for travel on tuesday and 
wednesday are st louisdallas 148 new yorklos angeles 198 
chicagodenver 168 and san antoniowashington 198 
roundtrip fares to europe have been cut by about 100 examples 
of oneway fares from new york on twa starting nov 1 are london 
149 paris 199 frankfurt west germany 189 madrid spain 
213 and rome 232

the parents of a texas college student killed 
in a ritual slaying by members of a drug cult told president bush 
today that for every drug user there are victims and suffering 
jim and helen kilroy were among about a dozen people meeting with 
bush and national drug policy director william j bennett as the 
administration prepares its first comprehensive strategy for 
fighting drugs due out sept 5 
the kilroys said bush was very sensitive to what happened to 
their son who disappeared in the mexican border town of matamoros 
while in spring break 
his body was later found in a mass grave on a ranch outside the 
city and had been dismembered by the drug cult which believed that 
human sacrifices would protect their illegal activities 
bennett said the nation suffered with the kilroys a couple of 
months ago but since that time the kilroys have taken their pain 
and their tragedy and turned it into a very good effort 
the santa fe texas couple have founded the mark kilroy 
foundation which kilroy said emphasizes education against the use 
of illegal drugs and that the use of drugs causes much suffering 
the government has to enforce the laws because right now people 
sell drugs use drugs at will i think that has to be at all levels 
local state and federal he said after the white house meeting 
thats the one thing we said to president bush there is a need 
for enforcement kilroy said 
i believe the drug dealers know exactly what theyre doing and 
that they should be punished mrs kilroy said 
mrs kilroy said even casual drug use has terrible effects 
there is so much suffering we definitely should make every 
effort possible to see an end to it in our generation kilroy said 
mrs kilroy said bush and bennett did not issue any specific 
recommendations for fighting drugs but she is satisfied the 
administration is moving in the right direction and praised bush 
and bennett for asking others about what can be done 
i think the federal government will do its part but that all 
of us are going to have to do our part too its going to take the 
entire nation everyone doing their part to rid our country of this 
terrible crisis mrs kilroy said

president bush said today that the new 
drugfighting strategy he will unveil next month is balanced 
decisive effective and achievable and said the american people 
demand no less 
the president at a news conference called attention to a new 
gallup poll that found overwhelming numbers of teenagers think 
drugs are the biggest problem facing their generation 
it is clear in these surveys that drug abuse is a national 
menace and that the central government must attack it with every 
means at its disposal bush said 
asked if he was willing to raise taxes to pay for the antidrug 
fight the president said were not going to have to but we are 
going to expand federal expenditures 
asked where the money was coming he said stay tuned and we 
will show you in september how were going to allocate the resources 
for this 
the poll released on monday at the white house said teenagers 
and adults alike view drug abuse as the most important problem 
facing the country eclipsing fear of war the economy aids 
crime abortion and alcohol abuse as top concerns 
the president gave no specifics of what the new strategy to be 
released sept 5 after he returns from his vacation will be this 
will be a rather comprehensive national strategy he said 
there is a little bit of good news out there bush said 
there is a decline in the casual use of cocaine thats taking 
place he said more can be done with education to counter the 
demand for drugs and that efforts to cut the supply line have also 
had some effect 
one adult in four and one teenager in three has come to believe 
that drug abuse is the countrys greatest problem said the poll 
and six in 10 teenagers believe it is the greatest problem facing 
their generation 
william bennett the national drug policy coordinator said 
monday that the poll results give a very clear sense of 
direction to the administration in its strategy 
in times of crisis such as war the public is willing to make 
great sacrifices to the public good said george h gallup in 
key ways today the american people are in a wartime mode and sense 
a national emergency in the drug crisis 
only six years ago in a similar poll unemployment most bothered 
53 percent of adults drugs and drug abuse did not register four 
years ago it was the top concern of only 2 percent in the telephone 
conducted by the gallup organization in june and july it was the top 
worry of 27 percent 
in the 50 years that the us public has been asked to name the 
most important problem facing the nation it is virtually 
unprecedented for any social issue to appear at the top of the 
list gallup said 
people are so disturbed he said that threefourths of all 
teenagers and nearly half of adults are ready to volunteer to help 
in drug prevention programs education and treatment 
a record number of americans cite the drug crisis as the 
nations top problem replacing the guns and butter issues of 
international tensions and economic worries he told a news 
conference also attended by bennett 
after drugs and drug abuse the top concerns by adults were 
poverty homelessness and hunger 8 percent the economy in general 
7 percent and the federal budget deficit and the environment 6 
percent each 
next came crime inflation other economic problems and a 
decline in morals each with 3 percent then abortion unemployment 
the trade deficit and dissatisfaction with government at 2 percent 
and quality of education 1 percent 
twelve percent of adults listed other problems at the top and 
the rest said they had no answer 
fear of war the category listed the most worrisome by 27 percent 
of adults in 1985 and 23 percent in 1987 was listed first by only 4 
percent in the new survey 
drug abuse was listed by 32 percent of teenagers as the most 
important problem facing the country ahead of fear of war 14 
percent economic issues 13 percent environment and pollution 7 
percent political issues 6 percent aids 5 percent crime 3 
percent abortion 2 percent and alcohol abuse 1 percent nine 
percent of the teenagers listed other concerns and the rest said 
they didnt know 
gallup interviewed 1005 adults and 500 teenagers in the 
telephone poll which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points for the adults and 6 percentage points for the 
teenagers 
in the new survey 60 percent of the teenagers questioned said 
drug abuse is the biggest problem confronting their age group 
nearly twice the number saying it is the biggest problem for the 
country for their age group 13 percent said the worst problem was 
peer pressures 11 percent said alcohol and 8 percent said teenage 
pregnancy 
considered the top problem by 3 percent or less school problems 
teenage gangs problems in growing up unemployment teenage 
suicide getting along with parents and career uncertainties aids 
and fear of war were listed first by less than 1 percent

but let me emphasize here that the federal government cannot do 
it alone 
local communities and states and individuals and families must 
help 
im being told in these meetings of the last few days that the 
american people are ready to take on this fight 
late august is a traditional vacation period but we cannot 
forget the full agenda that faces america at this time our 
hostages the middle east lebanon drugs the budget and so many 
other matters 
in addition the congress is considering more than 100 of our 
nominees for government positions and we need these people 
and i urge the congress to make this a top priority when they 
come back 
all of these issues will be on my mind as we prepare for the hard 
work of the fall 
and so on this last day before vacation ill miss you but let 
me just see norm 
q mr president your spokesman said yesterday that significant 
progress had been made in pursuing the issue of the hostages were 
told that youve been on the phone to foreign leaders that theres 
been a flurry of diplomatic contacts but can you say today that 
were any closer to seeing the hostages released than we were say 
about three weeks ago when the israeli seizure of sheik obeid set 
into motion this chain of developments that seems to have raised 
expectations or hopes of a breakthrough 
a norm i cant say that today but were going to keep on 
trying 
but i cannot give you a definitive assessment of that 
i just dont know 
theres a lot of lines out there a lot of initiatives have been 
taken 
as i said earlier the cooperation that weve received some that 
weve solicited and some unsolicited from leaders around the world 
its just been magnificent 
but i cant give you that you know positive assessment at this 
point 
q can i follow up on just one path that was pursued on that in 
the absence of an exchange of prisoners have you considered the 
extradition of sheik obeid to this country to face criminal charges 
a no we have no criminal indictment against sheik obeid 
q is that any kind of a legal option 
a well we dont we wouldnt move against somebody without the 
legal process going forward 
q mr president what does it mean when you pointedly remind 
iran that goodwill begets goodwill the united states wants the 
return of the hostages in lebanon if that occurred what would the 
united states do in return for iran 
a too hypothetical to answer but i would simply repeat that we 
are looking for signs of change certainly when it comes to holding 
of hostages 
we all know that weve had some major differences with iran and 
the question of state sponsorship of terrorism 
thats a given 
now we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signals 
coming out of iran some in the old mode and then some that offer 
more hope

president bush said today he cant offer any 
assurances that american hostages held in the middle east will be 
freed anytime soon and said his administration continues to look 
for signs of change from iran 
i think that if iran decided they wanted those hostages to come 
out of there there would be a good likelihood that that would 
happen perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood bush 
said 
we dont have to be hostile with iran for the rest of our 
lives he said the united states broke off diplomatic relations 
with iran a decade ago 
at a prevacation news conference at the white house bush was 
questioned repeatedly about the possibility of military action 
against those holding the hostages and he replied that at some 
point we have to stand up for our interests even if it means 
military yet im not threatening military action 
later he added if i could find a way to take those hostages 
get them and bring them out and that required using the military 
force of the united states make no mistake about it i would do it 
in an instant 
the president fielded questions for 30 minutes on subjects 
ranging from economic policy to drug abuse on those topics he 
refused to rule out kidnapping panamanian leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges 
i have an obligation to try to bring people to justice he said 
said he was comfortable with budget director richard 
darmans weekend comment that the federal reserve was keeping 
interest rates too high to permit sustained growth 
promised to return from his vacation in maine on sept 5 with a 
comprehensive plan to attack the national menace of drug abuse 
he said his plan would include additional federal spending but 
would not require higher taxes 
said he wished the legal process could move along in the 
case of felix bloch a state department official suspected of 
espionage without a lot of hype bloch has not been charged 
called on the democratcontrolled senate to act speedily on 
more than 100 highlevel government appointments that await 
confirmation 
eulogized reps mickey leland and larkin smith who died in 
recent days in separate plane crashes he said the two were fine 
individuals who represented a deep caring for the poor the 
disadvantaged the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other 
areas 
bush was questioned repeatedly about the hostages in the middle 
east and the recent flurry of sensitive diplomatic efforts aimed at 
winning the release of the eight americans held in captivity 
he noted conflicting signals emanating from iran in recent weeks 
we dont have to be hostile with iran for the rest of our 
lives the president said the hostages are thought to be held by 
the shiite religious group hezbollah a faction heavily influenced 
by the iranians 
were going to keep on trying but i cant give you a definitive 
assessment of whether the hostages are any closer to freedom bush 
said 
i just dont know theres a lot of lines out there a lot of 
initiatives have been taken he said 
asked why he did not retaliate militarily after the murder of lt 
col william higgins bush said the united states still did not have 
adequate information to take either a diplomatic or military 
response the pentagon still is not certain when or how higgins 
died on july 31 his captors released a videotape that showed him 
hanging from a makeshift gallows 
i do not want to be responsible for the loss of innocent 
life bush said adding that he was also concerned that an 
american response could lead to harm for the remaining eight 
hostages 
he said that if he could mount an effective military rescue i 
would do it in an instant 
the president was asked whether he would consider seeking the 
extradition of sheik abdul karim obeid whose capture last month by 
the israelis outraged his religious followers we have no criminal 
indictment against obeid in the kidnapping of americans bush 
said we wouldnt move against somebody without the legal process 
going forward 
bush generally endorsed darmans criticism that the federal 
reserve was harming economic growth by keeping interest rates too 
high 
i feel very comfortable with his darmans sallying forth 
bush said i think i have said the same things in the past 
however bush stopped short of saying that if a recession 
occurred it would be the fault of policies by the central bank 
bush went out of his way to emphasize his commitment to a new 
national plan for fighting drug abuse and said it would take a 
full court press not just in the federal government but all 
across society to deal with it he said drug czar william bennett 
has given him a draft proposal and said the plan he unveils next 
month will be balanced decisive effective and achievable he 
offered no details 
on the hostage issue bush said he had received magnificent 
cooperation from world leaders some of it unsolicited but he did 
not identify anyone by name 
bush was asked about his inauguration day comment that goodwill 
would beget goodwill in the us relationship with iran 
now we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signals 
coming out of iran some in the old mode some that offer more hope 
i would leave it stand that a clear and good signal would be the 
release of the american hostages 
he added i just hope that the positive signs prevail because 
there are some they are encouraging

an american proira activist 
was arrested tuesday for violating a 5yearold order barring him 
from british territory police said 
lawyer martin galvin publicity director of the new yorkbased 
irish northern aid committee or noraid was bundled into a police 
jeep and driven away after taking a highprofile walk through 
northern irelands secondlargest city 
the british government said galvin would be deported after being 
flown to londons heathrow airport and handed over to immigration 
authorities there 
home secretary douglas hurd has no reason to alter his decision 
in relation to the exclusion order made in july 1984 the home 
office said as an illegal entrant and the subject of an exclusion 
order mr galvin will be removed from the uk 
galvins arrest came only hours after masked rioters marked the 
20th anniversary of the arrival of british troops in northern 
ireland by throwing rocks and homemade bombs at police riot squads 
fired plastic bullets slightly injuring two men police said 
galvin 39 has visited northern ireland at least four times 
since 1984 despite being under a british exclusion order he said he 
arrived for this latest visit three days ago 
it would have been unconscionable for me not to have been with 
the nationalist people on the 20th anniversary of the arrival of the 
troops he told reporters 
the exclusion order against galvin was signed in july 1984 
following a speech at toomebridge county londonderry in which he 
encouraged violence the day after a soldier was killed in 
londonderry 
a month later police tried to arrest galvin when he appeared on 
a platform of speakers in west belfast police killed a young man 
with a plastic bullet when fighting broke out in the crowd of 
thousands of ira supporters galvin was lifted over the heads of 
people in the crowd and vanished up a back street 
the ban is difficult to enforce because movement between northern 
ireland and the irish republic is easy there are many unpatrolled 
roads across the border no passport requirements and only random 
checks of cars 
in the latest incident officers grabbed galvin as he stood with 
officials of sinn fein the irish republican armys legal political 
wing at free derry corner a symbol of irish nationalist resistance 
to british rule 
as he was led away galvin shouted this will attract 
international attention 
britain says noraid collects funds to buy arms for the ira 
galvin denies this saying the money goes to families of victims of 
20 years of violence in the province 
sinn fein president gerry adams called for galvins release 
saying the arrest was ironic testimony to british repression which 
relies upon exclusion orders the denial of human rights and 
censorship as well as military force to maintain its presence 
here 
the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police force 
said violence flared early tuesday in the bogside a roman catholic 
stronghold and scene of some of the worst sectarian violence when 
the troubles broke out 20 years ago 
police said one homemade bomb was thrown at an armored car 
rocking the vehicle and breaking windows in nearby homes 
in north belfast a bomb exploded in the catholic ardoyne area 
and a bus and a car were hijacked and burned 
in coalisland county tyrone a crowd of 30 people hurled 
gasoline bombs at the towns police station and a bomb exploded at a 
gas station in dungannon in the center of the province 
several thousand ira supporters marked the 20year anniversary on 
monday by marching peacefully from creggan another catholic 
stronghold to bogside they walked into londonderrys old walled 
city a protestant area and past a building wrecked by an irish 
republican army bomb recently 
the ira is fighting to unite the province and its protestant 
majority with the predominantly catholic republic of ireland under 
socialist rule more than 2700 people have been killed in 20 years 
of fighting

the bodies of us rep mickey 
leland and the 15 others in his delegation were lifted off a 
mountainside in southwestern ethiopia today officials said 
weve got them all air force capt kevin krejarck told 
reporters in the capital upon his return from gambela a town near 
the crash site the site has now been cleared 
the bodies lifted one by one from the wreckage by helicopters 
hovering near the face of a sheer cliff were flown to gambela 
where they were placed aboard an ethiopian air force c130 cargo 
plane for the return to the capital 
us marine lt col david titus said the bodies would be 
identified in addis ababa by a team of us forensic experts a 
process he said could take up to a week 
two c130 hercules cargo planes carrying rescue teams and fuel 
left the capital shortly after dawn for gambela about 35 miles 
southeast of the crash site where joined two blackhawk helicopters 
in the operation said us embassy spokesman james haley 
heavy clouds rain and low visibility were believed to have led 
to the crash of the twin otter carrying leland eight other 
americans and seven ethiopians to the fugnido refugee camp in 
southwestern ethiopia on aug 7 
persistent bad weather also slowed the 6day search as well as 
the recovery effort after the twinengine plane was found sunday 
and the director of operations said the recovery operation could 
take two more days 
the recovery is proving to be extremely difficult because of 
slippery rock thick undergrowth and tall savannah grass air 
force maj gen james record of the us central command told a 
news conference in addis ababa monday night the cliff inclines at 
an 80 degree angle 
gambela has served as the recovery coordination base since 12 
bodies were found sunday on the threequarters the way up the slopes 
of a 5500foot mountain where the twin otter crashed about 350 
miles southwest of addis ababa 
record said ethiopia had accepted an offer from the us national 
transportation and safety board to participate in an investigation 
into the cause of the crash 
he said a team of experts already was on its way to ethiopia 
including representatives of the boeing and pratt and whitney 
aircraft companies which manufactured the planes body and engine 
the aircraft which carries up to 20 passengers was built by the 
canadian boeing subsidiary de havilland 
a fourman congressional delegation also planned to fly to 
ethiopia to escort the bodies home but officials have said they will 
not leave washington until the bodies have been identified 
leland 44 was on his fifth visit to africa and his second this 
year when the accident occurred en route to the refugee camp one of 
four in southwestern ethiopia run by the un high commissioner for 
refugees that house more than 300000 sudanese fleeing war and 
famine in their neighboring country

president bush today refused to rule out 
abducting panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega to bring him 
to trial on drugtrafficking charges say i have an obligation to 
try to bring people to justice 
the president also said at a news conference that he has told 
guillermo endara who was widely considered the victor in panamas 
may 7 presidential election that we will continue to support what 
the people of panama voted for 
a senior state department official said that bushs vow of 
support for endara did not put the administration at odds with an 
organization of american states agreement to promote new elections 
sept 1 conditioned on a transfer of power from noriegas regime to 
a transitional government 
the united states supports that plan although it continues to 
believe that endara fairly won the election said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the president was asked about comments he made in a recent hearst 
newspapers interview in which he seemed to indicate in answer to a 
question that kidnapping would be an acceptable option to bring 
noriega to this country to face a federal indictments in florida 
asked today if kidnapping would be appropriate bush said 
we have an indictment out against general noriega for drug 
trafficking im told that its a good indictment im not saying 
what i would do or wouldnt do i have an obligation to try to 
bring people to justice 
mediation efforts by the oas and economic and diplomatic 
sanctions against panama by the united states have failed to get 
noriega to give up power there are no indications he will step down 
as panamas de facto ruler in the face of the oas call for a 
peaceful transfer of power next month 
im not holding my breath on his voluntary departure the 
president told reporters 
asked what the administration plans are with regard to panama he 
said i dont know for sure what we are going to do 
noriega unilaterally invalidated the may election after 
initially claiming it was won by his handpicked presidential 
candidate 
various independent international and us observer groups said 
endara won the election by as much as a 31 margin despite 
widespread fraud allegedly engineered by noriegas forces 
bush said he had recently told endara who was duly elected by 
the people of panama that we will continue to support what the 
people of panama voted for

a well that if their justice system goes forward and there is 
a there is an indictment against him i would be remiss if i 
didnt try to see him brought to trial 
q well sir cant you take the lead in that and encourage the 
justice department to proceed 
a ive put it just exactly the way i want to put it 
q mr president 
a weve got to get to the back of the room here 
were yeah 
q can you explain why you have not retaliated for the murder of 
colonel higgins 
a retaliated for his murder 
q yes sir 
a if i could find some action diplomatic military private 
sector public sector that i thought would help get the hostages 
out or guard against future hostage taking i would take such action 
military action id like to know that what action we took was 
not going to victimize a lot of innocent people 
and id like to be sure of all the facts before taking action on 
the higgins case 
and i wish i could tell you we had all the facts and we dont 
so when you when you look at the action that the united states 
can take i dont want to i dont want to be responsible for the 
loss of innocent life 
i also must would have to weigh if we considered military 
action the lives of the americans that were being asked to carry 
out that action 
so its just not clear yet but if i could find a way to take 
those hostages get them and bring them out and that required using 
the military force of the united states make no mistake about it i 
would do it in an instant 
yeah right in the back you have a followup 
q yes may i ask what youre doing to increase the intelligence 
that would let you do something like that have you ordered the cia 
to try to get assets in lebanon 
a well the problem there is it takes a long time 
and i do think that the period that we went through quite a few 
years ago has resulted in less human intelligence than is necessary 
to come to grips with something as murky as hostageholding 
and so id like to do more and the various agencies know of my 
interest in this but i dont want to hold out the wrong kind of 
hope that you can say lets get more agents more intelligence of 
the human source and that that happens overnight 
it just doesnt work that way 
yeah way in the middle in the back yes

blackdamp a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen feared by 
miners was detected in the mine monday said jim diamanti a mine

all it takes is one breath of it and youre literally knocked 
down and you cant function if somebody doesnt pull you out 
youre dead diamanti said 
your body quits working your mind doesnt but your body 
immediately quits working and you cant move 
killed on sunday were christian rossman 15 catherine

warner 16 was in serious condition at st marys hospital after 
being pulled from the cave 
sheriffs lt wayne harms said the teenagers along with two 
others miles slape 17 and abby roberts 16 drove to the mine 
sunday night slape told authorities he entered the mine first but 
came out when he had trouble breathing 
the others didnt believe him so they went inside and they 
never came out harms said 
slape and roberts heard their friends choking and tried 
unsuccessfully to reenter the mine neither had keys to the two 
cars they had driven so they ran and walked five miles through the 
desert to a motel to call for help 
rescuers found the bodies about 400 feet inside the cave just 
beyond a pile of rubble they suspect kept the blackdamp inside the 
cave 
they theorized that warner who was found atop the rubble was 
high enough to avoid the lowlying layer of blackdamp

experts left washington on monday for ethiopia to help investigate 
the cause of the crash the ethiopian government had requested the 
aid 
plans for a delegation of four members of congress and two white 
house aides to travel to ethiopia to accompany the american bodies 
back to the united states were on hold until the bodies were 
retrieved and identified 
leland a 44yearold texas democrat who headed the house select 
committee on hunger was on his sixth visit to africa and his second 
this year when the plane crashed on aug 7 
this mission was a mission of mercy it was the best our 
country had to offer it showed our compassion our generosity our 
interest in seeing that there are no more hungry people the 
children would not die of hunger so why these said robert 
mallett an aide to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said at the 
memorial service

the capitol hill aides who were among those accompanying him 
sponsored by the senate black legislative staff caucus the 
service in the stately caucus room of the russell senate office 
building mourned leland patrice y johnson lelands chief of

ababa there were no survivors 
the trip was intended to focus attention on the need for hunger 
relief for hundreds of thousands of sudanese who have been forced 
from their homes by the countrys longrunning civil war 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters there 
will be a determination on the part members of the house to work for 
those goals that mickey leland sought to achieve the alleviation of 
hunger and suffering here and in africa and elsewhere in the world 
foley said lelands willingness to return to africa was a 
testament to his determination individually to follow through on 
commitments and values that were very very close to him 
and i think other members will also be willing to assume those 
risks and i dont think this will change said foley 
letters telegrams and phone calls of condolence poured in to 
lelands office monday as staff members from other congressional 
offices pitched in to help 
private companies sent food and concerned people stopped by

since the korean war ended in 1953 
south korea had said repeatedly that the crossing would violate 
the korean armistice agreement officials of the usled united 
nations command a signatory to the armistice said they would file 
a formal protest with north korea of the violation 
the un command consisting of the united states and 15 other 
nations that supported south korea in the 195053 war has 
jurisdiction over the southern half of the panmunjom truce area 35 
miles north of seoul 
north korean reports quoted maj gen choi ui ung chief delegate 
to the armistice commission as saying allowing them to go to the 
south through panmunjom is in full accord with the armistice 
agreement and the spirit of humanitarianism 
miss im who studies french at hankook university in seoul 
entered north korea on june 30 to attend the world festival of youth 
and students in pyongyang 
her original plan was to return july 27 but she stopped short of 
the demarcation line when seoul refused permission and went on a 
hunger strike for five days north korean officals said she became 
ill during the fast and had only recently been released from a 
hospital 
moon visited north korea in june and returned there after a trip 
to the united states where he studies with the maryknoll order in 
new york state 
after their arrests miss im and moon were were flown to seoul by 
helicopter and she was given a medical checkup before being turned 
over to the national intelligence agency south korean officials 
said 
they said the priest was questioned about his trip and about 
antisouth korea statements he allegedly made while in north korea 
if the two are convicted under the national security laws they 
could receive prison sentences of up to 10 years legal experts said 
in a speech in seoul marking both koreas liberation from 
japanese rule and its division in 1945 president roh taewoo said 
the koreas should recognize each other seek coexistence and 
coprosperity and restore and develop a single national community 
through mutual openingup exchanges and cooperation 
roh also cautioned north korea against agitating radicals in the 
south 
north korea must realize that the only thing they can gain by 
agitating the extremists and radicals within our society and by 
enticing a few of them to secretly visit pyongyang is the abhorrence 
of our people he declared 
dialogue between the nations has been sporadic several meetings 
were held during the past year but negotiations bogged down after 
the illegal trips to north korea

scientists have concluded that a 
kerosenebased chemical exxon corp had concocted to remove oil from 
alaskan beaches doesnt work 
a review committee determined that corexit 9580ms generally is 
harmless to marine life but is of little value in lifting oil from 
rocky shorelines 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced 
monday the substance wouldnt be approved for use on crude oil 
spilled when the exxon valdez ran onto a reef in prince william 
sound march 24 
the review committee made up of representatives from state and 
federal agencies involved in the cleanup has looked at hundreds of 
chemicals and cleanup techniques but so far hasnt found anything 
better than the highpressure washing that is becoming less 
effective as the oil weathers and hardens 
noaa is on the committee as is the environmental protection 
agency 
with exxons selfimposed deadline of sept 15 for the end of 
this years cleanup rapidly approaching corexit 9580ms was one of 
about a dozen chemicals that under went extensive study as 
scientists sought a lastditch solution 
environmentalists and state officials have been wary of the use 
of chemical dispersants fearing they would simply break up the oil 
and distribute it through the water where it would be more toxic 
than on the beach 
corexit is one of a variety of dispersant chemicals exxon makes 
the company tried a kerosenebased blend of the chemical that 
scientists hoped would break oil free from rocks but wouldnt 
dissolve it to the point it couldnt be picked up by skimmers

q mr president youve told us youre going to expand vastly 
the fight against drugs are you willing to raise taxes to pay for 
that 
a were not going to have to but we are going to expand federal 
expenditures 
q followup on that mr president 
a yeah 
q if youre not going to raise revenues to fight the drug war 
where are you going to get this money can you tell us specifically 
a stay tuned and we will show you in september how were going 
to allocate the resources for this 
q and do i understand that this money will have to come from 
other federal programs now being funded can you tell us 
specifically where this 
a not yet 
no i cant tell you yet because the final decisions havent been 
made 
but we will have to do some reallocation of resources theres no 
question about that 
q mr president 
q inaudible panama 
a yeah 
q going back to latin america for a minute on sept 1 
therell be an inauguration of the candidate that noriega supported 
effectively institutionalizing what the us considers a stolen 
election what is the us going to do now are we going to be 
limited to these kind of skirmishes that we saw last week these 
arrests of one side or the other or is there something else 
a i dont know for sure what were going to do 
part of our understanding of the oas agreement was that noriega 
would be would be out 
and im not holding my breath on his his voluntary departure 
but and i have told mr endara who was duly elected by the 
people of panama the other day that we will continue to support 
what the people of panama voted for 
but its still rather murky as to what will happen beyond sept 1 
there are some hints that possibly there will be a transfer 
let me just simply say this i would reiterate that our argument 
is not with the panamanian defense forces it is with mr noriega 
himself and that if he were to go out and that you had the will of 
the people recognized we would instantly have better relations with 
panama it would be good for our country and certainly it would 
improve life for the panamanians 
john in the middle 
q mr president in the past youve said that the budget is very 
tight theres not much room at the federal level for spending now 
you say that resources are going to be reallocated doesnt that 
signal some hard times ahead for the military or the social programs 
or both

tens of thousands of traditionalist and rightwing 
roman catholics marched through the streets tuesday in ceremonies of 
atonement for what they call the crimes of the french revolution 
the hymnsinging procession with hundreds of colorful banners 
bearing royal and christian symbols wound its way along a 2mile 
route from the louvre to the opera and back via the stock market 
district 
heading the procession was the rev philippe laguerie leader of 
fundamentalist roman catholics loyal to rebel archbishop marcel 
lefebvre who was excommunicated by pope john paul ii for 
consecrating bishops in his order without authorization 
organizers estimated about 30000 people took part in the daylong 
events which began with a traditional latin mass in front of the 
louvre a former royal palace that is now a museum 
the events were organized by religious fundamentalists and people 
identified with extreme rightwing politics two groups that overlap 
in france 
jeanclaude martinez a leader of the extremeright national 
front who served in parliament from 198688 was among the 
spectators he described the participants as the right wing the 
hard core of our electorate about 90 percent would be national 
front voters 
authorities refused permission to hold the rally at the place de 
la concorde where king louis xvi was beheaded but brigneau said 
the square in front of the louvre was just as appropriate 
we are here in the heart of what was the republic of fear the 
republic of terror the republic of the revolution he said 
noting that during the terror prisoners were taken from cells just 
across the seine in the conciergerie in carts past the louvre to the 
guillotine 
there were many innocents priests men of the people children 
who were killed said gabrielle fath who said she came from her 
home in montbronn in eastern france to atone for all the crimes 
committed in the revolution 
gerard champion of arras in northern france said the official 
bicentennial celebrations this year were grotesque they showed 
the desire of the authorities to continue to brainwash the people 
into thinking the revolution was good 
champion and mrs fath said they were not necessarily advocating 
a return to monarchy im not against democracy as such as long 
as its founded on faith champion said 
mrs fath said she would prefer a just and pure king like st 
louis but could support a republican government if we had a 
good catholic president who outlawed abortion 
the day ended with an appeal to the virgin mary asking her to 
accept a public rehabilitation of france which seems to have 
abandoned its christian vocation for the past 200 years 
the vow was a renewal of king louis xiiis consecration of france 
to mary in 1638 which he ordered to be made every year on aug 15 
we are ardent and convinced counterrevolutionaries said 
francois brigneau an editorialist for the extremeright weekly 
national hebdo in a welcoming speech 
calling attention to a 13foot replica of a guillotine on one 
side of the square brigneau said it was symbolic of our hostility 
to a bicentennial which insists on recounting a tragedy with 
cheerful words and on glorifying the executioners without a thought 
to honoring the victims 
the procession marked the feast of the assumption when roman 
catholics believe the virgin marys body and soul were taken up into 
heaven after her death 
a simultaneous but smaller procession also with a statue of 
mary took place outside notre dame cathedral a few blocks away 
under the auspices of cardinal jeanmarie lustiger the roman 
catholic archbishop of paris

a yes were in a period of hard times in the sense that we 
dont have all the money that we would like to spend in several 
areas 
so it isnt easy 
and im determined though to get this federal budget deficit 
down and to live within the grammrudman targets and to do it 
without threatening this long expansion by raising taxes on the 
american people 
owen 
q have you made no final decision on what programs are going to 
get the pinch on 
a no the omb is working on that right now 
yes 
q the last administration also made the fight against drugs a 
major priority and yet drug interdiction efforts have not slowed 
the distribution of crack cocaine people in this country still 
think drug abuse is a very major problem what can you do 
differently now that youre president than the last administration 
or even prior administrations to turn this problem around 
a well the drugs in the first place were formulating a 
national drug strategy 
and though weve approached in the previous administration we 
approached various parts of it this will be a rather comprehensive 
national strategy 
you point out the bad side of it and it is horrible no question 
there is a little bit of good news out there and that is the 
decline a decline a serious decline in the amount of casual use 
of cocaine has taken place 
this encourages because i think with better emphasis on 
education we can do more on the demand side 
on the interdiction side we are going to have some specifics in 
that that i think will help get to the problem at the source 
so you learn 
i salute the interdiction people who have done a good job but 
were just trying to improve on it make it better 
q mr president 
q can i follow that 
a yeah here 
q can i follow that up 
a yeah owen please follow up there 
q i know theres talk about using military assistance to provide 
colombia peru and bolivia to help cut down on drug trafficking can 
you tell me if you would consider deploying us troops in these 
countries to help in that effort 
a well i have said previously way back in the campaign that i 
would give serious consideration to an invitation from countries to 
help them 
and ill tell you what i found at this g7 meeting 
it was a very interesting from several of the european leaders 
the feeling that maybe we ought to have some kind of international 
effort to help countries in this regard going after people where 
in a country at the invitation of a government of a country people 
that have been out of the reach of the law enforcement of the 
local of the local of the country itself of the government

one week into estonias costly strikes a panel of 
legislators flew there tuesday to hear out angry workers and a 
toughly worded pravda article showed the kremlins growing 
impatience over the walkouts 
the communist partys top newspaper blasted nationalist 
hysteria in the baltic region and blamed a law passed by estonias 
supreme soviet parliament for igniting labor unrest among ethnic 
russians and other nonestonians in the republic 
izvestia the soviet government daily reported that the workers 
protest in its seventh day has shut down another mine in estonia 
and that railway employees walked off the job at a station at 
yulemiste 
that means all rail freight stations around tallinn estonias 
capital have been paralyzed by the strike with more than 3000 
rail cars standing idle izvestia said 
to assure the flow of supplies to the city of 480000 people 
goods are being shipped to other cities in estonia the paper quoted 
the republics deputy premier p palu as saying that way well 
supply tallinn with everything needed he said 
maarika saarna an editor with estonian state radio said from 
tallinn that at last report 26000 workers at about 40 enterprises 
in the republic of 15 million people were believed to be on strike 
mikhail lysenko a member of the strike committee said by 
telephone that thousands of ethnic russians at some 50 factories 
were staying off the job 
the strike began one day after estonias lawmakers adopted a law 
limiting voting to adults who have lived in the same district for 
two years or anywhere in estonia for five years candidates for 
elected office must live in the same place for five years or in 
estonia for 10 years 
staterun radio moscow said the law will take the right to vote 
away from more than 100000 recent nonestonian arrivals the 
precise goal pursued by the laws advocates who fear an influx of 
outsiders will make ethnic estonians a minority in their own 
homeland 
in its tough commentary pravda aimed its criticism at the law 
rather than the strikers saying the passage of discriminatory 
acts has an extremely destabilizing influence on the political 
situation in estonia and its two baltic neighbors latvia and 
lithuania a situation is building up of nationalist hysteria 
the paper said 
on monday estonias communist party chief vaino vyalyas called 
for ethnic russians to negotiate their differences with the 
republics authorities and end the strike which radio moscow said 
has cost the soviet economy millions of dollars 
however vyalyas said in an estonian tv interview that an initial 
round of negotations with protesting workers monday did not succeed 
in resolving the strike and called for more 
he admitted the rights of estonias minorities had not been taken 
into account and added this is our mistake and it must be 
rectified russians and other migrants make up about onethird of 
estonias population 
ms saarna said two sets of negotiations were taking place 
tuesday in tallinn at the estonian partys policymaking central 
committee and with members of the moscowbased supreme soviet 
legislatures commission on interethnic relations who flew to 
tallinn to try to calm tempers and end the strike 
ms saarna an ethnic estonian defended the new election law 
from criticisms published by pravda and in other moscowbased media 
they forget every civilized country has a citizenship she said 
we are fighting for staying alive as a nation they act as though 
the poor russians only had this place estonia to live in 
in the caucasus republics of georgia and azerbaijan two other 
soviet areas threatened by nationalist labor unrest officials said 
all was quiet tuesday 
georgian activists called off a strike they had considered for 
tuesday according to gruzinform the official georgian news agency 
an activist said the strike was postponed until sept 1 because the 
government promised it will identify and take action against 
instigators of violence in one district of the republic abkhazia 
by then 
at least 20 people died in the violence last month finding and 
punishing those responsible has been the georgian activists main 
demand 
in azerbaijan where six factories in the capital of baku were 
reported on strike monday and 10000 people demonstrated monday 
night an interior ministry official said life was back to normal 
tuesday

syrian troops pounded defense lines around 
the countrys besieged christian enclave with artillery and tank 
fire today in what police feared was a softeningup barrage before a 
major ground offensive 
sixteen people were kiled and 86 wounded police said 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in an 
extraordinary move today called an emergency meeting of the 
security council to arrange a ceasefire there was no immediate 
word on when the council would convene 
police reported clashes between syrian and christian forces in 
three provinces both sides battled with artillery in beirut 
hitting residential neighborhoods in the eastern christian and 
western moslem sectors 
the latest casualties raised the toll in the fighting that broke 
out march 8 to at least 757 dead and 2036 wounded 
the syrians outnumbering christian forces by twotoone were 
reported massing troops and sovietbuilt t72 tanks in the central 
mountains that form the eastern flank of the beleaguered enclave 
the action appeared to be seeking to stretch christian leader 
gen michel aouns forces who two days earlier repelled an attack 
on a mountain outpost overlooking the capital 
the moslem voice of the nation radio meanwhile reported israeli 
warplanes blasted targets shortly after noon today near the southern 
port of sidon but police had no immediate confirmation 
the syrians have about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate and have sided with a moslem government 
that rivals the christian government headed by aoun who commands 
about 20000 fighters 
a police spokesman said fighting flared across beiruts dividing 
green line in the mountains southeast of the capital and on the 
northern flank of the christian enclave 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said the syrians want to shatter aouns forces and 
weaken their supply lines they want aoun to fight a war on several 
fronts at the same time 
the syrian moves were an apparent preparation for a new attack 
on aouns defenses following an abortive attempt to storm the 
christians strategic souk elgharb strongpoint 15 miles southeast 
of beirut two days ago he said 
the mountaintop outpost besieged by moslem forces since 1983 
controls a network of roads twisting through the mountains into the 
christian heartland north of beirut 
syrian gunners in moslem west beirut the chouf mountains 
southeast of the capital and in syriancontrolled north lebanon 
hammered aouns defenses with 130mm howitzers and tanks 
police said shells were falling on christian positions at a rate 
of five a minute 
two unidentified warplanes flew over the christian perimeter at 
high altitude releasing scarlet balloons to deflect heatseeking 
missiles but they drew no fire 
a spokesman for aouns command who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said christian artillery were targeting syrian troop 
concentrations in the central mountains and the druse moslem 
villages facing souk elgharb 
aouns forces were determined to foil all attempts to storm 
through our lines even before they launch an attack the 
spokesman said 
in washington the us state department criticized syria and its 
allies for the continued warfare in lebanon and said the bloodshed 
makes us efforts to gain the release of american hostages held by 
iranianbacked shiite moslems there more difficult 
in kuwait syrian defense minister gen mustafa tlass was quoted 
by the alwatan daily as saying damascus will supply its moslem 
allies with all the weapons including surfacetosurface missiles 
they need to defeat aouns troops and rightwing militia allies 
syrian and christian gunners shelled residential districts of 
beirut intermittently through the morning bringing to a standstill 
what little life there was left in the devastated capital 
an estimated 90 percent of the citys population of 15 million 
has fled the last few weeks leaving only about 150000 people 
huddled in underground shelters 
a few bakeries that have not been hit or closed down were open 
but few civilians risked being caught in the open to line up for 
bread 
there are only a few people still in beirut anyway said 
hassan zebib at the sandbagged entrance of his west beirut bakery 
we only allow five people to wait for bread at the entrance we 
dont want a large crowd to avoid casualties in case were 
shelled he added 
the telecommunications ministry appealed for its technicians to 
report to duty immediately to repair telephone and telex lines 
that suffered severe damage during the shelling 
the current round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
broke out when aoun blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked 
militias south of beirut 
his attempt to restore longeroded government authority over the 
militias whose ports siphoned an estimated 100 million a year in 
customs levies from the state treasury triggered retaliatory 
shelling by the syrians and their allies

seven thousand relatives of war victims paused for a 
minute of silence tuesday on the anniversary of world war iis end 
and emperor akihito prayed for world peace 
at least 10 members of the cabinet of new prime minister toshiki 
kaifu marked the day by making visiting the shinto shrine for 24 
million of japans 31 million war dead including 14 convicted war 
criminals 
kaifu himself did not visit the yasukuni shrine opposition 
political parties and other groups in japan say such visits violate 
the constitutional separation of religion and state and promote 
militarism 
akihito attending a ceremony at a martial arts hall near the 
imperial palace stood before 25000 white and yellow chrysanthemums 
and bowed deeply with empress michiko at his side 
looking back it has already been 44 years since the end of the 
war and in the midst of the peace and prosperity of today brought 
about by the untiring hard work of the people when i recall the 
times replete with hardship my mind is filled with a thousand 
emotions akihito said 
on the occasion of this day in remembrance of the war victims 
i think of the many people who lost their lives and of their 
families and i am deeply saddened he told relatives of war 
victims 
i pray along with all our people for the future development 
of our country and for world peace he said 
the late emperor hirohito akihitos father announced to the 
nation on aug 15 1945 that japan would surrender to the allies 
akihito led tuesdays ceremony in a minute of silence at noon 
the exact moment that hirohitos voice was broadcast 
about 90 members of parliament from the governing liberal 
democratic party also visited the yasukuni shrine kyodo news 
service reported 
last year prime minister noboru takeshita did not visit yasukuni 
on the war anniversary his predecessor yasuhiro nakasone visited 
the shrine in 1985 but later discontinued the visits because of 
strong opposition from china and other neighboring nations 
the chinese and other nations in the region are wary of any signs 
of growing japanese militarism in a prewar conquest japan seized 
manchuria from china in 1931 
in his statement marking tuesdays anniversary kaifu said 
those who did not return did not die in vain as we take the 
lessons of the war closely to heart and pledge to work for world 
peace and the prosperity and harmony of our country in international 
society

so we have no specifics on that at this point 
but generally speaking we have used military assets as you know 
weve used helicopters for example in i believe it was bolivia 
and perhaps peru 
and were were were interested in all of this but i dont 
think you can inflict force on a country and i wouldnt i 
wouldnt want to be a part of that at all 
yeah 
q mr president 
q mr president you talked about conflicting signals coming out 
of iran as a result of your diplomatic efforts 
a well im not sure its a result of it but there are 
conflicting signals coming out of iran 
q coincident with 
a ok 
q your diplomatic efforts id like to ask do you believe 
that president rafsanjani is firmly in charge in iran how long are 
you prepared to give this diplomatic process before trying some 
other means or effort 
a well please elaborate 
what do you mean before trying some other means im not 
sure 
q well there are those there are those who believe that there 
should be stronger military messages 
a yeah 
q sent 
a i dont know the answer to your first part of it and i dont 
know any expert in this government that does 
i had a meeting with various agency experts on iran and i think 
the jury is still out as to the what has happened internally there 
in iran 
i think all our experts feel that there are some hopeful signs 
and i would cite some of the comments by mr rafsanjani 
and then youve seen some countersigns one as recently as 
yesterday by mr khamenei 
and there are others their interior minister who seems to be 
very hard over 
so i think we dont know yet we dont know how it is sorting 
out 
but again i would go back to the earlier answer that thats 
fine that can move forward 
but if i find some other channel or action that would get our 
hostages out of there i wouldnt wait on sorting out the internal 
affairs of iran 
yeah 
q if i can follow though just how long are you prepared to 
wait and would you consider stepping up military pressure in this 
process and to what extent do you hold iran responsible for the 
safety of these hostages 
a well again were trying to sort out there certainly i 
think that if iran decided they wanted those hostages to come out of 
there there would be a good likelihood that that would happen 
perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood

older people who accept the stereotype 
that theyre supposed to be forgetful are more likely to be so a 
researcher says 
a younger person is likely to attribute memory problems to 
inattention or a task being difficult while an elderly person often 
says well i had trouble with that because im old said robin 
west a university of florida psychology professor and author of the 
book memory fitness over 40 
in a new study ms west hopes that combining memoryimproving 
techniques with a different set of beliefs about aging will bring 
longterm changes 
were not going to try to convince people that aging doesnt 
change memory it does she said monday 
if older adults avoid memory tasks theyre likely to lose 
these skills because their lifestyles often are less demanding than 
those of younger people ms west said their boss isnt asking 
them to do a complex job and they arent supervising their 
childrens activities 
the first memory skill people are likely to lose as they get 
older is mental speed other early problems are difficulty 
concentrating and retrieving information such as feeling someones 
name is on the tipofthetongue she said 
imagery is one technique ms west suggests to improve memory 
grocery lists can be memorized for example by matching pictures of 
food with each item on the list and mentally linking the pictures 
she said 
older adults have as many stereotypes about aging and memory as 
young people do she said many believe that age brings memory 
decline and that it is more pervasive and serious than it often is

and so as you know the position of the united states government 
has been that iran and a couple of other states have been involved 
in the state sponsorship of terrorism 
and so i dont think its a question of how long its a 
question of not in my view its a question of exploring every 
avenue to get these people back and recognizing that at some point 
we have to stand up for our interests even if it means military 
and yet im not threatening military action because ive told 
you some of the constraints on authorizing military action 
q your budget director said over the weekend that the fed ought 
to be a little bit less concerned about inflation and more concerned 
about recession and perhaps let loose on interest rates do you 
agree with that 
a listen i dont know of any president now or in the past who 
doesnt favor lower interest rates 
that is thats the american way 
but you also have to be concerned about inflationary pressures 
i thought what dick darman said was very balanced and very i 
can feel very comfortable with his sallying forth and saying that 
and i think ive said essentially the same thing in the past 
q mr president 
q mr darman also suggested that the fed might be responsible 
for any recession down the road if interest rates dont come down 
do you agree with that sir 
a well id like to go back because i dont recall that part of 
it and take that under advisement and let you know at a later date 
laughter 
yeah 
q mr president are you what is the united states doing if 
anything to try and stop the destruction of beirut thats under 
way is this is it a fear that if the syrians succeed in driving 
the christians out that would seriously set back any progress 
thats been made on settling the west bank and gaza problem 
a the answer to your last question is yes and the answer to the 
first part is joining others in calling for a ceasefire and the 
withdrawal of all foreign forces support for the arab league 
mission which regrettably has hit an impasse right now but 
encouraging those three countries involved to reenergize that 
initiative joining where we can i had a long talk with the 
secretary general to see what role the united nations can play 
and indeed i might take this opportunity to thank him for his 
timely dispatch of his emissary to the middle east although that 
wasnt a mission about lebanon it had to do with colonel higgins 
i was deeply appreciative of his taking that action 
so we are in a very complicated situation in the lebanon where 
i am not sure any outside power can do other than exort people in 
the country to have the ceasefire and to withdraw foreign forces 
and then to take a look at whatever constitutional change is 
necessary so you have a representation there that all factions in 
lebanon can feel comfortable with 
and its a long process 
and in the meantime i am literally heartbroken i have bored 
some of you with this but i have been to the lebanon when i was in 
business and i recall it as the peaceful oasis in a thentroubled 
middle east 
and i saw christians living peacefully with the muslims and some 
day again i would like to think that the lebanon can be restored 
to that

two cosmonauts will reactivate the mir 
space station in september after four months in mothballs and 
theyll try out a new space motorcycle and shower and install a 
docking port for the soviet space shuttle officials said tuesday 
alexander s viktorenko the flight commander and alexander a 
serebrov the flight engineer are to blast off sept 6 to resume 
the soviet manned space program that was put on hold because of 
tight finances and technical delays 
among the highlights of the sixmonth mission will be a ride 
outside mir in a space motorcycle alexander n balandin a 
backup engineer for the flight said the motorcycle is similar to 
the manned maneuvering unit used by us space shuttle astronauts 
it can travel up to 50 yards away from mir for 23 hours at a 
time he told a news conference at the gagarin cosmonaut training 
center in star city about 25 miles east of moscow 
soviet officials have said cosmonauts will use the craft to 
inspect mirs exterior repair satellites and as a rescue vehicle 
mir the showcase of the soviet space program launched in 
february 1986 was designed to be manned permanently but was 
unexpectedly vacated april 27 when three cosmonauts returned to 
earth 
officials have said the mir was mothballed to save money and 
because two new modules including one containing the motorcycle 
were not ready 
the soviet space program has come under fire for lavish spending 
at a time when the country is suffering a 192 billion budget 
deficit and chronic shortages of consumer goods and food serebrov 
said the lapse in the program saved an estimated 32 million 
including the cost of a supply ship that would have been needed as 
well as a crew transport capsule and rocket booster 
unfortunately the calculations are such now that when a 
cosmonaut doesnt fly we economize and its advantageous were 
working toward a situation where a cosmonaut flies and there will be 
only profit said anatoly y solovyev another backup cosmonaut 
for the mission 
a 20ton module containing the cycle a new space shower and 
wider more comfortable airlock for space walks will be launched in 
october and attached to mir serebrov said the cosmonauts plan to 
try out the new cycle at some point during the mission while wearing 
a new more flexible spacesuit 
alexei a leonov the training centers deputy director and a 
former cosmonaut said he had worked with soviet engineers to 
develop a space motorcycle in the early 1970s but the project was 
canceled because some wise guy said it wasnt needed 
a second module with a special docking port to receive the new 
soviet shuttle buran and equipment to grow crystals for electronics 
in the weightlessness of space is to be launched in february 
serebrov said 
buran a carbon copy of the us shuttle flew for the first time 
in november without a crew leonov said the shuttle wont fly again 
until 1991 at the earliest and then will be launched without a crew 
to link up with mir using the new docking port it could return to 
earth carrying cosmonauts leonov said 
the 20ton mir already has one module attached to it a space 
observation laboratory called kvant mir has docking ports for three 
more modules 
serebrov a veteran of two flights and viktorenko who flew once 
before are to blast off at night aboard a soyuz rocket from the 
baikonur space center in the central asian republic of kazakhstan 
leonov said 
balandin and solovyov are to join the two aboard mir in early 
march and work with them for a week said viktorenko 43 he said he 
and serebrov 45 will then return to earth 
mir has been manned for 880 days since its launch with four 
resident crews cosmonauts vladimir titov and musa manarov broke 
space endurance records by staying aboard for one year

irans foreign minister repeated his 
nations frequent denial of any link with hostages in lebanon but 
he also indicated tuesday that talks might follow if israel frees a 
kidnapped shiite moslem cleric 
president bush adopted a conciliatory tone saying in washington 
the iranians have it in their power to get american hostages 
released and rejoin the family of law abiding nations 
sixteen westerners are missing in lebanon including eight 
americans and most are believed held by shiite groups loyal to iran 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati thought to be among 
the pragmatists led by president hashemi rafsanjani said talks 
with the syrians will not have anything to do with the hostage 
issue since this issue does not concern us he spoke to reporters 
after meeting with foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
official media in damascus indicated however that president 
hafez assad and other syrian leaders were pressing the iranians for 
action on the hostages syria was irans main arab ally in its 
eightyear war with iraq in which a truce was reached a year ago 
velayati said israel must free the proiranian cleric sheik 
abdul karim obeid without conditions 
israel kidnapped obeid from south lebanon on july 28 it has 
offered to trade him and hundreds of other lebanese shiite prisoners 
for three israeli soldiers held captive in lebanon and the western 
hostages 
bush said in washington we dont have to be hostile with iran 
for the rest of our lives weve had a good relationship with them 
in the past theyre of strategic importance theyd be welcome back 
into the family of lawabiding nonterroristsponsoring nations 
he said the best signal iran could give the united states of its 
intention to improve relations would be to bring about the release 
of the americans 
i think that if iran decided they wanted those hostages to come 
out of there there would be a good likelihood that that would 
happen bush said 
in another apparent signal to tehran the united states told the 
world court it would be willing to participate in a suit brought by 
iran over the shooting down of an iranian passenger plane in july 
1988 by a us navy ship in the persian gulf 
velayati who arrived monday for talks on the fighting between 
syrians and chrstians in lebanon said we hope sheik obeid will 
be released this release should take place without any prior 
conditions no talks no discussions before sheik obeid is 
released 
syria has been instrumental in past hostage releases and has 
promised washington to help resolve the crisis surrounding obeids 
abduction 
after talks with the foreign minister velayati met with assad 
and delivered a letter from rafsanjani who has indicated 
flexibility on the hostage issue since his inauguration the day 
obeid was kidnapped the contents were not disclosed 
accompanying velayati to damascus was one of his deputies 
hussein sheikholeslam a hardliner with close links to hezbollah 
or party of god the group thought to sponsor shiite kidnap gangs in 
lebanon 
sheikholeslam was a leader of iranian militants who stormed the 
us embassy in tehran in november 1979 and held 52 amricans hostage 
for 444 days 
velayati also met in damascus with hezbollah leaders including 
sheik mohammad hussein fadlallah the movements spiritual adviser 
fadlallah said friday that all hostages should be freed 
britain asked iran to release businessman roger cooper after 
nearly four years of detention so he can attend his mothers funeral 
saturday cooper 53 was detained in november 1985 for overstaying 
his visa and later was accused of spying but no charges have been 
filed his mother died aug 3 
tehran newspapers denounced the united states on tuesday 
kayhan international an englishlanguage daily said for bush to 
pin hopes on irans assistance to free the hostages without 
respecting tehrans conditions is wishful thinking 
it said iran rejects indirect talks through pakistan an islamic 
neighbor with which tehran is forging new links because of 
washingtons insolent tone 
foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan of pakistan was scheduled 
to arrive in tehran on wednesday for a threeday visit 
kayhan said the release of billions of dollars in iranian assets 
the united states froze in 1979 would be taken only as a goodwill 
gesture not as an tradeoff for help in freeing the hostages 
abrar a radical daily said the return of iranian assets and 
properties is the indisputable and lawful right of the islamic 
republic and is not something to be bargained over 
last week the englishlanguage tehran times said iran would be 
willing to help free the hostages if the assets were released

the money was gone but the workers figured 
alice wilson would still like to have back the purse they found 
behind an old department store cabinet they were right found 
nearly two decades after it was stolen it was like her own personal 
time capsule 
there were pictures an address book old telephone numbers 
memories 
the construction workers who found it chuck williams and tracy 
johnston eventually found ms wilson using the phone numbers 
to ensure that they would recognize her they studied her 
photograph 
they were surprised they said you sure look different 
said ms wilson whose permed dark hair has replaced the large afro 
she once wore they said i looked much better 
it was my favorite purse at the time because it was given to me 
for my birthday ms wilson now 39 said tuesday never in a 
million years did i think i would get that purse back 
inside was her learners permit for driving there were photos of 
her high school sweetheart her girlfriends from high school there 
was her thennew social security card and her thennew voter 
registration card along with goldcolored lipstick and makeup 
there was a photo of her mother smoking a cigarette ms wilson 
happily said her mom has since given up the habit 
then there was a photo of herself as a much younger woman 
wearing red bellbottom pants a halter top and platform shoes in 
another she wore a mini dress 
it brought back memories said ms wilson of forestville 
md who now works as a congressional liaison for the department of 
the army 
when she found the photo of her cousin larry a vietnam veteran 
she said a wave of combined sadness and joy came over her 
so many young people were killed in vietnam she said i 
was so glad that he made it back 
ms wilson said she and her sorority sisters some of whom are 
pictured in another photo will have a 20year reunion sept 23 
its gamma theta rho or is it beta rho she questioned 
its been a long time 
a thief had apparently stolen her purse from a locker 19 years 
ago when she worked as a secretary at the lansburghs department 
store the abandoned building is being torn down 
the thief took 60 her weekly pay she said and apparently 
tossed the purse atop the tall wooden cabinet in the basement of 
the store 
and there it stayed through the years until the workers moved 
that cabinet 
its like a dream come true a fantasy to have people you 
dont even know to bring back good memories ms wilson said it 
goes to show that we do have some good samaritans

q id like to follow up 
q mr president if i could follow up there are reports that 
the united states does not want to pressure syria to back off 
because we need their help to get the hostages out 
a thats wrong 
i never heard such a report but if there is such a report youve 
heard it is wrong 
yeah 
q mr president in the interview last week i believe with 
hearst newspapers you seemed to say that you would be willing to 
kidnap general noriega to bring him to justice is that your policy 
and would that be an appropriate thing for the united states 
government to do 
a we have an indictment out against general noriega for drug 
trafficking 
i am told that its a good indictment that its an indepth 
indictment and im not saying what i would do or wouldnt do 
but there was a case where a man named yusef i believe younis 
younis was apprehended and brought to justice 
and i have an obligation to try to bring people to justice 
q well are there any constraints on what means you use even 
though theres a legal indictment or are there limits on what would 
be appropriate in enforcing such an indictment 
a theres always limits theres always limits in matters of 
this nature 
and the limits as far as im concerned are the lives of first 
of americans and clearly innocent life 
youve got to consider those things when you go about whatever it 
is hostages or the trying to bring mr noriega to justice 
q mr president 
q mr president there was some talk of sending the green berets 
to south america do you think 
a what was that question 
q sending the green berets 
a yeah 
q there has been some talk of sending green berets to south 
america do you think that the dea is enough to do this job or not 
and why 
a to do the job of of helping at the source 
well you have to look at it countrybycountry and then i could 
tell you a little more about what the problem is 
some of the countries are faced with enormously wellorganized 
and financed insurgencies 
some of them are faced with the most highly financed cartels 
and so youd have to look individually 
and theres dea isnt big enough or strong enough to solve the 
problems in these various south american countries they can help a 
lot and in some areas they have been very very helpful 
but i dont think that the dea alone can solve the problems of 
the cartels in colombia for example 
q are you considering sending the green berets to south america 
a no no im not considering that 
q mr president 
marlin fitzwater final question 
q on the drug plan 
bush this is the final question marlin says 
q inaudible 
a prevacation question 
q secretary bennett has indicated that part of the drug plan is 
to hold casual users of drugs accountable given that many many 
state prisons are overflowing and indeed the federal system has no 
more room at the present time what type of accountability are you 
looking for would it be jail time or something short of that 
a well it depends what the you know what the penalty is for 
the crime involved 
and the tolerance though of casual users or the excusing of 
one echelon of society for using drugs and then going after another 
is unacceptable in a national strategy 
and so id say wed have to look at the individual individual 
case 
but i think the day of tolerance for those who break the law in 
using drugs is over and should be over 
and so we will try to make the punishment fit the crime if you 
will

q one more mr president 
a thank you all very much 
i hate to go laughter but i have to go 
q what are you going do about felix bloch mr president what 
about bloch 
q do you have any political advice for mario cuomo laughter 
a let the legal process go on without a lot of hype 
thats what i suggest on felix 
q mr president are you a little concerned about raising 
expectations on drugs 
a no im not because i think the time has come to encourage 
every element in our society the teacher the family the local 
community the state the federal government to pitch in 
so i am not 
i think it is time that we recognize there is a major national 
program problem there are signs that some things can happen 
through education and i cite the decline in cocaine use 
and i think given that ray of hope we ought to put on a 
fullcourt press not just in the federal government but all across 
society to try to solve this problem 
q but isnt your reputation largely on the line given the 
promise you made at the inaugural 
a far more important than my reputation is can we solve this 
problem can we make progress against this scourge 
and so be it thats the way it is

when the moon moves into the earths shadow 
wednesday night creating a total eclipse visible to perhaps a 
billion people art whipple will fire a laser beam at a 
breadboxsized reflector on the lunar surface a quarter of a million 
miles away 
if the astronomer is successful tiny particles of light will 
jump back across the vast distance and be captured by telescopes at 
the mcdonald observatory near fort davis texas 
if hes not successful whipple says hell still enjoy the lunar 
eclipse a rare opportunity to watch the full moon change from a 
bright silver to a polished copper or faint orange or perhaps 
even vanish from view 
people on the continents bordering the atlantic ocean will have a 
chance to see some phase of the lunar eclipse it will start at 823 
pm edt and end about 5 hours later 
it will be the first full lunar eclipse since december 1982 and 
the next one will not occur until december 1992 
in the united states the east coast will have the best viewing 
if skies are clear while alaska will miss it altogether in the 
central mountain and western time zones the eclipse will be under 
way already by the time the moon becomes visible moonrise in 
chicago for instance is at 743 pm cdt twenty minutes after the 
eclipse begins and in los angeles the moon rises at 735 pm pdt 
when the eclipse is already in totality 
cloudy skies could spoil the celestial show for much of the east 
wednesday forecasts call for thundershowers observers may have 
better luck in the central and western areas of the country where 
clear to partly cloudy skies are predicted for most areas 
with good local weather some phase of the spectacle should be 
visible to observers in north and south america western europe and 
africa and the antarctic sailors at sea in the atlantic and in the 
eastern pacific ocean also will be able to see part of the eclipse 
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow 
created by the earth blocking the suns light the moon in its 
orbit of the earth usually passes above or below this shadowline 
for whipple the total eclipse is precious opportunity to fire 
laser beams at a darkened full moon 
the university of texas and mcdonald observatory astronomer will 
be firing the laser at a reflector placed near a lunar feature 
called hadley rille in 1971 by the apollo 15 astronauts 
anytime the moon sites are available we fire the laser he 
said in a telephone interview but whipple said it is impossible to 
see the laser reflection from a full moon because the natural 
surface reflects sunlight so powerfully only during an eclipse he 
said can mcdonald scientists detect light reflecting from the 
apollo instruments 
by clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laser 
to the moon and then back to the mcdonald telescopes scientists are 
able to precisely measure the distance between the earth and its 
moon 
whipple said in the years since astronomers have been laser 
ranging to the apollo reflectors they have discovered that the moon 
is moving away from the earth at the rate of about two inches a 
year the mean distance between the earth and moon is about 230000 
miles 
but even without the laser experiment whipple said the 
astronomers are eagerly awaiting the eclipse 
were looking forward to the show he said 
during an eclipse the moon can appear to be a bright coppery red 
if there is clean air between the lunar surface and the observer on 
earth if smoke or dust obscure the view the moon can dim to an 
faint orange color or even fade from view altogether 
dust from volcanic eruptions can contribute to the color but 
astronomers say that enough time has passed since the last major 
volcanic eruption that most dust has settled 
the eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the 
penumbra the outer fringe of the earths shadow this phase shows 
as a grayish shading of the moon half an hour later the moon edges 
into the umbra the dark central part of the shadow total eclipse 
when all of the moon is covered by the umbra will begin at about 
1020 pm edt and last for one hour 36 minutes 
when the moon leaves the umbra the events will occur in reverse 
order the eclipse ends about 153 am edt when the moon edges out 
of the shadow altogether and regains its customary bright silver 
color

growing understanding about aids is building 
americans confidence in the safety of the nations blood supply 
but many still believe it is likely they could get the disease by 
receiving or donating blood said a poll released tuesday 
the poll conducted for the american association of blood banks 
found that 66 percent think the blood supply is safer today than 
five years ago up from 56 percent last year and 44 percent in 1985 
when screening for aids in blood donations began 
the survey shows the american public understands the steps 
being taken to protect the blood supply said laurence a sherman 
president of the association 
he said however gaps remain in the publics understanding 
more than half of those surveyed 52 percent said they believe 
it is unlikely they could get aids from a blood transfusion 
however 44 percent considered it likely 
in fact sherman said the chances of getting aids from a 
transfusion are extremely low since 1985 public health officials 
estimate that about 60 people have been infected with the virus 
through transfusions a tiny fraction of the 4 million to 5 million 
transfusions performed each year in the united states 
were not happy with 60 but that is far lower than the 
30000 that are believed to have been infected before procedures 
were initiated to screen out aidscontaminated blood said gilbert 
clark executive director of the association 
the american public wants zero risk but zero risk is 
unattainable as with any medical procedure he said 
blood banks receive about 12 million blood donations a year 
threequarters of those polled said it was unlikely someone could 
get aids from donating blood but 20 percent erroneously believed it 
was likely 
sherman noted that the proportion of the public believing aids 
could be transmitted while giving blood has dropped from 34 percent 
in 1985 but he said this faulty belief has made if more difficult 
to recruit blood donors 
overall the nations blood supply is marginal and the amount 
of blood in the system has been unchanged for the last several years 
he said that donating takes more time today than it did before 
1985 because blood banks require more detailed questioning of donors 
as part of the aidsscreening efforts blood that is donated is also 
subjected to an antibody test to detect presence of the aids virus 
for the second year in a row the survey found that aids was 
ranked as the most serious health problem facing the country ahead 
of cancer heart disease and drug abuse however fewer 31 percent 
this year compared with 36 percent last year gave it top ranking 
black americans were the only group that showed increasing 
concern about aids with 48 percent ranking it as the top health 
problem up from 42 percent last year 
among the other findings 
contracting aids through a transfusion and difficulties during 
recurperation shared second place each cited by 17 percent as the 
greatest concerns in the case of an operation the top concern 27 
percent was complications due to errors made by doctors and medical 
staff sixteen percent cited complications from anesthesia 
41 percent said they feel they have a lot of accurate 
information about aids up 4 points from last year and 20 points 
since 1985 
16 percent of those polled said they personally knew someone 
infected with the aids virus but 82 said they did not 
91 percent said favored criminal penalties for people who donate 
blood even when they know they are infected with the aids virus 
82 percent would require mandatory reporting to health officials 
the names of people who test positive for aids and 81 percent would 
require mandatory testing of highrisk groups such as drug users 
homosexuals and prostitutes 
the telephone poll conducted by hamilton amp staff of washington 
dc surveyed 1000 randomly selected adults between june 23 and 
july 6 the sampling error for the survey is plus or minus 3 
percentage points

the 6monthold trial of night stalker 
murder defendant richard ramirez took another bizarre twist when a 
juror deliberating the case was slain in an apparent domestic 
dispute 
the body of phyllis singletary a 30yearold telephone employee 
was found monday afternoon in her home neighbors reported hearing 
fighting and gunshots in her apartment friday night and early 
saturday 
authorities were seeking her livein boyfriend james cecil 
melton 51 for questioning said sheriffs deputy bill wehner 
superior court judge michael tynan who dismissed a juror last 
week for sleeping during deliberations at ramirezs trial on 13 
murder charges replaced ms singletary with an alternate today and 
sent the panel home for the day 
the judge warned that the slaying apparently had nothing to do 
with this case and does not add or diminish to the evidence of 
whether mr ramirez is guilty or innocent 
both the defense and prosecution expressed a desire to avoid a 
mistrial but defense attorney ray clark said he wants jurors to be 
polled on whether they feel they are able to go forward the jury 
returns wednesday 
prosecutors allege ramirez a 29yearold drifter from el paso 
texas is the devilworshiping night stalker who raped robbed 
and murdered people in their southern california homes in 1985 
the jury began deliberations july 26 but was ordered to start 
over after the one member was dismissed monday was to have been the 
first day of the new deliberations but ms singletary didnt show

advocates for improved prenatal health care 
said tuesday that spending 400 for expectant mother services can 
save a thousand times that amount in lifetime care costs for a low 
birthweight infant 
pointing out that the infant mortality rate in the united states 
is the worst of any of the 18 industrialized nations the national 
commission to prevent infant mortality called for universal 
access to early maternity and pediatric care for all mothers and 
infants 
in a report issued this month the commission said employers 
should make sure the health insurance they offer covers maternity 
and wellbaby care and called on the government to assume the 
responsibility for those who dont have insurance 
we can spend the money now or we can spend a lot more later 
said the report the costs of prenatal care care that can 
prevent low birthweight can be as little as 400 per mother 
the lifetime costs of caring for a low birthweight infant can 
reach 400000 
low birthweight is the leading cause of infant deaths and chronic 
and disabling illness the commission said low birthweight babies 
are those born at less than five and a half pounds 
this is very serious business dr reed tuckson commissioner 
of health for the district of columbia he said the infant mortality 
rate for blacks is twice that for whites and named the crack cocaine 
problem as the reason for a recent increase in infant deaths in the 
district 
he and other panelists appeared for an infant mortality symposium 
sponsored by the congressional black associates and the young black 
professionals at the capitol 
the group acknowledged that a tight federal budget meant little 
money for prenatal care programs and tuckson pointed out that much 
of the funding for public health concerns was now going to find a 
cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
but the panel said publicity could do a lot to get expectant 
mothers to available health care facilities

with the collapse of complete communist 
control of parliament the once docile united peasants party has 
emerged as an independent political force whose leaders seem 
determined to play a major role 
prime minister gen czeslaw kiszczak said monday he is ready to 
give up trying to form a government in favor of roman malinowski 
the leader of the peasant party 
malinowski who has favored continuing his partys historical 
alliance with the communist party would be asked to create a 
cabinet composed of representatives of all forces in parliament 
according to kiszczak 
but the 54yearold economist who has led the party since 1981 
and was among top communist coalition candidates who were defeated 
in june parliamentary elections faces opposition from peasant 
lawmakers in parliament who fear reprisals at the polls if the 
partys links with the unpopular communists are not cut 
led by aleksander bentkowski their independentminded 
parliamentary floor leader at least one third of the 76 peasant 
deputies favor forming a coalition government with solidarity 
as the thirdlargest group in parliament in which neither the 
larger communists or solidarity lawmakers holds a majority the 
peasants suddenly have been catapulted into the role of kingmaker 
the split between the party leadership and its representatives in 
parliament comes as the peasants search for a new identity in 
response to voter disenchantment with the old party model and with 
an eye to completely free elections promised in the future 
the peasant movement in poland has deep roots with the first 
organized polish peasant party founded in rzeszow then in 
austriaruled galicia in 1895 rzeszow now in southeast poland 
remains a center of rural activism 
before and after world war ii the party advocated land reform to 
free the peasantry from the control of large wealthy landowners in 
prewar poland it was an important political force with its leader 
wincenty witos serving as premier three times 
one of its leaders stanislaw mikolajczyk also headed the polish 
governmentinexile in london during world war ii 
the polish peasants party enjoyed a brief period of independent 
activity in poland after world war ii but the communist party that 
swept to power as a result of soviet military might forced the 
merger of the independent party known as the psl with a 
procommunist peasant party the sl in 1949 to form the zsl as 
the united peasant party is now known 
in that era of stalinist purges independent peasant leaders were 
forced to flee the country step down or bend to communist rule 
in the most notorious case mikolajczyk the wartime premier and 
only member of the london government to risk coming back to poland 
after the war to join a communistled coalition fled in 1947 when 
it became clear he was facing arrest and a show trial 
he was denounced as a spy and lost his citizenship in 1949 only 
this year was his citizenship restored posthumously by the council 
of state 
for most of the history of the polish peoples republic the 
peasant party like the other minor party the democrats has 
obediently followed communist policy 
in the last decade as a result of political reforms the peasant 
party has been allowed to develop a more independent policy while 
still acknowledging the communist partys leading role it 
traditionally has exercised broad powers in rural areas and often 
holds the ministry of agriculture 
the zsl claims a membership of 500000 and says it represents the 
interests of farmers 
peasant deputies resenting communist domination of the policies 
of their own party were critical of malinowskis defense of 
continued obedience to the communists at a caucus last week 
deputies favoring a coalition with solidarity also have said 
their constituents resented kiszczaks election as prime minister 
because it left the impression that nothing has changed despite 
solidaritys victory at the polls in june 
the internal revolt within the zsl took on a new dimension 
tuesday as 120 peasant activists from around the country met in 
warsaw and decided to resume the activities of mikolajczyks old 
psl which was declared illegal in 1947 the state news agency pap 
said 
participants who included representatives from rural solidarity 
the independent farmers union said the party would be revived on 
the basis of the program adopted by the psl in 1946

protested as marines stormed a cityowned beach on lake erie on 
tuesday in a recruitment drive 
just to see the vast majority of people here getting up early 
and watching us makes me proud of the service i do in the marine 
corps said staff sgt sam adkins of chattanooga tenn 
i feel its my job to protect the people i see here said 
adkins dressed in full combat gear and with his face blackened with 
camouflage 
police capt cel rivera estimated that 10000 people turned out 
at lakeview beach to watch a company of about 100 marines board four 
landing craft from the uss boulder and land on the beach in a 
morning mist 
fifteen people staged a silent protest at a gazebo overlooking 
the beach holding antiwar placards and distributing literature 
this whole thing is so silly the idea that you can make a war 
a carnival said the rev steve hammond a copastor at first 
baptist church in oberlin 
the protesters represented various groups including the lorain 
county peace and justice commission clergy and laity concerned and 
the baptist peace fellowship 
but most of the crowd cheered the marines and scampered across 
the beach to inspect the landing craft 
i liked it said gary jones of westlake who was holding his 
1yearold son bradford jones said he wanted to see where your 
tax dollar goes 
gov richard celeste had refused the marines permission to land 
june 24 at clevelands edgewater state park as part of a 20city 
recruiting promotion tour of the great lakes region 
celeste whose action was denounced by veterans groups said the 
landing would be an inappropriate use of the park 
after the marines landed and held a brief formation they mixed 
with the crowd which included families sitting on picnic blankets 
and a navy band playing jazz music

fw de klerk became acting 
president tuesday and pledged faster action on limited racial policy 
reforms begun by his predecessor pw botha but did not say what 
he would do 
there is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a new era 
in south africa history offers us a unique opportunity for peaceful 
solutions de klerk said at the brief swearingin ceremony in 
pretoria 
archbishop desmond tutu a leading critic of the government 
said all he is doing is giving a new face to apartheid 
the transition is just a change of initials from pw to fw 
said the black anglican church leader who won the 1984 nobel peace 
prize for his work against apartheid 
in washington the state department said it hoped for an active 
dialogue with the new leadership on ending apartheid the official 
policy of racial discrimination it held out the possibility of a 
visit by de klerk who also heads the governing national party 
botha who led south africa for 11 often turbulent years 
resigned monday night after repeated confrontations with his cabinet 
national party leaders tried to persuade the 73yearold 
president to leave gracefully after he suffered a stroke jan 18 
but botha refused his stubborn defiant manner resulted in 
embarrassing public battles likely to hurt the party in 
parliamentary elections sept 6 
there was no evidence of policy disputes with the cabinet but 
younger leaders appeared to believe bothas age health and growing 
political isolation made him unable to continue the gradual limited 
reforms he introduced in the early 1980s 
after nationwide black unrest developed in 1984 botha 
increasingly turned away from reform and relied on repression to 
stifle black political demands 
de klerk praised botha on tuesday for starting reform 
his greatest gift to south africa is the fact that he has put 
our country on the road to fundamental reform that he has 
successfully started pulling south africa out of its deadend 
streets he told reporters after being sworn in by chief justice 
michael corbett 
he repeated his intention to speed reform but did not pledge 
specific action on such major apartheid issues as sharing power with 
blacks who outnumber whites 28 million to 5 million and have no 
voice in national affairs 
we want to build a new south africa in which all people 
participate in decisions affecting their lives at all levels de 
klerk said 
i trust that the people of south africa will show the courage 
and vision required to break the cycle of conflict tension and 
isolation that has gripped us for so long 
since taking over from botha in february as leader of the 
national party which has governed since 1948 de klerk has stressed 
the need for immediate reform to end south africas deep racial 
divisions and international isolation 
his speeches are more conciliatory than bothas his personal 
style affable rather than confrontational at age 53 he belongs to 
a younger generation more receptive to change 
through 17 years in politics however he has been a loyal 
supporter of the national party including limited race reforms 
that reject majority rule de klerk has not set himself apart from 
any botha policies and has yet to name apartheid laws he would 
repeal 
the african national congress the main guerrilla movement 
fighting white supremacy said botha dedicated his life to the 
construction of the apartheid system and its defense at all costs 
he has brought death and destruction to millions of people in 
south africa and the rest of the region through a systematic 
campaign of brutal repression general secretary alfred nzo said 
in lusaka zambia where the group has its headquarters 
south african media also had harsh words about the former 
president 
the last image that will linger for many years is that of a 
blind samson who with his last strength tried to overturn the 
pillars of his party on himself and his own companions said 
beeld an afrikaanslanguage daily that had supported botha 
although the national party is favored in next months elections 
it is expected to lose ground to both the antiapartheid democratic 
party on its left and the segregationist conservative party on its 
right 
de klerk said he will convene a new parliament a week after the 
election if the nationalists win he is expected to become 
president for a full fiveyear term

president bush said tuesday he could not claim 
american hostages in lebanon were any closer to freedom despite an 
intense diplomatic effort but that there was a good likelihood 
they could come home if iran wanted them released 
renewing his appeal for assistance from the new leaders in 
tehran bush said we dont have to be hostile with iran for the 
rest of our lives weve had a good relationship with them in the 
past before breaking off relations a decade ago 
iran accused by the united states of sponsoring terrorism is 
the major bankroller of hezbollah the radical group thought to be 
an umbrella for various factions of the hostageholders 
i think that if iran wanted those hostages to come out of 
there there would be a good likelihood that that would happen 
perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood the president 
said 
he said that there were limits on possible military action to 
free the hostages that he did not want to see innocent people 
killed and would have to weigh the risks to us forces that would 
be involved 
but if i could find a way to take those hostages get them and 
bring them out and that required using the military force of the 
united states make no mistake about it i would do it in an 
instant the president said 
at some point we have to stand up for our interests even if it 
means military yet im not threatening military action he said 
bush discussed the hostage situation in a halfhour news 
conference on the eve of his departure for a threeweek vacation at 
his seaside compound at kennebunkport maine 
he promised that one day after his labor day return to 
washington he would unveil a new antidrug program that is 
balanced decisive effective and achievable 
bush said the program would require more federal spending but not 
higher taxes adding that the money would be diverted from other 
programs 
while the hostage crisis and to a lesser extent drugs 
dominated the news conference he commented on other subjects 
ranging including economic policy and panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega the president 
refused to rule out the possibility of abducting noriega to 
stand trial in the united states on drugtrafficking charges i 
have an obligation to try to bring people to justice bush said 
pronounced himself very comfortable with budget director 
richard darmans comment that the federal reserve was keeping 
interest rates too high to permit sustained growth 
however when asked if he agreed with darman that the fed would 
be responsible for any recession if interest rates dont drop bush 
sidestepped saying i dont recall that part of it and ill take 
that under advisement and let you know at a later date 
said he wished the legal process could proceed without a lot 
of hype in the case of felix bloch a state department official 
suspected of espionage bloch has not been charged 
eulogized reps mickey leland dtexas and larkin smith 
rmiss who died in separate plane crashes he said they were 
fine individuals who represented a deep caring for the poor the 
disadvantaged the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other 
areas of our society that need improving 
the plight of the eight americans held hostage in lebanon was 
pushed to the fore after israeli commandos seized a moslem cleric in 
lebanon sheik abdul karim obeid on july 28 in response a group 
called the organization of the oppressed on earth contended it had 
hanged american marine lt col william higgins 
asked if the american hostages were any closer to freedom now as 
a result of the developments of the past few weeks bush said i 
cant say that today but were going to keep on trying 
bush said that with hashemi rafsanjani assuming the presidency of 
iran we hear different signals coming out of iran some in the 
old monde and then some that offer more hope 
he said the release of the hostages would send a clear and good 
signal of irans intentions adding that there are many ways 
that countries who are estranged can get back together from 
diplomatic relations or a wide array of other things 
asked if the united states might seek the extradition of obeid 
who has been said to have been instrumental in higgins abduction 
bush said we have no indictment against obeid 
later bush said if the justice system goes forward and there 
is an indictment against him i would be remiss if i didnt try to 
see him brought to trial 
bush seemed caught off guard momentarily when a questioner asked 
why the united states had not retaliated for higgins death 
if i could find some action diplomatic military private 
sector public sector that i thought would help get the hostages 
out or guard against future hostage taking i would take such 
action he said

vietnamese refugees in hong kongs teeming 
detention centers are in danger of dying because of malnutrition and 
disease the top un refugee official in the colony said tuesday 
robert van leeuwen called for better food and a massive 
immunization campaign for boat people being housed on an outlying 
island and on five ferries in hong kongs harbor 
also on tuesday 124 vietnamese refugees convinced their quest 
for a new life is over have volunteered to return to the country 
they fled 
the group ranging from elderly women to four babies is 
scheduled to fly to vietnam on thursday in the biggest such 
repatriation of boat people since the first group left in march 
van leeuwen based his statements on a preliminary report by un 
officials about camps housing 6700 of hong kongs 51000 boat 
people 
large numbers of children in a camp at tai a chau island and the 
ferries were suffering from borderline malnutrition van leeuwen 
said although he not say how many 
when you have a population which has become weakened through 
belowstandard levels of nutrition they become very vulnerable to an 
outbreak of disease which could have life threatening 
consequences he said they cannot be expected to continue much 
longer with the diet provided 
van leeuwens statement is one of several recent criticisms made 
recently by un officials of hong kongs handling of the boat 
people 
last week another un official said the camps were some of the 
worst he had seen 
the space is less than the space given to people in prison 
here said omar bakhet head of the technical support unit for the 
united nations high commissioner for refugees in hong kong it is 
even less than what is supposed to be given here for a dog 
the un organization has alleged that more than 100 boat people 
were beaten by police during a july 23 disturbance at a detention 
center in the new territories section of hong kong 
opposition to the refugees is growing in this crowded colony of 5 
million people residents of one village have organized protests and 
sitins against a planned camp near the high island reservoir in the 
new territories 
the opposition was evident tuesday when reporters were brought to 
the lo wu detention center near the chinese border to speak with 
some of the voluntary returnees 
posters reading say no to viets and no more viets 
lined the entrance to the camp 
inside the camp a former army post children and women in ragged 
clothing looked out through barbedwire fences vietnamese men in 
tshirts smiled and asked for cigarettes 
those people who still have hope will stay said truang van 
bong a 21yearold fisherman from haiphong i have no more hope 
so im going back i think my government wont punish me i believe 
the assurances of the united nations 
vietnam has promised it wont prosecute its returning citizens 
other refugees said they were returning because they missed their 
families 
i miss my old mother very much said le thi minh 39 a 
fishmonger from haiphong she said her brother was unable to care 
for her mother because he is in jail for trying to flee vietnam 
we all have to take risks she said about returning but 
for me the pull of my family is too strong 
the group of 124 will be the third to leave hong kong since the 
voluntary repatriation program began in march so far groups of 75 
and 68 boat people have returned home 
adult returnees are given 50 and children 14 and under are given 
25 the un will also assist them once they return to their homes 
with a food allowance 
they are among the 38300 vietnamese who have sailed into hong 
kong since the british colony adopted a tough policy last year 
ruling out resettlement for most of them 
under the new policy vietnamese are considered refugees only if 
they can prove they fled their homeland beccause of persecution

police record has been sentenced to life in prison without 
possibility of parole on his first conviction

whether to deal in crack or not us attorney mike moore said 
and he chose to deal in crack he got exactly what congress wanted 
for that decision

mercedes benz he also refused to reveal the source of his cocaine

president bush saying im not holding my 
breath waiting for gen manuel antonio noriega to step aside 
tuesday hinted that abduction of the panamanian leader might be 
justifiable 
i have an obligation to try to bring people to justice bush 
told a news conference he cited the fbis 1987 abduction of a 
lebanese highjacker as precedent for such longarm tactics 
noriega remains under 1988 indictments on us drugconspiracy 
charges 
while declining to say whether abducting noriega was actually 
being considered bush said we have an indictment out against 
gen noriega for drug trafficking im told that its a good 
indictment that its an indepth indictment 
expanding on remarks he made in an interview last week with 
reporters from hearst newspapers bush told the nationally broadcast 
news conference im not saying what i would do or wouldnt do 
but there was a case where a man named younis was apprehended and 
brought to justice 
it was a reference to the fbi hostage rescue squads grabbing on 
sept 13 1987 of lebanese hijacker fawaz younis in the 
mediterranean sea 
us agents lured younis aboard a yacht 13 miles off the coast of 
cyprus with the prospect of a drug deal and a party he was later 
convicted in us district court in washington of leading five 
heavily armed men in hijacking royal jordanian airlines flight 402 
and holding 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours in beirut 
bush reaffirmed the longstanding us view that normal relations 
with panama cannot resume so long as noriega remains in power 
however noriega whose regime annulled a may 7 presidential 
election that international observers said was won by opposition 
candidate guillermo endara has shown no signs of yielding to us 
demands that he step down 
a team of international mediators is in panama now negotiating 
terms of a resolution by the organization of american states oas 
calling for new elections on sept 1 
part of our understanding on the oas agreement was that noriega 
would be out bush said but he added im not holding my 
breath on his voluntary departure 
bush also told reporters that he had recently told opposition 
candidate endara that we will continue to support what the people 
of panama voted for 
a senior state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that bushs vow of support for endara did not put 
the administration at odds with the oas agreement to promote new 
elections sept 1 conditioned on a transfer of power from noriegas 
regime to a transitional government 
the united states supports that plan said the official although 
it continues to believe that endara fairly won the election 
noriega commander of panamas defense forces and de facto 
leader said last week that he was not going to step down despite 
the oas agreement he has been in power for six years 
last wednesday bush told reporters from hearst newspapers that 
i wouldnt rule out any option when asked if he would consider 
seizing noriega to bring him to trial in the united states 
according to some published accounts former president reagan 
considered a plan to abduct noriega while he was visiting his 
daughter in the dominican republic but rejected it as too risky

the sun didnt shine into tsutomu miyazakis room 
the single window of the room where police believe miyazaki 
mutilated the body of 5yearold ayako nomoto was blocked by piles 
of comic books pornography and childrens cartoon videotapes 
police announced tuesday that the 26yearold print shop worker 
had confessed to killing and mutilating three girls in what 
television news is calling the worst murder case in japans postwar 
history 
miyazaki was arrested friday in connection with the killing of 
ayako in june 
police said miyazaki also confessed to strangling mari konno 4 
in august 1988 burning the body and leaving it on her parents 
doorstep and strangling erika namba also 4 in december and 
dumping her body on a mountain 
television and newspaper coverage including images of the 
suspects room has stirred fear in the homes of japanese unfamiliar 
with the level of violent crime in many other societies 
the child slayings are the latest in a series of murders of 
startling brutality by japanese youth 
experts have been filling the airwaves with analyses of the 
impact of violent sex imagery that is perhaps more pervasive in 
japanese popular culture than in any other developed country 
japanese barely blink at the graphic scenes of rape and murder 
they see in sports newspapers and comic books they usually ignore 
the ads plastering telephone booths for prostitution services 
now the extraordinary attention given the miyazaki case which 
has dominated the front pages of national newspapers for days has 
stunned the japanese and stirred concern about sex and violence in 
the media

hundreds of east germans who want to 
flee to the west moved their vigil tuesday from the closed west 
german consulate to a nearby church while german and hungarian 
officials negotiated their fate 
these and other east germans who demand permission to emigrate 
via west german diplomatic facilities in the east bloc have created 
a standoff involving their communist homeland west germany and 
hungary 
west german diplomats closed their budapest consulate and embassy 
monday because they said they could not handle the crush of east 
germans demanding asylum 
rezsoe stuchlik head of the hungarian red cross foreign section 
said tuesday about 200 east germans had come from the consulate to 
the courtyard of a roman catholic church about two miles away 
an east german outside the church grounds said later the number 
had risen to about 300 
about 30 east germans remained in front of the consulate they 
said west germany diplomats had given them money 
im staying here as long as it takes said a 47yearold man 
from the berlin area who spoke on condition of anonymity one 
month two months i dont care 
varying numbers of east germans have been maintaining a vigil in 
front of the embassy and consulate for at least a week they had 
been allowed inside at night until the buildings closed monday 
in bonn foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher said monday 
that 141 other adults and 40 children were holed up inside the 
embassy in budapest political opposition figures estimate that 400 
east germans have overstayed their visas and gone underground 
west germany closed its east berlin mission aug 8 after 131 east 
germans seeking guarantees that they can go to west germany sought 
refuge there 
negotiations involving both german states and hungary continued 
tuesday the hungarian foreign ministry said it gave no details 
in bonn government spokesman herbert schmuelling said chancellor 
helmut kohl wrote a letter on the problems in hungary to east german 
leader erich honecker he did not say what the letter said 
red cross officials said they didnt know how long the east 
germans at the budapest church would continue their vigil we have 
means of taking care of them for about two weeks but were 
considering longerrange plans said stuchlik 
speaking by telephone stuchlik said tents may be erected in the 
courtyard by wednesday he said the red cross and the hungarian 
maltesian caritas service a charity group were providing three 
meals a day for the east germans 
hungarian authorities were not consulted about the move to the 
church he said 
he said the hungarian red cross could turn to the international 
red cross if it ran out of money and food for the east germans 
an east german consulate statement carried by the hungarian news 
agency mti urged all east germans staying here illegally to return 
home it also repeated a pledge that they would not be prosecuted 
for escape attempts or overstaying visas 
east germans began asking for asylum in budapest last month after 
failed attempts to escape across the austrian border where liberal 
hungarian authorities have removed fences the east germans say they 
fear persecution at home because they tried to flee 
at least 1600 east germans are estimated to have crossed 
illegally into austria from hungary since the fences came down in 
may once in austria they try to obtain papers from the west german 
embassy in vienna for travel to west germany 
east germans can easily visit hungary but it is difficult for 
them to travel legally to the west 
the east german who commented at the church said west german 
diplomats on church grounds were issuing west german passports to 
the east germans 
according to west german law all east germans have a right to 
west german passports consulate and embassy personnel routinely 
issued passports to all east germans seeking them before the two 
compounds closed 
however hungarian border authorities have not allowed bearers of 
west german passports made out in budapest to cross into austria

us trade representative carla hills on 
tuesday expressed support for increasing tax benefits for individual 
savers contending that expanded individual retirement accounts 
would help boost the countrys low savings rate and reduce americas 
huge trade deficit 
hills stressed that her endorsement did not mean that the 
administration had decided to propose such a change which has the 
potential of benefiting millions of americans 
but other officials have said the administration is readying a 
fall campaign to address the chronically low us savings rate and 
that expanding tax benefits to individual investors who use iras was 
one of the ideas being considered 
hills said that expanding iras would highlight the great need 
for private savings to go up it sends up a flag saying this is 
very important not only to your nation but to your own future and 
to your children 
one reason long advanced for americas high trade deficits is 
that americans consume more than the country can produce 
domestically if americans could be persuaded to cut back on 
consumption and save more then it would limit the need for foreign 
goods economists reason 
higher us savings rates would also lower the cost of capital 
for us businesses and make their products more competitive on 
overseas markets 
hills said she did not know anyone in the administration who 
opposed increasing ira tax benefits but she said there was concern 
over such questions as the potential loss of federal revenue 
the huge cost to the treasury of iras was one reason that they 
were greatly scaled back by the 1986 tax reform act as a result 
the number of tax returns claiming ira deductions fell from 155 
million in 1987 to 74 million last year 
the administration is considering a variety of proposals to boost 
us savings rates as part of a fall initiative designed to address 
longrange problems facing the country treasury secretary nicholas 
brady is scheduled to kick off the campaign with a series of 
speeches officials have said 
the personal savings rate savings as a percent of aftertax 
income fell to a 40year low of 32 percent in 1987 and increased 
only slightly to 42 percent last year by contrast the savings 
rate in japan was 165 percent in 1987 
hills said that increasing the us savings rate would help her 
answer charges from japanese trade negotiators that the united 
states has not done enough on its own to solve its huge trade 
deficit 
currently hills is holding negotiations with japan brazil and 
india in an effort to get those nations to lower trade barriers 
cited by the administration last may when it issued a hit list 
of the countries with the most harmful barriers to sales of american 
products 
the japanese have countered that america should make progress in 
boosting its savings rate and cutting its huge federal budget 
deficit as a way of lessening its dependence on foreign capital 
the administrations various trade opening initiatives are aimed 
at lowering the countrys huge trade deficit which measured 1265 
billion last year on a current account basis covering trade in both 
merchandise and services 
hills said the current account deficit over the next 18 months 
may actually rise a little reflecting the rise in the value of 
the dollar which makes american goods less competitive on overseas 
markets 
it is hard to predict but i do not look for a dramatic drop in 
the trade deficit she said

president wojciech jaruzelski called 
tuesday for an emergency meeting of polands political leaders to 
seek rational solutions to a growing government crisis that he 
said threatens the nations stability 
the call was seconded by solidarity leader lech walesa who also 
said that if society wants it he would agree to serve as prime 
minister 
if solidarity succeeds in winning the prime ministers post it 
would be the first noncommunist government in the east bloc since 
the late 1940s 
prime minister czeslaw kiszczak said monday he is ready to resign 
and abandon efforts to assemble a cabinet in the face of 
solidaritys opposition to any communistled government kiszczak 
became prime minister 12 days ago 
he urged that united peasant party chairman roman malinowski a 
communist loyalist be selected by jaruzelski to form a grand 
coalition government that would include communists and members of 
solidarity 
but the proposal of malinowski drew little interest from other 
political groups and malinowski himself by late tuesday had not 
answered whether he wants to be considered a candidate 
walesa reiterated his proposal to form a government based on a 
coalition of solidarity the peasant party and the democratic party 
with some sensitive posts left to the communists 
in the confused political situation the state pap news agency 
said jaruzelski expresses his concern over the deepening 
instability of polands political and economic situation 
the president intends to appeal to representatives of the main 
political forces in the country for participation in a joint meeting 
devoted to seeking rational solutions as soon as possible pap 
said 
jaruzelski also asked for restraint in political and social 
emotions which make national accord more difficult he contacted 
walesa through private channels to ask him for a meeting possibly 
on wednesday said walesa aide krzysztof pusz 
the joint meeting was likely to bring together representatives of 
the three parties and solidarity who were the main figures in last 
springs successful talks that led to an accord on elections and 
legalizing the independent trade union movement after a sevenyear 
ban 
walesa said he welcomed kiszczaks decision to abandon forming a 
government but rejected malinowski as prime minister he said the 
parties in the coalition discussions should decide on a candidate 
if society wants it i will have to go for the prime ministers 
office walesa said but i would prefer someone else 
walesa also told state tv after we sit down and reach 
agreement on deep reforms then we will find the names to head the 
government too 
he said any solidarityled government would guarantee the 
sensitive ministries of defense and interior to the communist party 
and would do nothing to endanger the functioning of the warsaw 
pact military alliance 
walesa said a solidarity coalition would be a government of 
national responsibility nominated with respect for the rights of 
the polish president referring to the constitutional rights of 
jaruzelski to control foreign policy and the armed forces 
despite such assurances the prospect of a solidarityled 
government has alarmed the communist party and the soviet union 
which has said it could destabilize poland and europe 
the party may also fear a solidarity government would purge the 
nomenklatura party loyalists who hold tens of thousands of 
government and management posts and undermine the communist 
partys main base of support 
the democratic party which along with the peasants holds the 
parliamentary balance of power on tuesday endorsed walesas bid to 
form the next government 
we think that we should do everything to realize lech walesas 
proposal which has broad support said the secretariat of the 
party which historically has been allied to the communists 
walesa said aug 7 that only a government headed by solidarity 
and dominated by noncommunists will have the credibility to solve 
polands political and economic problems 
on the economic front kiszczaks caretaker cabinet said extra 
food supplies are to be directed to larger cities and publicly 
owned shops are to be sold or rented to private food vendors 
walesa praised kiszczaks decision to resign saying it reflected 
a feeling of responsibility and could solve the government 
crisis he said he had nothing personally against gen kiszczak the 
interior minister for eight years 
the resignation of a communist premier because the opposition 
wont endorse him as well as the bid by solidarity to form a 
government against the wishes of the polish and soviet party 
authorities demonstrates how radically east bloc politics have 
changed the events would have been unthinkable a year ago 
cardinal jozef glemp the countrys roman catholic primate noted 
the changes during an annual assumption day sermon in czestochowa 
these events and changes of great significance were made 
finally without violence and destruction and we should thank 
god for that he said but he warned the crowd of 150000 of new 
concerns including the economy 
solidarity began coalition talks thursday with lamakers from the 
two minor parties which have a combined strength of 103 seats and 
hold the balance of power in parliament normally obscure and once 
regarded as little more than communist fronts the parties have been 
thrown into the role of kingmakers 
aleksander bentkowski the leader of the peasant partys 
parliament delegation said he favors solidaritys concept for the 
next government 
about a third of the peasant party legislators are leaning to 
solidarity and want greater independence from the communists 
malinowski represents the more traditional procommunist wing of 
the party that claims 500000 members 
since partially free elections in june many of the minorparty 
lawmakers feel that in order to survive they must distance 
themselves from the generally unpopular communists

the leaders of the antiisraeli uprising tuesday 
ordered west bank palestinians to boycott their jobs in israel for a 
week to protest restrictive new measures imposed on arabs in the 
gaza strip 
the order for a sevenday strike which would be the longest in 
the 20monthold uprising came along with a call for more stones 
and knives in fighting israeli occupation 
a palestinian man died tuesday of a gunshot wound suffered a day 
earlier in a clash with soldiers the army said 
the death brought to 536 the number of palestinians killed by 
soldiers or jewish settlers since the uprising began in the west 
bank and gaza strip in december 1987 thirtyeight israelis have 
been killed 
sixteen other palestinans were reported shot and wounded tuesday 
in confrontations with soldiers in the occupied lands according to 
arab reports one of the victims a 14yearold girl from the askar 
refugee camp near nablus was reported in critical condition with a 
bullet in the head 
the plobacked underground leaders of the uprising said in a 
communique that the strike should begin friday the day the army 
begins enforcing a new rule that requires gaza strip palestinians to 
show computerized id cards to enter israel 
cards are denied anyone considered a security risk 
more than 50000 gazans work in israel as do about 60000 
palestinians from the west bank 
the uprising leaders called the cards a policy of starvation 
that would deny arabs work and said west bank palestinians who did 
not strike in sympathy for those in the gaza strip would be 
considered betrayers 
it also called for an escalation of the fight against israeli 
occupation and ordered palestinians not to meet with israelis who do 
not support the goals of an independent palestinian state it said 
anybody who breaks this decision will be outside the national 
line 
israeli officials have held a series of meetings with palestinian 
leaders to try to persuade them to accept the governments peace 
plan which calls for elections in the occupied lands but rules out 
an independent palestinian state 
the 17 million palestinians in the occupied territories closed 
their shops and offices tuesday in response to a strike call by the 
moslem fundamentalist hamas movement 
another commercial strike has been called wednesday by the 
underground leadership 
the palestinian who died tuesday was identified by an army 
spokeswoman as ahmed abdel khaled ayub 23 of the fara refugee camp 
near nablus 
the spokeswoman said ayub was shot in the back monday when 
soldiers opened fire on youths who attacked an army patrol at 
close range with large stones and concrete blocks 
several thousand camp residents raised palestinian flags and 
chanted proplo slogans at a funeral procession for ayub arab 
reporters said 
the army ordered a curfew on the camp after the funeral 
confining the 5000 residents to their homes

the kremlin made it clear tuesday that its 
acknowledgement of a secret pact with nazi germany dividing up 
poland and the baltic states does not mean it was admitting the 
baltics were forced to join the soviet union 
the latest official view of history and the molotovribbentrop 
pact came in a foreign ministry news conference with nine historians 
and a ministry spokesman they said it was perfectly logical for the 
baltics to invite the red army onto their territory after the nazis 
invaded poland 
the issue is at the heart of a drive by latvia lithuania and 
estonia to gain more autonomy if not outright independence from 
the soviet union 
for decades the soviet union denied the existence of the secret 
protocols to the nonaggression pact which was signed by germanys 
joachim von ribbentrop and the soviet unions vyacheslav molotov on 
aug 23 1939 one week before the nazis invaded poland 
microfilm copies in west german archives indicate the protocols 
allocated the majority of poland to germanys sphere of influence 
and the baltic states and eastern poland to the soviet union 
a commission set up by the soviet parliament in june is expected 
to announce any day that it has determined the protocols were 
genuine members of the commission say the official report will 
condemn the protocols and declare them null and void 
the secret protocols said the baltics were in the sphere of 
influence of the soviet union agreed historian mikhail i 
semryaga at tuesdays news conference but what does that mean it 
does not mean they were obliged to become part of the soviet union 
i was in the western ukraine in september 1939 said another 
historian valentin m berezhkov referring to an area that had been 
part of poland and was incorporated into the soviet ukraine that 
month the population was friendly 
berezhkov also said he thought it was logical for the baltics to 
agree to the establishment of soviet military bases on their soil 
after the nazis had invaded poland 
the historians did show some signs of disagreement when asked if 
they were dismissing the testimony of baltic witnesses to the events 
of 193940 who say their independent nations were forced to join 
the soviet union by the occupying red army 
historian alexander o chubarin said some members of his 
profession are reconsidering the standard view that the baltics 
viewed their entrance to the soviet union with euphoria 
chubarin said he personally believes there were various opinions 
among baltic citizens at the time and the choice was very narrow 
in 1940 after the fall of france 
a lot of people saw the soviet union as a good partner he 
said they saw the soviet union as the embodiment of socialist 
principles but wound up with stalinism instead of socialism 
they suffered as did many other peoples of the soviet union 
chubarin said 
on orders from soviet dictator josef stalin tens of thousands of 
baltic citizens were deported to siberia and the far north 
but another member of the panel alexander s orlov said the red 
army was moderate in its actions in the baltic and even agreed to 
inform local authorities of impending military exercises 
occupying forces never behaved like that orlov said 
several members of the panel blamed stalin for the secret pact 
and echoed the conclusion of the commission that the protocols were 
illegal because they never were approved by the nominal parliament 
of the time 
maj gen viktor i filatov editor of military history journal 
argued the protocols were just prepared by clerks and never 
approved 
but chubarin did not let that pass those were not minor clerks 
who signed it he said the german copies of the pact and 
accompanying maps show the signatures of stalin as well as molotov 
and ribbentrop 
one member of the parliamentary commission latvian iy kezbers 
said in the newspaper arguments and facts this weekend that the pact 
showed stalins imperialist tendencies

he shuffled us warships around the 
mediterranean sought the help of other nations and offered iran his 
goodwill but with it all president bush appeared on tuesday to be 
handcuffed in his struggle to free the american hostages 
two weeks of veiled threats interspersed with indirect offers to 
resume normal relations with tehran have not produced tangible 
results and bush responding with evident discomfort to tough 
questions at a white house news conference could neither report 
evidence of progress in his multilayered campaign nor offer a 
promising new approach 
were going to keep on trying was about all he could muster 
in the way of a response theres a lot of lines out there a lot 
of initiatives have been taken 
and yet bush was forced to acknowledge that efforts so far 
failed to permit him to provide a positive assessment at this 
point 
his predicament is not unique president jimmy carter tried a 
similar range of tactics and a dramatic helicopter rescue operation 
that fell apart in a disabling windstorm in the iranian desert and 
yet he was unable to liberate the americans held hostage in tehran 
for 444 days 
they emerged on his last day in office ronald reagans 
inauguration day in 1980 
as for reagan despite his muscular campaign rhetoric only a 
surreptitious transfer of us weapons to iran which caused an 
uproar when it became public seemed to liberate three americans 
and others were seized subsequently 
bush rounding out his seventh month in the white house might 
take some comfort in his predecessors frustrations but he too 
has been unable to dent the iranianbacked hezbollah which abducted 
and apparently killed marine lt col william r higgins 
the factions believed to be holding eight other americans in 
lebanon present an elusive and perhaps impossible target they are 
mingled in with innocent civilians in slums and camps and 
apparently move the hostages around and about in a crazyquilt 
pattern that defies american surveillance 
if i could find some action diplomatic military private 
sector public sector that i thought would help get the hostages 
out or guard against future hostage taking i would take such 
action bush said 
but on the military front at least the leader of the worlds 
most powerful nation seems paralyzed 
id like to know that what action we took was not going to 
victimize a lot of innocent people bush said when you look at 
the action that the united states can take i dont want to be 
responsible for the loss of innocent life 
besides bush must weigh the safety of the hostages themselves 
and the lives of the americans sent on a longshot rescue mission 
on the diplomatic front his appeal to the soviet union the arab 
world and other friendly or neutral countries has at least gained 
their sympathetic support but as with bushs public signal to iran 
last wednesday that goodwill begets goodwill there is no 
response from tehran that portends freeing of the hostages 
irans religious leader issued a flat rejection monday of bushs 
goodwill gestures and white house hints that direct talks could be 
in the offing 
next to israel the usurper regime ruling over occupied 
palestine you are the most cursed government in the eyes of the 
iranian people the ayatollah ali khamenei said in slamming that 
door shut no one in the islamic republic will hold talks with 
you 
that leaves the legal front 
lawyers at the justice department have been looking at 
antiterrorist laws to see if a case can be built for extraditing 
sheik abdul karim obeid the israeliheld moslem cleric said by some 
to have played a role in higgins abduction 
presumably that might touch off a chain of events leading to a 
swap for the hostages as israel has proposed 
but bush was very cool to the idea 
if there is an indictment he said i would be remiss if i 
didnt try to see him brought to trial 
well a reporter pressed could the president take the lead and 
encourage the justice department to proceed 
ive put it just exactly the way i want to put it bush said 
with a touch of irritation and frustration 
on wednesday with the hostage crisis his first real foreign 
policy problem hanging over him bush embarks on a 20day 
vacation obviously he would like to have a solution or at least 
be on the verge of one 
if i could find a way to take those hostages get them and 
bring them out and that required using the military force of the 
united states make no mistake about it i would do it in an 
instant bush said 
but he left the white house podium with every indication that is 
not about to happen

preliminary results show that an ignition 
test tuesday of the space shuttles redesigned solid rocket motor 
was a success officials at the marshall space flight center said 
the center is continuing to test the redesigned engine to check 
the performance of joints that were blamed for the 1986 challenger 
explosion even though the engine is currently used in flights the 
lastest was by columbia which returned sunday from a space voyage 
the tested rocket motor contained intentional flaws including a 
lack of adhesive on one of the joints and a small hole in another 
but the test worked as predicted with no leaks passing expected 
points said chuck vibbart project manager for the test 
further testing on the rocket motor will be done in the next few 
days to determine if any possible leaks occurred officials said 
the test was the initial one in the second phase of trials of the 
redesigned solid rocket motor officials expect to conduct several 
more years of testing including some work on the next generation of 
rocket motors to be built at a national aeronautics and space 
administration site in iuka miss 
we feel that we have tested the redesigned rocket motor 
sufficiently to demonstrate its flight readiness vibbart said 
after tuesdays test but were also cautious technical engineers 
that feel we need to continue to gather data to make sure there are 
no surprises lurking out there

espousing religious fundamentalism especially within the countrys 
majority hindu faith 
he is scheduled to call general elections in the next four 
months and he suggested repeatedly these groups are hindering the 
nations development 
the prime minister was elected to a fiveyear term in december 
1984 two months after his mother and predecessor indira gandhi 
was assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards 
gandhi spoke from the ramparts of the 17th century red fort he 
was flanked by foreign diplomats cabinet ministers and senior 
government officials 
authorities checked for hidden explosives in vehicles arriving 
for the ceremony visitors were frisked and sent through metal 
detectors 
gandhi wore a white bulletproof jacket over a white tunic and 
trousers during his speech celebrating indian independence from 
britain in 1947 a bulletproof glass shield on his podium was 
removed minutes before he began his 50minute speech 
police officials said security was strengthened after they 
received reports that nine militants had entered the capital for 
terrorist attacks 
sikh militants in the northern state of punjab have been fighting 
for an independent nation since 1982 they have been blamed for 
1200 killings in punjab this year and for bomb attacks in new delhi 
tuesdays violence however was blamed on moslem militants who 
apparently were trying to enforce a general strike in the kashmir 
valley of jammukashmir state 
government spokesman mohammad s pandit said 27 people were 
injured when a hand grenade exploded at a vegetable market in 
srinagar 
pandit said the grenade thrown at a police jeep missed and 
instead exploded among morning shoppers 
he said no one was injured in three other bomb attacks around the 
area 
pandit blamed the attacks on kashmiri militants and 
secessionists which are terms used by the government to describe 
propakistani groups 
srinagar a predominantly moslem city is about 62 miles west of 
the border with pakistan which claims part of the state as its own 
three moslem militant groups called the strike in srinagar to 
protest what they said was forcible occupation of kashmir by 
india

sinhalese radicals enforced a oneday 
general strike tuesday the latest in a series to protest the 
presence of indian soldiers trying to end an ethnic civil war 
traffic virtually halted in colombo and other parts of this 
island off the tip of india most businesses closed 
soldiers patrolled the city and policemen stood guard at major 
intersections and bus stops 
sinhalese militants of the peoples liberation front who have 
conducted a campaign of strikes and assassination against the 
government for two years had distributed posters warning people to 
stay indoors 
the campaign began after indian troops were deployed in sri lanka 
two years ago to try to help end the war involving separatists in 
the tamil minority demanding a homeland in northern and eastern sri 
lanka 
president ranasinghe premadasa who has been negotiating with 
india for a phased withdrawal of the estimated 43000 soldiers 
urged people to refrain from violence 
no room should be left for the slightest undermining of the 
sovereignty of sri lanka he said in a reference to indias 
declaration that it would not withdraw while the tamil insurrection 
continues 
every practical step should be taken to ensure total peace in 
the north and east by taking into consideration the realities of the 
situation premadasa said in a statement released by the 
government 
most tamil rebel groups laid down their arms but the largest 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam continued the fight against 
the indian soldiers 
a military official who cannot be identified under standing 
rules said the tigers ambushed and killed four indian soldiers 
tuesday in morawewa 145 miles northeast of colombo 
at least 1000 indians have been killed since they arrived after 
the peace accord of july 29 1987 and the tamil war has cost 10000 
sri lankan lives since it began in 1983 
the indians are deployed only in the northeast where most tamils 
live but the peoples liberation front says their presence 
compromises sri lankan independence it also claims the accord made 
too many concessions to tamils 
premadasas government blames the sinhalese radicals for 4000 
killings since june 1987 including at least seven on tuesday which 
brought the total to 79 in four days 
tuesdays strike coincided with the 42nd anniversary of indias 
independence from britain at least two colombo dailies refused to 
carry special supplements on the occasion sources at the newspapers 
said privately 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
claim discrimination by the majority sinhalese most tamils are 
hindus and sinhalese are predominantly buddhist 
india an overwhelmingly hindu nation became involved because it 
is the regional power and 60 million of its people are tamils

the drop in mortgage interest rates that began 
in march is being offset by the prohibitive high cost to firsttime 
buyers causing only a modest rally in sales of existing homes 
for the rest of the year a real estate trade group said tuesday 
the national association of realtors said the interest rate 
declines will result in acrosstheboard sales increases but not at 
last years level earlier high mortgage rates had caused sales to 
fall 31 percent in the spring 
falling rates are likely to trigger only a modest rally said 
john a tuccillo nar chief economist 
while rates are falling an nar survey of 83 metropolitan areas 
showed housing costs rising during the second quarter pricing many 
prospective firsttime buyers out of the market 
twentytwo areas posted median prices above the national median 
price of 92900 during the apriljune period the nar said 
fortythree areas recorded an annual median price increase exceeding 
the national price increase of 4 percent 
the median price means that half of the homes sold for more and 
half for less 
the growing range of metropolitan prices indicates that some 
areas housing costs have reached a level sufficient to shut out 
entrylevel buyers indefinitely said nar president ira gribin 
the group is urging federal legislation containing help for 
firsttime buyers including expansion of the federal housing 
administrations mortgage insurance program and a downpayment 
assistance plan 
in its report the nar said sales of existing homes fell in the 
second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 372 million 
units the survey covered sales of singlefamily detached homes 
town houses apartment condominiums and cooperatives 
but mortgate rates which peaked at 1122 percent in march have 
fallen since then to 996 percent last friday according to the 
federal national mortgage association 
gribin said consumer response lagged the mortgage rate drop but 
should be felt in the third quarter 
now the people who can afford to get in the market are house 
hunting he said 
affordability however is a problem for many 
the nar survey showed that prices of existing homes rose in all 
regions during the second quarter but while the northeast posted 
the slowest increases it still had the highest median pricetag of 
145900 
elsewhere prices rose 187 percent in the west to a median cost 
of 139700 49 percent in the midwest to 70900 and 46 percent 
in the south to 84700 
the san francisco bay area was ranked as the most expensive 
market with a 265700 median price it was followed by honolulu 
262500 anaheimsanta ana 247600 los angeles 218000 and 
boston 188600

japanese living in beijing took special 
precautions tuesday against possible attackd by an obscure terrorist 
group calling itself the bloodbright dare to die squad 
the group had said in death threats received as long as a month 
ago that on tuesday its members would start killing two japanese 
businessmen or tourists a week to retaliate for japans economic 
invasion of china 
the threats contained in letters sent to japanese in cities 
nationwide have led hotels and businesses to tighten security 
japanese businessmen said 
an official at japan air lines which received the first threat 
in july said arrangements had been made to improve security at the 
beijing airport 
we havent done anything special ourselves but stricter 
security measures are being taken by the public security office at 
the beijing airport said shigeki suetsugu a jal manager 
additional plainclothes and uniformed guards were posted at the 
jinglun hotel which is popular with japanese businessmen and where 
the airlines ticket and reservations office are located suetsugu 
said 
about 230 japanese businessmen living and working at the minzu 
hotel in beijing met with the hotel staff to plan extra security 
precautions the measures included hiring additional guards and 
implementing mandatory registration of visitors in the evenings 
said toshimi inoue manager of a trading company operating from 
offices in the hotel 
all the hotels are looking out for the japanese inoue said 
of course we dont really expect anything to happen but its 
better to take precautions 
japanese embassy officials said no special measures were planned 
beyond earlier warnings to nationals to take precautions such as 
varying their routes to work and staying indoors at night 
as of late tuesday no attacks or incidents involving japanese 
nationals had been reported the embassy said 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama said thursday his 
ministry was considering lifting an advisory against nonessential 
travel in china he said the advisory would remain in effect for 
beijing which has been under martial law since may 20 martial law 
was imposed because of the prodemocracy movement that was crushed 
by military forces on june 34 
most of the japanese living in china left following the military 
suppression of the studentled movement airline employees said 
virtually no japanese tourists are traveling to china but most 
japanese businessmen have returned to their jobs 
were just going ahead with our work as usual said kenji 
ishii of the japan association for promotion of international trade 
you cant spend all day worrying after all there are 
extremists in japan too said inoue who has managed a trading 
firm in beijing for four years 
the protests last spring seem to have brought some of those 
groups out into the open here in china too he said referring to 
organizations such as the bloodbright dare to die squad 
some japanese say the threats have cast a pall over living and 
working in china 
we dont expect anything to happen but the threats make it 
impossible for us to move around freely it makes life here rather 
grim said jals suetsugu it would be a lie to say im not 
worried its creepy

president bush on tuesday endorsed complaints 
made by budget director richard darman that the federal reserve was 
keeping interest rates so high that the central bank was impeding 
economic growth 
i dont know of any president now or in the past who doesnt 
favor lower interest rates bush said in response to a question at 
a news conference 
i can feel very comfortable with his darmans sallying forth 
and saying that bush said i think ive said essentially the 
same thing in the past 
darman on sunday criticized the federal reserve for pursuing 
interest rate policies which he said could be pushing the country 
toward a recession he said the central bank should ease credit 
further to keep the 6yearold economic expansion alive 
darman said that if the country does suffer a recession it will 
be because the fed erred on the side of caution in keeping 
interest rates high in an effort to guard against inflation 
bush sidestepped a question on whether he agreed with darmans 
assessment on who would bear the blame for a recession saying he 
would take that question under advisement

a soviet offer to open files on raoul 
wallenberg the swedish diplomat missing since world war ii has 
raised hopes of unraveling the mystery about his fate but an 
official in moscow said tuesday the material will show wallenberg is 
dead 
wallenberg who was credited with saving tens of thousands of 
jews from nazi concentration camps vanished after his arrest by 
soviet troops entering budapest hungary in january 1945 
the soviets say files discovered in 1957 showed wallenberg who 
would be 77 today died of a heart attack in prison 30 months after 
his arrest but soviet dissident sources have reported seeing the 
swedish diplomat in labor camps during this decade 
the stockholmbased raoul wallenberg association said monday it 
has been invited to send a fourmember delegation including 
wallenbergs closest relatives to moscow for talks on his 
disappearance 
the group is to travel to moscow in midoctober 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
said wallenbergs relatives probably will have the opportunity to 
acquaint themselves with all the materials we have on the wallenberg 
case including the materials on his death in 1946 
there was no explanation for gremitskikhs reference to 1946 for 
wallenbergs death given previously as july 1947 
wallenberg issued swedish passports to 20000 hungarian jews 
slated for nazi death camps his intervention with german 
authorities was credited for the survival of another 100000

your vigilance to help me honor that commitment 
bush has sent congress legislation that would revamp the federal

careers to the maintenance of high standards bush wrote the 
inspectors general whom he met with in january shortly after his 
inauguration 
he made no mention of the influencepeddling scandal at the 
department of housing and urban development now under investigation

in investigating possible improprieties is essential both in 
ensuring that employees adhere to scrupulous standards and 
seeing that justice is done when employees fall short of proper

federal investigators hauled twisted 
portions of a light plane to keesler air force base in biloxi 
tuesday in hopes of determining what caused a crash that killed rep 
larkin smith and his pilot 
so far we dont have any significant findings the wreckage is 
being removed for further examination george prellezo regional 
director for the national transportation safety board said from 
miami 
the preliminary examination did not reveal anything 
significant so basically we dont have anything to suggest what may 
have caused the crash 
searchers on monday found the body of smith 45 along with that 
of pilot chuck vierling 58 authorities said the pairs 
singleengine cessna 177 crashed about 930 pm sunday into a dense 
south mississippi forest 
smith a freshman republican from mississippis 5th district 
threw out the first pitch in a youth baseball tournament in 
hattiesburg and was returning to his home in gulfport a gulf coast 
city about 70 miles to the south 
prellezo said volunteers from keesler used a path cut by a 
bulldozer during the search to remove wreckage 
a perry county sheriffs department deputy who declined to give 
his name said no portions of the plane were found intact 
prellezo said an ntsb investigator was being assisted by about 
five other people including personnel from the federal aviation 
administration and the aircrafts manufacturer 
he said they were interviewing witnesses and would examine the 
planes engine nothing about the positioning of the crash debris 
offered any clues about its cause prellezo said 
there was nothing significant about the wreckage itself 
nothing strange nothing extraordinary he said 
there was no indication that foul play had been involved in the 
crash but it had not been ruled out perry county sheriff carlos 
herring said 
but prellezo said we have no reason to suspect foul play at 
this point 
officials say the plane apparently clipped a 70foottall pine 
tree and disintegrated on impact 
smith will be mourned at a twoday public memorial wednesday and 
thursday at the mississippi coast coliseum and convention center in 
biloxi officials said 
the grayhaired former sheriff and police chief went to 
washington with a hardline stance against crime gained in 22 years 
of law enforcement experience and quickly impressed colleagues with 
his knowledge of the law 
smith won a position on the house judiciary committee breaking a 
republican tradition of appointing only lawyers to the panel 
because of his background and hardworking manner he gave every 
indication of becoming a star said alan coffey chief republican 
counsel for the judiciary committee 
im just absolutely heartsick to lose somebody like smith 
said gov ray mabus who ordered state flags flown at half staff 
our hearts and prayers go out to his family he and i were real 
good friends even though we were in different political parties 
he was easy to work with 
smith was the second congressman in as many weeks to die in a 
plane crash earlier sunday the wreckage of a plane carrying rep 
mickey leland dtexas and 15 other people were found in ethiopia 
with no survivors that plane disappeared aug 7 on a flight to a 
remote village 
smiths survivors include his wife sheila a daughter tracy

the prosecution in the tax evasion and extortion 
trial of hotel queen leona helmsley rested its case tuesday after 
six weeks of testimony in which former employees called her a 
pennypinching tyrant 
but even before the last witness had completed his testimony 
attention was focused on the defense presentation 
at issue is an accounting report that claims mrs helmsley and 
her husband harry are actually owed 681000 in tax refunds during 
198385 the years charged in the indictment 
in arguments at the start of the day assistant us attorney 
james devita said defense attorneys had given him a copy of the 
report monday afternoon he complained to us district judge john 
walker that the rules of evidence mandate that the defense turn over 
such documents at a much earlier date 
walker who appeared upset at the development admonished mrs 
helmsleys attorney gerald feffer 
i am extremely disappointed in defense counsel for not 
furnishing this earlier walker said to me it is inexcusable 
and i cant understand why it didnt happen 
walker said that if he allows the report to be admitted into 
evidence the trial could take a month longer than expected because 
the government would need to rebut its conclusions 
the judge also indicated that he may grant the government a delay 
to review the report and its underlying documents if he does this 
the trial could continue into september 
he reserved his decision on whether to admit the report into 
evidence 
the government needs to have absolute and complete disclosure 
of every aspect of this offer of proof walker said that 
includes finding out from the accountants when they were retained 
what they had to say and what the basis is for their testimony 
the report itself has not yet been made public but feffer and 
another lawyer for mrs helmsley james a bruton iii have 
described it during arguments 
they said two outside accounting firms reviewed the tax returns 
of several helmsleyowned partnerships from 198385 and found that 
the accountants who prepared the returns had incorrectly calculated 
the depreciation of property 
these alleged oversights the lawyers claim resulted in an 
overstatement of the helmsleys personal income 
bruton said the report concluded that the helmsleys overpaid 
90000 in taxes in 1983 13000 in 1984 and 578000 in 1985 
mrs helmsley 69 is charged with evading about 1 million in 
federal taxes by charging about 4 million in personal expenses to 
helmsleyowned businesses two former aides frank turco and joseph 
licari are being tried for assisting in the scheme 
mrs helmsley and turco are additionally charged with conspiracy 
to extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with 
the helmsley organization 
mrs helmsleys husband harry 80 was also charged but was 
severed from the trial for health reasons 
the last of 42 witnesses to testify was gus lesnevich a 
handwriting expert hired by the prosecution to review invoices 
memorandums and other documents submitted during the trial 
lesnevich identified the initials and writing of mrs helmsley 
and her codefendants on the documents 
when devita stood and said the government had rested its case 
mrs helmsley smiled and appeared relieved 
previous witnesses had portrayed mrs helmsley as an abusive boss 
who sometimes forced suppliers to charge her personal expenses to 
her business even her attorney conceded that she was demanding 
and abrasive

new york gov mario cuomo tried and failed 
tuesday to change the federal mind and win presidential approval for 
his plan to dismantle a new nuclear power plant 
i dont think anything was done to change the governors mind 
i dont think anything was done to change the presidents mind 
deputy energy secretary w henson moore said outside the white house 
we havent seen anything new in the information the governor 
gave us 
president bush moore white house chief of staff john sununu and 
bush aide andrew card met with cuomo for nearly an hour tuesday 
after cuomo said he wanted to see the president personally to make 
his case for dismantling rather than mothballing the shoreham 
plant 50 miles east of new york city on long islands northern shore 
cuomo left the president with a 2inchthick binder of 
information on shoreham and a list of 10 questions he would like the 
administration to answer about shoreham and nuclear energy the 
questions generally expressed great skepticism about the feasibility 
of mothablling the plant 
we left it that the administrations energy planners would 
talk to my planners that the president would ask people at energy 
and presumably his staff as well to read the book to read the 10 
questions and to get back to us with answers cuomo said he 
was precise about saying that we were entitled to answers and we 
would get answers 
the governor declined to characterize bushs reaction to the 
presentation but said it was a positive sign that the president had 
even agreed to the meeting 
cuomo said the federal governments attempt to derail the tearing 
down of the long island nuclear power plant amounted to usurpation 
of states rights 
the department of energy is presuming to tell the state of new 
york what plants it can build whether or not it should mothball the 
plants whether or not it needs environmental impact statements 
he said theres no such authority in the department of energy 
nor has anybody ever attempted anything like that in all the years 
of this federal government 
but moore disagreed calling cuomos argument a red herring 
the congress has charged the department of energy with 
fashioning a national energy policy he said the law says that 
were supposed to speak up were supposed to make decisions were 
supposed to do what we can to see to it that the american people 
have affordable energy and have the supplies of it that they need 
the energy department argues that the 813 megawatts that shoreham 
can produce are needed to ease possible power shortgaes in the 
northeast and that replacement power would mean burning more 
environmentally harmful fossil fuels 
cuomo asked in july for a meeting with bush after white house 
chief of staff sununu said the plant should be mothballed not 
dismantled 
we want to wait for the people of long island to realize that 
the plant is needed sununu said in an interview with newsday a 
long island newspaper 
cuomo said at the time he did not expect to be granted an 
audience with the president because it would put bush in the 
embarrassing position of admitting he was illinformed but at a 
meeting of the national governors association in chicago earlier 
this month bush told cuomo they could get together 
the federalstate debate over shorehams fate has been running 
since bush appointed sununu and energy secretary james watkins both 
of whom have been strongly pronuclear and proshoreham 
the democratic governor blasted the administration for its 
unjustified and arrogant interference in trying to block a 
shutdown settlement negotiated between the state and the long island 
lighting co which built shoreham the state has long maintained 
that the area around shoreham could not be safely evacuated in the 
event of a nuclear accident 
under the settlement the state will buy the 55 billion plant 
for 1 and have it dismantled at the companys expense in return 
the company has been guaranteed annual rate increases of about 5 
percent for at least a decade long island homeowners and businesses 
already pay the highest electricity rates in the country 
although the deal has been approved by various state agencies and 
company stockholders the department of energy has said it would 
seek to prevent it from going through by opposing transfer of 
shorehams license the nuclear regulatory commission must approve 
the transfer and the department has tried to slow that process by 
asking the commission to order its own environmental review of the 
impact of closing shoreham and freeze staffing there 
last week the energy department also joined a private lawsuit 
that challenges the shoreham shutdown on environmental grounds

authorities on tuesday recovered the 
bodies of all 16 people killed in the crash of a plane carrying a 
us congressional delegation headed by rep mickey leland 
a helicopter hovered near the face of a sheer cliff in 
southwestern ethiopia as the bodies were hoisted up one by one from 
the rugged mountainside where the twinengine plane crashed last 
week 
they were flown to the nearby town of gambela and placed aboard 
an ethiopian air force c130 cargo plane for the return to addis 
ababa 
weve got them all air force capt kevin krejarck said upon 
his return to the capital from gambela the site has now been 
cleared 
the weather gave us a break today krejarck said it was 
sunny down there for the first time in days 
the effort to retrieve the bodies of leland who headed the house 
select committee on hunger and his companions was stalled monday by 
low clouds rain and fog that shrouded the mountain which is called 
tam 
about 50 american and ethiopian personnel were able to reach the 
site tuesday said james haley chief spokesman for the us embassy 
in addis ababa 
the recovery teams were lowered to the base of the cliff by 
helicopters then had to scale it to reach the wreckage and bodies 
krejarck said 
a team of air force investigators arrived from washington to work 
with ethiopian authorities to determine the cause of the accident 
the team included representatives of the us civil aviation 
authority and the boeing and pratt and whitney companies which 
made the body and engines of lelands chartered twin otter

jordans first general parliamentary 
elections in 22 years will be held nov 8 prime minister zeid bin 
shaker said tuesday 
his announcement carried by the official jordan news agency 
said the date was set by the 26member cabinet in accordance with 
king husseins election decree earlier this month 
interior minister salem massadeh said about 1400 candidates 
would run for a parliament of 80 seats and candidate registration 
would start saturday 
a ban on political parties in effect since a coup attempt in 
1957 remains in force so candidates will run as individuals 
although they can be members of political organizations 
massadeh said more than a million voters registered in a 15day 
period that ended tuesday about 12 jordanians are eligible to vote 
he said committees would begin examining the registration lists 
wednesday and the procedure would take a week 
since the early 1950s parliaments have been evenly divided 
between the east and west banks of the jordan river but voting on 
both banks has not been possible since israel captured the west bank 
in the 1967 middle east war a few district elections were held in 
1984 to replace lawmakers who had died 
king hussein suspended the old 60member parliament last year 
after relinquishing sovereignty over the west bank to the palestine 
liberation organization election of the mew parliamewnt solely from 
jordan will help seal the countrys separation from the 
israelioccupied territory 
the king approved a law april 17 calling for a 72member body 
representing only the east bank after four days of rioting over 
price increases later that month he promised elections by the end of 
the year 
political activists said the april election law did not 
distribute seats fairly according to population and it was amended 
in july to add eight seats for major population centers

a wasp no bigger than the dot of an i 
could play a big role in the fight against lyme disease following 
its rediscovery by a victim of the ailment who was searching through 
old newspaper files 
the state on tuesday awarded a 15000 grant to the university of 
massachusetts at amherst to collect chalcid wasps reproduce them 
and eventually let them loose on the deer tick that carries lyme 
disease 
theres very exciting possibilities there for some control of 
the problem that has really panicked some people who summer here 
said william wilcox senior county agriculture agent for marthas 
vineyard and nantucket 
we need more information but it looks like theres potential 
there said roy van driesche an entomology professor involved in 
the project 
the minuscule wasp took on new prominence after a member of the 
marthas vineyard lyme disease action committee started to poke 
around in the vineyard gazette files wilcox said 
burton engley a 76yearold marthas vineyard resident who had 
suffered two mild cases of lyme disease said he was trying to track 
down reports of an experiment he recalled from the 1920s 
he found a 1937 article that reported a 1926 experiment in which 
chalcid wasps from europe were released on the island to kill dog 
and wood ticks that fit with a 1985 study that found the wasps 
eggs had infested and were killing nearly 27 percent of the deer 
ticks on the island 
its just a lucky break actually that it worked out that way 
wilcox said 
local health officials then contacted the university of 
massachusetts applied biological control program to explore the 
possibility of using the chalcid wasps for disease control 
lyme disease named for the connecticut town where it was first 
documented in 1975 can cause rashes headaches and sore muscles 
and if not detected early arthritis and heart irregularities it 
can be treated with antibiotics 
between 5000 and 8000 cases of lyme disease are reported 
nationally each year and 350 cases have been documented in 
massachusetts since officials began documenting the disease in 1985 
said paul etkind state epidemiologist 
if this works it could maybe reduce incidents by 35 percent 
said august schumacher jr commissioner of food and agriculture 
thats 100 cases 
the chalcid kills ticks by using a needlelike appendage to 
insert eggs inside the host as the eggs develop they kill the 
tick the wasp also may help inhibit immature ticks from spreading 
the disease health officials said 
researchers hope to begin work soon at a field station on 
nantucket van driesche said 
if the wasps prove effective state officials hope to have them 
commercially bred and used in conjunction with the current burning 
techniques and pesticides 
it could be part of spring in massachusetts would be releasing 
a box of these bugs schumacher said

drug czar william j bennett sounded a 
distinctly negative note tuesday about the nostalgia that has welled 
up around the 20th anniversary of woodstock 
bennett emerged from a white house meeting on antidrug strategy 
with president bush to complain about memory distortion going on 
about the rock concert in upstate new york that captivated a 
generation in 1969 
the 45yearold bennett a onetime guitar player and fan of early 
rock n roll recited what he called the casualty list from 
woodstock rock performers including singer janis joplin who 
died in later years from drug overdoses 
bennett who as a graduate student at the university of texas in 
the late 1960s had a blind date with joplin complained about the 
torrent of publicity marking the anniversary of the threeday 
counterculture festival 
he said part of the legacy of woodstock was tolerance of drugs 
and let us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back we 
do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs weve come too 
far 
people have been hearing today and probably will hear ad 
nauseam over the next couple of days fond memories and nostalgia 
about woodstock and theres a lot of memory distortion going on 
he said 
the next time you hear somebody gushing about woodstock and 
why cant it be that way today remind them of the casualty list 
from woodstock 
in order of performance 
janis joplin who died in 1970 of a drug overdose 
jimi hendrix dead 1970 drug overdose 
keith moon of the who dead of a drug overdose in 78 
paul butterfield blues band butterfield died of a drug 
overdose in 87 
woodstock was a time of a great deal of tolerance for drug use 
and it was also a time of a great deal of death because of the 
tolerance of drugs said bennett

a man sought in the death of a night 
stalker trial juror committed suicide tuesday and admitted in a 
note to killing the juror during a domestic dispute authorities 
said 
hours earlier superior court judge michael tynan sent the jury 
home to recover from the shock of phyllis singletarys death tynan 
said he hoped the jury could resume deliberations wednesday and 
lawyers for both sides said they wanted to avert a mistrial in the 
yearold trial 
james cecil melton 51 shot himself in the head at 1030 am at 
a motel in suburban carson after sheriffs deputies received an 
anonymous phone tip that he was there said deputy bill wehner 
he came out of his room onto the balcony put a fully loaded 
unidentified caliber handgun to his head and shot himself said 
wehner he died at the scene 
melton had been sought for questioning in the killing of 
singletary 30 his livein girlfriend who was shot at the couples 
carson home wehner said 
in a note melton admitted killing ms singletary in a domestic 
dispute but the note did not elaborate the deputy said 
defense and prosecution lawyers said they believed the jury with 
an alternate replacing ms singletary could continue working toward 
verdicts on the serial murder charges against richard ramirez 
ramirez 29 a drifter from el paso texas is charged with 13 
counts of murder and 30 other felonies prosecutors contend ramirez 
is the devilworshiping night stalker who raped robbed and 
murdered victims in a 1985 rampage that terrorized southern 
california 
mr ramirez doesnt want a mistrial he wants to go forward 
said attorney ray clark hes like the rest of us nobodys happy 
about this its a very sad thing 
some of the jurors were in tears as they arrived in court tuesday 
i think there is a tear in the eyes of a lot of us tynan 
told the panel but he stressed that ms singletarys slaying had 
nothing to do with this case 
ms singletarys battered body was found monday after she had 
failed to show up for jury deliberations that morning wehner said 
she had been beaten before she was shot many times 
neighbors told police the couple had fought over the weekend and 
one woman said she heard gunshots 
the judge selected an alternate to replace ms singletary 
it is tragic the judge said but what happened to her does 
not add or diminish to the evidence of whether mr ramirez is guilty 
or innocent 
i do not mean to be callous he said but we have business 
to do 
he recessed court for the day 
i think we all have been terribly affected he said 
it was the second time in five days that a deliberating juror had 
to be replaced on friday a juror was dismissed for sleeping during 
the talks and an alternate was substituted 
in addition to the 12 regular jurors seated from the beginning of 
the trial 12 alternates were chosen as of tuesday five had been 
sent in as regular jurors

namibias administrator on tuesday 
ordered that 1200 policemen who had served in a paramilitary unit 
be confined to their bases for retraining 
adminstratorgeneral louis pienaar said the policemen had been 
members of a disbanded counterinsurgency group known as 
koevoet the afrikaanslanguage word for crowbar 
he said the action was designed to ease tensions as the 
territory also known as southwest africa heads toward 
independence 
pienaar said the relative calm in namibia allowed the policemen 
to be confined to bases where they will undergo reorientation and 
retraining to equip them for roles that are to be redefined 
if the situation should in any way deteriorate i shall 
consider the steps that would need to be taken in order to restore 
law and order he added 
united nations officials including secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar had said that former koevoet members were 
intimidating civilians in northern namibia and should be removed 
from the 6000member namibian police force 
un military and civilian personnel are in namibia to monitor 
the transition to independence the territory has been administered 
by south africa since world war i under a mandate from the defunct 
league of nations 
koevoet squads played a leading role in the south africanled 
security forces battle against guerrillas of the southwest africa 
peoples organization swao 
most koevoet members were black namibians some civilians accused 
the unit of brutality and atrocities it was disbanded in january 
many exkoevoet members have been integrated into the regular 
police force pienaar had argued the exkoevoet fighters were needed 
to guard against possible attacks by swapo guerrillas 
under a unbacked regional peace accord south africa agreed to 
free the territory beginning april 1 but on that date some 1000 
swapo guerrillas crossed into northern namibia from southern angola 
setting off three weeks of fighting that threatened to derail the 
independence plan 
but the peace process is back on track and swapo is favored to 
win preindependence elections in november 
pienaar said he decided to confine the exkoevoet members to the 
bases after un officials assured him that the threat of a swapo 
attack had subsided

president bush on tuesday promised a 
balanced decisive effective and achievable national drug plan 
backed by more federal money to meet americans demand for action 
he declined to say where the money would come from because the 
final decisions havent been made 
bush said he would not raise taxes but we are going to expand 
federal expenditures he added we will have to do some 
reallocation of resources 
bush focused on the antidrug campaign on his last day at the 
white house before leaving for a threeweek vacation in 
kennebunkport maine 
he told reporters at a news conference that his drug policy 
coordinator william bennett has given him an outline of the 
developing national drug strategy 
its balanced decisive effective and achievable and it will 
target all aspects of the problem it will call for commitment and 
sacrifice and understanding but its clear to me that the american 
people demand no less he said 
he said final details of the plan will be worked out over the 
next several weeks before he announces the specifics on sept 5 
bennetts proposal would target drug users as well as strengthen 
enforcement a draft of the plan obtained by the associated press 
calls for users to be arrested and fined and to lose their drivers 
licenses their cars their federal grants if they have any 
bush discussed whether to put federal financial muscle behind 
such proposals in a meeting tuesday with his domestic policy council 
of advisers 
as drafted the plan would withhold federal highway funds from 
states that did not revoke drug offenders licenses and it would 
withhold federal criminal justice funds from states that dont 
perform drug tests on people in the criminal justice system schools 
receiving federal money would have to have firm prevention programs 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said bush was still weighing 
those ideas 
during his presidential campaign bush supported revocation of 
drug offenders drivers licenses 
the draft strategy would seek a 49 percent increase in federal 
treatment money for 1990 to 925 million 12 billion for new 
prison construction a 200 million increase for state and local law 
enforcement and 50 million for the department of housing and urban 
development most of it for security improvements at public housing 
projects 
the president asked tuesday if he planned to cut other programs 
to fund the antidrug war said he could not state where the money 
would come from because the final decisions havent been made 
but we will have to do some reallocation of resources theres no 
question about that 
pressed on how he would come up with the funds he added were 
in a period of hard times in the sense that we dont have all the 
money that we would like to spend in several areas 
at the same time he expressed determination to reduce the federal 
budget deficit and stay within the spending limits set by 
congressional budget writers 
some law enforcement professionals and members of congress have 
criticized the antidrug plan being developed by bennett under the 
legislation that established his job as too reliant on enforcement 
solutions 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee criticized bushs resolve not to raise taxes to fight 
drugs 
to make real progress on this issue it is going to take a 
massive commitment of resources to law enforcement drug treatment 
programs drug education and more if that means raising taxes to 
pay for drugfighting measures so be it biden said tuesday we 
should not let the politics of readmylips stand in the way of a 
full scale effort to arrest the drug epidemic 
bennett told reporters tuesday that his plan will lay out terms 
of accountability for all aspects of this problem whether its the 
treatment side or the education side or the law enforcement side 
and were holding ourselves accountable 
were saying in 10 years theres going to be a lot less drug 
use said bennett 
bush on tuesday met with two groups of community antidrug 
activists to get their opinions on what must be done 
among them were the parents of a texas college student killed by 
members of a drug cult 
jim and helen kilroy among about three dozen people meeting with 
bush and bennett later said tougher enforcement is needed their 
sons body was found in a mass grave outside matamoros mexico 
drug treatment experts said after the meeting that they didnt 
dwell on where to get the money for the antidrug fight 
geraldine sylvester head of new hampshires drug rehabilitation 
services said i dont know how the funds are going to be 
reallocated but i know there is a total commitment to fight this 
war on drugs on all levels and if there has to be some shuffling of 
resources im certain they are astute enough to figure out exactly 
how to do that 
the president in his remarks was asked if drugproducing 
countries should be penalized if they fail to cooperate in stemming 
the flow of drugs 
i wouldnt be opposed to that provided they were able to 
cooperate with us the president said 
but he said he has a certain responsibility to look at the 
problems that are facing some of these countries with limited armed 
forces of their own with very complicated insurgencies in their 
countries and to formulate a foreign policy that takes these things 
into consideration 
he expressed the view that colombias leadership wants to help 
for example but that its effort is hindered because colombia has 
been ripped asunder by the drug cartels with many judges and 
officials assassinated

state officials tuesday approved a 
farreaching blueprint to clear the polluted skies of southern 
california so the state can meet federal standards by the year 2007 
harriet wieder an orange county supervisor serving on the 
ninemember air resources board characterized the boards plan to 
clean the nations smoggiest air as a leap into a brave new 
world 
but its either that leap or we wake up one morning and 
discover that its the day after and that we did it to 
ourselves said brian p bilbray a board member and san diego 
county supervisor 
the board voted 80 to adopt the plan despite industry 
opposition that prompted the board two months ago to request 
additional information from the regional agencies that developed the 
program 
the plan was branded texas justice by william t huston a 
commercial developer leading a coalition of business and labor 
interests battling to revise the smog cleanup effort 
theyre acting as their own judge jury and executioner 
huston said 
but while two reports were presented to clarify questions raised 
by business and political interests the air resources board made no 
changes in adopting the plan 
those people who oppose the plan are going to have to look at 
how they plan to accomplish the same goals said arb chairwoman 
jananne sharpless so far the alternatives offered have come up 
very short of the goals or they dont have any authority for doing 
what they want to do 
the unprecedented plan represents a comprehensive approach to 
improving air quality using landuse planning transportation 
programs and stricter standards for industry smokestacks automotive 
emissions and petroleumbased fuels 
it was finalized last march following more than five years in 
development by the south coast air quality management district and 
the southern california association of governments 
the first part of the threephase program calls for enacting more 
than 120 rules that would require for example the chemical 
reformulation of aerosol sprays and stricter controls on industry 
smokestacks 
existing smogcontrol rules were incorporated in the plan but it 
also serves as a blueprint for the future by outlining the process 
for adopting new rules and by planning for the use of antipollution 
technologies yet to be perfected 
the los angeles basin has the worst air pollution in the nation 
and has been working under a court order to comply with standards 
set by the federal clean air act and enforced by the environmental 
protection agency 
air quality measurements for el monte tuesday showed ozone levels 
at about 15 hundred parts per million an unhealthy level said tom 
eichhorn a spokesman for the south coast air quality management 
district 
it was unhealthful but for august in southern california it 
was pretty good eichhorn said 
following the board action state and two regional agencies can 
begin enacting the plans clean air provisions even though the epa 
has yet to give its approval said bill sessa a spokesman for the 
air resources board 
california is the only state with its own standards for vehicle 
emissions and has led the nation in reducing smog by pioneering new 
standards and such devices as the catalytic converter sessa said 
last june for example the board tightened its emission 
standards which exceed federal standards for several pollutants 
for automobiles to be produced in 1993 and afterward 
the board also plans to require improvements in computerized 
pollutant control equipment in cars tighten state smog check 
requirements and set new standards for petroleumbased fuels 
huston refused to say whether his group the community air 
quality task force plans to file a legal challenge to the plan 
although he said thats an option to be considered

the bones of the five suspected victims 
of cannibal alferd packer were reburied tuesday in a simple yellow 
pine coffin as a minister prayed for all victims of crime and 
evil 
in a ceremony devoid of flowers or music the scientists who dug 
up the bones last month placed them in five compartments inside the 
4footby4foot corduroylined coffin 
four lake city clergymen spoke briefly to a crowd of about 150 
gathered at the hilltop grave before the coffin was lowered 8 feet 
into the ground a steel plate was placed over the coffin to 
discourage vandals 
packer was the only survivor of a snowbound party of utah 
goldseekers that was trapped in the san juan mountains in southwest 
colorado during the winter of 1874 
packer claimed one member of the party killed the other four and 
packer was forced to kill him in selfdefense he said he ate their 
remains to survive 
he eventually was convicted of manslaughter and served time in 
prison but maintained his innocence until his death 
dr james starrs a george washington university law professor 
who wanted to separate fact from legend about packer led a research 
team that dug up the bones last month 
the bones and other artifacts found in the common grave were 
transported to the arizona state museum in tucson for analysis but 
time and money shortages forced the reburial of the bones earlier 
than the scientists had hoped 
last week starrs and walter birkby curator of physical 
anthropology at the arizona state museum said they found at least 
four of the victims were bludgeoned to death in butcher fashion and 
then were carefully defleshed they also said there was no visible 
evidence that any had suffered gunshot wounds 
birkby said tuesday that the only answer scientists found in 
their examination of the remains was that the victims were murdered 
and cannibalized 
we found nothing to corroborate or refute anything packer 
said birkby said tuesday well never know who did it based on 
any solid physical evidence were never going to know 
when the bones were dug up in july the expedition took on the 
air of a lighthearted historical circus reporters descended on the 
community and tshirts with slogans such as have a friend for 
dinner and taste the high country sold briskly 
on tuesday the rev jeff light of the presbyterian community 
church began the reburial ceremony with a prayer for victims of 
crime and evil 
three other ministers representing the other religious 
communities of lake city population about 400 addressed the 
gathering of local residents and tourists then the scientists 
placed the bones in the coffin compartments and served as 
pallbearers 
sandra jarman who owns the property on which the remains were 
buried placed five grapevines and eucalyptus leaves on the coffin 
before it was lowered into the common grave 
dressed in a black jogging suit and black tennis shoes jarman 
said shes pleased the bones have been returned to the place where 
they were dumped in burlap sacks 115 years ago 
theyve become my little friends she said 
a headstone erected on the site in 1928 or 1929 was to be 
restored to its place and the site opened to tourists wednesday

gay mens health crisis on tuesday urged new 
yorkers who may have aids to seriously consider being tested for the 
disease a change of emphasis that the group said was based on 
medical and political developments 
while the organization has been skeptical about testing in the 
past its director richard dunne said it was reassured by a state 
confidentiality law and encouraged by evidence some drugs can extend 
the lives of aids patients 
weve always said think about it said dunne the 
difference is that if you thought about it in 1985 you probably 
wouldnt want to get tested if you think about it in 1989 you 
probably will want to get tested 
the organization was not recommending the test be taken dunne 
said because the decision was a personal one 
gmhc placed ads headlined think about it in the citys four 
major daily newspapers tuesday they noted that the drug azt can 
slow development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and 
treatments such as aerosolized pentamidine can prevent some 
aidsrelated illnesses

a lawyer who said he was running for an american 
seat decisively captured the democratic nomination tuesday over a 
cubanborn woman in an ethnically tense battle to succeed the late 
rep claude pepper 
gerald richman a 47yearold former florida bar association 
president making his first run for office defeated rosario kennedy 
44 who resigned after four years as a miami city commissioner to 
run in the special election 
with all of 146 precincts reporting unofficial returns richman 
had 14411 votes or 61 percent to 9226 votes or 39 percent for 
ms kennedy 
richman will face republican state sen ileana roslehtinen 37 
on aug 29 president bush will campaign with the cubanborn 
educator here wednesday as the republican party eyes what it 
considers a golden opportunity to add to its 108 majority in 
floridas congressional delegation 
pepper held the seat for the democrats from its inception until 
his death 27 years later may 30 at age 88

richman stunned ms kennedy the democratic frontrunner with a 
latecharging 146vote victory in the aug 1 primary in which five 
other democrats were eliminated 
ms roslehtinen whose resignation after seven years as state 
legislator is effective aug 29 won the fourway race for gop 
nomination with 83 percent of the vote her campaign manager is jeb 
bush the presidents son 
little difference on issues emerged between ms kennedy and 
richman in their runoff dominated by discussion of ethnic 
divisiveness qualifications and ability to defeat ms roslehtinen 
in late charges ms kennedy criticized richman who raised money 
for democratic candidates in 1988 for contributing 2000 to the 
bush campaign richman said he attended a bush dinner at a friends 
request and his campaign countered that ms kennedy campaigned with 
thencandidate dan quayle her campaign said she appeared with 
quayle in her role as a city commissioner 
ms kennedy carried predominantly hispanic precincts aug 1 and 
richman dominated miami beachs jewish and retiree vote 
jo ann pepper the late congressmans niece and black candidates 
marvin dunn and sonny wright dominated the diverse districts black 
neighborhoods and all three have endorsed ms kennedy however 
richman devoted much attention to the black vote in the runoff race 
there are 32183 registered black voters 16028 registered 
hispanics and 51987 nonhispanic whites among the 100198 
registered democrats in the 18th district 
richman has said repeatedly this is an american seat 
richman says that theme means he is for all the people and that 
he rejects republican leader lee atwaters 2monthold statement 
its time to elect the first cubanamerican to congress the 
mostqualified candidate should be elected he says 
ms kennedy says her remark in jest that she was that 
cubanamerican was in the context that the republican frontrunner 
was cubanborn 
ms kennedy who was 14 when she left cuba implied in a saturday 
debate that richmans campaign tried to exploit her spanish accent 
and asked richman when are you going to stop this type of 
divisive campaign 
the dade county fair campaign practices committee was critical of 
richmans campaign and the miami herald called it naked 
deliberate bigotry and has endorsed ms kennedy 
democrats are concerned about increasing hispanic numbers 40 
percent to 50 percent of the registered voters in the district 
most are republicans 
richman supporters say he can best energize the vote in black 
neighborhoods and on miami beach to capitalize on the democrats 
continued registration advantage 
there are 71620 registered republicans 46738 of them 
hispanicborn

shipyard workers on tuesday began moving the 
exxon valdez from a pier to a dock where the tanker that caused the 
nations worst oil spill will be repaired over the next nine months 
tugboats helped guide the 987foot ship into the repair dock 
which is only 3 feet wider than the 166footwide valdez national 
steel and shipbuilding co officials said 
workers plannd to tow the valdez from its current berth at a 
nassco pier into san diego bay then turn and back it sternfirst 
into the dock 
the vessel was launched three years ago from the same dock which 
resembles a huge swimming pool separated from the bay by a moveable 
gate 
the crippled ship was returned to nassco from alaska where it 
ran aground march 24 in prince william sound spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of crude into the sounds wildliferich waters 
repairs to the ship and its shredded hull were expected to cost 
about 25 million 
dockmaster frank russell a veteran of more than 40 dockings 
said he would use up to eight tugs to coordinate the ships movement 
while monitoring the tankers position through a team of divers and 
surveying instruments 
shipyard workers were not expected to start repairs this week 
because it will take about six days to remove all the water from the 
dock 
i suspect there will be a twoweek period in which the only 
people in there will be lawyers and engineers said nassco senior 
vice president al lutter 
once inside the gate will be closed and naasco crews will start 
draining water from the repair dock after lowering the water level 
about six feet which takes about four hours the valdez will come 
to rest on blocks and supports that will hold the ship while its 
being repaired 
five clusters of 24 adjustable jacks each having a 250ton 
capacity have been installed to maintain an even keel when the ship 
is lowered a level landing was crucial because the tanker otherwise 
might slide off the blocks and damage itself and the repair dock 
russell said 
exxon shipping co officials have said they plan to return the 
tanker to service though possibly under a different name after 
repairs are completed 
the valdez arrived off the san diego coast july 10 after being 
towed more than 2000 miles from prince william sound but its entry 
into the bay was delayed three weeks after oil slicks were sighted 
near the vessel the ship pulled into the nassco yard on july 31

parked amid the tents and trailers littering 
the alfalfa field the site of rock n rolls most memorable 
concert 20 years ago tuesday was a jeep with the license plate tv 
junkie 
it was in the right place woodstocks 20th anniversary party was 
a premier media event with dozens of reporters elbowing each other 
to find out if the peace and love generation had lost its way in the 
1980s 
a forest of satellite dishes surrounded a plaque that 
commemorated the epochal threeday concert that attracted some 
400000 spectators woodstock veterans and wistful wannabes 
barely had the chance to formulate their reminiscences before being 
asked to share them with the world 
you want my favorite quote debbie armstrong of montgomery 
ny called out as a reporter wandered by a tent thick with tattoos 
and tiedyed shirts we feel like were at the orange county fair 
only were the attraction 
much to some peoples disappointment there was no organized 
celebration of woodstocks 20th anniversary at the late max yasgurs 
onetime farm rather it was a freeform party as tourists mingled 
with campers staking their turf under the watchful eyes of dozens of 
cameras 
armstrong and her friends said theyd been interviewed about a 
dozen times their favorite came monday night when they crowded 
around a campfire and shouted goodnight from woodstock on cue to 
a cameraman from scranton pa 
this has turned into such a media event she said back 
then they reporters werent even into the heart of it it took 20 
years for the spirit to sink in 
but the attention has its downside she said 
a lot of people are drawn toward the cameras she said a 
lot of people are behaving because the press is looking 
that didnt stop one man with a cast on his foot from holding up 
a marijuana cigarette when questioned by a reporter his companion 
said she was from venus 
twentyyearold denise frangipane of bethel said shed been 
camping at the site for the last four days because we werent 
there last time im getting tired of saying that she said she 
made the same statement the day before to a german television crew 
or was it a french team 
a makeshift stage crammed with speakers stood at the bottom of 
the natural amphitheater where richie havens launched the original 
woodstock with a threehour show 
anybody who has anything just gets up and plays frangipane 
said despite hopeful rumors spreading through the crowd that the 
grateful dead would make a return engagement the stage was empty 
tuesday afternoon 
makeshift hot dog souvenir and tshirt stands lined the country 
road leading to the field where several hundred people were 
gathered tuesday 
a representative of the fields current owners june gelish and 
louis nicky of new york city collected 5 from each carload for 
field restoration 
ron anderson 42 put a guitar in the back of his car and drove 
up from coventry conn for the day hed already been interviewed 
by reporters from enough channel numbers to make up a lottery card 
he wasnt at the original concert but said he was glad to 
experience it this way 
i didnt really know what to expect i found it to be quite 
interesting weve met some pretty nice people he said

the second flight of the 
b2 stealth bomber was scrubbed tuesday because a preflight 
checklist took too long to complete to get a full days flight test 
completed the air force said 
col don weisert the b2s deputy program director at ohios 
wrightpatterson afb also blamed the weather and said in a 
telephone interview there was nothing wrong with the airplane 
we expected winds to come up and we wanted to make sure we 
could get in a full day of activity he said 
a statement released at edwards said the second flight of the 
b2 has been delayed because of the crew rest requirement they have 
been on duty on preflight status for the maximum time for safety 
air force officials did not specify how long was the allowable 
duty day for the b2 crew flight crews however must be allowed 
sufficient periods of rest depending on the requirements of the 
mission 
the three to fourhour second flight which may include 
retracting its landing gear faster speeds and higher altitudes was 
initially planned for saturday but was postponed 
after a fivehour delay on tuesday the ominouslooking flying 
wing emerged from its hangar at about 1230 pm and rested for 
about 90 minutes before the mission was scrubbed 
captain tess taft an air force spokeswoman reached at 
wrightpatterson said it looks good for tomorrow 
on its july 17 maiden flight northrop corp test pilot bruce j 
hinds and air force col richard couch flew the b2 for nearly two 
hours and reached an altitude of 10000 feet without retracting the 
landing gear 
the b2 a tailless 172footlong wing with bulges in the 
middle was described by couch as a very nimble aircraft and a 
lot of fun to fly 
the 530 million fourengine bomber engineered to elude radar 
detection is designed to carry nuclear bombs and along with the 
conventional b1 replace the air forces aged b52 bomber fleet 
that forms part of the us nuclear deterrent against the soviet 
union 
the socalled stealth technology combines advanced composite 
materials and a special shape to create a plane believed to be 
undetectable by enemy radar though the bomber is still being 
developed stealth fighters have operated for several years 
the government has already invested about 224 billion in the 
b2 program which is 18 months behind schedule and congress has

a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that 
jewish inmates at the state prison of southern michigan should be 
allowed to travel between complexes at the prison site so they can 
attend weekly sabbath services 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
unanimously rejected claims by michigan prison officials that 
permitting the intercomplex travel by six jewish inmates would pose 
security problems the inmates accused prison officials of violating 
their civil rights 
the appeals courts decision reverses a ruling by us district 
judge horace gilmore who upheld the prison officials position and 
barred travel of the prisoners for the weekly services 
the appeals court upheld another portion of gilmores order which 
requires the prison officials to permit an annual passover seder 
observance at the prison 
the inmates filed suit in april 1986 
the michigan facility once was operated as a single 4500bed 
prison but has since been split into three separate complexes 
according to testimony

if there can be an unsung hero in opera 
especially in a monumental extravaganza such as die meistersinger 
von nuremberg it would have to be the chorus master 
despite the central role of the 97 singers the largest chorus in 
any seattle opera production to date the man charged with welding 
them into a crisp ensemble with flawless diction and perfect pitch 
gets no major billing and takes no bows 
what george fiore does take is unabashed pride in his work 
im always in charge because i have to be he said i get 
very good results with the chorus 
in an interview at a rehearsal earlier this month fiore waxed 
enthusiastic during a parade scene that brings more than 100 people 
on stage in the third act 
you see that active energetic they really are the populace 
not just 100 sticks people singing notes he said 
the 63yearold fiore became chorus master five years ago after 
occasional work as associate chorus master coach for principal 
singers and other jobs with the opera dating to 1968 
i brought him in said speight jenkins general director of 
the seattle opera i dont think theres a better chorus master in 
the country 
jenkins who spent two years as host of the television series 
live from the met and eight as music critic for the new york 
post said fiores crowning achievement was a fight scene with 135 
people on stage in the second act 
for three minutes they are in a wild melee singing and 
fighting on stage then the night watchmans horn is heard and 
everyone vanishes jenkins said 
the libretto calls for 16 separate vocal lines for example 
four soprano sections each exchanging epithets in previous modern 
stagings jenkins said they simply have each line of people sing 
all the words 
director francois rochaix however decided that to be true to 
wagners libretto half the singers in each line should sing one 
epithet and the other half the response 
people are going to hear a difference a clarity of lines i 
hope jenkins said george has done such extraordinary work that 
the people are able to do this he taught it to them to sing 
faster than he ever thought hermann michael could conduct it 
with the slightest breakdown in timing anything less than 
perfect pitch and diction the music would sink into cacophany 
i think weve rehearsed that fight scene 30 or 40 times it 
hasnt fallen apart yet jenkins said 
die meistersinger one of the longest operas at six housrs 
poses other challenges as well total costs are likely to exceed 
16 million for seven performances aug 319 
a new production on the scale of ours has not been done since 
the mets the metropolitan opera in 1962 jenkins said 
everybody likes to do die meistersinger its just that they 
cant afford to produce it 
a quarter or more of the cost goes for costumes sets and other 
onetime expenses 
under a contract with the american guild of musical artists 
fulltime choristers get 8 an hour for rehearsal time plus a 
performance fee for a total of about 1200 for die 
meistersinger while auxiliaries earn as little as about 100 
total said monte jacobson a soprano in the chorus since the 
company was founded 25 years ago 
they all have jobs like anybody else fiore said some of 
them are housewives of course but thats a fulltime job too 
regulars including those from past seasons must survive an 
audition every two years about 190 singers were heard in special 
auditions to choose the 61 auxiliary choristers in die 
meistersinger 
the chorus which began rehearsals may 18 sings the opening and 
closing lyrics and die meistersinger is one of handful of 
operas in which the people comprise a central role 
wagner composed this opera as a strong statement of the german 
people jenkins said in each of the acts the people have a 
very strong role to play 
set in 16thcentury nuremberg the opera tells the story of hans 
sachs a cobbler and master singer who winds up serving as principal 
judge in a song contest among the towns apprentice master singers 
to the victor goes the hand and fortune of eva the beautiful 
daughter of the towns wealthy goldsmith and the object of sachs 
own unrequited love 
the cast includes roger roloff as sachs soprano helen donath as 
eva and julian patrick benn heppner and bergitta svenden in other 
lead roles 
die meistersinger is the seventh new wagner production for 
jenkins since he took over in 1983 the seattle opera has risen to 
no 6 in attendance nationwide and wagner news has declared it 
without a doubt the leading wagner company in america 
the company is best known for annual stagings of wagners 
fourpart der ring des niebelungen from 1975 to 1987 the first 
nine years in english as well as german 
jenkins hired largely to overhaul the ring presided over new 
productions of die walkure in 1985 and of das rheingold 
siegfried and die gotterdammerung in 1986 
despite the companys overall financial health annual 
productions ended in 1988 because of persistent operating deficits 
for the 35 million summer extravaganza and what jenkins saw as a 
lack of sufficient local corporate and individual donations he has 
said he hopes to revive the ring for performances every two or three 
years starting in 1991 
the rings legacy is evidence this year with the return of 
michael as conducter rochaix as director joan sullivan as lighting 
director and soloists patrick and roloff who sang wotan in 1984 
1986 and 1987

as one editor at people magazine recalls there 
was no burst of pride among the staff when some of their stories 
began appearing two years ago on a televised edition of the weekly 
but hal wingo the magazines assistant managing editor says 
people magazine on tv is winning over the more than 150 writers 
editors artists and production staff as it prepares to air its 
fifth edition on wednesday 
some of them were disappointed in it in the beginning he 
said of the staffs reaction i believe this next show is the best 
reflection yet of what the magazine is all about it feels like the 
magazine 
the staff was concerned he said because a quality tv show would 
stimulate sales of the magazine which sells a majority of its 
copies on newstands generally no subject airs unless it already 
was in print 
this time the onehour special on cbs includes an interview with 
christie brinkley and billy joel in which the singer strikes back at 
those who claim the couple will split and a segment about robert 
redfords fight to save an endangered hispanic community 
it also looks at the case of a woman who has been in jail for two 
years because she refused to allow her daughter to visit the 
exhusband she claims raped the girl 
it takes the viewer to zambia to hear about the successful 
efforts of a us couple who went there five years ago to teach 
local residents the importance of making their government protect 
wild animals being killed off by poachers 
and it includes an interview with professional tennis player 
michael chang and a firstperson narrative from the mother of two 
5yearold conjoined sisters 
wingo said the mix of celebrity interviews features and more 
serious subjects is closer to what the magazine strives to publish 
each week 
the magazine went through the same sort of search for the best 
combination of stories when it started he said 
nobody had ever done this before we kind of made up the rules 
as we went along wingo said 
duplicating the broad mix of 20 to 25 stories in the magazine was 
difficult on the televised special which could only include six to 
eight segments and it irritated the magazines staff he said 
but ward sylvester supervising producer of the tv special said 
hed like to think weve always reflected the magazine 
many of our stories were covers he said we look at the 
magazine and try to think of stories that will translate well 
sylvester said the show has improved since the arrival of kcbstv 
los angeles anchor bree walker who was host for the first time when 
it aired last in april 
i lean toward the hard news features thats my bent she 
said one of the things that they wanted to do was try to make 
people magazine on tv a more topical and newsier show 
issueoriented features will be a bright spot of this next show 
walker added we have to be a little forgiving the first time 
around on any new show

an inflationary thrust that began in 1987 and 
seemed to be gathering momentum was blunted in july according to a 
smallbusiness survey with a record of accuracy 
what appeared to be an inflationgatheringsteam has suddenly 
dissipated said prof william dunkelberg who conducts the survey 
for the national federation of independent business 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business and 
management said the change was clearly reflected in written 
responses from 1851 small and mediumsize businesses and was 
abrupt and substantial 
prior to the latest survey responses showed actual and planned 
price increases had steadily increased for nearly two years raising 
until recently the fear of a broadbased resurgence of inflation 
that fear was shared by many economists the federal reserve 
board and even by some white house advisers but based on the latest 
responses dunkelberg said that at least for the moment the 
momentum in prices has been blunted 
the survey which examines existing conditions and attitudes 
about the future of prices hiring inventories borrowing and 
various other factors seeks to obtain an indication of economic 
conditions six months hence 
many of these indicators are then synthesized and expressed in a 
small business optimism index which last month rose slightly to 
998 from 995 in the second quarter of this year 
for comparison purposes the third quarter of 1975 is assumed to 
be 100 meaning the latest index approximates the expectations of 
small and mediuumsize businesses at that time 
the index begun in 1974 reached its highest reading of 1087 in 
the first quarter of 1984 and remained above 100 with just two 
exceptions until the second quarter of this year its low was 811 
in the second quarter of 1980 
the latest measurement said dunkelberg suggests a modest 
improvement over the second quarter in the outlook for business 
conditions and business expansion although the future of the 
economy as a whole stays a bit negative 
analyzing the report dunkelberg said more companies expect a 
deterioration of economic conditions than improvement over the next 
six months unemployment might drop slightly then rise modestly 
interest rates will fall a bit 
in the professors estimate the current weakness in interest 
rates is more a result of weakening credit demands than of federal 
reserve easing 
earlier studies have shown a reluctance of many firms to take on 
debt in recent years in the late 1970s more than 50 percent of 
respondents said they were regular borrowers but since 1981 that 
rate has not exceeded 44 percent 
for many companies he said the direct impact of higher rates 
should they occur isnt large more important he said might be 
the impact of higher rates on cash flow since it might affect 
customers and discourage buying 
the survey is conducted among the more than 500000 member 
companies of the federation which range in size from 
proprietorships to a relatively small number of companies with sales 
in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
what the federation does not represent is the top tier of perhaps 
1000 companies in terms of sales such as those represented on the 
fortune 500 list of largest companies and whose views are more 
often sought in surveys 
however the federation points out that the economic segment 
represented by its members employs about half the private nonfarm 
work force and produces about 50 percent of the nations goods and 
services 
measuring economic sentiment from this half of the economy thus 
involves a greater spread of business experience and opinion

the political opposition is pursuing an 
unprecedented dialogue with the armed forces seeking a formula for 
peaceful coexistence when chile returns to civilian government in 
march 
the military which has ruled since 1973 has indicated a 
willingness to negotiate but only under certain conditions 
both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past had 
led to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must be 
eliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability 
patricio aylwin the presidential candidate of a united 
centerleft opposition and heavily favored to win the presidential 
election dec 14 recently remarked we want an approach an 
exchange of views 
the isolation that has existed for years among civilians and 
military is not good for the country and must end aylwin added 
the time has come for a dialogue 
gen augusto pinochet the rightwing army commander who has been 
president since seizing power in september 1973 was obliged to 
call decembers general elections after losing a referendum in 
october on extending his rule to 1997 
aylwin and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to take 
place before the new government takes office march 11 
experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on the 
agenda 
ignacio walker a leading adviser to aylwin on military matters 
said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under the 
civilian government the continuation of the present 
commandersinchief in their posts the defense budget and probably 
the most sensitive problem how the new government will deal with 
the human rights violations during pinochets rule 
after the 1973 coup which toppled the elected government of 
marxist salvadoe allende the military launched a campaign of 
political repression thousands of leftists were arrested many were 
tortured killed or sent into exile human rights groups have 
documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after 
being arrested by seurity agents 
the opposition has said that it will investigate all pending 
cases of rights abuse and try those responsible 
its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnesty 
law issued by pinochet that pardoned violations occurred from 1973 
to 1978 
that announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning from 
the military ranks gen fernando matthei the air force commander 
who is considered politically moderate and has expressed support for 
a dialogue said repealing the amnesty law could unleash an 
unpredictible reaction by the armed forces 
those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious that 
could be matthei added 
he noted that pinochet himself has warned that an attempt to try 
military officials could lead to an interruption of the democratic 
transition 
opposition leaders have insisted they seek truth and justice 
not vengeance against the military they are under heavy political 
pressure from human rights groups representing victims of repression 
or their relatives 
another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clause 
that allows the military chiefs including pinochet to retain their 
military commands under the civilian government pinochet has said 
he will remain the armys leader for as long as the constitution 
allows until 1998 
even some progovernment politicians contend the new leadership 
must be empowered to make changes in the military command but the 
armed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point a 
statement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to 
use legitimate force to uphold constitution which was drafted 
by the military and approved in a referendum 
and military commanders insist that their mission includes 
ensuring internal stability as well as defending the country against 
foreign attack that is considered another potential area of 
controversy but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talk 
about it too in spite of the risks and difficulties 
the peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy 
and chile cannot be an exception wrote rene abeliuk a social 
democratic leader in a newspaper column 
the roman catholic church also has urged civilians and military 
to talk about their differences to help the transition to 
democracy

women around the country see a new femalemajority 
government in west berlin as a sign of a new age in west germany and 
a test case that could influence their political fortunes in the 
future 
women hold eight of the 13 seats in the west berlin senate the 
citys governing body 
while the coalition of leftist social democrats and 
environmentalists has held together better than many had predicted 
when it took office in march it has been tainted by controversy 
anne klein the state minister for youth affairs has been 
accused of taking part in illegal gambling activities 
culture minister anke martiny has come under fire in the press 
following allegations that one of her women staffers misused office 
contacts and mailing privileges to secure an apartment 
but women defenders respond that what happened to the women is 
nothing more than the kind of trouble men get into 
i wouldnt want to understate the seriousness of such matters 
but its fair to say that they are not problems specific to women 
politicians said ingrid hesse a spokeswoman for the social 
democratic womens organization an arm of the social democratic 
party which governs in coalition with an environmentalist group 
the fact that a woman is discovered to have taken part in 
something questionable doesnt detract from the undeniable 
importance of this huge step forward for women ms hesse added 
peter rudolph a taxi driver in his 50s tended to agree 
people are always looking for excuses to complain about the 
government especially now with all those women he said they 
arent doing anything the male politicians werent doing but 
everyone notices now 
the eight women senators caucus over croissants and coffee each 
tuesday morning in a ritual that has been called the witches 
breakfast 
it is really quite productive and it lets all these women blow 
off steam so that it doesnt interfere with the whole senates 
business said alice uebe chief adviser to ms martiny and an 
active the social democrat 
the women are credited with pressing for changes aimed at 
improving living conditions in this city of 2 million people tightly 
ringed by communist east germany 
they have introduced measures to reduce air and noise pollution 
improve housing availability and to expand daycare opportunities 
for the increasing numbers of west german women who work outside the 
home 
while many berliners attribute the atmospheric changes to the 
womens influence they likewise are blamed for decisions and edicts 
that dont sit well with the public 
west berlins interior minister erich paetzold decided in july 
to require that official correspondence be genderneutral for 
example a male resident is a berliner and a female is a 
berlinerin the unisex term is berlinerin with the second i 
capitalized 
what has become known as the big i decision has been widely 
ridiculed as silliness resulting from the female majority in the 
senate hannarenate laurien a former senator of the outofpower 
christian democratic union called it perverse 
monika herrmann one of the founding members of the womenonly 
artemisia hotel and art gallery in west berlin says the new 
government has awakened the west german womens movement 
but she and others also maintained that it has left some men 
feeling defensive and threatened 
for a long time many people have confused emancipation with 
sexual alternativism ms herrmann said in an interview women 
are doing things for themselves and men fear their power is being 
reduced 
a member of the city governments 35women advisory council on 
family and social affairs ms herrmann said the women in positions 
of authority now recognize that they have to move carefully to 
achieve what they want without undermining their electoral support 
meanwhile women politicians in other parts of the country keep a 
close eye on west berlin to gauge their own standing with voters 
the berliners have given the situation for political women a 
step up but we are seeing this in other areas of the country as 
well in smaller cities observed ingrid sehrbrock director of 
the womens union of the christian democatic union what kind of 
example the berlin coalition poses remains to be seen but it has 
certainly raised everyones consciousness

ban non saoae thailand ap the war has nothing to do with 
them but without warning it comes roaring in often on the 729 
people of ban non saoae who make their living by farming 
the war is cambodias government forces fighting rebels and 
the villagers have the misfortune of living close to the border 
where the fighting frequently breaks out with artillery barrages 
that send shells crashing into thailand 
bunker is one of the few english words that have worked their 
where 
also 
dum jankeja 64 said he also will stay dum and his wife share a 
bunker with three other households and he said adversity has 
brought the villagers closer 
we have to go through this together we help each other out if 
we go into the bunker we go in together 
less fortunate was somwang janpit 22 one of at least three 
villagers who recently lost legs to landmines 
in june he was searching for bamboo shoots in a deserted field 
he thought the blast he heard was someone shooting birds until he 
saw his right leg was gone 
yes im angry he said now i cant take care of my father 
and mother 
his mother 63 now toils nine hours a day in the fields to feed 
him his handicapped sister and their father 84 
at the village school anything that sounds like gunfire sends 
the children dashing for the bunker on the compound heavy shelling 
last year shattered several school buildings 
but most students have learned to cope a teacher said 
their homes are here in the village when they hear it the 
shelling they are scared when its over they go and play like

islanders say there is a curse on 
this mysterious 700 yearold ruined city they know as the reef of 
heaven 
the curse is so strong they say that no one will stay overnight 
no way the last person who stayed there was a german governor 
about 100 years ago said bermin f wellbacher director of 
tourism and natural resources for pohnpei site of the city and one 
of the three island states that make up the federated states of 
micronesia he was found mysteriously dead the next morning you 
wouldnt catch me there no way 
but wellbacher is more than happy for tourists to come in daytime 
to see a stone megalith that is one of the wonders of the pacific 
it is the prime tourist attraction of this impoverished remote 
island 2485 miles west of honolulu 
few people know about nan mahdol no one has fully explained how 
it was built or who built it 
most pacific islands never had a stone age but at nan mahdol the 
walls are made of stone blocks that weight up to 50 tons 
archaeologists believe the stones came from another island and 
brought to the site on rafts but how laborers were able to lift 
them remains a mystery 
it takes an hour by fast boat across a lagoon to reach the city 
at low tide visitors must wade through a sea grass swamp and climb 
slippery rocks to the dark grey mosscovered walls of the ruin 
nan mahdol is a canal city built on 92 artificial islands 15 
miles from kolonia the capital of pohnpei 
built near the passage through the coral reef into the lagoon it 
covers 160 acres huge walls of basalt rock up to 20 feet high 
enclose a deserted city with burial chambers vaults made of giant 
stone slabs and pathways of crushed coral 
scientists believe an advanced civilization built a seawall a 
priestly burial place and adminstrative center servants quarters 
a ceremonial center a coconutoil processing area and a 
communications center where messages were sent by beating log drums 
carbon dating of the ruins indicates the city was built between 
the years 1285 and 1485 recent underwater archaeology suggests it 
might be even older 
legend also says nan madol was created by magicians who then flew 
off into space 
nowadays people of pohnpei are divided over who owns the city 
the local paramount chief salvadore hadley claims it is his 
the government also claims it 
at stake is who gets the revenues from tourism 
i dont ever want to see the day that a paramount chief and the 
government are fighting one another in court said wellbacher the 
tourism official it goes against all our traditions but it is 
our greatest tourist asset 
last year almost 8000 tourists visited pohnpei a lush volcanic 
island which in turn was ruled by spain germany japan and the 
united states 
it is now the capital of micronesia made up of the islands of 
pohnpei truk and kosrae all formerly part of the usadministered 
united nations trust territory of the pacific islands 
wellbacher wants to build a road to the shoreline near nan mahdol 
to make the trip easier for tourists 
hed like to add a restaurant and souvenir shop 
but no hotel 
no one will stay overnight wellbacher said

chris lemmon has thrown over the pursuit of 
money in fox networks duet to chase his dream of becoming a 
pianist in open house 
its not really a new show in fact its as much a spinoff as 
anything else duet has been revamped given the new name open 
house and a largely new cast 
lemmon still plays richard phillips but now he has different 
goals the focus has been moved to a real estate office where 
phillips wife linda played by alison la placa now works 
its about my wife coping with her new job as a real estate 
saleswoman im a guy whos given up millions of dollars to follow 
his dream lemmon said 
last season richard quit his in his fathers patio business 
linda was pregnant and richard grew up and realized what was 
important they now have a young daughter i think they changed the 
show because fox stepped in and ordered a change they wanted 
something more controversial with the wife working and supporting a 
husband who is trying to find a new career 
its partially a case of art imitating life lemmon who has a 
degree in classical piano and composing had hoped to pursue his own 
dream 
it was a typical case of a man biting off more than he could 
chew said lemmon i wanted to be a pianist a composer then an 
actor a producer and a director i still want to do all of them 
but in time 
during the summer lemmon and his wife gina raymond took off to 
massachusetts for the movie dad with chris father jack 
lemmon and olympia dukakis we play pop and olympia at the age of 
35 i cut my hair and grew a mustache chris said 
gina went through a remarkable makeup transformation that made 
her look like olympia i didnt think it was possible 
the lemmons father and son previously appeared together in 
thats life 
pop and i are so significantly alike physically and 
temperamentally that i think we can only play father and son that 
cuts down on the amount of work we can do together which is tough 
because we love working together 
the acting bug hit lemmon rather late he studied with his 
fathers acting coach david alexander and in the comedy workshop 
run by the late harvey lembeck 
his first series was the shortlived brothers and sisters he 
appeared in some tv series and feature films but his big break was 
being named the aramis man in the tv commercials 
before his marriage he worked only enough to pay the bills and 
support his skiing habit one season i went to the slopes 55 
times he said i sprained my thumb three times in one month i 
lived in a cheap apartment and 12 or so commercials that i could do 
in two weeks would hold me for the year 
whats more important your work or your life im always 
concerned about people who say a career is the most important thing 
in their life with me my wife and my family come first i dont 
think i could ever believe in the movie business ahead of my family 
after that comes the health of this planet then the health of 
the brothers and sisters on this planet my career comes fourth 
its left me happy and sound spiritually it works for me 
lemmon is also active in greenpeace and save the whales 
he is working with several partners on a small film about robert 
schumann the german composer 
his wife clara made the money while he stayed home with their 
11 children and wrote music he said

the federal reserves tightmoney policy 
initiated last year to slow the economy and prevent inflation has 
achieved its desired effect university of michigan economic 
research shows 
an economic forecast prepared for release today predicts a soft 
landing following the implementation of the policy and 3 percent 
growth during 1990 with an unemployment rate of 57 percent 
the forecast is based on a series of equations involving hundreds 
of economic variables that comprise the michigan quarterly 
econometric model of the us economy also known as the michigan 
model 
janet c wolfe a university of michigan economist who helped 
prepare the forecast with professor saul h hymans and economist 
joan p crary said the federal reserves policy in part caused 
economic growth to slow this year 
the danger that runs in this type of policy is if the fed 
tightens too much growth might slow down or become negative and 
that would be a recession wolfe said 
she said the us department of commerces most recent 
measurement showed that the economy is growing at a rate of 17 
percent this year the forecast indicates continued sluggishness but 
a pickup during 1990 
while we expect slow growth for the remainder of this year 
we do not expect a recession wolfe said we expect renewed 
growth during 1990 that is contingent upon easing of the fed toward 
the end of this year 
according to the forecast inflation is expected to hold steady 
at 44 percent in 1989 and 1990 then creep up to 45 percent in 
1991 the gross national product will grow by 26 percent in 1989 
22 percent in 1990 and 29 percent in 1991 according to the 
forecast 
civilian unemployment is forecast to edge up from 53 percent in 
1989 to 57 percent in 1990 and 58 percent in 1991 automobile 
sales are predicted to hold steady at 10 million per year through 
the forecast period a decline from the 106 million units sold in 
1988 housing starts are expected to rebound from 14 million units 
in 1989 to 17 million units in 1991

when you ask people about richard c breeden 
the savvy washington lawyer nominated to head the securities and 
exchange commission they always start off by calling him very 
intelligent or extremely bright 
he has the experienced good mind that will stand him in good 
stead former sec chairman roderick m hills said monday after the 
nomination of breeden an architect of the savings and loan industry 
bailout was announced 
even people who question the wisdom of the appointment like sen 
donald w riegle jr dmich start their criticism with mr 
breeden is highly intelligent and did fine work on the sampl reform 
package 
one industry source who did not wish to be identified said that 
because of his keen mind breeden does not suffer fools gladly 
and could be abrasive 
but when breeden was gathering information for a task force 
chaired by thenvice president george bush on what financial 
regulatory rules needed to be amended or scrapped said the source 
we sent him some very difficult complicated stuff 
usually people in that position read it and dont understand 
it or pass it on to someone else to read it but when we met with 
him it was obvious he had read it and understood it all 
industry observers believe breedens wideranging experience will 
be an asset in the sec position 
he comes to this job with a fairly broad knowledge of the 
financial services industry said joseph r hardiman president of 
the national association of securities dealers which oversees 
overthecounter stock trading 
a 1972 graduate of stanford university and a 1975 graduate of 
harvard law school breeden practiced securities law on wall street 
with the prestigious firm cravath swaine amp moore he also worked 
for the washington office of the politically powerful texas law firm 
baker amp botts 
from 198182 breeden was an executive assistant to the 
undersecretary of labor 
hes been a practitioner hes been in government he knows 
banking said the industry source he may get rid of a lot of 
junk along the way but hell be doing his job 
the white house announcement ended months of speculation about 
who would succeed departing sec chairman david s ruder who 
announced in may he was stepping down 
in contrast to ruder 60 an academic and legal expert who 
managed to keep his distance from the freemarket philosophy of the 
reagan administration breeden 39 is known as a fierce fighter for 
the policies of george bush 
breeden helped write the bush plan for bailing out the nations 
ailing savings and loan industry and then shepherded through 
congress the plan to spend more than 150 billion over three decades 
to deal with the nations biggest money problem since the depression 
before that breeden a manhattan beach calif native who now 
lives in the virginia suburbs outside washington worked for and 
with bush in a number of capacities 
breeden now a presidential assistant for issues analysis also 
helped fashion administration policy in dealing with the exxon 
valdez oil spill 
he helped candidate bush prepare for the 1988 presidential 
debates with michael dukakis 
from 1982 to 1985 he was deputy counsel to bush as vice 
president breeden also served as staff director on the task force 
bush chaired to reform the financial regulatory system 
im not sure if hes a regulator or a deregulator said 
gordon macklin chief executive officer of the san francisco 
investment banking firm of hambrecht and quist 
macklin who has known breeden since 1984 said the wiry and 
intense lawyer is interested in efficient cost effective 
regulation he knows the interrelationships in the world of 
financial services he has a broad view of whats out there and an 
extensive knowledge

a striking telephone worker was critically injured in a picket 
line accident and the only contract talks between unions and four 
strikebound regional telephone companies failed to make any gains 
meanwhile customers of the four baby bell companies continued to 
experience minor delays on operatorassisted calls but a union 
spokesman said the strike by more than 190000 employees would bite 
harder in time 
the strike certainly has not seriously affected service jim 
ohare president of local 1118 of the communications workers of 
america in albany ny said monday 
but we know that after a while these machines that are running 
will show signs of lack of maintenance youll see more trouble as 
time goes on he said 
cwa workers were in the second week of a strike against new 
yorkbased nynex corp philadelphiabased bell atlantic and san 
franciscobased pacific telesis union members at ameritech which 
has its headquarters in chicago joined the walkout sunday 
members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
also are on strike at nynex pacific telesis and bell atlantic the 
strikes affected customers in 20 states and the district of columbia 
bell atlantic representatives presented a revised proposal to 
union officials at an hourlong meeting monday but cwa spokesman 
jim willer said the companys health insurance offer was 
unacceptable willer said the company continued to demand that 
workers pay deductibles plus half the premiums for relatives other 
than spouses and children 
efforts to shift some health care costs onto workers are a key 
issue in the four strikes 
the three other regional phone companies atlantabased 
bellsouth denverbased us west and st louisbased southwestern 
bell have reached settlements the seven baby bells were formed in 
the 1984 breakup of american telegraph amp telephone co 
no talks were scheduled at ameritech which serves 123 million 
customers in five midwestern states 
cwa officials in illinois ohio michigan indiana and wisconsin 
said their bargaining committees would meet thursday in detroit to 
plot strategy before seeking any talks with ameritech subsidiaries 
in their states 
i dont expect any talks before the end of the week said l 
keith dooley cochairman of the indiana bargaining committee 
right now i would say were still a long ways off from getting a 
contract 
ameritech subsidiaries have offered a threeyear contract with an 
immediate increase of 5 percent most of which would come in the 
form of a 1000 signing bonus for lowerpaid employees base wages 
would increase 2 percent in 1990 and 1991 said larry cose a 
spokesman for illinois bell 
the cwa said the offer would do little for lowerpaid operators 
and clerks 
the base pay has to increase enough to make it worthwhile for 
people to work there said greg kenefick a cwa spokesman in 
cleveland 
meanwhile nynex picket edward g horgan 34 was hospitalized in 
critical condition after a picket line accident in the new york 
suburb of mount pleasant 
police chief paul oliva said an 18yearold nynex employee was 
driving on the service road of a nynex facility when her car brushed 
horgan after he and several other pickets gathered around her car 
and yelled at her 
horgan mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded on 
the windshield but slid off and hit his head on the pavement 
police said the union disputed that saying he fell onto the hood 
and the young woman accelerated no charges were filed 
new york telephone co president fred salerno called the accident 
tragic and asked the union to resume negotiations to try and 
calm the waters

a nynex car was burned shortly after midnight monday in a 
company parking lot in elmont ny police said the fire was

the price of ual corp shares continued to rise 
with unconfirmed reports that several additional suitors were 
interested in aquiring the airline company 
ual rose 150 to 25850 a share monday in new york stock 
exchange trading the increase followed a gain of some 56 percent 
last week following a 240 a share takeover proposal to ual parent 
of united airlines from los angeles investor marvin davis 
the new york leveraged buyout firms kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
and forstmann little amp co also reportedly have expressed interest 
in buying the company while officials of new yorkbased pan am 
corp have stated they were interested in a possible merger 
it basically says the sophisticated players in the market 
believe that there will be other bidders for the company said 
robert joedicke an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york he said the amount of money that will be needed to take over 
ual limits the number of potential bidders 
its not something anybody and everybody will become involved 
in joedicke said 
the wall street journal reported in its editions today that the 
airline which is negotiating on a new contract with its pilots 
union is also considering a possible managementled employee buyout 
weekend talks between ual and the pilots apparently were aimed at 
determining whether the airlines unions might agree to enough 
concessions to make an employee buyout bid viable the journal said 
ual would also have to win the support of the machinists union and 
other employees 
uniteds pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying 
the company 
kathy hardin a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
unit at united said monday the unions financial and legal advisers 
were studying efforts to take over the company 
ual spokesman robert doughty said today the airline had no 
comment on the report it is our policy not to confirm or deny 
negotiations he said 
analysts have said ual could fetch as much as 675 billion and 
prospective bids likely would include a management buyout plan 
the journal has quoted officials it did not name as saying ual 
had received nibbles from several groups including companies that 
showed interest in eagan minnbased nwa inc parent of northwest 
airlines 
in addition to davis kohlberg kravis forstmann little and pan 
am were among those who unsuccessfully made takeover proposals for 
nwa which was sold to a group headed by los angeles investor alfred 
checchi for 365 billion 
officials of ual refused to comment monday on the report of 
additional bidders 
we neither confirm or deny any other bids ual spokesman 
doughty said monday 
kohlberg kravis roberts also remained silent on the issue 
the firm has said nothing and havent made any comment on 
whether it is interested in acquiring ual said spokesman tom daly 
officials of forstmann little also declined comment 
pan am said it would make an offer if uals board asked it to 
they have not publicly said they were up for sale said pan 
am spokeswoman elizabeth manners my understanding is that they 
did say they were going to explore some alternative 
last week in response to davis overture uals board of 
directors announced it would explore all possible financial and 
strategic alternatives open to the company

the federal reserve isnt likely to lower 
interest rates any time soon to boost economic growth despite a 
pointed warning of recession from president bushs budget director 
many economists say 
analysts predicted monday that interest rates will hold steady 
because the central bank is satisfied it has done all it needs to 
keep the country out of an economic slump 
those economists suggested that comments by budget director 
richard darman might actually backfire and make the central bank 
less inclined to ease credit conditions for fear of appearing to bow 
to political pressure 
darman complained that the central bank was keeping interest 
rates too high and would shoulder the blame if the country falls 
into a recession 
if we do have a recession i think it will be because they 
erred on the side of caution in fighting inflation by keeping 
interest rates too high darman said sunday on nbcs meet the 
press 
the white house tried to soften the sting from darmans message 
by praising the fed on monday for generally doing a good job but 
bush today generally endorsed the comments during a morning press 
conference 
bush praised darman for expressing his views which he called 
very balanced 
i feel very comfortable with his darmans sallying forth 
bush said i think i have said the same things in the past 
bush said he did not know of any president who had ever come out 
against lower interest rates but he stopped short of saying that he 
believed that if a recession did occur it would be the fault of the 
central bank 
private economists were surprised by the timing of darmans 
criticism given recent economic statistics such as a drop in the 
jobless rate in august that suggest the economy isnt as sluggish as 
previously feared 
there is virtually no chance that we will have a recession this 
year so why stir up this fuss and get financial markets unsettled 
when you dont have to asked michael evans head of a washington 
forecasting company 
but other economists said they believed darman was positioning 
the fed to take the blame if the economy does weaken and the country 
ends up in a recession right before next years congressional 
elections 
this is a classic situation of setting up the fed to be the 
fall guy if something goes wrong said robert dederick chief 
economist at northern trust co of chicago 
dederick and other economists said it was unlikely that darmans 
remarks would have any impact on upcoming fed decisions top fed 
policymakers will meet again in washington on aug 22 
many economists said they expected the central bank to hold 
interest rates steady and not ease further given recent signs that 
certain key sectors such as consumer spending are rebounding 
so long as the economy is ok there is no reason for the fed to 
ease any more said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
from march 1988 through march 1989 the federal reserve pushed 
shortterm interest rates higher in an antiinflation campaign the 
fed reversed course in june and has made three modest moves to lower 
interest rates by making more money available to the banking system 
banks have been able to cut their prime lending rate since early 
june by a full percentage point to 105 percent home mortgage rates 
have declined as well dropping below 10 percent to stand at 996 
percent for fixedrate loans 
sinai said he believed mortgage rates have hit their low for the 
year and may even climb by about onefourth percentage point in 
coming weeks as financial markets realize that the central bank has 
decided to hold off on further easing moves 
paul getman senior economist at the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa consulting company said the fed was correct to pause before 
driving interest rates any lower 
he said if economic activity turns out to be stronger in the 
second half of the year than forecast the fed would run the risk of 
triggering higher inflation next year by loosening credit conditions 
too rapidly

chrysler corp said today tentative 
prices for its 1990 cars will increase an average of 5 percent over 
comparably equipped 1989 models 
nearly half the boost is caused by the installation of 
driverside air bags in all of chryslers usmade cars expected 
to be about 1 million vehicles in the 1990 model year spokeswoman 
karen stewart said 
she said the average air bag will cost a consumer 450 less than 
what chrysler pays to buy and install them she refused to say 
exactly what the automaker is spending on the systems 
the rest of chryslers price increase stems from economic 
reasons including higher material and labor costs she said 
the federal government requires driverside air bags or automatic 
seat belts on all cars made in the united states after sept 1 
earlier this month general motors corp announced a tentative 
average price increase of 34 percent and ford motor co said its 
car prices could go up as much as 48 percent for the coming model 
year 
stewart said a few of the 1990model cars offered by the nations 
no 3 automaker will decrease in price while the rest will increase 
between 28 percent and 69 percent she said she did not have a 
list of all models and their price increases 
chryslers final retail prices will be announced in september or

costs and other expenses may result in a larger operating loss for 
the third quarter which ends sept 30 than in the second quarter 
that ended june 30 
the company said its previously announced program to reduce 
inventories on the shelves of us distributors and resellers is 
continuing 
ashtontate also is going through a transition to a newer version

hundreds of workers tore down black and 
red strike flags unlocked gates and poured back to their jobs 
tuesday at americanowned assembly plants closed over a union power 
struggle 
were waiting for the other union to come and try to take us 
out said alberto de la torre 22 an assembly line worker at the 
nibco valve plant in this northern border city 
weve been inactive for three weeks we need our jobs said 
marco antonio becerra a nibco section chief 
maquiladoras are foreignowned plants that take advantage of 
mexicos lower wage rates to assemble products to sell in the united 
states 
about 900 workers both men and women defied a rival union and 
unlocking gates reopened 15 american plants closed july 25 when one 
union leader attempted to take control from another 
rafael morales put up strike banners and locked the gates of 
plants organized under leader abel hernandez 
about 2000 workers were idled by the strike although they said 
the companies continued to pay their salaries 
morales argued that hernandez no longer could legally represent 
the workers because hernandez had withdrawn from the federation of 
mexican laborers or ctm 
but the workers said tuesday that they want hernandez as their 
union leader whether or not hes allied with the ctm 
theyre tired they said of waiting for government and judicial 
authorities to end the strike 
we want the government to intervene we want them to respect 
the contract we have with hernandez said aurelio veraza a nibco 
supervisor 
hernandez who had called for workers to return to their jobs 
said tuesday that he did so because they dont have any reason to 
stay out 
morales was not immediately available for comment 
no american manager was on the premises of any of the plants as 
the workers calmly walked past the two or three guards at each gate 
once inside each person went to work at his or her station 
taking orders only from the supervisors involved in the retaking of 
the plants 
the workers contend that morales acted illegally when he forced 
the plants closed 
only workers have the right to strike said veraza were 
happy with the work the americans give us theyre giving us chances 
to advance 
the state labor arbitration board had ruled in favor of morales 
but the plants took the case to federal court asking that hernandez 
be declared the official representative 
the federal court has yet to issue a ruling in the case 
all the workers interviewed said they expected morales supporters 
to attempt to remove them from the plants 
no action had been taken by the rival union however hours after 
the plants reopened 
two american companies invacare corp of elyria ohio and 
pilling de mexico of pennsylvania have said theyll pull out of 
mexico before being forced to sign a contract with morales 
and the workers said tuesday that theyre concerned that if the 
plants arent in operation theyll close down 
if the plants close down nobody is going to make sure we have 
jobs were not taking action against anybody we just want to hold 
on to our jobs said nibcos alonso rivera 
salinas has not made a statement favoring one union leader or the 
other 
plant managers have made several trips to mexico city seeking an 
end to the conflict through the federal government 
no decision had come tuesday from either the courts or government 
officials 
don king plant manager for the newly opened west bend plant 
said tuesday that the workers action proves their loyalty to 
hernandez 
its a loud signal from the mexican people to the government 
that they want their jobs and they want to work and work under the 
representation of abel hernandez said king contacted in at the 
economic development corp in mcallen texas just across the border 
from reynosa 
asked when the american managers would return to the plants king 
said we have to wait and see what happens we are continuing to 
try to solve this legally

grain and soybean futures prices rose tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade with the rise triggered by reports of 
deteriorating crop conditions 
mondays crop ratings from the department of agriculture showed a 
decline in the condition of the soybean crop particularly in iowa 
and illinois due to lack of moisture 
there was also a strike overnight in brazil said jerry 
gidel an analyst with lit america inc in chicago while it did 
not affect brazilian soybean shipments the psychology of that 
didnt hurt the beans 
soybean prices were also supported by the national weather 
services 30day forecast released monday which calls for 
belownormal precipitation and abovenormal temperatures 
corn futures were boosted by the announcement that mexico would 
be in the market for 400000 metric tons of corn and rumors that the 
soviet union would also enter the market 
wheat futures were helped by light commercial purchases by 
algeria and carryover from the other markets gidel said 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 399 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 5 cents higher with september at 233 a bushel oats

telecommunications inc the nations largest 
cable television systems operator said tuesday its secondquarter 
loss widened to 636 million citing higher interest expenses and 
increased losses by its affiliates 
the companys loss for the three months ended june 30 was three 
times larger than its 219 million loss in the second quarter of 
1988 
revenue for the second quarter rose 318 percent to 7264 
million from 5510 million in the second quarter of 1988 
the company said the increase in revenue was due to new cable 
television subscribers increases in rates and acquisitions 
tci said its operating income rose to 1426 million from 1254 
million a year earlier 
interest expenses however climbed to 2059 million from 1388 
million a year earlier and its share of losses by affiliates rose 
to 297 million from 400000 in the second quarter of 1988 
consummation of the purchase of a 425 percent indirect 
interest in sci holdings inc and the business combination involving 
united cable television corp and united artists communications inc 
have had a negative impact on tcis earnings due to the cost of 
servicing the indebtedness incurred to finance the transactions and 
the resulting increase in depreciation and amortization the 
company said 
for the first six months of the year tci recorded a net loss of 
115 million compared with a loss of 292 million in the first half 
of 1988 
sixmonth revenue rose 314 percent to 138 billion from 105 
billion a year earlier

eastern airlines trying to rebuild from a crippling 
strike and financial problems on tuesday expanded its schedule and 
cut its already discounted fares while adding the lure of refundable 
tickets 
a union leader meanwhile said the new fare cuts for fall travel 
by easterns healthier competitors would badly hurt easterns 
efforts to rebuild without its unions 
the discounts of up to 160 on a roundtrip fare were announced 
sunday by trans world airways and matched over the next two days by 
carriers including eastern delta air lines pan american world 
airways united airlines american airlines northwest airlines 
continental airlines and usair group 
george brennan easterns vice president for marketing said 
eastern had already planned new discounts before the other carriers 
and he said easterns fall promotion offers tickets that are much 
easier to use and a much better value in most cases 
besides competitive rates brennan said easterns discounted 
fares beginning sept 7 have fewer restrictions and unlike the 
other carriers allow full refunds on unused tickets 
weve been planning a major initiative for some time our 
fares are very very different our fares are like going to an atm 
automatic teller machine and theirs are like trying to get a 
mortgage brennan said 
eastern will require only three tosevenday advance purchase 
and its low fares are available nearly every day and carry no 
restrictive penalties 
the fares will affect all domestic markets eastern said 
the carrier increased tuesday from 350 to 390 daily flights by 
adding 40 flights connecting atlanta and destinations mostly in the 
south and said it would fly 600 daily flights starting sept 7 
easterns rebuilding plan proposed to its creditors calls for 800 
daily flights by years end and an airline about twothirds its 
prestrike size 
while eastern says it has hired enough new pilots and is keeping 
up with maintenance despite its strike it has been leasing five 
planes and crews from sister carrier continental airlines brennan 
said more planes and crews will be leased from continental owned by 
texas air corp as is eastern to meet the september expansion but 
that the practice is only temporary 
eastern union leaders in their sixth month on strike say the 
airlines claims to be coming back are misleading because their 
fares as low as 39 one way make it impossible to make money 
the more they fly the more they lose machinists district 
100 president charles bryan told a rally in miami on saturday 
matell said easterns priority is winning back customers and the 
company is pleased at 75 percent load figures as its tries to come 
out of chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
indications are were getting a warm welcome back matell 
said thats not to say that after a 5month strike operating 10 
percent of our service that there isnt a major challenge in 
rebuilding the airline 
you have to first win back your customer base we said in our 
business plan we would lose hundreds of millions of dollars between 
the comeback and the end of the year matell said 
bryan said in an interview tuesday that consumers are going to go 
with the other airlines because they are very reliable firstline 
carriers theyre not having phantom flights and people dont have 
to worry about losing their money 
if eastern tries to go even lower than the rest of the 
carriers thats just going to compound their problems its going 
to doom the rebuilding plan which was already doomed bryan said 
before the strike that started march 4 eastern normally had 
around 1 billion in revenue per quarter last quarter eastern 
posted 896 million in revenue 
management last week hurdled a major barrier to its rebuilding 
efforts when a split in pilots union ranks resulted in at least 250 
more pilots returning to work boosting to 650 the union crossovers 
eastern said with its own recruitment and training program it now 
has the 1700 pilots needed for its rebuilding plan 
eastern is still hiring flight attendants and mechanics to 
replace strikers 
the unions are backing a buyout bid by chicago businessman joseph 
ritchie and are lobbying in washington for presidential and 
congressional intervention

copper was 125 cents to 150 cents higher with august at 1218

chrysler corp tentatively plans to boost prices 
of its 1990 model cars by an average 5 percent the automaker said 
tuesday and blames much of the rise on the cost of 
federallymandated passenger restraints such as air bags 
price hikes outlined by the nations thirdlargest automaker 
would boost the price of a chrysler lebaron coupe by 87 percent to 
12495 and of a subcompact plymouth horizon by 607 percent to 
6995 for example 
the federal government is requiring that all cars made in the 
united states after sept 1 have driverside air bags or automatic 
seat belts as standard equipment 
chrysler and ford motor co said they will install air bags on 
about 1 million cars each during the 1990 model year and general 
motors corp said it will have the devices on about half as many 
earlier this week gm announced a tentative 34 percent increase 
in its 1990 car prices nearly 1 percent of it blamed on air bags 
ford division general manager thomas wagner said earlier this month 
that his company will boost car prices about 48 percent 
chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said tuesday that air bags 
will add about 450 to the price of each usmade chrysler car 
although thats less than the automaker actually is spending on 
buying and installing the devices she declined to say exactly how 
much the company is spending on air bags 
the rest of chryslers price increase stems from economic 
reasons including higher material and labor costs she said 
those figures are a bit lower than some analysts expected and may 
not include much padding for buyer incentives that can be factored 
into any carbuying deal 
there has been speculation that the big three are eager to get 
out of the incentive war they have been in since early april 
incentives have cost the companies hundreds of dollars per car in 
recent months cutting directly into profits 
but a unilateral withdrawal from the rebate war may be tough and 
consumers have grown accustomed to dealer offers of rebates and 
cutrate financing 
theyre filing for pretty big price increases said analyst 
david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc but whether they will 
be real world or just on paper to be superseded with rebates is a 
good question 
healy said he may have the answer i think they will wait for 
about 15 minutes see that 1990 sales are slow and come out with 
rebates 
firm retail prices will be announced during the next few weeks as 
the automakers introduce their 1990 cars 
although it is nearly certain that most 1990 cars will be more 
expensive than 1989s some analysts say the sticker shock could be 
worse 
if you look at an air bag cost and assume its between 350 and 
500 said analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new 
york city the price increases would not appear to be recovering 
the total costs of air bags and materials

sales of cars and light trucks rose 82 percent in 
early august compared with last year partly because of buying by 
consumers seeking to avoid price increases for 1990 cars the 
companies reported tuesday 
vehicles assembled by the eight major automakers in the united 
states sold at an average daily rate of 33660 during the aug 110 
period this year compared with a rate of 31118 during the same

in the last two seeks the big three automakers have outlined 
tentative price hikes for cars in the model year that generally 
begins in october general motors corp said its tentative prices 
will be about 34 percent above 1989 levels ford motor co said its 
prices will be about 48 percent higher and chrysler corps 1990 
prices will be about 5 percent up from 1989 
the companies said some of the increases are due to costs 
stemming from governmental requirements that they install passive 
restraint systems air bags or automatic seat belts in 1990 model 
cars 
some consumers may be pushing their 1990 car buying plans up a 
few months to miss the price boosts 
i think in all probability there are people buying a little 
earlier than usual but not many said analyst ron glantz of 
montgomery securities inc of san francisco 
he said the picture would become a clearer later in the month as 
more sales reports are issued 
consumers also were lured by incentives which automakers would 
like to drop during the coming model year 
car sales are a little stronger than i expected said analyst 
david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new york i would 
say it is the attractive rebates on the 89s and the fear of costs 
of air bags

them esso cocacola co and pepsico inc esso whose parent company 
is exxon corp operates the countrys only oil refinery 
a us economic embargo virtually ended the flow of investment 
capital from the united states and with the rebel warfare helped

armand hammer elated over his pardon by 
president bush for a watergateera crime won a 13year battle to 
clear his name with the same persistence and political savvy that 
made him a multibillionaire industrialist and intimate of world 
leaders 
hammer 91 said on monday he had been pardoned for making 
illegal contributions to president nixons reelection campaign in 
1972 hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976 and was 
sentenced to one years probation and fined 3000 
white house officials confirmed that bush had pardoned hammer and 
nine other unidentified people on monday but refused to give 
details repeated efforts to reach presidential counsel c boyden 
gray were unsuccessful tuesday 
having spent my lifetime fighting injustice this vindication 
reinforces my abiding faith in the american system of justice 
hammer said in a statement from his los angeles home i deeply 
appreciate president bushs action in clearing my name 
a spokesmen said tuesday that hammer chairman of occidental 
petroleum corp would have no further comment 
hammer spent several years seeking a pardon president reagan is 
known to have considered granting hammers wish before he left 
office last january but nothing came of it 
im pleading guilty because im guilty hammer had declared 
in federal court in 1976 but hammer had blamed former gov tim 
babcock of montana a former vice president of an occidental 
subsidiary through whom the 54000 in illegal payments were made 
hammer argued that he funneled the money through babcock to 
maintain anonymity but that babcock did not deliver the funds until 
after a new federal law went into effect in april 1972 which 
prohibited making campaign contributions in someone elses name 
babcock was sentenced to four months in prison and fined 1000 
for concealing the identity of hammer as the actual donor a federal 
judge later set aside babcocks prison term partly because hammer 
was given probation instead of a prison term because of his age and 
poor health 
leaving his hospital bed as a heart patient for sentencing 13 
years ago hammer expressed regret over the first crime he had ever 
committed he told the judge that i trust in the time that may be 
left me your honor will allow me to continue being a useful member 
of society 
since his brush with the law hammer has circled the globe in his 
specially outfitted boeing 727 hobnobbing with presidents kings and 
prime ministers pushing for ussoviet summit talks providing aid 
to earthquake victims giving away chunks of his vast art collection 
and trying to raise 1 billion to find a cure for cancer 
ive had two dreams two ambitions in life and i hope to 
accomplish both of them he once said they are peace between east 
and west and a cure for cancer 
all the while hammer has guided occidental petroleums growth 
from a struggling oil company worth 34000 in 1956 when he made 
his first investment into a colossus of oil chemicals coal and 
foods with a book value of more than 6 billion 
his pardon was not universally applauded however 
a group called the friends of oliver north decried the pardon for 
the man they said has been trying to encourage communist expansion 
through his open business dealings with the soviet union the 
group called on bush to muster the courage to pardon north the 
former white house aide convicted of charges in the irancontra 
affair 
born in new york as the grandson of a russian jewish immigrant 
hammer became a millionaire while still studying at columbia 
university when he took over his physician fathers faltering 
pharmaceutical business and turned it into a moneymaker 
at 23 he was fresh out of medical school but unwilling to wait 
six months to begin his internship at new yorks bellevue hospital 
so in 1921 hammer made his first trip to the soviet union to help 
alleviate a typhus epidemic 
once there hammer decided the russian people needed food more 
than medical assistance he quickly announced a deal that brought a 
shipload of surplus american wheat valued at 1 million in return 
for russian furs hides and caviar 
that deal caught the attention of vi lenin the first of many 
soviet leaders hammer has known lenin encouraged the young american 
entrepreneur to take over an abandoned asbestos mine near western 
siberia the first soviet concession ever granted to a foreigner 
hammer developed the mine into a profitable enterprise and soon 
obtained sales concessions for such leading american firms as ford 
motor co us rubber allischalmers and underwood typewriter he 
also opened the soviet unions first pencil factory which posted 1 
million in profits in the first year 
hammer left the soviet union in 1930 taking his profits in the 
form of paintings tapestries silver and jewels which formed the 
start of his multimilliondollar art collection he owns two art 
galleries in new york city 
during the 1940s hammer netted a 75 million profit from a 
100000 investment by developing a way to turn surplus potato crops 
into commercial alcohol and marketing a blended whiskey under his 
own label he accumulated seven distilleries and later sold his 
entire whiskey interests to the schenley group 
he also made fortunes in livestock feed and cattle and held the 
nations first milliondollar purebred angus cattle sale even 
today he is reaping fat profits from a 20 billion chemical 
fertilizer deal with the soviets and has joint coal mining and 
phosphoric acid ventures under way in china 
commenting on his reputation as a worldwide wheelerdealer 
hammer once said i am first a catalyst i bring people and 
situations together thats the big thing bringing the deal 
together

a boeing corp subsidiary overcharged the 
government by 59 million on five computer projects between 1983 
and 1987 a house committee said tuesday 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house government 
operations committee released a report from the general accounting 
office the congressional auditing agency detailing the overcharges 
by boeing computer services co like gao conyers said he was asking 
the air force to seek recovery of the money 
spokesmen for boeing computer services in seattle had no 
immediate comment on the report 
conyers also said he received a related but separate report from 
the gao tuesday suggesting that the software productivity 
consortium a group of 14 of the nations leading defense firms 
established to develop tools and techniques to improve the 
productivity of military software may have overcharged the 
government by 225 million for their participation in the 
consortium 
in both cases the house government operations committee said 
the improper charges stemmed from misclassification of projects as 
manufacturing and production engineering a category of expense 
for which contractors can be fully reimbursed by the government 
the gao however concluded that both boeing computer services 
and the software productivity consortium should have classified 
their activities as independent research and development 
expenditures a classification of expenses for which the government 
contribution is limited 
in this era of 300billion military budgets and 
halfbilliondollar airplanes 6 million may not seem like much 
but that money could give 2225 youngsters a chance in life by 
putting them through one year of head start conyers said in a 
statement

a canadian partnership removed some conditions 
tuesday on its 296 million hostile bid for dunkin donuts and said 
it would raise the offer to 308 million if it wins a lawsuit 
challenging the doughnut shop chains antitakeover measures 
dd acquisition corp a partnership of kingsbridge capital group 
and cara operations ltd said it would raise its price to 45 a 
share from 43 if delawares chancery court orders dunkin donuts 
to rescind its employee stock ownership plan and other defenses 
the torontobased partnerships offer originally was conditioned 
on obtaining 75 percent of the doughnut companys shares that 
offer which was set to expire at midnight tuesday was extended 
until sept 15 and is now conditioned on obtaining just 501 
percent or a bare majority of the shares 
what we are saying by dropping the minimum number of shares is 
that were prepared to buy a voting control position and hang around 
until we get actual control which could take a couple of years 
said eric w evans a spokesman for kingsbridge 
dunkin donuts which is based in suburban randolph had no 
immediate response to the revised offer the reaction on wall street 
was lukewarm dunkin donuts shares rose 37 cents to close at 
3787 in overthecounter trading tuesday 
kingsbridge the merchant banking arm of investor george manns 
unicorp canada corp offered a friendly merger with dunkin donuts 
at 42 a share in may when it was rebuffed it joined with cara 
the parent company of two canadian restaurant chains to launch the 
43ashare hostile offer 
dunkin donuts has set up a series of tough defenses including 
the employee stock ownership plan which holds about 16 percent of 
its outstanding common shares 
it also has a shareholder rights plan or poison pill 
designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a 
takeover making a merger prohibitively expensive 
and it has sold 28 million of preferred stock convertible to an 
11 percent stake in the company to an avowedly friendly investor 
general electric capital corp 
kingsbridge and cara have filed suit in delaware charging that 
the esop and preferred stock sale were improperly put in place 
solely to prevent a takeover the canadian partners also have asked 
the chancery court to order dunkin donuts to remove its poison pill 
last week the court refused to grant the partnership a 
preliminary injunction against the takeover defenses the case has 
not yet been scheduled to be heard on its merits

the government has announced new rules 
allowing foreign investment in the nationalized petroleum industry 
hoping to attract 8 billion over the next five years and modernize 
the industry 
this is the first time we have defined clearly what foreign 
investment is allowed in petrochemical products alfredo elias 
spokesman for the mexican petrochemical commission said at a news 
conference tuesday 
the commission has ruled that 15 oilbased products are now open 
to 40 percent private investment by foreign and domestic interests 
elias said those products were formerly reserved exclusively for 
the national oil company petroleos de mexico also known as pemex 
the new rules also allow about 350 tertiary petrochemical 
products to be manufactured with 100 percent private investment 
these include about 100 plastics products 
loosening pemexs grip on petroleum byproducts follows a may 
announcement that the government was allowing greater foreign 
ownership in mexican companies 
president carlos salinas gortaris administration has been 
striving to increase foreign investment and make the notoriously 
ineffectual oil industry more efficient and less corrupt 
its important for mexico to be integrated in world commerce 
and that we modernize technology elias said 
the mexican constitution reserves primary petrochemical product 
manufacture to the government only secondary and tertiary products 
come under the new ruling 
the energy mines and parastate companies department projects 
pemex investments of 15 billion through 1995 the government 
expects to attract an additional 8 billion from foreign and 
domestic private investors elias said

include du pont union carbide corp hoechst celanese corp and 
shell oil co he added 
the government hopes to increase petrochemical exports and 
decrease imports under the new scheme he said 
investment of 40 percent will be allowed in producing vinyl 
acetate acetone acrylic acid anhydrous acid chlorobenzenes 
ammonium phosphate isoprene isopropanal ammonium nitrate 
ammonium sulfate polypropylenes and urea these are all secondary 
products
