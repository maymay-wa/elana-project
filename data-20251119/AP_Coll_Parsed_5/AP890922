hurricane hugo punched this city of 
antebellum mansions with full fury and killed at least 12 people in 
the carolinas before weakening friday and trailing off inland to the 
north 
south carolinas barrier islands were also hit hard as houses 
were blown off their foundations and boats were pushed ashore 
stacked along the beaches two and three deep 
garden city for all practical purposes is gone said ml 
love a horry county administrator who toured the elite resort 
community near myrtle beach 
president bush declared seven counties a federal disaster area 
it is the worst storm the worst disaster ive ever seen 
anywhere said gov carrolll campbell 
hugo downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 am had lost all 
characteristics of tropical storm and was weakening although the 
system had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains 
the storms last location was in pennsylvania just west of 
pittsburgh at latitude 405 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees 
west officials said there would be no further tracking 
campbell toured his state friday by air stopping to assist some 
people who waved him down for help 
about 50 people in the small coastal community of mcclellanville 
were stranded by the storm and some were standing on top of cars 
and waving at the passing helicopter 
campbells helicopter landed in a nearby baseball field and the 
governor made sure the people got help there are a lot of little 
places like that in this state that just got wiped out campbell 
said 
eleven of the us deaths were in south carolina said warren 
hardy of the states office of emergency preparedness the south 
carolina deaths included an elderly man found in the rubble of a 
house in charleston and a power company employee who was 
electrocuted friday as he worked to restore electricity in north 
carolina a 6monthold baby was killed in union county when a tree 
fell on a house 
the center of the storm advanced farther west than expected 
targeting eastern ohio western pennsylvania and western new york 
before it was expected to wear itself out in canada it was moving 
to the north at 30 mph 
a hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm moist air over open 
oceans when these giant storms hit land they lose their wallop 
although they can still manage considerable bluster 
charleston sc felt the full wrath of hugo which wrecked a 
string of caribbean resort islands beginning early sunday as many 
as 27 people were killed in the caribbean about 50000 people are 
homeless 
the city where the first shots of the civil war were fired in 
1861 was clobbered with 135 mph winds and a tidal surge of 12 to 17 
feet the storm which at its height was as large as the state of 
south carolina flattened 30 buildings peeled off roofs and flooded 
streets several people were believed trapped in a building 
collapse officials later said no one was found inside 
theres just destruction everywhere said mayor joseph p 
riley who imposed a 6 pm curfew he called it a disaster of 
extraordinary dimensions 
riley estimated damage at 1 billion in the city of 65000 
residents 
national guardsman patrolled streets and campbell confirmed 
there was sporadic looting before authorities restored order 
jo smith rode out the storm in her 100yearold house across from 
the medical university of south carolina but said friday she wished 
she would have left town 
i thought i was going to die she said the house was 
shaking i could hear pieces of tin flying off my roof 
at least 900000 people were without power in the carolinas 
officials said the total included 200000 or 85 percent of the 
homes and businesses in charlotte nc which felt hugos muscle 
even though its 200 miles inland the fraud and conspiracy trial of 
ptl founder jim bakker was canceled friday because of the storm 
in addition to flooding fires from natural gas leaks erupted in 
lowlying charleston where some treelined streets were under 
several feet of water 
at least 20 boats washed ashore including a 50foot craft that 
washed up on a city street police chief reuben greenberg said 
most of the historic antebellum mansions facing charleston harbor 
weathered the storm with little cosmetic damage officials said 
but fort sumter the first union holding fired upon by the 
confederacy at the beginning of the civil war suffered 1 million 
damage when a 17foot wall of water passed over it according to 
constance harriman assistant secretary of the interior for parks 
and wildlife 
the pentagon reported friday that its air force base near 
charleston appears to have sustained catastrophic levels of 
damage according to a statement issued in washington 
seventy miles up the coast the elite vacation retreat community 
of garden city was smashed officials said it was among the 
communities under an evacuation order before hugo hit 
love said destruction extended as far as i could see 
on pawleys island south of myrtle beach authorities said at 
least 14 houses had been washed away three piers disappeared in 
north myrtle beach cherry grove and garden city 
amy garrison of wkzq amfm said a reporter who was allowed to 
tour the islands with civil defense personnel said houses were 
sitting in the middle of the road roads were washed away and trees 
and power lines were down 
refrigerators air conditioners and washers and dryers were 
floating in the streets stairways that lead down to the beach were 
sitting in the streets 
barrier islands which were ordered evacuated on thursday were 
pummeled and flooded jack sellers a pilot from columbia who flew 
people to the coast to look at their property said pawleys island 
had about a 100to200foot wide swath cut through it 
there are now two pawleys islands if you will sellers said 
he said two houses that had been on the beachfront were sitting 
300 yards or 400 yards away in a marsh 
bushs disaster declaration makes federal aid available for such 
things as temporary housing lowcost loans for rebuilding and 
grants for repairing roads bridges and other public structures 
hurricaneforce winds first hit the south carolina coast at 915 
pm thursday it was the first major hurricane to strike charleston 
since hurricane gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959 
the eye passed over charleston about midnight a wall of water 
gushed into city hall when a chunk of roof on the 188yearold brick 
building blew away during the storm phone and electric service to 
the citys command post was knocked out

an abandonship drill has been revised on 
the recommendation of investigators probing the death of an aviation 
officer candidate in a training pool a navy spokesman said thursday 
the changes were made although the navy found no wrongdoing or 
safety shortcomings in the june 23 death of michael fedie at 
pensacola naval air station said cmdr dennis hessler 
fedie 22 of altoona wis died from an unexplained seizure 
accompanied by acute cerebral edema a swelling and excess of fluid 
in the brain an autopsy report concluded 
he collapsed as he was walking from the pool after jumping off a 
12foot tower and swimming 15 yards underwater to simulate efforts 
to avoid burning fuel on the surface surrounding a sinking ship 
fedie and other students first completed the drill wearing only 
swimming suits and then did it again in flight suits and boots 
before fedie collapsed 
one change adds an interim jump while wearing flight suits but no 
boots and another is to have the students swim in flight suits and 
boots to get a feel for what it is like before jumping from the 
tower said hessler spokesman for the pensacolabased naval 
education and training command 
as an added precaution students have been jumping from the side 
of the pool instead of the tower since fedies death but hessler 
said he expects the tower jump will be reinstated 
another recommendation that has been adopted is a daily check of 
the telephone at the pool the phone was working on the day fedie 
collapsed hessler said 
the changes were unrelated to the cause of fedies death but were 
among recommendations that the judge advocate generals office will 
make in a final report 
those three recommendations were passed on to the naval aviation 
schools command ahead of the reports release which is expected 
soon hessler said additional recommendations are expected in the 
report 
the changes affect only the aviation program at pensacola 
although similar drills are conducted for nonaviation trainees at 
other bases hessler said 
the death of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
on march 2 1988 triggered changes in procedure for training rescue 
swimmers who jump from helicopters to aid downed airmen 
mirecki drowned after suffering fearinduced heart failure a 
pathologist testified at the courtmartial of an instructor who was 
convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to 90 days in the brig

a 15yearold former high school football 
player accused in four neighborhood murders over the past two years 
waived his right to a trial thursday and will serve six years in 
reform school 
the sentence is the maximum craig price could have received even 
if he had been found guilty in a trial according to state laws 
concerning minors he also pleaded guilty to two burglary charges 
price goes to the strictest section of the rhode island training 
school almost three weeks after the bodies of joan heaton 39 and 
her two daughters melissa 8 and jennifer 10 were discovered 
on labor day in their home here 
price lived two blocks away from the heatons and two doors from 
the house where rebecca a spencer was killed in 1987 price 
admitted to killing all four in taped confessions said state 
prosector jeffrey pine 
the youth stared at the table in front of him as family court 
judge carmine depatrillo told him that by pleading guilty to 
deliquency by firstdegree murder and burglary he would have no 
court hearing chance to challenge any evidence witnesses or give 
testimony in court 
attorney general james e oneil said after price was taken away 
that he felt no special relief at watching the youth go to the 
states juvenile prison 
this is not a type of situation where you sit back and achieve 
any degree of satisfaction oneil said its just wasted human 
lives 
he said he was frustrated because price will only serve time 
until his 21st birthday which he would have if he had been found 
guilty in a trial 
investigators said the 240pound price a former high school 
football player known as iron man who was repeating the ninth 
grade never showed any remorse for the killings 
all three heatons had been beaten to death and were stabbed 
repeatedly 
spencer who was killed in july 1987 was stabbed 58 times 
police said blanchard and capt ronald carter who headed the 
investigation both said they suspected the same person in all the 
killings

british filmmakerplaywright david hare thinks 
american love stories are unrealistic and says his latest work 
strapless with blair brown and bridget fonda is more 
believable than current hollywood fare 
strapless will have its premiere at the new york film 
festival 
after a screening of strapless this week hare attacked rob 
reiners hit movie when harry met sally for failing to 
integrate the lead characters into the outside world 
at no point was there any reference to the characters jobs or 
to what their relationships were outside dating said hare they 
were people who dated that was their primary social function they 
either were happy or unhappy according to whether they were dating 
its this way of looking at the world through people who exist 
in rooms and the minute the door closes everything that is the 
world is shut out of that room and you are simply together eating 
lasagna or spaghetti or whatever kind of pasta the scene is about 
he said 
in strapless brown stars as a 40yearold american doctor 
working in a london hospital and living with her rebellious younger 
sister fonda while on holiday brown is pursued by a romantic 
entrepreneur bruno ganz who follows her back to london and 
eventually persuades her to marry him 
but ganz substantially in debt suddenly flees and brown is 
forced to put her life back together again and provide support for 
fonda who has become pregnant after a brief affair 
hare who also wrote the screenplay said he enjoyed the 
challenge of creating female characters theres nothing harder to 
get than a member of the opposite sex i know the benefit of writing 
about women is you have such an extraordinary range of underused 
actresses actresses able to do all sorts of things theyre not 
ususally given a chance to 
hare also directed the 1984 drama wetherby and wrote the 
play and screenplay plenty meryl streep starred in the film 
version

colombias crackdown on its cocaine cartels has 
reached as far as the streets of lima where a sudden shortage of 
drug money has sparked wild speculation in dollars 
in the month since colombia declared war on drug traffickers 
visits by colombian narcotics smugglers to perus upper huallaga 
river valley source of most of the worlds coca leaf have dropped 
80 percent according to analysts the illegal trade is believed to 
bring at least 1 billion a year to perus dollarstarved economy 
most of it via the northeastern highland jungles where 60000 
peasant families grow the worlds bestquality coca 
colombian traffickers fly into remote airstrips scattered through 
the region and pay cash dollars for coca paste which they refine 
into cocaine 
the drug dollars then travel in chartered planes and trucks over 
the andes which separate the jungle from the coast and are traded 
for peruvian intis on limas bustling black market 
but the dollars arent flowing as they did 
the number of planes carrying dollars from the jungle has 
dropped from about 15 a week to three said economist alberto 
grana director of the magazine actualidad economica 
some have been quick to try to exploit the dollar shortage 
in a thirdfloor apartment in the ritzy san isidro suburb 
roberto owner of an underground money exchange house is 
juggling two telephones trying to line up a deal for 30000 
with a buyer on one line and a seller on the other hes trying 
to ride the rising exchange rate and take in 150 intis on the dollar 
as his cut three times the margin of a few weeks ago 
the phone never stops here he said 
as he talks people with gym bags and paper sacks stuffed with 
intis shuffle in out of the apartment past a bored guard twirling 
his revolver 
roberto who asked that his full name not be used has five years 
in the business and although the government legalized the black 
market last year he chose not to register to avoid regulations and 
taxes 
theres an incredible diversity in prices right now said 
roberto who stood to make 900 if the deal held 
since aug 19 the unofficial exchange rate at which most dollars 
are sold and bought has shot from 3300 intis to the dollar to 
5300 a 60 percent rise attributed to the scarcity of us currency 
the drug moneys power can be seen in the growth of black market 
trading which has effectively turned perus feeble economy into one 
based on dollars 
carrying pocket calculators and wads of bills eager curbside 
money changers can be seen throughout the capital accosting cars and 
pedestrians to make a deal their numbers have jumped from 300 to 
more than 3000 in just two years 
private exchange houses downtown set the exchange rate according 
to the ebb and flow of available dollars and street traders 
throughout the city are in constant touch by telephone to know the 
latest price 
they said two planes with narcodollars were coming from the 
jungle yesterday but they never appeared so the price went up 
said lucy mejia a 45yearold unemployeed nurse who averages a 
profit of 2 a day as a street corner money changer 
the dollar has become a haven for many whose inti income is eaten 
up by hyperinflation estimated at 5700 percent over the last 12 
months businesses also are desperate for dollars to pay for imports 
even though many of the dollars come from the drug trade it 
doesnt mean that we live off cocaine economist guido pennano 
said recently in a television interview it means that were not 
poorer because of the cocaine 
but because of colombias crackdown on cocaine trafficking 
economists are concerned about perus economy being cut off from one 
of its biggest sources of cash 
the most important impact will be an increase in the inflation 
index said grana explaining that as the dollar rises import 
costs go up 
but political leaders frequently express concern that perus 
economy has been weakened by years of narcodependence 
the narcotraffickers are controlling certain aspects of the 
national economy and at least 25 percent of foreign exchange 
earnings is fed by dollars from the drug traffic said luis 
bedoya a leader in the centerright coalition supporting novelist 
mario vargas llosa for president in next aprils election

hurricane hugo struck south carolina with 
renewed fury thursday after thousands of coastal residents in 
southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on 
jammed highways 
this is a disaster staring us right in the eye mayor joseph 
p riley jr said from his city hall command post in charleston 
where the hurricane downed power lines snapped trees and caused 
utility transformers to explode 
all we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have 
taken have been sufficient riley said as hugos eye bore in on 
the city i just hope and pray we can get through this without any 
loss of life 
by midnight 119 mph winds were reported in charleston the roof 
cracked at city hall a 188yearold brick building that has 
withstood several hurricanes and torrents of water poured into the 
paneled council chamber phone and electric service to the command 
post was knocked out 
hurricaneforce winds first hit the coast by 915 pm edt and 
about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the isle of 
palms just east of charleston said bob sheets director of the 
national hurricane center in coral gables fla 
the eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135 
mph 
hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north causing severe 
flooding as it moved up the east coast the storm posed a 19 percent 
chance of hitting new york city and a 16 percent chance of hitting 
boston before sunday night the hurricane center said 
as hugo neared the coast roads from hilton head to myrtle beach 
200 miles north were nearly empty as were the boardedup resort 
towns themselves power lines and trees were downed in some spots 
and water flooded roads stop lights and neon lights were knocked 
out in myrtle beach 
one eyewitness said its like a light show said amy 
garrison a reporter at wkzq amfm in myrtle beach 
in charleston the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs 
palmetto fronds and chunks of bark businesses were closed and 
classes at public schools and universities canceled riley ordered 
residents of onestory homes to evacuate 
hospitals stockpiled supplies discharging any patients well 
enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for 
emergency patients officials said 
about 12000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state 
as of thursday evening and more were expected said bennish brown 
a spokesman for the emergency operations center in columbia 220 
miles northwest of here 
we tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side 
doors said elaine skelton a registered nurse working at the 
conway high school shelter near myrtle beach we tried to post 
guards at the doors but people were still coming in 
american red cross relief efforts were buckling under the number 
of evacuees said brian ruberry a spokesman in savannah ga who 
appealed for help 
right now the red cross is sheltering tens of thousands of 
people all along the eastern seaboard this of course is at the same 
time that were sheltering 25000 people on puerto rico and the 
other caribbean islands 
were beginning to feel the squeeze our resources are very 
tight right now hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief 
operations of the decade 
at midnight the center of hugo was near latitude 327 degrees 
north and longitude 799 degrees west forecasters said the 
hurricanes speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier 
near its center hugos muscle reached winds of 135 mph up from 
125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before north and 
south carolina can expect tornadoes linked to hugo for the next two 
days according to the hurricane center 
the coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 
hours once the eye comes ashore officials said a hurricane warning 
was in effect between fernandina beach fla and oregon inlet nc 
by late afternoon hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on 
the saffirsimpson scale of strength the second mightiest category 
which indicated it could cause extreme damage 
it strengthened more than we thought it would sheets said 
adding that hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the 
appalachians 
the timing of the landfall was critical because of the storms 
tidal surge a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a 
normal 5foot high tide that peaks after 2 am 
on top of that will be waves sheets said earlier and in 
many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean 
off

the likelihood that someone put a bomb aboard a 
french jetliner in an african backwater killing 171 people kindled 
fresh fears among specialists over aircraft vulnerability 
worldwide according to the international air transport 
association 900 to 1000 scheduled airlines serve 5000 to 6000 
airports security is all but absent in many of the airports 
experts scrutinize major airports after fatal incidents but 
otherwise airport security is left to national authorities with 
almost no international oversight 
this is the problem with security said john brindley a 
transport association spokesman its like night guards at a bank 
after youve been robbed you realize you need three guards instead 
of two 
if terrorists target airports where security is lax he said 
echoing concerns of others interviewed the cost of protecting 
flights could be far higher than once believed 
the problem goes far beyond screening passengers and baggage 
in many african airports for example outsiders can roam 
unchallenged around parked aircraft most have vip lounges from 
which officials and their retinues walk directly to boarding doors 
frequent travelers report broken xray equipment lackadaisical 
searches and even instances where small bribes allow passengers to 
skirt timeconsuming security checks 
sometimes only cursory checks are made of baggage handlers 
caterers and cleaners 
one african who recently transited brazzaville congo on 
business described his experience on the condition he not be 
identified 
i walked through the electronic gate forgetting a large bunch 
of keys in my pocket nothing sounded and the policeman in charge 
waved me through but that is not unusual in africa he said 
after the crash tuesday of uta flight 772 in the niger desert 
airline president rene lapautre said he felt some african airports 
had fragile security measures 
he was asked if that included brazzaville from where the uta 
flight originated let us be frank yes he told french 
television 
lapautre said only the combined efforts of police airport 
authorities and airlines could reduce the risk to passengers 
its not just africa brindley said not much is going on 
in reykjavik iceland or adelaide australia say so people might 
be a little more relaxed 
benjamin demps us federal aviation administration director for 
europe africa and the middle east refused comment on the uta 
accident but agreed in general with brindley 
we know there are airports around the world not up to speed in 
security measures he said adding concern that international 
authorities had little leverage to correct some weaknesses 
air travel is inextricably international demps said we 
must think of it as international and remove ourselves from the 
myproblem yourproblem mentality 
bernard adamczewski deputy director of the londonbased 
institute for terrorist studies concurred that governments had to 
transcend national sovereignty to counter growing threats 
all terrorist organizations have masses of time on their hands 
for detailed reconnaisance of security measures he said we can 
expect much greater degrees of sophistication from them 
pilots associations are especially worried but most accept the 
reality of a massive challenge 
we must be concerned said group capt john tritton of 
britains guild of air pilots and air navigators but if a 
terrorist is determined enough there is very little you can do 
he agreed that governments had to unite to deny safe havens to 
hijackers and to coordinate investigations but he feared the public 
will could wane in the face of the overall cost 
my experience is that after an incident security becomes very 
severe tritton said then as memories dim it gets less and 
less precise 
frequent travelers tend to agree 
after a pan am jumbo jet was blown up over lockerbie scotland 
last december us airlines imposed strict new security on all 
transatlantic routes 
the bomb was traced to a tape recorder and us authorities 
contemplated measures including a ban on carrying electronic items 
aboard aircraft such appliances were to be inspected by hand 
but passengers now find that busy security agents frequently 
ignore the xray images of portable computers large radios and 
other gear in carryon luggage 
acknowledging this tritton said memories are short its 
human nature

its official us and soviet spacemen are 
going to mars and the martians cant wait to greet them 
thats mars pa 16046 usa earth 
soviet cosmonaut sergei krikalev arrives in mars on monday by 
jetliner and car for an eightday visit to this community of about 
1800 humanoids about 25 miles north of pittsburgh 
krikalev 31 a flight engineer spent five months on a 
sovietfrench soyuz mission that ended in april he will be joined 
wednesday by navy lt cmdr mario runco jr 37 a nasa astronaut 
who is awaiting assignment to a space shuttle flight 
the spacemens mission is to teach martian children about space 
and sovietamerican friendship at school lunches and assemblies 
organizers say its just like martians as some residents call 
themselves to do something spacey like this 
it just seems natural when you live close to mars people here 
have a lot of pride that our town is named after a planet said 
bonnie solino mother of a 13yearold boy and the first martian to 
invite spacemen to this sector of the solar system 
frankly im a little perplexed by all this but then im 
originally from the new york city area she admitted thursday 
ralph terrell a retired chemist and chairman of the mars area 
foundation for educational excellence a private group organizing 
the event for the school district said thursday you have to have a 
sense of humor to live in mars 
the school team is called the mars planets we have the mars 
national bank that gives service out of this world theres an 
undercurrent but nobody had really glorified it until we stumbled 
upon this terrell said 
im even thinking of having cards printed up that say i 
talked to a martian today he said 
about 5000 mission to mars stickers which show the american 
eagle and soviet bear below the tail of a comet are to be sold at 
an open house in the mars middle school sept 28 when runco and 
krikalev are scheduled to appear to together 
things are happening almost by the hour ive ordered another 
1000 stickers terrell said 
martians already have purchased about 1300 lapel pins with the 
american and soviet flags an item mrs solino said has taken off 
tremendously 
terrell said the mars history and landmarks society plans to 
place a 10foot steel flying saucer in a downtown lot before a 
wednesday photo session the makeshift spaceship is being built out 
of drum lids he said 
organizers plan to treat the cosmonaut to a pittsburgh pirates 
baseball game on tuesday night and a mars area high school football 
game next saturday runco can stay only two days 
terrell said there are no plans for side trips to nearby moon or 
apollo townships

thousands of caliche pits like the one in 
thursdays fatal school bus accident line roads throughout south 
texas a littleregulated legacy of contractors who dig up the 
gravellike material for road base and then move on 
nineteen students were killed when the bus plunged into the pit 
following a collision with a softdrink delivery truck the bus 
became submerged in about 12 feet of water at the bottom of the 
40footdeep chasm 
no guard rail separated the pit from the roadway 20 feet away and 
no road signs warned of its presence texas department of public 
safety sgt israel pacheco said there was no fence around the pit 
though there may have been one before some recent road construction 
nearby 
there are no state regulations governing the pits said officials 
of the state railroad commission which governs surface mining and 
the general land office which oversees the states geology 
federal mining regulations govern caliche pits while they are 
being mined said bill driscoll executive director of a state 
contractors association but those regulations do not apply to 
inactive pits 
officials were unsure who had excavated the pit involved in 
thursdays accident just outside alton or who owned the land on 
which it is located 
caliche a spanish word is defined as gravel sand and desert 
debris cemented by a porous calcium carbonate according to state 
geologist bill farr 
the material occurs naturally through the southwest and mexico 
and is used quite a lot in making road base material farr said 
youll see caliche pits lining the highways all throughout the 
southwest he said 
such a pit is not unusual in the rio grande valley hidalgo 
county sheriffs deputy rene torres said we see that a lot down 
here i used to go swimming in them as a kid 
farr said caliche will not withstand transportation long 
distances requiring the material to be mined near where it will be 
used 
contractors lease the ground from owners of land adjoining a 
project dig out the caliche they need then move on he said all 
that remains is the hole in the ground that left when the caliche 
is removed 
what theyre removing is 99 percent of what theyre actually 
using so there is really nothing to fill the pit with other than 
to go dig a hole somewhere else farr said

two out of three teachers say they would

school teachers polled and 87 percent of rural teachers according 
to the survey preparing schools for the 1990s 
in the last five years the proportion of teachers considering 
the dropout problem serious at their schools rose from 40 percent to 
52 percent 
and 70 percent of high school teachers regard drug use as a 
serious problem at their schools up from 58 percent in 1985 
american teachers particularly those in our cities have sent 
an sos about the severity of the outofschool problems facing 
their students albert shanker president of the american 
federation of teachers said in reaction to the poll 
if president bush and the nations governors are serious about 
making education a national priority one of the things they will 
have to do is listen to the messages from the front lines to the 
problems teachers face every day in the classroom shanker said 
and what our teachers are crying out for are solutions to the 
severe problems children face which affect the ability of schools 
to do their job poverty ill health drug abuse and troubled 
families 
the survey appearing less than a week before president bush is 
to convene an education summit with the nations governors was 
conducted by louis harris and associates it was based on a 
telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of 2000 
public school teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade polled 
in may and june the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 
three percentage points 
on the positive side 81 percent of teachers surveyed said they 
still love to teach twothirds said they would advise a young 
person to enter the teaching profession compared with 45 percent 
five years ago 
fiftythree percent believe education reform has improved their 
schools compared with 43 percent who expressed that view in a 1984 
poll only six percent said school reforms have had a negative 
impact the remainder said the effects were neutral 
but teachers were less enthused about the impact of reform on 
themselves 43 percent said reform has affected teachers positively 
27 percent said they felt neutral and 29 percent said reform has 
had a negative effect on teachers 
eightysix percent said they backed mentorteacher programs in 
which teachers help colleagues improve and 55 percent supported 
career ladder programs which offer teachers the chance to advance to 
the level of master teacher for more pay 
twothirds said they strongly backed creation of schoolbased 
leadership committees of principals teachers and students to 
enforce school rules 
but 64 percent say schools are getting worse at sparing teachers 
administrative busy work 
teachers are most supportive of reform in schools where 
educators are actively involved in making decisions about teaching 
and learning new ideas flourish and student learning improves 
said keith geiger president of the national education association 
the nations largest teacher union 
in places where reform simply means more more graduation 
requirements more hours in the school day more paperwork teachers 
are understandably less enthusiastic he said

federal claims in a lawsuit accusing major 
insurance companies of conspiring to manufacture a liability 
crisis and drive up rates have been dismissed by a federal judge 
us district judge william schwarzers decision was released 
thursday in connection with a lawsuit filed by 19 states in march 
1988 against 32 major insurance companies and reinsurers who 
provide insurance for insurance companies 
california attorney general john van de kamp announced he would 
appeal the decision 
the lawsuit claimed insurance companies in the mid1980s agreed 
to sharply reduce liability coverage for public agencies businesses 
and nonprofit organizations and to stop all coverage for 
environmental damages caused by pollution 
the judge who sits in san francisco issued a preliminary 
decision in july dismissing the suit on grounds that insurance 
companies can act together under federal law without being subject 
to most types of antitrust suits 
the states involved in the suit are california new york west 
virginia wisconsin minnesota alabama massachusetts arizona 
maryland connecticut new jersey pennsylvania ohio colorado 
montana washington alaska michigan and louisiana texas filed a 
similar suit in its state court that is preceeding to trial 
independently of this action 
the states alleged violations of federal antitrust laws and state 
laws in a global conspiracy starting in 1984 that they said included 
boycotts threats intimidation and other coersive conduct 
insurance companies denied the allegations and said rate 
increases resulted from claim losses due in part to broad liability 
rules in many states they also blamed investment income declines 
insurers are immune from federal antitrust suits unless they are 
shown to have engaged in a boycott intimidation or coercion

as hurricane hugo tore through the 
caribbean on a beeline course for puerto rico my sister called from 
tennessee to check how we were doing 
were taping up the windows and moving all the furniture into 
the back rooms i said its kind of exciting 
within 24 hours our home on the top floor of an 18story 
beachfront condominium would be wrecked and i was to gain an 
understanding of hurricanes i could never acquire from simply 
reporting on them 
by the time i arrived from the ap office after midnight sunday 
my wife mary jane had taken our four daughters marcia 13 
nancy 11 katherine 3 and susan 6 months to an apartment on 
the 17th floor our neighbors there herb and nancy brown had put 
up aluminum siding on their windows 
i decided to stay in our apartment resting on a mattress in the 
study on the side away from the sea i put a clock on a bookcase 
hugo with more than 140 mph winds was supposed to hit sometime 
after daybreak 
the wind was howling and it started to rain i kept getting up 
to see whether the windows were holding up eventually the 
electricity went off in the dark i stepped in a puddle water from 
a broken window and moved the mattress into the hall 
at about 6 am mary jane had rapped on the browns bedroom door 
and asked herb if it was just her imagination that the bed was 
shaking it wasnt 
while the children slept mary jane came several times to check 
our apartment as water spread across the floors 
she brought up our dog lucky a small black mongrel who had 
been whining in a bathroom it was cool but luckys fur was wet and 
she was panting 
i thought i can try to fool myself into thinking were not in 
danger but you cant fool this animal 
palms were bending now glass was shattering and metal was 
tearing away from the building 
mary jane and the girls had moved into the hall with the browns 
and spread sofa cushions on the floor i joined them with the 
mattress 
we followed the progress of the storm on the radio and watched 
through a concrete lattice in a corner of the hall periodically i 
went back upstairs to listen outside my apartment 
amazingly the telephones were still working and i could get 
through to the office i was talking with bureau chief kernan 
turner when there was a shatter of glass followed by silence 
finally he came back on the line after having run for cover at the 
back of the office and then crawling back to the phone everybody 
was ok but the office was taking a beating 
by then our building was swaying like a ship at sea 
we debated whether a hurricane can topple an 18floor building 
are you safer on the top floor or the ground floor nobody knew 
we took up an offer to move the family down to the 11th floor 
where the sway was less noticeable and the wind less fierce 
we settled outside an apartment occupied by two sisters we had 
never met teresa and lucy bague they gave our children water 
juice crackers and milky way bars susan the baby was the only 
one who slept much 
mary jane told me later i looked at you and your lips were 
gray i thought mine must be too 
hours passed the storm died down and then came back stronger 
than ever as if roused from fitful sleep 
then the hurricane hit us with all its might two hours later 
hugo passed and we were safe

a texas judge picked by president bush to head 
the office of government ethics has been ruled out after an fbi 
background check found disqualifying information according to a 
report published friday 
paul pressler of houston had not yet been formally nominated for 
the post but the routine background check was being conducted in 
preparation for that the washington post reported 
information was uncovered we felt was disqualifying an 
official whose identity was not disclosed told the newspaper 
anonymous officials cited by the post would not give details of 
the contents of the fbi report except to say that it did not 
contain allegations of crimes or financial improprieties 
the post identified pressler as a civil court judge and a leader 
of a fundamentalist movement within the southern baptist convention 
pressler reached by telephone in san francisco by the associated 
press said no one at the white house had contacted him about the 
information in the fbi report or to say that he had been 
disqualified for the ethics post 
i have no idea about it pressler said when asked if the 
administration had picked him for the ethics job he replied im 
not sure we talked a little about it 
a white house official told the newspaper there is not yet 
another leading candidate for the job 
the ethics office is responsible for application of ethics laws 
and regulations in the government including review of personal 
financial statements of federal officials 
in his presidential campaign last year bush pledged to make 
ethics in government a priority

republican senators following six hours of 
negotiations with democrats agreed late thursday to take a new plan 
for financing the war on drugs to the white house for consideration 
sources said the plan contained some of the selected cuts in 
spending the bush administration had wanted as a way to offset 
increases in the drug program as well as an acrosstheboard 
reduction in federal programs to raise the bulk of the money 
republicans said they would not consider the plan a tentative 
agreement without white house approval and they indicated that there 
was no rush on the part of the bush administration to provide that 
weve been on the phone to white house chief of staff john 
sununu all night sen john warner rva said emerging from the 
negotiations along with other tired senators 
republicans said they would take the plan to the white house on 
friday and then reconvene their negotiations with the democrats 
senators declined to comment on specifics of the plan sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said however that the 
acrosstheboard cut envisioned in the proposal would amount to 03 
percent that would be an increase from a 02875 percent reduction 
in a plan that republicans carried into the negotiating session 
thursday afternoon 
that republican plan would have paid for all but 23 million of 
an 850 million increase in the drug war on top of the 79 billion 
proposed by bush 
offsets in selected programs under the new versions would be 
determined at the committee level democrats are planning something 
similar to that but on a larger scale in the house 
approval of the proposal would stave off a threatened blockade of 
spending bills on the senate floor with nine days to go before the 
start of the next fiscal year when they will be needed to pay for 
the operations of the government 
four spending bills are currently awaiting passage in the senate 
and eight others are in the pipeline

the man who shot lincoln comes to the 
audience from limbo something like a live weird episode of the 
twilight zone 
the play not without interest but finally less than successful 
opened thursday night at the offbroadway astor place theater in 
it actor edwin booth tells us his version of his life story in 
which he and not his brother john wilkes shoots abraham lincoln at 
fords theater 
its essentially a tale in which edwin booth plays both othello 
overwhelmingly jealous of his wife and iago whispering accusations 
into his own ear 
the conversation starts out stilted and sam tsoutsouvas speaks 
it with ripe plumminess and a smirk to the discomfort of listeners 
both dialogue and delivery improve but not enough 
a feeling of restlessness develops as the play progresses though 
one doesnt entirely lose interest 
the characters include booths wife mary played with saintly 
sweetness by marcia gay harden mary dies soon after giving birth 
but remains in the play as a figment of booths imagination 
conan mccarty is sprightly as a jaunty womanizing john wilkes 
booth passionate defender of the confederacy eric tull shows 
versatility in walkons as the booth brothers insane father a 
simpleton and a union officer 
playwright luigi creatore has had musicals and at least one other 
drama produced crandall diehl directed michael bottari and ronald

two soldiers with 
submachine guns waved their arms and shouted ordering a woman and 
her three teenage children to slap paint on a white stone wall to 
cover antiisraeli graffiti 
down the street israeli tax agents dragged furniture from a home 
in lieu of unpaid taxes 
in nearby beit jala troops searched house to house for a 
stonethrower who injured an israeli soldier 
in the occupied gaza strip shops in gaza city were shut for a 
second day to protest the killing of a 21yearold man by soldiers 
thursday was one more day in the intefadeh the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
that has sometimes raged and sometimes sputtered for more than 21 
months 
it is the deaths that make headlines but the uprising is made up 
of thousands of tiny incidents stones thrown at soldiers 
checkpoints thrown up by troops tax or arrest raids outlawed 
palestinian flags flown from telephone wires 
according to the army more than 33000 instances of stone 
throwing and tire burning occurred in the past year that doesnt 
include 756 firebombings 130 knifings or other serious assaults or 
345 cases of arson 
these numbers show the uprising is still going on says a 
military officer who agreed to discuss the revolt on condition of 
anonymity 
the intensity is not what it once was its lost a lot of its 
volume he said but he added that violence may flare at any 
moment 
you have ups and downs it can be affected by rumors by 
factors even outside the country not just what the army does or 
people in the community do 
the officer said the army did everything it could to prevent more 
violence when it made raids to arrest uprising activists but he 
added obviously theres an animosity to army presence 
an uprising leader asked about the status of the intefadeh 
noted the youngsters throw stones of course thats no secret 
and we have our daily battles with the settlers 
the man an organizer for the syrianbacked popular front for the 
liberation of palestine said jewish settlers often fire at 
stonethrowing youngsters or smashed arabowned cars in revenge 
when asked what caused bigger demonstrations he said its the 
street its not just dozens of youngsters the street the people 
are ready to cooperate sometimes the anger bursts and it happens 
the street did not explode thursday but the intefadeh went on 
seven youths were reported shot by soldiers in clashes with 
stonethrowers in the gaza strip one confrontation was in the 
jabaliya refugee camp where the uprising started on dec 8 1987 
since then 573 palestinians have been killed by soldiers or 
jewish civilians and 40 israelis have been slain at least 114 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs as alleged 
collaborators

stay off the streets while soldiers searched houses for suspects in

seizing truckloads of property from homes and businesses to demand

its battle against graffiti

a usair pilot told the control tower he was 
aborting takeoff moments before his jetliner slid into the east 
river killing two passengers but did not say what the problem was 
officials said thursday 
there was no indication of why he was aborting said federal 
aviation administration spokesman fred farrar until we know why 
the guy aborted the takeoff we have no way of knowing the cause of 
the accident 
survivors clung to the wings of the broken aircraft or grasped 
floating timbers after the boeing 737400 slid into bowery bay off 
laguardia airport at 1129 pm wednesday two women were killed 
but 59 people including crew members survived 
the jets flight data and cockpit voice recorders were analyzed 
thursday by the national transportation safety board but provided 
no immediate clues on the cause of the crash said ntsb chairman 
james kolstad said 
there were no noises or voices that suggested there was any 
problem with the takeoff or why the takeoff was aborted kolstand 
said at an evening news conference at kennedy airport 
the flight data box recording indicated that the plane swerved 
slightly instead of moving straight down the runway and showed some 
deviations in rudder movement kolstad said but investigators 
did not immediately understand what effect that might have had on 
the takeoff 
meanwhile the new york times in its friday editions said law 
enforcement officials were checking reports that the copilot told 
port authority police shortly after the crash that the pilot had 
been mumbling and acting irrationally just before takeoff 
however port authority spokesman john hughes said pa police had 
no interviews with the crew after the crash commenting on the times 
report hughes said i have heard nothing about that 
the paper quoting undentified airline industry officials said 
the pilot and copilot had little experience aboard 737s the pilot 
had flown the planes for only two months and the copilot was said 
to have been in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time the newspaper 
said 
a taperecorded message answered usairs public relations office 
telephone and referred all questions to the ntsb 
a spokeswoman for the national transportation safety board 
rachel halterman said the ntsb had no direct knowledge of the 
times report she said until the pilots are interviewed anything 
else is hearsay 
the crew has not been interviewed yet by authorities and kolstad 
had no information about their experience or identities 
he said the ntsb had asked for drug and alcohol tests for the 
crew and plans to interview the pilot and copilot friday they have 
the right to decline to speak with investigators but can be 
subpoenaed if they refuse said ntsb spokeswoman rachel halterman 
usair chairman edwin colodny declined to discuss any details or 
possible causes of the crash saying the ntsb had jurisdiction 
the captain is taking advice of his own counsel colodny said 
at a news conference he declined to identify the pilot or other 
crew members or describe their experience other than to say they 
had been based in baltimore and had worked for piedmont aviation 
before its merger with usair in august 
flight 5050 bound for charlotte nc was accelerating down the 
runway in a light rain when the control tower acknowledged the 
pilots request to abort and cleared him to turn onto the last 
taxiway before the end of the runway 
farrar said a pilot would not be required to get permission to 
abort takeoff he said it was not immediately clear exactly at what 
point the communication with the tower occurred or which member of 
the flight crew was at the radio but it likely was whichever pilot 
was not controlling the plane at the time 
the pilot seemed to be accelerating but didnt have enough 
power to get the plane up said passenger larry martin he put 
on the brakes the plane took a dip and the next thing i knew all 
hell broke loose 
the plane broke into three parts about 50 to 100 feet into bowery 
bay its front sections resting above the water on a trestle that 
held runway lights its back sections submerged the two women who 
died were seated in the rear 
people were on top of each other people were screaming said 
martin who was traveling with his wife valerie there was the 
smell of gas everyone was saying get out get out get out 
stunned passengers scramled out doors and onto wings some 
escaped down an emergency chute and found themselves in about 25 
feet of water many clung to wings or grasped floating timbers 
i said hell this thing is going to blow up said passenger 
fred oloughlin then all of a sudden i was in the water by 
myself 
the crew was great they were pitching people out and down 
the slide said passenger tom newberry 27 we just grabbed on 
to a big piece of wood and held on for dear life 
police scuba divers freed as many as 15 people who were trapped 
in the cabin while rescuers in boats scooped passengers from the 
water or off the wings they were hanging from the pier hanging 
on the wing hanging from the front of the plane said police lt 
larry johnston 
rescuers working under the glare of emergency lights placed 
slings under the tail section to keep it from sinking and had all 
survivors ashore within 40 minutes 
authorities did not identify the women who died but a relative 
said they were betsy hayter brogan in her 30s of gray tenn and 
her motherinlaw alice brogan of roanoke va the relative jack 
hayter of morristown tenn said the younger woman was a nurse who 
had a 5yearold son 
there were 55 passengers and six crew members on the plane 
colodny said fortyfive people went to hospitals and usair vice 
president jack long said eight remained hospitalized one was hurt 
seriously and had undergone surgery for blunt trauma 
flight 5050 was added to the schedule after an earlier flight was 
canceled because of bad weather airline spokeswoman susan young 
said it was raining lightly at the time of the crash but bill 
cahill spokesman for the port authority of new york and new jersey 
which operates the airport said weather was not a factor 
the plane was 9 months old and it had no history of mechanical 
problems said airline spokeswoman nancy vaughan a threemember 
boeing crash team planned to examine the aircraft 
a 737400 operated by british midland airways crashed jan 8 
north of london killing 44 people investigators said the crash may 
have resulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenly 
shutting down the other engine but no official report has been 
issued 
many uninjured survivors huddled in blankets at a terminal 
building others spoke from hospital beds 
joseph pankow a north carolina businessman recalled trying to 
reassure a woman who was screaming in panic after the plane came to 
rest i said calm down youre going to make it were all going 
to make it lets pray together and lets get out of this airplane 
a lady was next to me with a small baby and ive been around 
just 40 years but that babys been around not even 40 months he 
said so for that baby to live and be safe tonight is a dream for 
me pankow said and i only pray that the families that have 
suffered the losses of their cherished folks that theyre ok and 
they try to understand

plo leader yasser arafat appealed to israel 
to join him in peace talks and said his group had not taken a 
position on an egyptian proposal 
in freewheeling banter with local and foreign reporters at a 
cairo news conference thursday arafat called the israelis his 
cousins and said israels crackdown on the palestinian uprising 
violates jewish religious teaching 
arafat asked the israeli press to convey to their leaders and 
people his invitation to withdraw from the occupied territories 
then join him in a dialogue and a peace treaty 
i want you to carry this invitation to all israeli people and 
to all israeli officials and i want to have an answer and a 
response to what i said he told the journalists 
the israelis refuse to negotiate with the palestine liberation 
organization which they denounce as a terrorist group 
arafat arrived in egypt earlier thursday to meet with president 
hosni mubarak on the egyptian leaders 10 suggested changes in an 
israeli plan 
the israeli plan calls for palestinian elections leading to 
negotiations between israel and representatives of the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip on limited autonomy 
in an effort to overcome arab objections mubarak has proposed 
basing negotiations on the landforpeace principle and letting the 
140000 arabs in israeliannexed east jerusalem vote in the 
palestinian elections 
however he has not demanded an explicit plo role in representing 
the territories and has not called for the creation of a palestinian 
state 
arafat said the plo had not taken a position on mubaraks 
suggestions 
all these subjects are still under discussion and there is an 
effort by mubarak and by other friends to reach an overall solution 
to all these questions arafat said 
in recent days mubarak has been trying to sell israelis on his 
proposals through a media blitz in radio and newspaper interviews 
he has appealed to israeli citizens to challenge their governments 
refusal to negotiate with the plo 
in israel prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud 
bloc told high school students in tel aviv he thought the egyptian 
leader was only kidding around by his appeals 
i think that our people rely on the government shamir said 
we are a democratic country if the people didnt rely on the 
government it wouldnt stand its not like in egypt 
however defense minister yitzhak rabin of the leftofcenter 
labor party praised mubaraks efforts and rejected rightwing 
criticism of mubaraks appeals 
labor which is likuds governing coalition partner has endorsed 
mubaraks plan rabin said thursday we are prepared for a 
dialogue with a palestinian delegation that is arranged by egypt 
with our agreement 
arafat remained cool and jovial when addressing israeli 
reporters but he showed anger in talking about the israeli armys 
crackdown on the palestinian uprising 
the main question is the daily killing of our children our 
women our men isnt this wrong he asked these are our 
children is this the teaching of the torah you are violating the 
torah he said referring to the jewish religious scriptures 
he claimed the israelis have killed 932 palestinians since the 
uprising began in december 1987 
associated press records which are based on un israeli and 
arab sources indicate 573 palestinian have died

federal health officials say they hope to reduce 
infant mortality and obesity in the 1990s but they acknowledge that 
many goals of the past 10 years have not been met 
the public health service which on thursday listed 21 areas for 
improvement by the year 2000 said other goals for the upcoming 
decade are a longer life expectancy and fewer adult smokers 
we ought to be able to anticipate progress in each of them 
said dr j michael mcginnis director of the office of disease 
prevention and health promototion in washington 
the biggest challenge will be in the area of violent and 
abusive behavior mcginnis said 
mcginnis said only modest progress was made in many of the health 
goals set to be reached by 1990 but he said he had optimism for the 
90s 
we know more now about what the risk groups are mcginnis 
said 
he said for example that little improvement has occurred during 
the 1980s in controlling americans obesity 
other areas where goals for the current decade apparently will 
not be reached are immunization of children before age 2 and flu 
vaccinations for highrisk populations the atlantabased national 
centers for disease control said in its weekly report the report 
referred to a draft of the phs year 2000 objectives for the 
nation 
mcginnis said infant mortality is an area where progress has 
been reasonably good but we need to target areas where the 
population is most vulnerable we have not been able to close the 
gap between blacks and whites and have missed the target for 1990 of 
reducing the rate for blacks 
in a telephone interview mcginnis said that among the tentative 
targets for 2000 were cutting the percentage of adult smokers in 
half to about 15 percent and reducing infant mortality from 104 
per thousand in 1986 to no more than seven per thousand 
other goals he said include raising life expectancy to at least 
78 years from 749 and increasing years of healthy life to 65 years 
from an estimated 60 in 1987 
smoking is a good example said mcginnis a deputy assistant 
secretary for health its accountable for 390000 deaths a year 
its an example of where we can target lowincome and minority 
populations where the most difficult challenges lie 
the 21 areas targeted by the phs for improvement by the year 2000 
include nutrition physical activity and fitness tobacco alcohol 
and other drugs sexual behavior violent and abusive behavior 
vitality and independence of older people environmental health 
occupational safety and health and unintentional injuries 
others are maternal and infant health immunization and 
infectious diseases aids other sexually transmitted diseases 
cholesterol and high blood pressure cancer other chronic 
disorders oral health mental and behavioral disorders health 
education and preventive services and surveillance and data systems 
mcginnis said the planning process was not complete and that 
comment was welcome

hud secretary jack kemp plans to create a new 
job of chief financial officer for the department as part of a 
response to apparent mismanagement and what kemp says is a ripoff 
of the poor 
claire e freeman huds assistant secretarydesignate for 
administration told a congressional panel thursday that plans were 
being drafted for a job with broad responsibility for monitoring the 
department of housing and urban developments spending 
if any agency needs one it certainly is hud freeman said 
that will be a critical position at hud 
kemp who has acknowledged up to 2 billion may have been 
misspent at the department under the reagan administration called 
the hud problems the ripoff of the poor in the housing programs 
in an appearance before another senate committee 
freeman spoke at her confirmation hearing by the senate committee 
on banking housing and urban affairs she has been serving in an 
acting capacity for several months 
a spokesman for hud jack flynn said the new position has not 
yet been formally announced and may be included in a package of 
departmental reforms kemp plans to announce in october 
he said details and responsibilities are still being worked out 
but the new position would have broader authority than the current 
department budget director 
hud has been enmeshed in scandal over allegations of influence 
peddling fraud and mismanagement stemming from the eight years in 
which the department was headed by secretary samuel r pierce jr 
pierce is under subpoena by a house subcommittee to testify next 
tuesday and at least two more times as part of the congressional 
investigation into the departments problems 
stuart weisberg staff director of the house panel investigating 
hud said the subpoenas were formally served with pierces attorneys 
late thursday 
kemp appearing before the senate small business committee 
touched on the hud scandals only briefly as he urged support for the 
administrations proposed tax incentives for urban and rural 
enterprise zones 
he criticized the house ways and means committee for failing to 
approve the enterprise zone tax breaks while backing a series of 
larger tax breaks for specific industries 
it would be unconscionable to ignore our nations poor while 
providing assistance to business energy and prosperous americans 
he said 
the administrations proposal would eliminate capital gains taxes 
for assets within areas designated as enterprise zones it would 
also permit tax deductions of up to 250000 for new investments 
and provide a 5 percent refundable tax credit of up to 525 for 
lowincome workers within the zones the administration estimates 
the cost at 50 million in fiscal 1990

the federal program that guarantees housing 
loans to veterans faces further financial erosion from loan 
foreclosures and will require more taxpayer subsidies according to 
an audit by the investigative arm of congress 
the general accounting office said the veterans affairs 
department program once largely paid its way but needed 900 
million in appropriations and transfers from other programs last 
year 
the audit which was released earlier this week blamed the 
programs problems on the high rate of defaults in depressed farm 
and oilproducing areas but it also cited problems in how the 
program has been run 
efforts are under way in congress to pass legislation correcting 
some of the problems in the special loan program which has 
benefited about 13 million veterans the gao said 
there were 43693 foreclosures on homes financed with va loans in 
the 1987 fiscal year and 48963 foreclosures in fiscal 1988 the 
report said there were 38721 in the first 10 months of this fiscal 
year va spokeswoman donna st john said 
we expect the numbers to continue to decrease she said 
the department says it is spending 778 million on the program 
this fiscal year with 120 million of that in supplemental funds 
the gao says the government will have to give an extra 453 
million to the program in fiscal 1990 to pay off bad loans and will 
have to transfer about 100 million from a separate program used for 
direct mortgage loans to severely disabled veterans 
but several factors could drive the need for additional money 
even higher the audit said including a foreclosure rate that is 
higher than what the department projects

a judges ruling in a divorce custody 
battle over seven frozen human embryos that life begins at 
conception has inflamed the debate on when life starts 
abortion foes took heart at the tennessee ruling thursday that 
custody of the embryos could be awarded as if they were children 
regina smith executive director of the prolife council of 
connecticut called the courts decision a victory for unborn 
children 
this ruling reflects what prolifers have been saying for years 
that life begins at conception and should be protected by the laws 
of our land ms smith said 
but those who support a womans right to have an abortion called 
the decision wrongheaded and found it at odds with the us supreme 
court decision in roe vs wade that legalized abortion 
that may be the personal view of this particular judge but it 
has no basis in law said kate michelman executive director of 
the national abortion rights action league in washington it also 
has dangerous implications for reproductive freedom in america 
blount county circuit judge w dale young awarded temporary 
custody of the embryos to mary sue davis who wants them implanted 
in her so she can bear a child the judge rejected the arguments of 
her estranged husband junior lewis davis who sued for divorce and 
sought an order preventing implantation 
child support visitation and final custody will be decided if a 
birth results the judge wrote 
davis 31 vowed to appeal to the tennessee court of appeals 
they are going to force me to become a father against my 
wishes he said 
mrs davis 29 who now lives near titusville fla said she 
would wait to try to get pregnant until appeals were over she said 
the earliest she would try would be in january 
charles clifford the husbands attorney said he believed this 
was the first time a judge declared an embryo a human being he said 
the ruling conflicts with the roe vs wade decision which said that 
a fetus in the early stages of development lacks legal rights 
the roe decision contains some explicit language that says that 
a fetus which of course is much further along than an embryo is 
not a human being for the purposes of the united states 
constitution clifford said 
the judge said he believed roe vs wade didnt apply to the davis 
case because it dealt with the constitutionality of abortion not 
conception 
from fertilization the cells of a human embryo are 
differentiated unique and specialized to the highest degree of 
distinction the judge said thus he said human life begins at 
conception 
hedy weinberg executive director of the tennessee american civil 
liberties union said there is no consensus among doctors and 
scientists supporting the judges conclusion 
there is no question that while some people believe that life 
begins at conception that is based on religious belief weinberg 
said 
the case grew out of the decadeold technology of testtube 
babies or invitro fertilization eggs extracted surgically from 
a woman are fertilized in a laboratory dish and then can be 
implanted back in the woman 
the couple produced nine embryos in december with the help of dr 
i ray king at a knoxville clinic two were implanted in mrs davis 
but failed to develop the others were put in cold storage davis 
sued for divorce in february 
after declaring the four to eightcell embryos to be children 
rather than property young in effect treated the case like a 
typical custody dispute in which the overriding concern is the best 
interest of the child 
the davises divorce is not yet final in his ruling young 
instructed mrs davis attorney to file final papers that would 
complete the proceeding other issues like the division of 
household property were uncontested

the bush administration is limiting the 
protection its willing to give buyers of insolvent savings 
institutions a marked shift from a muchcriticized government 
policy in 1988 thrift bailouts 
the overseers of the resolution trust corp an agency created 
last month to deal with failed sampls on thursday barred regulators 
from guaranteeing sampl buyers against losses for longer than six 
months 
an attorney who has represented buyers of failed thrifts said the 
decision will leave the government holding more of the sour loans 
and real estate from insolvent institutions but will make it easier 
to sell the sampls 
there arent many acquirers that are going to be willing to 
take asset risks said thomas p vartanian a washington lawyer 
as a result the government will end up holding the assets and 
trying to sell them separately from the institutions that in turn 
could make the clean institutions more attractive to buyers 
christie sciacca of the secura group a consulting firm advising 
sampl buyers said purchasers if they accept the bad assets likely 
will demand more government assistance in exchange for giving up 
longterm loss protection 
its kind of pay me now or pay me later from the buyers 
standpoint he said 
previously the government effectively warehoused the bad loans 
and real estate within bailedout institutions by guaranteeing the 
new owners against loss sometimes as long as 10 years 
but critics in congress said the deals left the government and 
taxpayers open to potentially huge and unknowable losses if bad 
loans continued to deteriorate or real estate prices fell 
nevertheless a threemember oversight board headed by treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady voted at its first public meeting to bar 
longterm guarantees in future rescues 
the shortterm guarantees it envisions would allow the government 
to complete bailout deals swiftly by giving buyers the right to sell 
back loans and other assets they had not had a chance to fully 
evaluate but buyers would retain that right no longer than six 
months and there would be no longterm risk assumed by the 
government 
the oversight panel which includes housing secretary jack kemp 
and federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan also told 
regulators to avoid taking large ownership positions in bailedout 
sampls thus exposing the government to the risk of future losses 
in some past deals the government has remained as a principal 
owner of bailedout banks and thrifts a practice that has allowed 
it to entice reluctant purchasers into putting at least some private 
money into ailing institutions 
however under the new policy regulators will be allowed to 
retain warrants that entitle the government to share in unexpected 
windfall profits earned by rescued sampls 
the oversight board sets the policies for the rtc however its 
work is carried out by the federal deposit insurance corp which 
insures bank and sampl deposits 
that arrangement designed to ensure a strong administration 
voice in the spending of the 50 billion in sampl rescue money through 
1991 has caused some tension between the treasurydominated 
oversight panel and the fdic an independent agency 
at one point regulators complained they were ready to proceed 
with large rescue deals but could not because the oversight board 
had not set the necessary policies 
david c cooke the rtc chief executive said thursdays action 
gives us the flexibility to do any kind of deal that we foresee 
right now 
so far the rtc has resolved the cases of 18 small institutions 
with 11 billion in deposits but still has 257 institutions in its 
care cooke said it hopes to complete five large deals by the end of 
this month spending a total of 8 billion including the 
transactions in august and earlier this month

the problem of overproduction in us 
agriculture will be around for at least another 40 years says a new 
study by the agriculture department 
rising crop yields are expected to increase more than enough to 
offset us population growth and export demands that will result 
in 40 percent less farmland needed for such major crops as wheat 
corn and soybeans 
the new projections were included thursday in a 280page 
appraisal of the nations soil and water resources ordered by 
congress in the resource conservation act of 1977 
in its first rca appraisal published in 1981 and using 
information from the 1970s usda analysts said almost 390 million 
acres would be required by 2030 by comparison slightly more than 
380 million acres were used for crops in 1982 the base year for the 
new projections 
under intermediate conditions assumed in the latest study 
cropland acreage in 2030 is projected to be slightly less than 220 
million acres 
the differences in the two projections of acreages needed do 
not result primarily from differences in projected demand for 
commodities the report said 
in fact it continued for the major crops corn sorghum 
soybeans and wheat projections of quantities needed are higher in 
the second appraisal than in the first largely because projected 
export demands are higher 
the report said domestic use of some grains in 2030 may be lower 
than previously anticipated because of improvements in livestock 
feeding efficiency and much greater use of pasture and forage also 
per capita projections of red meat consumption are lower in the new 
appraisal 
but the main reason for the differences in the amount of cropland 
that will be required in 2030 stems from the projected rates of crop 
yields 
for example in the first appraisal average us corn yields in 
2030 were projected at 144 bushels per acre the 1989 harvest is 
currently estimated at 1124 bushels per acre 
the new appraisal puts 2030 corn yields at 198 bushels per acre 
sorghum would go to 127 bushels per acre compared with 67 projected 
in the first appraisal and this years average of 626 bushels 
wheat would go to 70 bushels per acre from 42 projected earlier 
and this years average of 329 soybean yields were projected at 69 
bushels per acre compared with 45 earlier and 32 this year 
the assumptions about yield increases mirror the vastly changed 
view of the future that has developed during the past decade the 
report said in the early 1970s many studies indicated 
productivity was increasing more slowly than in preceding decades 
at that time it appeared to researchers that without 
significant technological breakthroughs and increased investment in 
research and extension programs the rate of growth in productivity 
will probably continue to decline 
but later research provided a basis for greater optimism the 
report said in scientific meetings in 1982 and in 1986 a view 
developed favorable to continued technological progress in crop and 
livestock production as well as in conservation of the nations 
resources 
as in the first rca appraisal the second found major problems 
confronting us soil and water resources erosion salinization 
range deterioration pollution destruction of wetlands and wildlife 
habitat and acid rain 
further about 15 million acres of agricultural land are being 
irreversibly removed from production and converted to 
nonagricultural uses each year the report said 
if the loss rate continues the nations cropland base would be 
reduced buy nearly 48 million acres or 12 percent between 1982 and 
2030 the period covered by the new appraisal

president bush met with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze on thursday opening three days of highlevel 
talks expected to narrow a time frame for a superpower summit next 
year and spur chemical and nuclear weapons cutbacks 
after nearly two hours of discussions shevardnadze said the two 
sides had not set a date for a summit meeting between bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev but we have concluded that 
a summit is necessary there is no doubt about that 
bush interviewed thursday night on abctvs primetime live 
show said there will be a summit but he did not specify a time 
when asked if it would be early next year the president replied 
i wouldnt say early 
secretary of state james a baker iii indicated a summit meeting 
might not occur until next year but said it would be in the united 
states another us official speaking privately said i would 
steer you away from this year definitely 
the highlevel meetings began with a white house session attended 
by bush shevardnadze and baker the discussions will continue 
between baker and shevardnadze on friday and saturday at a 
wilderness lodge near jackson hole wyo the two arrived there late 
thursday on an air force jet where shevardnadze said he hoped the 
the good fresh air of wyoming will help bring fresh ideas 
discussion aboard the plane concentrated on independence 
movements among the soviet unions baltic republics and gorbachevs 
plans to restructure the nations economy 
in the past the soviet preoccupation was never to reveal a 
weakness because they felt we would exploit it said the us 
official who spoke to five reporters aboard the plane on the 
condition he would not be identified now they understand we are 
interested in a relationship of mutual advantge 
baker said that there was a full discussion of a summit and 
that we hope to have a general time frame fora summit which we 
could announce while were in wyoming 
shevardnadze spoke with reporters in the white house driveway 
before getting into a waiting limousine using the same language as 
baker shevardnadze said the talks in wyoming probably would set a 
general time frame for a bushgorbachev summit the foreign 
minister said i think it is entirely possible that well have 
something more definite for you in wyoming 
bush said monday he felt he was under no rush to have a 
summit 
while saying the timing and site for a summit have not been 
determined baker said i think its our turn to host such a 
meeting the last superpower summit was in moscow in 1988 
i think its important that the leaders of the soviet union and 
the united states get together periodically baker said it will 
have been some time if were looking at something into next year 
and im not saying thats the time frame were going to give you in 
wyoming but i think its important they get together from time to 
time and talk about the full range of problems between these two 
countries 
bush and baker met with shevardnadze for about an hour in the 
cabinet room along with aides on both sides that session was 
followed by another meeting lasting about a half hour in the oval 
office that excluded most of the aides 
shevardnadze said he delivered a letter from gorbachev mostly 
dealing with the entire complex of arms control issues 
baker said the letter in some instances restates longheld 
soviet positions in some instances it puts new twists on those 
positions he declined to elaborate saying the document required 
more analysis 
baker described gorbachevs letter as a reply to a june 20 letter 
from bush this is a very serious letter it is received by us in 
a serious manner baker said he said the united states would 
reply to it in wyoming 
baker said he hoped the wyoming meeting would produce 
substantial progress on verification and stability measures 
proposed by the united states for a strategic arms reduction treaty 
shevardnadze talking with reporters was asked if bush had 
disclosed any new initiatives bush had said monday he had some 
ideas that would capture the imagination of the soviet people 
there have been such suggestions on the american side and we 
certainly did not come here emptyhanded shevardnadze replied 
describing the talks with bush shevardnadze said it was a 
very interesting conversation held in a very good atmosphere also 
a frank atmosphere he said he was very pleased 
baker at a separate briefing for reporters said bush expressed 
the belief that the soviet union had proceeded very responsibly 
and in a very measured way with respect to changes that are taking 
place not just in the soviet union but in eastern europe as well 
baker said shevardnadze offered assurances that the soviet union 
was not shippng weapons to nicaragua baker said that us officials 
emphasized that shipments from the soviet bloc have not diminished 
he said the subject would be discussed at some length in wyoming 
a senior soviet official said shevardnadze had brought a positive 
response to the us idea of trial verifications which would be 
carried out before the conclusion of a treaty to cut strategic 
nuclear arms 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity also said the 
soviet side is carrying proposals concerning the prohibition of 
weaponsgrade fission materials gorbachev initially suggested such 
a ban several months ago 
as for the discussions on a reduction of conventional forces in 
europe the official said shevardnadze has brought proposals which 
he believes will make possible the conclusion of an agreement within 
the six months to 12 months suggested by bush bush has proposed 
massive cuts 
shevardnadze told reporters the soviet side welcomes with 
active support the open skies proposal set forth by bush 
several months ago and wants further discussions 
under the proposal the skies of both countries would be open to 
reconnaissance flights of the other it was the first time moscow 
had indicatedly publicly its interest in exploring that proposal 
the white house session marked bushs first direct contact with a 
highranking soviet official since taking office last january and 
came amid complaints by congressional democrats as well as from 
moscow about the pace of activity in superpower relations 
trying to capitalize on gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or 
openness the administration prepared proposals lifting virtually 
all restrictions on travel by diplomats trade representatives and 
journalists in each others countries according to sources 
about 90 percent of the soviet union is off limits to americans 
reflecting the suspicions that marked the rule of josef stalin over 
the years the united states responded by imposing similar travel 
restrictions on a large part of the united states 
bakers meetings with shevardnadze are expected to produce 
progress across a broad range of subjects including in addition to 
conventional arms 
chemical weapons the two sides are reportedly close to an 
agreement to exchange information on their chemical weapons programs 
and to open stockpiles and plants to inspections by the other side 
baker and shevardnadze hope to resolve details including whether 
us chemical weapons stored in west germany would be covered 
nuclear arms the two sides are exploring steps to narrow 
differences blocking an agreement to cut by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the most deadly weapons in the superpowers arsenals longrange 
bombers missiles and submarines the soviet delegation includes a 
team of arms experts 
the united states is withdrawing its proposal to ban mobile 
longrange missiles which moscow has and the united states wants 
human rights the soviets have told us officials that hundreds 
of jews who have been refused exit permits will be allowed to leave 
the bush administration had presented lists of more than 500 
socalled refuseniks the soviet union reportedly said that 
threequarters could leave 
ice curtain baker and shevardnadze are to sign an agreement for 
regular visits between the yupik and inupiat eskimos of alaska and 
siberia thereby shattering the socalled ice curtain that has 
existed since the kremlin forbade travel across the bering strait in 
1948 
nuclear testing the two officials may reach agreement in 
principle on methods of monitoring underground nuclear tests that 
would be an impetus toward senate ratification of two longstalled 
nuclear testing treaties

a civil rights lawyer called thursday for 
the police chiefs resignation over the alleged mistreatment of a 
protected federal witness who was a key figure in a dramatic new 
york city drugandmurder case 
carl maxeys client who was moved to spokane a year ago under 
the name amos hardeen said he was hit with a nightstick and called 
a racial slur by officer patricia madsen after she stopped him and 
cited him for speeding and running a stop sign 
he also was cited for failure to obey an officer resisting 
arrest and thirddegree assault after a brief scuffle outside his 
home sept 1 
maxey contends that his client who previously went by the single 
name arjune was branded a liar by police chief terry mangan before 
completion of an internal police investigation into his claim of 
racial harassment 
mangan in turn accused maxey of reverse racism 
arjune was a key prosecution witness in a major cocaine trial in 
new york city he also testified against two of the four people 
convicted of seconddegree murder in the feb 26 1988 shooting 
death of edward byrne a 22yearold rookie police officer who was 
guarding arjunes house at the time 
arjune was relocated to spokane last year and was recently moved 
to an undisclosed location after his cover was blown 
spokane county prosecutors decided to prosecute arjune for 
resisting arrest a misdemeanor but dropped the felony assault 
charge deputy prosecutor clark colwell said arjune is forefeiting 
bond in the case maxey said 
mangan said at a sept 11 press conference that the officer 
denied arjunes accusations and had passed a polygraph test mangan 
said arjune described in new york as a guyanese immigrant lied in 
his claim of harassment and tried to use his skin color to mask 
criminal activity 
maxey said thursday the chiefs inappropriate prejudicial and 
personal comments and lack of adherence to standard police 
procedure made it impossible for his client to participate in the 
internal police probe 
i called arjune a liar because thats exactly what he did 
mangan said later he tried to make it a phony racial incident by 
lying about our officer and saying she called him a racial slur and 
hit him with her nightstick 
wed be happy to hear mr hardeens side of the story if he 
decides to give it but we have documented proof that he gave a 
false account of the events 
arjune didnt hide behind his color maxey said he wears 
it as a badge of honor and hes done far more in the war against 
drugs than the police chief of spokane 
bill dempsey of the us marshals service headquarters in 
arlington va said the agency does not discuss specific cases or 
confirm that a person is in the witness protection program 
a witness would be dropped from the program for committing a 
serious crime but not necessarily for minor offenses like traffic 
infractions 
the program is not a shield for a witness to hide behind 
dempsey said the object of the program is to provide protection 
not immunity from the laws of the land

maurice faulkner has been known to pull a 
prank or two so it was no surprise that only one friend believed 
him when he claimed hed just chased a 6foot lizard into the woods 
we thought he was making it up ernie bartlett said 
theres not supposed to be anything like this in this part of the 
country and he has been known to josh you 
faulkner told bartlett that he thought the lizard which was 
lying in the road was a log until the log lifted its head he 
stopped his truck and chased the lizard into the woods where it 
climbed a tree 
but the lizard turned the tables hissing loudly and thrusting 
its long forked tongue as it chased faulkner eventually the 
reptile burrowed into a hole in a creek bank 
bartletts wife kay a frequent viewer of national geographic 
television specials identified the reptile as a monitor lizard 
but even after a few more friends were convinced no one wanted 
to help faulkner roam the woods of southern arkansas at night to 
seek a giant hissing lizard 
at daylight sunday a posse of seven set out armed with a shovel 
some rope a net and a videocamera the group captured the lizard 
while the reptile was still parked in the hole with his tail 
sticking out 
the bartletts have contacted zoos in monroe la and little rock 
about taking the lizard

the fbi says it wont appeal a federal court 
order that directs changes in promotions and assignments to correct 
what a judge called systematic discrimination against hispanic 
agents 
the bureau made the announcement thursday after solicitor general 
kenneth starr told the fbi he had accepted fbi director william 
sessions recommendation not to appeal the case 
the may 5 order by a federal judge in texas strips fbi 
supervisors of the power to overrule decisions by the bureaus 
career promotion board 
it also set up a panel of three outside attorneys to decide if up 
to 200 hispanic agents should be promoted to make up for past job 
discrimination 
sessions said in a statement that he recommended against 
appealing the order after weighing the myriad legal operational 
and institutional considerations 
we must move beyond the frictions caused by this case to 
address the many vital challenges facing the fbi in the 1990s 
said sessions who added that dropping the appeal was in the best 
interests of fbi employees 
the decision was hailed by rep don edwards dcalif who called 
on the fbi to settle a racial harassment and discrimination lawsuit 
filed by donald rochon a black fbi agent now assigned to the 
philadelphia field office 
rochon claims he and his family were harassed by white agents 
when he worked in chicago and that he suffered retaliation by fbi 
supervisors for pressing his complaints 
thats exactly the right decision something weve been urging 
for many months edwards chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil rights said of the fbis decision 
its time for them to move on and get at the root causes of the 
problems said the congressman 
bureau officials refused to comment on the rochon case except to 
cite sessions previous statements that he intended to withhold 
judgment until the facts have been adjudicated 
in the classaction suit joined by 311 of the fbis approximately 
400 hispanic agents us district judge lucius bunton iii of 
midland texas directed the bureau to end its unsystematic 
excessively subjective method of promoting special agents 
bunton said the ability of special agents in charge of field 
offices to overrule promotionboard decisions was anathema to 
nearly every reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this court 
to improve the fairness and reviewability of the process 
the order followed two years of litigation launched in early 1987 
by bernardo m perez then the no 2 fbi agent in el paso texas 
the suit was filed by perez after a series of demotions from special 
agent in charge of the san juan puerto rico field office to el 
paso which he termed an fbi dumping ground 
bunton ordered perezs promotion and he has since been appointed 
deputy assistant director of the fbis laboratory division in 
washington 
in earlier rulings the judge found that hispanic agents were 
often relegated to what one hispanic agent has described as the 
taco circuit working in hispanic neighborhoods or doing 
language translations 
bunton concluded that hispanic agents were often assigned to such 
undesirable tasks as monitoring spanishspeaking suspects on 
wiretaps 
after he took office in november 1987 sessions reviewed all fbi 
personnel and recruitment policies saying he would tolerate no 
discrimination 
sessions went outside the bureau to hire a new head of the 
reorganized equal employment opportunity office 
bunton acknowledged these steps demonstrate energetic and 
goodfaith effort to correct the disparities found by this court 
but the judge said the fbi had to do more saying the changes 
already implemented while wellintentioned are finetuning of a 
system that requires more dramatic repair

responding to growing concern over raunchy 
radio and tv the nations major broadcasting group is considering 
restoring program codes that were dropped under government pressure 
in the 1970s 
the national association of broadcasters will canvass its members 
and study whether to restore the codes because new federal 
communications commission chairman alfred sikes urged radio 
executives to shut down shock radio nab spokesman walt wurfel 
said thursday 
sikes urged broadcasters at a convention in new orleans last week 
to shun programs that use sexually and racially offensive humor to 
attract audiences 
sikes said broadcasters should revive the codes that were 
abandoned in the mid1970s after the justice department initiated an 
antitrust lawsuit against provisions of the codes involving 
advertising new codes should be drawn up by the industry without 
government pressure said sikes the chief regulator of the radio 
and television industry 
wurfel said the nabs executive committee in response to sikes 
comments told staff members to conduct an assessment of the 
feasibility effectiveness legal and legislative elements of and 
member support for devising a statement of standards or guidelines 
concerning programming in the public interest 
sikes a former radio station owner who came to the fcc six weeks 
ago told the broadcasters convention they were not simply 
recorders transmitters and antennas we are what we broadcast 
he noted that on aug 24 the fcc announced it was considering 
action against three radio stations in chicago san jose calif 
and indianapolis for possibly broadcasting indecent programming 
during daytime hours 
that action was widely viewed as a warning shot across the bow of 
broadcasters from a new nononsense fcc sikes and new 
commissioners andrew barrett and sherrie marshall faced tough 
questioning during their senate confirmation hearings in july on 
what they proposed to do about indecency on the airwaves 
wurfel said the nab which represents more than 6000 radio and 
tv stations and the major radio and tv networks was hesitant about 
new codes in light of the justice department attack on the old codes 
we dont desire to get into any further antitrust action 
wurfel said adding that nab also has to weigh first amendment 
concerns and community concerns 
the house earlier this year passed a bill that would give the 
television industry a threeyear antitrust exemption so it can try 
to adopt voluntary guidelines on violence 
the senate passed a similar measure that added antitrust 
exemption for guidelines on portrayals of drug use and sex and 
differences in the two bills are now being worked out in a 
housesenate conference committee

the worlds only condom that holds a 
certificate of air worthiness wont be flying at this years 18th 
annual international balloon fiesta 
the 12story high 45foot wide hot air balloon made from a 
canary yellow nonflammable polyester and topped with a 10foot 
nipple was refused entry 
the owner dr malcolm potts said his balloon was turned down 
because someone thought it obscene but organizers say potts 
application arrived too late 
potts director of a nonprofit aids prevention and family 
planning organization near raleigh nc owns the balloon with 
phillip harvey enterprises inc a condom distributor 
its a goodnatured symbol of a lifesaving object that wont 
offend children potts said thursday in a telephone interview from 
raleigh but by making people smile it might assist them in 
purchasing condoms for the first time and possibly save their 
lives 
it may be adolescent and naughty but its not crude and 
offensive he said 
the balloon which was built in june sports a banner that reads 
i save lives it has flown a number of times in north carolina 
and over montreal during an aids conference the balloon was to have 
raised money for aids projects during the albuquerque fiesta which 
runs oct 715 
marge ruppenthal the fiestas executive director said the 
owners of the condom balloon registered too late for entry 
i dont know what the problem is ruppenthal said they 
called about the balloon coming but after the deadline was extended 
to sept 1 and i hadnt received any paperwork i couldnt accept the 
entry 
but mary brady owner of above the ordinary which provides pilot 
and crew for the condom balloon said the fiesta committee told her 
that a major sponsor of the fiesta united new mexico bank 
threatened to withdraw its support if the condom was permitted to 
fly 
sandy miller the banks director of marketing declined to say 
whether the bank was opposed to the balloon she said she was told 
by the committee that the owners missed the deadline so the bank 
had no decision to make

age and the rheumatiz are causing burl ives 
to move a little slower these days but hes still enchanting 
audiences with his folk ballads poems and tales of the american 
past 
thats what a song is for to sing it said the 80yearold 
celebrated folk singer and actor you cant put it in a box 
a little thinner than in his younger years but still sporting his 
trademark white goatee ives gave one of his increasingly rare 
recitals thursday night at the library of congress to help celebrate 
the year of the young reader a library initiative promoting book 
reading among youngsters first lady barbara bush is honorary 
chairman of the project 
as he has for years ives starts his program with some old 
favorites like barbara allen and the old lady who swallowed 
the fly throws in a couple of cowboy songs some irish songs a 
few verses of poetry and a finale of songs ending with a lively 
rendition of jimmy crack corn 
ives is an old friend of the library of congress whose vast 
collection of recordings includes several hundred folk songs by the 
wayfaring stranger as ives calls himself 
his songs also including foggy foggy dew and blue tail 
fly are familiar to millions of americans who grew up in the 
1940s and 1950s and to successive generations of children who heard 
his recordings 
besides his folk song concerts ives was a popular stage radio 
television and movie performer he won an academy award for 
supporting actor in the big country in 1958 and is widely 
remembered as big daddy in the stage and movie productions of 
tennessee williams cat on a hot tin roof 
a degenerative bone disease has forced ives to reduce his concert 
appearances from about 40 or 50 annually to a few in the fall and 
a few in the spring he spends much of his time at his new home on 
anacortes an island off the coast of washington state where he 
moved recently from california 
ives has slimmed down from the 270 pounds he used to carry but 
the familiar goatee is still there and his blue eyes still twinkle 
when he tells a story or sings a song with his deepchested tenor 
in a prerecital interview ives said he usually practices 
singing every day to stay in shape even though his repertoire 
includes songs he has been singing for 75 years or more he learned 
some from his grandmother on a farm in jasper county ill and many 
others during his hitchhiking tour of america with his guitar during 
the depression 
some music critics say ives represents a link between 
angloamerican folk traditions of the 19th century whose songs he 
often sings and the folkrock styles of the 1960s 
speaking for himself ives says he loves the nashville sound 
those gentle folklike songs that depend on their lyrics for 
effect and not the thump of the rhythm section 
he doesnt have much use for rocknroll 
i dont dislike it and i dont like it he said i just 
dont pay much attention to it

president bush will involve nearly every 
cabinet member in his education summit with the nations governors 
next week because everyone has a responsibility to help improve 
schools education secretary lauro cavazos says 
it is a good move to involve the entire cabinet because 
certainly this is a national issue cavazos said thursday at a 
briefing on the twoday summit set for next wednesday and thursday 
in charlottesville va 
we tend to think of education as being the purview of the 
department of education with its 22 billion budget he 
explained another 20 billion for education is spent by other 
agencies including the departments of health and human services 
labor defense and agriculture 
the quality of structure that each of these people will give 
in their area of responsibility can greatly impact the quality 
of education cavazos said therefore i think everyone has a 
responsibility 
roger porter bushs domestic policy adviser said the white 
house is expecting perfect attendance from the governors of the 50 
states and several governors from us territories will be there 
with virtually the entire cabinet 
the aim of the largely closeddoor deliberations on the 
university of virginia campus will be to find new ideas to improve 
americas schools porter said 
the best ideas including efforts to give parents more choice 
over which public school their child attends revolve around more 
efficient use of the moneys that we are already spending said 
porter 
such ideas do not require more money he said 
democratic leaders of congress on wednesday unveiled their own 
goals for the nations schools and promised to press for 
adequate funding to help meet them 
porter said americans are spending 353 billion on education at 
all levels from kindergarten through graduate school including 
more than 5200 for every public school pupil 
were not going to be announcing any goals at the end of the 
summit porter said what we will be announcing will be the 
process by which those goals are going to be developed 
the postsummit process of drawing up those goals will involve 
parents and teachers and administrators and school boards 
porter said the ideas that hold real promise for improving the 
bottom line invariably expand choice for parents and students 
introduce greater flexibility while demanding increased 
accountability for results 
the president believes the current level of performance is not 
acceptable and simply doing more of the same is unlikely to improve 
it porter said new approaches and new ideas are needed 
although the agenda includes a discussion of expanding access to 
higher education and training more teachers the focus will clearly 
be on problems in the lower grades 
porter on leave as a professor of government at harvards 
kennedy school said americas universities are really quite 
phenomenal in part because they are incredibly diverse and 
highly competitive 
the topics for the six working groups announced last week by the 
governors are teaching learning environment governance choice 
and restructuring a competitive work force and lifelong learning 
and postsecondary education 
bush will participate in each of the six working group sessions 
with 16 or 17 governors and five or six cabinet members 
each working group will be cochaired by a republican governor 
and a democratic governor with a cabinet member moderating the 
discussion a report will be prepared that the president and the 
governors will consider in plenary sessions

the focus is on arms control in this latest 
round of ussoviet talks and the bush administration knows how it 
wants to approach that subject 
but on the economic front there is no decision yet on how much 
help beyond good wishes to give mikhail s gorbachev as the 
soviet president tries to restructure his countrys industries and 
agriculture 
arms control and economics are related reducing troops and 
weapons gives gorbachev more capital to spend on consumer goods and 
other necessities 
president bush and his foreign policy advisers have made up their 
minds in one respect at least 
they will move to conclude arms control agreements that are in 
us security interests but they will not be frantic about it 
secreary of state james a baker iii said this week 
on the economic front there have been only hints the judgment 
within the administration seems to be that gorbachevs perestroika 
program will succeed or fail mostly on decisions taken in moscow 
there are no simple or quick fixes baker said 
but on some specific steps that could help gorbachev the 
administration is still making up its mind 
one is whether to give the soviets the same kind of trading 
privileges granted hungary this week another is whether to support 
membership for moscow in the genevabased general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
the 96nation gatt sets rules for international trade and settles 
disputes among its members membership would be a break for 
gorbachev and give the soviet economy greater acceptance within the 
international trading community 
gorbachev is seeking at least observer status he also wants 
membership in the world bank and the international monetary fund 
this summer gorbachev entered a bid for links to the annual 
summit meeting of the united states and six other industrialized 
democracies britain canada france italy japan and west germany 
he didnt get his foot in the door 
bakers advice this week to the soviets was to help themselves by 
pulling out of regional wars around the globe and redirecting 
billions of dollars saved into the economy 
they are spending billions of dollars in regional conflict 
situations that we think could be put to better use to assist the 
process of perestroika he said 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger took a tougher 
line last week in a speech at georgetown university 
he reminded the western allies and japan that gorbachev is no 
anticommunist and said they should avoid bankrolling merely 
cosmetic soviet reforms 
how bad is the situation in the soviet union 
us analysts are constantly reassessing the economic power of 
the soviet union they are interested mainly in how much capital the 
soviets are spending on their military programs 
at a central committee meeting last year gorbachev made an 
admission that surprised some analysts here 
he said growth figures in the 1970s under leonid i brezhnev had 
been boosted by highpriced oil sales and by the sale of vodka 
otherwise gorbachev said there was no increase in the absolute 
growth of the national income 
world oil prices have been in decline in recent years and 
gorbachev has put the kibosh on hard liquor as part of his revival 
program 
so the soviet economy must still be hardpressed 
some people would make the argument that the united states its 
european partners and japan have a stake in gorbachev succeeding 
they would argue he has lowered tensions while also trying to 
improve conditions at home 
failure could usher in a hardline successor 
others argue that the west should keep its distance and let the 
soviets figure their own way out of difficulty 
collectively the bush administration is not sure yet but thats 
the direction in which it appears to be going as baker huddles with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in wyoming

congress is being urged to move cautiously on a 
new proposal to streamline death penalty appeals that civil 
libertarians say could undermine fundamental rights of death row 
inmates 
we are concerned that fairness not be sacrificed for 
expediency said american bar association president stanley 
chauvin in a letter to senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r 
biden ddel 
chauvin said biden should hold extensive public hearings on a 
report announced thursday by a committee appointed by chief justice 
william h rehnquist the aba head also said the hearings should 
await the lawyers group own report on the issue due by november 
the rehnquist committee proposed a new system that could lead to 
swifter executions the panel headed by retired justice lewis f 
powell proposed that fewer appeals be accompanied by more legal 
help for condemned killers 
civil liberties lawyers accused rehnquist of stacking the panel 
and said the promise of expanded legal help is an illusion 
they want to be able to kill more people faster said mary 
broderick of the national legal aid and defender association 
its a public relations ploy to facilitate the rush to the 
gallows said leslie harris of the american civil liberties union 
ralph neas of the leadership conference on civil rights said the 
committee plan means less protection against abuse by police and 
prosecutors in capital cases particularly for poor blacks 
imposition of the death penalty is hopelessly tainted by race 
discrimination he said not only does race discrimination drive 
the decision to seek and impose the death penalty it affects every 
part of the proceeding 
but powell said the hard fact is that the capital punishment 
laws of 37 states are not being enforced by the courts 
i respect those who argue for outright abolition of death 
punishment but it seems irrational to retain the penalty and 
frustrate its fair implementation he said 
ironically powell said he would vote to abolish capital 
punishment if he were a state legislator contending it has not 
deterred murder 
the united states has the highest murder rate of any nation and 
is the only democracy that has the death penalty he noted 
powell said the committees report is intended to reform a system 
that encourages endless legal maneuvering years of delay and 
frenzied lastminute moves to stave off execution 
the report was submitted to the us judicial conference the 
policymaking arm of the federal courts the conference postponed 
any action on the report and any recommendation to congress 
until its 28 judges reconvene in march 
the committee recommended that states enact laws to limit death 
row inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts 
one round would challenge a verdict directly a second would be 
based on alleged violations of the condemned individuals rights 
the current system permits successive rounds of appeals in the 
federal courts 
there are some 2200 convicted murderers on death row across the 
nation there have been 118 executions since the supreme court 
reinstated the death penalty in 1976 
powell said only a fraction of those convicted for the 20000 
murders committed each year are sentenced to die and that the 
average lapse between conviction and execution is more than eight 
years

the university of georgia will end its grand 
tradition of public prayer before football games because of the 
likelihood it would not withstand a court challenge the schools 
president said 
president charles b knapp made the decision thursday hours 
after attorney general michael bowers advised him a threatened 
lawsuit by the american civil liberties union probably would succeed 
i personally believe in the pregame prayer knapp said i 
thought it was a grand tradition at the university of georgia and 
im very very saddened that we are going to have to discontinue 
it 
bowers said he believed a recent us supreme court decision 
banning pregame prayers at high school athletic events also applied 
to colleges and universities 
i must conclude that the likelihood of successfully defending 
the pregame prayer at the university of georgia is very slight 
bowers said in a letter handdelivered to state university system 
chancellor h dean propst 
knapp said bowers told him that replacing the prayer with a 
moment of silence would run the same risk as invocations 
a student read a prayer over the sanford stadium public address 
system before last saturdays baylorgeorgia football game and 
knapp had said the invocations would continue unless he was advised 
otherwise by bowers or a court 
georgia athletic director vince dooley said he was dismayed by 
the decision though he supported it on legal grounds 
the pregame prayer has been a longstanding tradition at the 
university of georgia but it has also been a great national 
tradition all across the country im disappointed the pregame 
prayer will no longer be part of our football and athletic 
tradition dooley said 
the case that went before the supreme court was brought by the 
georgia aclu on behalf of a douglasville ga high school student 
hilary chiz executive director of the georgia aclu said 
thursday she was glad a protracted court fight would be avoided but 
she said she had been confident all along the aclu position would 
prevail 
im glad they understood that prayer in a statesupported 
environment is a violation of the constitution she said the 
constitution is safe the first amendment stands

the war against drugs will require more money 
and possible curbs on some traditional american freedoms says adm 
william crowe jr the retiring chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff 
the admiral in a wideranging interview thursday said both 
congress and the nations taxpayers will have to face the fact that 
the battle is a fullfledged war and will be costly 
if you want to stop the drug war you are going to have to 
spend more money i dont see any way in the world to achieve more 
and spend less crowe said when asked if enough funds have been 
directed to the drug battle 
president bush and congress are embroiled in discussions over the 
cost of the nations antidrug strategy with the democratic 
leadership pressing the president to put more funds into the fight 
crowe who is scheduled to retire oct 1 after 43 years in the 
service said the nations citizens also must face the fact that 
some of their most cherished rights might need to be curbed in order 
to purge the drug menace from society 
asked which rights could be limited crowe said search and 
seizure the most simple one is random drug testing that is 
what has allowed us to bring down the usage so heavily in the 
military 
crowe said many people want drugs to go away but they dont 
want the quality of their rights eroded 
crowe also said the nation might consider doing unusual things 
with the military to win the war against drugs 
we are now looking at contributing much more heavily 
particularly in the land border in the united states crowe said 
indicating that military personnel could be used in steppedup 
reconnaissance duties or aiding the border patrol 
if we want to fight it and we want to whip it we want to 
prevent it i would suggest that it does require unusual measures 
crowe said 
the admiral also suggested banning the sale of assault weapons 
president bush has banned imported assault weapons but has allowed 
sales of usmade versions to continue 
saying the nation has never seen the fiber of our society eaten 
away by an insidious uncontrollable threat crowe suggested that 
in the antidrug fight americans might want to use the military in 
new ways that doesnt appall me he said 
he suggested the military might be used to help patrol the 
nations borders saying were thinly stretched on the southern 
border and there are a lot of access routes 
he said he could not outline the pentagons role in great detail 
noting the militarys plans were currently being worked out at the 
command of defense secretary dick cheney 
but he said us forces will not be drawn into antidrug combat 
overseas and that pentagon officials are not interested in shooting 
down unidentified aircraft suspected of ferrying illicit narcotics 
into the country a possibility suggested by some in congress 
the admiral asked about the proliferation of guns in society 
said ive never objected to measures that make you register your 
guns i think the most reasonable position seems to be that we 
should generally know where the guns are and who owns them and if 
you own a gun you shouldnt insist on owning it clandestinely 
the 64yearold former submariner is wrapping up two terms as the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff where he served as the 
principal military adviser to the president and as the pentagons 
top military leader

the government moving to reduce whiplash 
injuries will require light trucks vans and sportutility vehicles 
to include headrests on the front seats 
a senator sponsoring auto safety legislation praised the order 
thursday by the national highway traffic safety administration but 
said so many people are driving such vehicles that the safety 
standards should be almost as tight as they are for passenger cars 
the safety agency which has required headrests for cars since 
1969 said multipurpose passenger vehicles assembled after 
september 1991 would have to include the head supports 
the rules cover all trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight 
rating of 10000 pounds or less 
many manufacturers already include headrests in their vehicles 
the order was prompted partly by motorists widespread use of 
light trucks and vans as substitutes for passenger cars the 
traffic agency said in a statement 
whiplash injuries most often occur when a vehicle is struck from 
behind throwing the occupants heads back rehabilitation therapy 
for such injuries often lasts a year or longer the agency said 
nhtsa estimated the new requirements will reduce the severity of 
between 510 and 870 injuries each year it said nearly 18000 
whiplash injuries are reported each year 
these protections are not luxury options they are basic 
protections every family deserves said sen john c danforth 
rmo 
he said his legislation would also require that light trucks meet 
minimum roof and sideimpact standards be equipped with high 
centermount brake lights and carry air bags or automatic seat belts 
danforth said small trucks minivans and fourwheel drive 
vehicles now make up about onethird of passenger vehicles sold in 
the united states 
nearly 8300 americans were killed in lighttruck crashes in 
1988 he said

flight attendants couldnt open all the exit 
doors and threw passengers seat cushions for use as life preservers 
in the frantic evacuation of usair flight 5050 a flight attendants 
union spokeswoman says 
the floor of the plane buckled up and down like a roller 
coaster said cindy yeast of the association of flight attendants 
which gathered information thursday about the crash from its members 
assigned to the usair jetliner 
the flight attendants and cockpit crew were not made available to 
news media after the wednesday night crash at new yorks laguardia 
airport federal investigators indicated they also were having 
difficulty late thursday finding crew members in their effort to 
determine why the plane skidded off the end of the runway 
the condition of the airliner which broke into three pieces 
made it impossible for flight attendants to get all the exit doors 
open ms yeast said two people sitting in the back of the 
ninemonthold plane were killed 
when the flight attendants realized passengers were going into 
the water they ripped off seat bottom cushions and began throwing 
them out the door she said 
current rules call for life vests only on flights that go more 
than 50 miles over major bodies of water 
congress passed a law in 1987 requiring the federal aviation 
administration to make rules that would put life vests for all 
passengers on all flights by us carriers the faa has proposed but 
not implemented the rules 
flight attendants and pilots began petitioning the faa for

the senate will take up a legislation to 
prohibit burning the american flag in two weeks and will consider a 
proposed constitutional amendment after lawmakers return from their 
october recess 
the primary interest is not whether we should provide 
protection for the flag but what is the proper course to provide 
that protection sen strom thurmond rsc said after the 
judiciary committee sent the rival measures to the floor 
the committee by a 95 vote thursday approved the democratic 
statute to bar flag desecration but also voted 86 to send along 
with an unfavorable recommendation the amendment favored by 
president bush 
a july 14 agreement between congressional leaders required that 
both measures be sent to the floor lawmakers plan floor action on 
the bill as the last major item of business before the senate goes 
on its oct 6 recess and plans to take up the proposed amendment 
soon after its oct 16 return 
thurmond the committees ranking republican argued that the 
amendment as well as the proposed statute should get a favorable 
recommendation 
but joseph biden ddel the panels chairman and sponsor of the 
statute said the amendment does violence to the first amendment 
because it is so broad 
on sept 12 the house voted 38038 to approve a similar statute 
the house has not yet voted on a constitutional amendment 
the lawmakers are attempting to reverse the effects of a supreme 
court ruling in june that threw out a texas law used to convict 
flagburning protester gregory lee johnson 
democrats arguing against a change in the constitution said 
nationwide interest in the issue has subsided after an initial 
uproar sen howard metzenbaum dohio said some lawmakers were 
being driven by politics and fear 
there isnt any scourge of flag burning in this country 
metzenbaum said it isnt one of those issues that the american 
people are excited about 
yet he said we are seriously thinking of cutting back on the 
first amendment just to avoid giving our opponents an issue the 
bill of rights is being held hostage to negative advertising spots 
in the next election 
can you imagine this asked sen patrick j leahy dvt 
some creep who wants publicity burns the flag and we seriously 
think of changing the constitution

members of a blue ribbon commission on health 
care are pressing health secretary louis sullivan to speed up plans 
to relieve the worsening burden of health care costs for americans 
we cannot continue sitting around here looking at the 
problem weve got to find some solutions sen david pryor 
dark a member of the pepper commission told the secretary at a 
hearing thursday 
with 31 million worth of studies conducted for the department of 
health and human services last year theres enough evidence 
enough statistics for you to make recommendations within six 
months pryor said 
the commission comprised of 12 members of congress and three 
white house appointees is supposed to report its recommendations 
for a comprehensive health and longterm care plan by march 1 1990 
sullivan told the commission he has asked department officials to 
bring him recommendations by october 1990 on changes in health and 
longterm care financing 
but rep bill gradison rohio said there is no reason 
sullivans recommendations cant be ready at the same time that the 
commission puts its ideas on the table 
i dont see why it should take so long gradison said 
were not experts in this but you are 
we do share your sense of urgency sullivan told the 
commission formally called the us bipartisan commission on 
comprehensive health care which was created by congress last year 
several witnesses showed the needs of the uninsured and those who 
require longterm care by recounting their own medical horror 
stories for the commission 
pamela young of dickson tenn told the commission that in 1983 
when her husband was unemployed and uninsured the couple separated 
so she and her children could qualify for medicaid to help pay 
medical bills because of her daughters kidney condition three 
months later when the girls condition improved her husband moved 
back in with his family 
it seemed wrong to have the government foot that bill but it 
was the only way we could think of to assure that mary would get the 
medical care she needed to make her well ms young said 
greg nugent of phoenix ariz told of trying to get care for his 
3yearold son who had a malignant tumor in his head nugent was 
selfemployed but couldnt afford insurance when the child was 
diagnosed in 1986 and went through a lengthy nightmare before they 
eventually qualified for public medical assistance 
im broke i lost the house i nearly lost my family and im 
tired he said his voice cracking with emotion 
if this commission could do one thing it would be my request 
to provide this information to our leaders lets take care of our 
most important commodity the people of america and not treat them 
like dogs

this years big storm is hurricane hugo last 
year gilbert was a killer and over the years camille and hazel 
donna and agnes have been the culprits a naming system intended to 
give each storm a clear identity for the public 
the designations can irritate or please human owners of the 
names depending on the violence of the storm involved 
but the practice at least avoids confusion in issuing warnings 
about particular storms especially when more than one is under way 
such as the current situiation with both hurricane hugo and 
tropical storm iris active 
naming these storms is a practice of longstanding yet the 
current system has been common only since world war ii and it was 
modified about a decade ago to include male names 
using saints names taken from the day a storm struck was a 
common practice for several hundred years particularly in regions 
that have a strong spanish influence 
a storm which struck puerto rico on july 26 1825 for example 
became known as the santa ana storm 
for meteorologists a simple system of latitude and longitude 
coordinates is used to locate storms but that can be confusing to 
the public especially when there are two or even three storms at 
the same time 
clement wragge an australian meteorlogist active way back around 
the turn of the century may be have helped initiate the current 
system 
inclement wragge was a wellknown lecturer on the weather who 
began naming storms to help explain them to the public he chose the 
names of females for tropical storms the type we call hurricanes 
and he used male names for other types of storms 
often the male names were those of politicians that wragge did 
not care for and one of his earliest weather maps includes a storm 
called hackenbush reports ivan ray tannehill in his book the 
hurricane hunters 
during world war ii military meteorologists found themselves busy 
tracking hurricanes and to avoid confusion named them using the 
phonetic alphabet able baker charlie and so on 
other armed forces weathermen began applying nicknames to 
particular storms of all types they were tracking explained the 
late frank h forrester who was a marine corps weatherman in that 
era 
nicknames such as big jack or dopey were common but 
it was strictly informal believe me said forrester 
the use of womens names for hurricanes in recent years may stem 
from the book storm by george r stewart published in 1941 it 
tells of a weatherman who names storms after women 
as public interest in hurricanes increased in the early 1950s 
officials of the air force navy and weather bureau met to try and 
develop a new naming system this led to a system of female names 
starting in 1953 
the process of selecting the names was eventually shifted to the 
world meteorological organization in geneva switzerland and 
starting in 1978 male names were added alternating with females 
the world meteorological organization has lists of names that 
rotate over periods of four or five years to keep them from 
repeating too often in addition names of exceptionally damaging 
storms are retired to prevent historical confusion 
last year for example both gilbert and joan were retired when 
their turn comes around again they will be replaced by gordon and 
joyce

military post 
powell 52 was approved on a voice vote without debate or 
dissent he will replace adm william crowe jr who is scheduled to 
retire oct 1 after 43 years in the service 
powell served as national security adviser in the final years of 
president reagans administration 
at his confirmation hearing on wednesday before the senate armed 
services committee powell said cuts in the bush administrations 
budget request for various weapons programs could undermine the 
ussoviet pace on reducing strategic arms 
powell also said political changes in the soviet union should not 
lead to cuts in the star wars program landbased nuclear missiles 
or the b2 stealth bomber 
cuts approved by the house would completely unhinge the us 
negotiating position in the strategic arms reduction talks powell 
said 
without the b2 we no longer have the same start position that 
we did for the last several years and i believe it most unlikely 
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify he told the 
senators 
he said he supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs 
and in response to terrorist attacks and he said he was very 
hesitant to cut us troops in south korea europe and other 
overseas posts to satisfy current budget demands 
most recently powell was commander of the army forces command in 
fort macpherson ga responsible for the combat readiness of 1 
million troops on active reserve or national guard duty 
along with his predecessor as national security adviser frank 
carlucci powell was credited with helping the reagan white house 
recover from the irancontra affair he was a key figure in the 
planning of reagans national security strategy and for his summits 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
before moving to the nsc powell commanded the army v corps in 
west germany for six months earlier he was former defense 
secretary caspar weinbergers senior military assistant from 1983 
through 1986 
powell was born to jamaican immigrant parents in new york city 
and raised in the south bronx 
he was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 and got his first 
taste of the white house in 1972 as a white house fellow at the 
office of management and budget

and as an executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a 
division operations officer in 196869 he was awarded a purple 
heart for being wounded in combat and a bronze star for valor

caribbean island 
my father managed to get to a boat wednesday and radioed my 
brother and he only was on for a minute he said do whatever 
you can to get us out of here kim sorrelle said thursday my

besides the destruction from hurricane hugo a looting frenzy was 
reported on the island which still lacks water power and telephone 
service us troops began patrolling the island thursday under 
orders from president bush to restore order 
my father said its total anarchy sorrelle said the 
island is completely destroyed 
she said her parents bruce and mary langlois told of seeing a 
local national guard soldier use his gun to break the lock of a 
jewelry store to loot and that people were firing rifles from 
rooftops

republican senators following marathon 
bargaining with democrats are taking a new plan for financing the 
war on drugs to the white house for inspection by the bush 
administration 
the blueprint which sources said includes a 03 percent 
acrosstheboard cut in federal spending programs to raise money for 
the drug war could not be called a tentative agreement republicans 
said thursday 
the sources who asked not to be identified by name also said 
the plan contained some of the selected cuts in spending cuts in 
spending the bush administration had wanted as a way to offset 
increases in the drug program 
republicans indicated that white house chief of staff john sununu 
had not agreed to the proposal in phone conversations thursday and 
added there was no deal without administration approval 
republicans said they would take the plan to the white house 
friday and then reconvene their negotiations with the democrats 
while senators declined to comment on specifics sources said the 
acrosstheboard cut envisioned in the proposal would amount to 03 
percent that would be an increase from a 2875 percent reduction in 
a plan that republicans carried into the negotiating session 
thursday afternoon 
under the republican plan presented at the start of the session 
all but 23 million of an 850 million increase in the drug war 
would have been funded with money raised through an acrossthe board 
cut 
that increase would have come on top of the 79 billion proposed 
by bush 
selected spending cuts under the new version would be determined 
at the committee level sources said democrats are planning 
something similar to that but on a larger scale in the house 
agreement on some financing plan for the antidrug effort is 
needed to stop a republican blockade of spending bills on the senate 
floor before the start of the next fiscal year oct 1 when they 
will be needed to pay for the operations of the government 
four spending bills are awaiting passage in the senate and eight 
others are in the pipeline 
gop senators have been holding up passage for a week to bring 
pressure on the democrats who control both houses of congress to 
negotiate on how to finance the drug plan 
senators of both parties negotiated late into thursday night in 
an effort to get an agreement and start the money bills moving again 
bush called for a 79 billion antidrug program but democrats 
led by sen robert c byrd dwva said the administration did not 
go far enough they proposed boosting the spending by 22 billion 
with most of the additional money going for treatment education and 
prevent 
the increase would have been funded with money raised through a 
05 percent acrosstheboard cut in all federal programs 
the bush administration opposed the plan saying it would hit too 
deeply at the defense department budget the democrats would have 
require a 18 billion reduction in pentagon spending 
in such cases however accounts used to pay military personnel 
are exempted from the cut 
republicans in negotiations earlier this week offered to add 800 
million with 600 million for treatment and 200 million for local 
law enforcement it would have been funded in part with a 25 
percent cut across the board but they insisted on raising the 
remainder of the money with offsetting cuts in a few selected 
programs 
maintaining that all of the money should come from 
acrosstheboard cuts the democrats on wednesday night fashioned a 
1 billion offer

this historic city has survived the 
ravages of earthquake battle and storm in its storied 
300yearhistory but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in 
hurricane hugo 
the storm packing winds of up to 135 mph raged into charleston 
thursday night 
this is a dangerous killer hurricane the likes of which few 
people who have lived all their lives in charleston have 
experienced warned mayor joseph p riley jr 
hugo was the first major hurricane to strike charleston since 
hurricane gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959 
the seaside community has suffered through many disasters both 
natural and manmade 
the worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore 
through the city killing 32 people injuring hundreds and causing 
an estimated 2 million in property damage 
charleston a city of pastelcolored antebellum structures lining 
quaint streets and alleyways is where the civil war began in 1861 
the city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any 
number of smaller hurricanes politely referred to by charlestonians 
of refinement as september gales 
but the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the 
hot night of aug 31 1886 when the ground rumbled in what some 
folks thought was a prelude to judgement day 
the great charleston earthquake was felt as far away as chicago 
and new york city 
measuring 77 on the richter scale of ground motion the 
earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives destroyed 102 buildings 
and tossed most of the citys 14000 chimneys into the streets 
in recent years the city has attracted millions of visitors 
annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine 
sand beaches 
charleston has received international acclaim as home to spoleto 
festival usa founded by composer gian carlo menotti organizers 
like to refer to spoleto as the worlds most comprehensive arts 
festival

the post identified pressler as a civil court judge and a leader 
of a fundamentalist movement within the southern baptist convention

initiative 
the administration wants to rush legislation through congress in 
the next week or so to make money available in time for nicaraguas

more than a dozen government lawsuits alleging 
age discrimination by employers may have to be dismissed unless 
congress restores protections overturned by the supreme court a 
government lawyer says 
charles a shanor general counsel of the equal employment 
opportunity commission testified thursday at a house hearing in 
support of legislation to reverse a june ruling that bias in fringe 
benefits is not automatically banned under the age discrimination in 
employment act 
the high court ruled 72 that federal law bans biased benefit 
plans only where the disparities are part of an attempt to 
discriminate in some nonfringebenefit aspect of employment 
such as hiring or firing 
shanor said the eeoc has more than 30 cases pending in courts 
around the country in which it alleges that employers discriminated 
against older workers by limiting their fringe benefits 
we estimate that over half of these cases would require 
dismissal absent remedial legislation shanor told a joint 
hearing of the house select committee on aging and two education and 
labor subcommittees

conservative lawmakers are counting on their 
house allies and a sympathetic president to tone down eased abortion 
restrictions adopted by the senate 
outnumbered antiabortion senators offered little resistance 
thursday as the senate by voice vote agreed to allow federal aid for 
abortions for pregnancies threatening a womans life or caused by 
rape or incest 
the expansion of the governments role in paying for abortions 
was included in a measure providing 1574 billion for health 
education and labor programs for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
final passage of the bill and other spending measures was blocked 
by republicans as the two parties worked on an unrelated antidrug 
package 
current law limits federal assistance for abortions to pregnant 
women whose lives are endangered president bush has promised to 
veto an expansion of that restriction and the house last year 
refused to stretch the limits further 
house conferees have been very adamant on that point in past 
years and id expect them to be the same this year said sen 
gordon humphrey rnh referring to house negotiators who will 
seek a compromise with their senate counterparts 
prochoice advocates said the vote showed congressional momentum 
was shifting their way but they conceded that based on last years 
experience and bushs veto promise it will be difficult for the 
senate language to be enacted 
this is the beginning of a very slow road back to where women 
who desperately need access to reproductive health care will have 
access to it said pat reuss lobbyist for the womens equity 
action league 
though they lost ground on abortion conservatives won points 
elsewhere in the legislation 
the senate voted 953 for language sponsored by sen jesse helms 
rnc blocking federal money for public education on aids to 
states that dont require authorities or doctors to notify people 
whose spouses are found to be infected with the aids virus the bill 
provides 1958 million for the initiative 
lawmakers decided by voice vote to bar federal financing of 
materials for school children which promote or encourage 
homosexuality or use words stating that homosexuality is normal 
or natural or healthy the measure was introduced by humphrey 
senators voted 990 to prohibit the use of federal aid to buy 
hypodermic needles for illegal drug users or bleach to clean the 
needles unless the president certifies that the efforts are 
effective 
by another 990 tally they adopted a compromise permitting 
federal aid for telling people how to limit the risk of getting 
aids the measure allows references to safe ways of engaging in 
sexual acts as well as the risks of engaging in promiscuous sex and 
intravenous drug abuse 
the legislation also provides 16 billion for aids research and 
treatment 370 million more than this year 12 billion for added 
child care programs and 237 billion for education 1 billion 
above this years level 
earlier this summer congress passed legislation easing abortion 
restrictions in washington dc despite a bush veto threat 
the senate last year voted 7319 for the same language it 
considered thursday after negotiations with the house the final 
version only allowed federal aid for pregnant women whose health was 
at risk 
this years house version of the bill passed aug 2 has the 
same abortion language as current law 
since 1981 congress has limited abortion aid under the medicaid 
program for the poor to women whose pregnancies are threatening 
their lives 
there were 72 abortions involving rape or incest financed by the 
federal government in 1979 the last year for which reliable figures 
are available according to a survey by the private alan guttmacher 
institute 
in fiscal 1987 the most recent year for which figures are 
available the federal government paid for 322 abortions nationwide 
at a cost of 160000 the institute says the study found that the 
same year states paid for 189000 abortions 
there are an estimated 16 million legal abortions in the united 
states annually

chinas top entrepreneur said today there are 
still good profits to be made in the communist nation and he is 
optimistic foreign investors will return despite the crackdown on 
prodemocracy activists 
rong yiren chairman of the china international trust and 
investment corp said it will take up to three years for china to 
overcome its economic problems he also expressed confidence that 
his company a target of recent government investigations would 
continue to prosper 
rong 73 spoke to reporters as his company knowns as citic 
prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of its founding as a highly 
independent investment firm under the auspices of the state council 
or cabinet 
he said chinas economic difficulties were excessive growth 20 
percent inflation energy and raw materials shortages and 
profiteering but he said the problems had eased somewhat under a 
government austerity program that severely restricted spending and 
put new marketoriented reforms on hold 
my view is that in the future the situation may be a little 
better but it may take two or three years rong said 
he said his company also is facing a tough year and profits could 
be down from the record 646 million of last year 
but he stressed that the recent government drive to reorganize or 
shut down some freewheeling investment and trade corporations 
accused of profiteering and corruption have nothing to do with 
citic 
rong said the company paid a 5 million fine imposed by the 
government last month after a 10month investigation into illegal 
trading in foreign exchange reselling production materials at a 
profit and evading taxes 
foreign enthusiasm for new investment projects in china has been 
dampened by the recent austerity measures and political instability 
and tensions following the military suppression of the studentled 
democracy movement 
rong said china international was pushing ahead with foreign 
investment and recently signed an agreement with italian and south 
korean companies to set up a plastics manufacturing plant in hong 
kong 
the company also owns a bank in hong kong and has bought into 
cathay pacific airlines an aluminum smelter in australia a pulp 
mill in canada timber in the us northwest real estate in arizona 
and a steel plant in delaware 
inside china much of its investment goes to heavy industry 
although its 23 subsidiaries are involved in the banking real 
estate trade travel hotel and publishing industries 
rong scion of one of precommunist chinas most wealthy 
families worked as a janitor during the ultraleftist cultural 
revolution 
chinas senior leader deng xiaoping asked him to put his 
capitalist skills to work when china international was formed in 
1979 to attract foreign funds 
although not a communist party member rong today is vice 
chairman of the national peoples congress the nations 
legislature and chairs the allchina federation of industry and 
commerce

a soviet official issued a public but 
conditional invitation today for vice premier and labor party leader 
shimon peres to visit the soviet union 
such a trip would be another step in renewing ties between israel 
and moscow but several supposed invitations issued recently by 
soviet officials have ended in canceled trips and embarrassment for 
the israelis 
henrich borovik head of a soviet trade group that met peres in 
new york on thursday was the first soviet official to make a public 
invitation to an israeli government minister peres confirmed the 
invitation in a radio interview from new york 
we are inviting mr shimon peres as our guest to moscow 
borovik said in a statement broadcast on israel radio today 
borovik is a member of the permanent committee of foreign 
relations of the supreme soviet but he issued the invitation on 
behalf of the nongovernmental soviet peace committee he heads and 
said that group would have to approve it 
i think he peres has a good chance i already said that 
my personal invitation he already got but we certainly have to 
discuss it on the bureau of the soviet peace commitee i hope that 
they will react positively 
the invitation was extended after a 45minute meeting with the 
fourmember soviet trade delegation the radio said 
peres interviewed in new york told israel radio 
ive received an invitation and i think there is an opening for 
economic relations between israel and the soviet union the areas 
that interest us and them are agriculture medicine air traffic and 
tourism we have a lot to discuss 
we found a great deal to discuss together to contribute to our 
economies and eventually to peace in the area and peace in the 
world peres added but i always believe its better to talk 
after the deed is done 
earlier this month agriculture minister avraham katzoz invited 
by two of his counterparts from soviet republics canceled a trip 
after authorities in moscow denied him a visa 
on aug 16 a spokesman for trade minister ariel sharon said 
sharon was invited to the soviet union by his soviet georgian 
counterpart who was visiting israel at the time sharon was due to 
leave for georgia in october but then the soviet foreign ministry 
denied any invitation was issued 
the soviets say renewal of diplomatic ties with israel depends on 
progress in the middle east peace process moscow and all other 
eastern european states apart from romania cut diplomatic relations 
with israel following the 1967 middle east war to protest israels 
seizure of land from moscows arab allies 
israel and the soviet union have exchanged lowlevel diplomatic 
missions in the last three years this week hungary became the 
first east bloc nation to renew full diplomatic ties with israel

suit against journalist seymour hersh 
attorney cyriac kappil said thursday he was giving kissinger the 
opportunity to appear voluntarily before invoking a subpoena of the 
former secretary of state who was the subject of hershs 1983 book 
the price of power 
kappil also said he was considering using a videotaped deposition 
made by kissinger if he was unsuccessful in procuring his direct 
testimony 
morarji desai indias prime minister from 1977 to 1979 has 
accused hersh of defamation for presenting desai as a paid cia 
informant in the book 
hersh testified on thursday that while he made some biographical 
mistakes about desai in the book he was convinced of desais role 
with the cia 
the thing thats important there is to know the sources were 
sources i had the utmost confidence in hersh testified that 
was the driving force behind what i wrote 
hersh acknowledged errors of fact among them the mispelling of 
desais first name and the year in which indira gandhi desais 
rival returned to power in india 
the mistakes which are not the subject of the lawsuit were made 
in the first printing of the book but corrected in later editions

informant for the cia acknowledged that in two 1983 interviews he 
had said there were only two sources for this information 
under questioning hersh declined to reveal the name of one 
source an indian foreign service officer in washington dc hersh 
said he submitted part of his manuscript prior to publication to the 
source for verification of its accuracy 
under us libel law desais attorneys must convince the 
sixmember jury that hersh knowingly printed false negligent or 
malicious material

for his articles exposing the my lai massacre in vietnam he was 
also a reporter for the associated press and the new york times

the aids virus is able to use one of the bodys 
major disease fighters to help overwhelm the immune system and leave 
the patient unprotected against infection according to a new study 
in a report published today in science dr michael k hoffman of 
the sloankettering institute said experiments in his laboratory 
show that an antibody made by the immune system to attack the aids 
virus is turned by the virus into a weapon against the immune system 
itself 
the finding said hoffman suggests that some types of vaccine 
against the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv that causes aids 
could actually help the disease instead of protecting the body 
in terms of vaccination our data provides some alarming news 
because you would have to realize if you immunize with a vaccine 
you also produce antibodies that might be rather harmful he said

children may be safer from injury at daycare 
centers than at home according to a researcher who suggests that 
more attention to playground hazards could reduce injury rates 
a study of injuries at atlanta daycare centers revealed a lower 
overall death rate for children at daycare centers than children at 
home 
dr jeffrey sacks a medical epidemiologist at the centers for 
disease control in atlanta noted that of the 27 children under 5 
years old who died from injuries in the last 6 months of 1987 none 
were in childcare 
parents have always had the bad news that kids in day care are 
at increased risk of infectious disease sacks said heres some 
good news for a change they are probably at less risk of injury and 
death from injury than they are when theyre not at day care 
sacks and his colleagues studied 143 injuries among 5300 
children at 71 atlanta daycare centers between june 1987 and may 
1988 centers reported any injury that required medical or dental 
attention to the researchers whose study was published in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
the researchers said that 35 percent of children in day care 
could be expected to be injured at the center in a given year they 
extrapolated from their data that if children were to stay at day 
care 24 hours a day 365 days a year 14 percent would incur an 
injury 
a typical injury rate for children in a community in one year 
is about 35 percent sacks said that suggests to us that 
children in child care are probably safer than when they are in the 
community at large 
dr george stern a new orleans pediatrician said although he 
hadnt seen the new study there is a certain amount of logic to 
it 
in a wellsupervised daycare center the environment has been 
looked at for hazards probably more than in the average home said 
stern who edited a daycare manual for the american academy of 
pediatrics 
and many children who are at home do not get the amount of 
ongoing supervision as a child does in a daycare center he said 
in a telephone interview 
in the atlanta study most injuries 58 percent were caused by 
falls and 685 percent were head injuries the study said 54 percent 
of the injuries occurred outside and outside accidents accounted 
for 76 percent of the most serious injuries 
the high number of playground injuries could be cut with a few 
simple measures including the installation of impactabsorbing 
surfaces such as wood chips or sand sacks suggested 
the researchers found that injuries were more likely to occur in 
the summer than the winter on monday and friday than in the middle 
of the week and between the hours of 11 am and noon and 4 pm 
and 5 pm 
they suggested that increased supervision during those periods 
could lower injury rates

the number of texas bank closings this year has 
tied last years total and more failures are on the way experts 
said 
texas banking commissioner kenneth littlefield closed rose 
capital bank in tyler on thursday the 113th failure this year 
analysts said more closings are on the way perhaps as a slower 
pace as the industry continues to suffer from the real estate and 
energy depressions 
i had projected earlier in the year that we would likely have 
100 independent bank failures littlefield said he noted that the 
113 include more than 44 from two large bankholding companies 
we believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in the 
number of independently chartered banks that fail littlefield 
said predicting about 80 next year 
we will continue to have bank failures for two more years as 
a result of past lending decisions littlefield said 
the worst is behind texas banks said sandy flannigan a 
houstonbased analyst for painewebber inc 
nationally the numbers should remain about the same next year 
according to alan whitney a spokesman for the federal deposit 
insurance corp in washington dc 
rose capital was the 160th failure this year in the country said 
whitney who noted that 10 banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981 
and we thought it was armageddon 
since then the numbers have grown each year 42 in 1982 48 in 
83 80 in 84 120 in 85 138 in 86 184 in 87 and 200 last year 
the failures will continue whitney said even though the 
economy in texas and other parts of the southwest has begun to 
stabilize somewhat because changes in the banking industry always 
lag from 18 months to 24 months 
littlefield said rose capital was closed because asset quality 
problems and resulting losses attributed to the areas poor 
economic condition 
the bank which had assets of 646 million and deposits of about 
611 million was purchased by first city bancorp of texas inc 
for 25000 
first city will also purchase about 464 million of rose 
capitals assets 
the fdic will provide 168 million in assistance and retain 
assets with a book value of 182 million the bank was to reopen 
today

while most hospitals follow uniform guidelines in 
disposing of infectious medical waste the offices of doctors 
dentists and other health care providers form a vast unregulated 
source of potentially harmful waste medical researchers say 
the volume of medical waste produced by these other facilities 
could exceed the 6000 tons of refuse churned out daily by 
hospitals according to a report in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
the researchers said onefourth of the states dont regulate how 
clinics dispose of their waste while in about half the states 
doctors and dentists offices fall outside the regulations 
there are 278000 private doctors and dentists offices 16400 
nursing homes and thousands of walkin surgery centers dialysis 
centers and blood banks across the nation 
in contrast to the lack of control over these facilities 44 
states regulate hospitals and the survey found that 82 percent of 
the hospitals responding said they complied with disposal guidelines 
developed by the federal centers for disease control 
seventyfive percent of the hospitals in the survey complied with 
waste disposal guidelines set by the us environmental protection 
agency which has a broader classification of infectious waste than 
the cdc 
i think its generally good news that the vast majority of 
hospitals are in compliance with the cdc and epa recommendations 
said dr william rutala administrative director of the department 
of hospital epidemiology of north carolina memorial hospital in 
chapel hill i believe it indicates the seriousness with which 
hospitals manage their medical waste 
rutala led the team of researchers who compiled the study 
he said that even in cases of noncompliance no hospital could 
identify an infection problem excluding needlestick injuries that 
was attributable to the disposal of infectious waste 
problems relating to medical waste disposal have come to public 
attention due to concerns about the spread of the aids virus and 
several highly publicized incidents in august 1987 several hundred 
tons of garbage including syringes and other medical waste 
washed ashore on new jersey beaches 
the researchers said that at a minimum the epa should 
spearhead a coordinated and consistent interstate approach to 
infectious waste management 
rutala said the survey data came from questionnaires sent in july 
1987 and january 1988 to 441 randomly selected hospitals in 48 
states 
infectious waste accounts for 15 percent of the total hospital 
waste the study said the american hospital association estimates 
that us hospitals spend as much as 466 million per year to 
dispose of such waste

amid the uproar of live coverage by the 
major networks and scores of other media organizations national 
hurricane center forecasters went about their business of monitoring 
hurricane hugo 
the whole system looks chaotic but it works said bob 
sheets the centers director 
on one side of a large room dominated by a ushaped bank of 
monitoring equipment were the forecasters making meticulous 
calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and 
getting emergency operations going in those areas 
on the other side were the media a pack of reporters camera 
operators and technicians jockeying for seconds of sheets time and 
tidbits of his expertise 
in the center was sheets himself surrounded by cameras wires 
and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones the ubiquitous 
redheaded meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to 
a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of hurricane hugo 
during prime news time competing technicians and cameramen shout 
and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of 
sheets 
at his back casually dressed forecasters who have been working 
12hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites 
we obviously dont like this and could probably do a better 
job but everyone knows now because of the media said hurricane 
specialist max mayfield in the caribbean we were not so certain 
the word got out but we know the carolinas have been evacuated 
when a hurricane warning goes into effect its a 50 million 
statement said meteorologist joel cline referring to the cost of 
emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented 
when the warning is posted 
if we werent here then you wouldnt know that a storm was out 
there he said before the hurricane warning system was 
established a storm of hugos power would have cost thousands of 
lives but early today after days of warnings and proper evacuation 
procedures there were no immediate reports of deaths despite 
widespread damage in charleston and other coastal areas of south 
carolina 
i like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives 
are concerned cline said 
after hugos landfall sheets and the other forecasters began to 
wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last 
several days but he warned the hurricane center still is 
following three other weather systems that have moved into the 
atlantic between the united states and africa and another storm in 
the pacific 
i hate to say were breathing a sigh of relief because people 
are getting clobbered to death meteorologist mark zimmer said as 
the storm pounded charleston sc but weve done all we can

refugees from the violent suppression of chinas 
prodemocracy movement today began the first meeting of a new 
opposition party in exile 
european politicians and artists were among about 500 people 
attending the threeday meeting of the federation for democracy in 
china held at sorbonne university 
participants observed a moment of silence to honor prodemocracy 
demonstrators who died june 34 when soldiers marched on beijing to 
crush the studentled movement hundreds and perhaps thousands 
were killed 
no one will think of freedom or democracy or remember 1989 
without recalling the courage and strength shown by those people on 
tiananmen square said paddy ashdown of britains liberal 
democratic party referring to the central beijing square where 
students staged prodemocracy protests 
what you have done has been an inspiration to us what you will 
do is a hope for the future the lawmaker said 
among those in the crowd were photographer henri cartierbresson 
and actor yves montand who told reporters he came to support the 
battle for human rights 
but how can they in exile he said the answer is like 
this this is the first chapter 
during the meeting prominent chinese exiles including former 
communist party members artists intellectuals students and 
businesspeople plan to establish rules for the federation a main 
office in paris will have branches in north america and asia 
many of those involved say the federation could serve as the 
basis for an effective opposition party to communist rule in china 
if conditions ever permit the exiles to go home 
wan runan chinas most influential independent business 
executive until the violent suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement june 34 predicted the exiles will go home within 10 years 
we have a large number of elites among us with lots of 
influence in china we also have millions of overseas chinese who 
are uniting to support the movement he said 
we can make a great impact on developments in china even though 
we are in exile weve left our traces in the system the second we 
raise any issue there will be a lot of followers back home wan 
said 
the federation hopes to mobilize more than 35 million chinese 
living in taiwan hong kong the united states and elsewhere to keep 
pressure on authorities in beijing for economic and political reform 
just as a company who desires success must satisfy its 
customers so any political organization has to satisfy its people 
in this belief we certainly have support said wan who formerly 
led the beijing stone group computer company 
the company was a model for many of the quasiindependent 
companies set up under an economic reform program that has been in 
trouble since last fall when the government announced austerity 
measures to combat inflation and excessive growth 
the federation will push for international economic sanctions to 
intensify chinas economic difficulties and with that force the 
government toward political change 
chen yizi an influential adviser to ousted communist party 
leader zhao ziyang and the most senior official known to have 
escaped to the west after the crackdown said economic conditions in 
the country continue to deteriorate 
he said inflation in the first six months of the year ran at an 
annual rate of 35 percent in the biggest cities and 28 percent 
nationwide 
as china moves away from an economy that responds to market 
forces and back to centralized control wages will suffer chen said 
during the decade that chen headed chinas institute for economic 
structural reform one of three influential think tanks per capita 
wages rose 260 percent for peasants and 70 percent for urban workers 
he predicted that under a return to centralized economy policies 
chinas gross national product would decline and consumer goods 
would become scarce 
there is and will continue to be widespread dissatisfaction 
chen said the next decade will see fundamental changes in china 
within 20 years we will have a firmly established democratic 
process and this federation will play a key role in that

gay rights activists and other longtime backers of 
us rep barney frank gathered in boston to support the embattled 
congressman in the face of an investigation into his involvement 
with a male prostitute 
a joint statement issued thursday by the 13 local and national 
groups endorsed frank arguing that the congressman has been 
unfairly tarnished because he is gay similar scandals involving 
heterosexuals have been much shorter lived in the news media the 
groups claimed 
much of the discussion of this matter has centered on barneys 
acknowledged homosexuality said steven tierney cochairman of 
the massachusetts gay and lesbian political caucus who read the 
joint statement 
the groups endorsing frank included the national organization for 
women the massachusetts womens caucus the gay and lesbian 
advocates and defenders and the aids action committee 
they said frank is entitled to a fair hearing before the house 
ethics committee 
congressman frank welcomes expressions of support said doug 
cahn a spokesman for frank 
several frank supporters said that franks behavior in his 
acknowledged affair with male prostitute stephen l gobie and his 
admitted solicitation of other male prostitutes had to be weighed 
against his record in congress 
this happened two to four years ago said robert wheatley a 
retired unitarian universalist minister barney has already gotten 
his act together he was honest and forthright and he said he made a 
mistake

rockwell international corp is suing the 
government claiming conflicting federal rules require it to violate 
hazardous waste disposal laws at the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant 
we have taken todays action only because we are caught in the 
middle of an intergovernmental feud for which no satisfactory 
resolution has been found donald r beall rockwell chairman and 
chief executive officer said in a news release issued thursday in 
denver after the suit was filed 
the lawsuit which names the government the justice department 
the department of energy and the environmental protection agency 
asks the court to clarify the obligations of rockwell and the 
government in the operation of the plant 
rockwell operates the plant 16 miles northwest of denver under a 
contract with doe rocky flats produces plutonium triggers for 
nuclear weapons and employs about 6000 workers 
the rockwell lawsuit focuses on plutonium recovery operations 
the application of land disposal restrictions to mixed wastes and 
the handling of recycled water 
doe spokesman ben mccarty based at rocky flats said the agency 
was surprised by the lawsuit but declined to comment further epa 
spokesman nat miullo in denver also declined to comment 
the civil lawsuit filed in us district court in washington 
dc is the latest development in an ongoing series of problems at 
the weapons plant involving disposal of hazardous wastes 
in june federal agents raided the plant as part of an 
investigation into allegations of illegal hazardous waste disposal 
a special federal grand jury is considering evidence in that case 
but has issued no indictments 
federal law prohibits storage of hazardous wastes at a production 
site for more than 90 days but there is no federally approved 
disposal site or treatment process for rocky flats wastes 
rockwell has been stockpiling wastes at rocky flats since idaho 
gov cecil andrus refused to accept further shipments bound for a 
temporary storage dump in idaho earlier this year the government 
plans to open an underground repository near carlsbad nm but 
that has been delayed pending further studies 
on friday rockwell threatened to close the plant unless 
hazardous waste regulations were clarified citing a concern over 
the potential for criminal prosecution later that day doe epa and 
state officials announced a plan to resolve the problems over the 
next year 
but beall said assurances that the company wont face criminal 
prosecution because of the regulation conflicts are insufficient 
considering the investigations already under way 
as an example of the conflicting regulations rockwell cited the 
plutonium residues which are stored at the plant for recycling and 
reuse under doe rules but the lawsuit said the justice department 
and epa claim the residues actually are wastes which are stored 
illegally under epa rules

armenian newspapers couldnt publish their latest 
editions because a blockade by the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan has cut off their supply of paper the communist party 
newspaper pravda reported today 
the newspapers printed thursday in the armenian capital yerevan 
would have carried major news the shakeup in the communist partys 
ruling politburo that replaced conservatives with key players in the 
reform programs of president mikhail s gorbachev 
pravda denounced the azerbaijani action saying it is 
difficult to believe that in our socialist government one of the 
union republics could find itself in an encircling economic 
blockade 
soviet press accounts earlier blamed the cutoff in freight 
shipments to armenia on striking azerbaijani railway workers 
more than 100 people have died in ethnic violence in the southern 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan in the past 19 months mosly 
because of a territorial dispute over nagornokarabakh a largely 
armenian area within azerbaijan 
the main rail and road routes to armenia pass through azerbaijan 
and pravda said today those routes remain closed even basic 
foodstuffs such as pasta and rice have disappeared in yerevan it 
said 
the workers of the republic are finding themselves unwilling 
strikers because their factories have been forced to shut down 
for lack of raw materials pravda said 
even the print shop of armenias communist party central 
committee has not received a shipment of newsprint since aug 26 
the labor newspaper trud said 
pravda said restoration in the area of armenia devastated by last 
years earthquake has halted and that a team of norwegians was 
preparing to give up its construction of a 200bed hospital and go 
home because it has been waiting for their supplies for months 
on thursday evening more than 100 armenians in moscow broke the 
ban on demonstrations on red square to protest being driven from 
their homes in baku the capital of azerbaijan 
witnesses said moscow police cordoned off the vast square 
adjacent to the kremlin preventing other armenians from joining the 
protest and keeping foreign and soviet tourists from the area it 
was not clear if the police forced the demonstrators to leave

a relative of a movie executive 
testified she was thrown against a car and jailed by the same 
policeman who arrested zsa zsa gabor for driving with expired auto 
license tags 
i thought he was going to kill me defense witness melanie 
jonkers said thursday during the ninth day of miss gabors criminal 
copslapping trial she frequently broke into tears while recalling 
the alleged confrontation with officer paul kramer 
he grabbed my arm threw me across the trunk of the car and 
handcuffed me said mrs jonkers the sisterinlaw of orion 
pictures chief michael medavoy 
mrs jonkers who lives with her husband and 2yearold daughter 
in arlington va had been pulled over by kramer last on oct 13 
because her child wasnt strapped in a car seat as required by state 
law 
it was so unnecessary she said of the encounter and my 
daughter is still suffering from it every time she hears 
sirens she says is that the mean man coming to take mommy away 
 
before she was arrested by kramer mrs jonkers testified that 
she desperately tried to flag down a passing car for help defense 
lawyer william graysen asked what she wanted a passing motorist to 
do 
for them to call the police she said 
mrs jonkers hired a lawyer to file suit against kramer but the 
attorney said it would be a difficult case because you cant fight 
city hall she came forward after hearing of the gabor case she 
said because officer kramer is still harassing people 
the testimony was a departure from the oftenfrivolous answers by 
miss gabor who concluded her third day on the stand thursday 
deputy district attorney elden fox replayed for jurors a 
videotape showing miss gabor using foul language during a phone call 
from the city jail 
after repeated questioning about her cursing miss gabor said 
mr fox im an old lady when im hit by a 6foot6 cop with a 
gun mr kramer used every expletive word there is i said 
the word because i learned it from your wonderful police 
department 
during the lunch recess miss gabor said she was relieved to have 
finished her testimony saying this is not nazi germany but this 
trial sounds like it she cried during mrs jonkers recollection 
of the october arrest 
miss gabor faces a possible 18month jail sentence if convicted 
of misdemeanor battery on a police officer disobeying an officers 
orders driving with an expired license and having an open container 
of alcohol a flask of jack daniels whiskey in the glove 
compartment in her car 
miss gabor doesnt deny slapping kramer but insists she lashed 
out in selfdefense after the motorcycle officer cursed her and 
dragged her from her rollsroyce on june 14 when he spotted expired 
registration tags on the car 
graysen said he expects to complete his case by monday and 
expects jury deliberations to begin tuesday

british jewish officials today welcomed a letter 
from cardinal jozef glemp the primate of poland in which he 
changed his position on a disputed convent at auschwitz and said it 
should be moved 
the letter appeared to reflect a radical change of heart on 
glemps part 
he wrote that he now realized that the shrill voices and 
aggression in the campaign against the convent at the nazi death 
camp in southern poland did not represent world jewry 
auschwitz should never be a place of controversy glemps 
letter said 
on tuesday tha vatican issued a statement saying the convent 
should be moved 
the primate had opposed moving the convent despite an agreement 
between catholic cardinals and jewish leaders that the carmelite 
nuns would moved to an interfaith cultural center to be built 
further away from the site of the camp 
the letter was made public by sir sigmund sternberg a 
philanthropist who heads the international council of christians and 
jews glemp handed the letter to sternberg at a dinner at the polish 
embassy in london on tuesday 
it said it is essential not only to move the convent outside 
the perimeter of the site but also to set up the new cultural 
center 
asked if this meant an end to the controversy hayim pinner 
secretary general of the board of deputies of british jews said 
it doesnt put an end to it the controversy will be at end when 
the convent is moved as promised by the agreement signed in 
geneva in 1987 
but pinner told the associated press the letter shows a better 
understanding on the part of those who so far have not been ready to 
implement the agreement its progress and we hope that it will now 
be implemented 
shimon cohen a spokesman for the chief rabbi of britain lord 
immanuel jakobovits said the letter will undoubtedly be a 
substantial contribution to restoring catholicjewish harmony 
the convent has angered many jews who suspect the catholic church 
of trying to insert itself into what they regard as a jewish 
catastrophe of the 4 million who died at auschwitz 25 million 
were jews 
the geneva agreement said the convent should be moved by feb 22 
this year but the deadline passed and last month the archbishop of 
krakow cardinal franciszek macharski said the church was 
abrogating the accord because it could not be implemented in an 
atmosphere of aggressive demands 
glemp has steadfastly defended the nuns right to choose their 
own course of action and his recent pronouncements on the issue 
have included remarks that many interpreted as antisemitic 
glemp arrived in britain on tuesday to consecrate a polish 
catholic church on the same day the vatican came out in support of 
building the interfaith center and offered financing 
there has been a great deal of ill feelings and 
misunderstanding which we would like to clear up glemps letter 
said it referred to a letter to sternberg from polish prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki which acknowledged the uniqueness of the 
jewish experience under the nazis 
referring to sternbergs intercession glemp wrote until you 
sent your messages i was unaware of the moderating voices therefore 
i was glad that some of the shrill voices do not reflect the 
feelings of world jewry and aggression is not part of jewish 
philosophy 
mazowieckis letter invited sternberg to poland and glemp said 
he would then be pleased to meet you and discuss with you the 
speedy implementation of the geneva declaration

troops patrolled st croix to restore order after hurricane hugo 
brought chaos to the island officials said it appeared the troops 
had curbed rampant looting 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting 
and other lawlessness associated with the destruction it is 
impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be 
there 
it appeared that most stores had been cleaned out before the 
troops began arriving thursday one local official defended the 
looters as desperate people left homeless and hungry by hugos 
devastation sunday 
the storm struck the us mainland late thursday blasting south 
carolina with 135 mph winds and leveling dozens of buildings it was 
downgraded to a tropical storm this morning with winds of 70 mph and 
was expected to weaken further as it moved northward up the east 
coast 
the marine radio band monitored on nearby st thomas said 
thursday that two looters were shot in st croix but there was no 
word of their condition or independent confirmation officials said 
some looters were local national guardsmen 
sixty fbi agents 50 federal marshals and 150 soldiers of the 
18th airborne corps from fort bragg nc arrived thursday with 
orders from president bush to restore calm to the popular vacation 
spot 
the rest of the 1200person fort bragg unit composed mostly of 
military police was due to be in place by today said lt col ned 
longsworth the units spokesman we are authorized to make 
arrests only in the total absence of local authorities he said 
the troops are the first active duty military personnel sent onto 
the nations streets in 20 years adm william j crowe chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff said in washington they were ordered to 
shoot if necessary to defend themselves 
a navy destroyer was anchored off christiansted st croixs 
biggest city on the northern coast and two coast guard cutters were 
off frederiksted on the southern coast 
us army c141 transport planes flew in and out of the airport 
while coast guard helicopters buzzed over the two towns where most 
of the islands of 55000 people live 
hurricane hugo left at least 26 people dead in the caribbean the 
storm was responsible for at least one death on st croix where it 
destroyed or severely damaged most homes on the island 70 miles 
east of puerto rico 
bush on thursday declared the virgin islands and puerto rico 
federal disaster areas making them eligible for emergency relief 
money 
roads were littered with debris in christiansted where hundreds 
of people lined up thursday behind water tank trucks with buckets 
and jugs others siphoned gasoline from wrecked service stations 
the island still lacked power water and telephone service 
the looting that followed the storm caused panic and fear among 
tourists and many residents armed themselves 
chief warrant officer layton timmons of the virgin islands 
national guard acknowledged that there were isolated cases of 
looting by guardsmen that had been videotaped by the coast guard 
when two people start looting the whole guard gets the rap 
he said 
witnesses said much of the sacking of supermarkets was done by 
desperate families living in a disaster zone 
we have 90 percent of the island destroyed said territorial 
sen holland redfield people just need food theyre panicked 
its a reaction of survival 
redfield said that in many cases supermarkets gave people 
permission to take the food since it was spoiling he said only a 
few of the looters were hardcore criminals 
the few businesses that were not looted were protected by their 
armed owners a sign on the door of a christiansted lawyers office 
read i dont have any light but i have a gun 
they the soldiers are here thank god said carol rubis 
owner of a sporting goods store called inside track for people 
like myself who own a store they came three days too late

gov rose mofford plans a billsigning celebration 
to enact a state workers holiday in honor of slain civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr 
the arizona senate voted 1711 followed by a 3721 vote in the 
house to swap state employees paid columbus day holiday for the 
paid king day 
the voting thursday ended years of disappointment for backers of 
a king holiday mrs moffords signature will cap a struggle that 
began in 1975 for king supporters 
im delighted the democratic governor said adding that she 
planned to sign the bill soon in the state capitol rotunda where 
there is plenty of room 
the holiday became a national issue after former gov evan mecham 
revoked an executive order by his predecessor gov bruce babbitt 
which some said enacted the holiday illegally 
the uproar that ensued included protest marches tourist boycotts 
and convention cancellations by national organizations arizona is 
one of only four states in the nation which does not have a king 
holiday 
boosters said arizona already has lost 256 million in convention 
and tourism business because it has no paid king holiday and that 
the state could lose 200 million in business if its bid for the 
1993 super bowl is rejected

president bushs spokesman today defended the 
luring of a drug dealer to the park across from the white house so 
the president could show crack cocaine on television and say it was 
bought there 
that was the whole point of the sting operation by the drug 
enforcement administration said presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
we told the dea we wanted to show that crack could be easily 
obtained in any neighborhood in washington not just in the 
ghetto fitzwater said 
he claimed there was nothing wrong in luring the dealer into the 
park so undercover agents could make the buy of crack cocaine 
there and that it did not consistute entrapment the area 
lafayette park is not known for drug activity 
william mcmullan assistant agent in charge of the deas 
washington field office was quoted in todays editions of the 
washington post as saying we were going to make that undercover 
buy anyway what difference does it make where it happened whether 
it was in front of the white house or in front of the supreme 
court 
the suspect who still hasnt been arrested already had sold 
crack to dea agents on other occasions elsewhere in washington and 
the buy in lafayette park was viewed as an installment toward a 
larger buy white house officials have said 
fitzwater said the administration had not sought to hide the fact 
that the dea set up the sting at the behest of the white house 
noting that he and other white house officials had discussed the 
operation publicly at the time of bushs sept 5 speech to the 
nation 
we wanted to do a government sting we said we wanted to make a 
buy in front of the white house the dea said no problem 
fitzwater said today 
there was no deception involved the dea does these kinds of 
stings all the time thats how they make most of their drug 
arrests 
reached at home by the associated press mcmullan the dea 
official declined to discuss the matter im not going to tell 
you anything until i read the article he said 
agency headquarters spokesman frank shults said however that 
locations of drug buys are highly negotiable between the buyer and 
seller 
that vicinity was as logical as any other location he said 
the sale of three ounces of crack to an undercover agent was made 
at 1130 am on sept 1 four days before bush held up a plastic 
bag of the substance and told television viewers this is crack 
cocaine it was seized a few days ago in a park across the street 
from the white house 
according to the newspaper the white house asked the justice 
department if it could provide some cocaine for the presidents 
speech justice asked dea and mcmullan was asked if he could move a 
planned purchase four or five blocks away closer to the white 
house 
a planned arrest of the suspect this week fell through when he 
failed to show up for a meeting with an agent and dea hopes to 
obtain indictments against him next week the newspaper said 
it wasnt easy to change the location mcmullan was quoted as 
saying at first the suspect seemed not to know what or where the 
white house was told it was the presidents house he said oh 
you mean where reagan lives

the government today denied it had received reports 
warning of terrorist attacks on french interests in the days before 
the crash of a french dc10 en route from chad to paris 
the uta flight with 171 people aboard blew apart tuesday over the 
west african country of niger leaving no survivors 
the lebanese extremist group islamic jihad claimed responsibility 
in separate telephone calls in london and paris although officials 
said they could not authenticate the claim 
french officials say they have not ruled out an accidental cause 
for the explosion but that a bomb was the most likely explanation 
a spokesman for president francois mitterrand speaking on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with government practice said a 
thorough check had shown none of our services none of our 
ministries received either threats or intelligence about 
preparations for antifrench attacks 
foreign ministry officials said the statement was a reponse to an 
article in todays edition of the weekly lexpress which said 
frances embassy in beirut had reported urgently on an article in 
the lebanese weekly ashshiraa reporting on possible terrorist 
attacks 
lexpress said ashshiraa reported the people who had held french 
hostages in beirut last year were complaining that the french 
government had not kept promises allegedly made to win their release 
france has repeatedly denied making any deal for the hostages 
beyond agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with iran the 
french dispute recurrent reports that they agreed to free anis 
naccache a proiranian lebanese serving a life sentence for the 
attempted murder in 1980 of former iranian prime minister shahpour 
bakhtiar in france 
a foreign ministry official who demanded anonymity confirmed 
that the french embassy in beirut sent copies of the ashshiraa 
article to paris 
all our embassies send us such reports regularly he said 
the content of the article is extremely vague you couldnt draw 
the conclusion from it that there would be an attack on a uta plane 
en route from ndjamena to paris 
ashshiraa is known for breaking the story of arms deals between 
the united states and iran but since then many of its articles 
relating to western hostages held in iran have not proved correct 
french officials have said they will wait for the results of an 
inquiry before concluding whether the plane was bombed 
uta or union des transports aeriens said it received an 
anonymous telephone call about midnight tuesday before the downed 
aircraft had been located by a french military plane saying islamic 
jihad was responsible 
an anonymous caller to a western news agency in london also said 
islamic jihad was responsible and demanded the release of shiite 
moslem religious leader sheik abdulkarim obeid who was kidnapped 
from southern lebanon on july 28 by israeli forces 
islamic jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in 
lebanon believed to be part of hezbollah or party of god the 
umbrella group thought to hold 16 westerners hostage in lebanon 
obeid is a member of hezbollah 
the hostages include eight americans the longest held is terry 
a anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
in ndjamena the chadian capital where french authorities are 
directing the search effort col jeanpierre job told reporters 
today that flight and voice recorders had been found and were being 
sent back to paris for study 
job said the searchers had recovered about 60 bodies to be flown 
out by helicopter they are to be flown to france for 
identification the foreign ministry said in niamey the capital of 
niger a plane carrying coffins arrived this morning 
french paratroopers and military doctors were working under 
severe conditions with temperatures up to 113 degrees and 
officials said they expected it to be difficult to identify all of 
the bodies

thousands of cambodian troops have 
been deployed to defend a strategic town against guerrilla attack a 
top officer said today describing what could become the first major 
test for his forces after vietnams pullout 
up to 450 khmer rouge guerrillas based in thailand and aiming to 
carve out a liberated zone have intensified mortar shelling of 
pailin sometimes raining 2000 rounds a day on the area according 
to the deputy defense minister gen ke kim yan 
a confrontation between government forces and guerrillas in the 
mountainous area that includes pailin will test whether the 
cambodian army can defend the country without help from vietnam 
we will not let the enemy occupy any territory as a liberated 
zone he told reporters on thursday vietnam began what it called 
the pullout of its last 26000 troops 
we are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose pailin he 
said 
thousands more soldiers began moving out today after a ceremony 
in battambang a neighboring province boredering thailand that 
includes pailin 
the sovietbacked vietnamese who invaded the country in 1978 and 
toppled the notorious khmer rouge regime have promised to withdraw 
the last of their troops by tuesday and leave the prohanoi 
government of president heng samrin to fend for itself 
cambodias army of an estimated 50000 regulars and 60000 to 
80000 poorly trained militia members will then face a resistance 
coalition of roughly 50000 guerrillas 
we still stay in pailin that means the khmer rouge cannot do 
anything to cambodia ke kim yan said 
a foreign ministry official said friday that pailin town was 
shelled when he and a foreign journalist visited there a few days 
ago on the road shells also struck a few feet behind an armored 
personnel carrier in their convoy he said on condition of anonymity 
the vietnamese troops are to cross into southern vietnam on 
tuesday by air land sea and river ending vietnams involvement in 
a war that cost it the lives of more than 25000 soldiers 
international isolation and economic stagnation 
the three guerrilla groups trying to topple the government 
vietnam installed in phnom penh say they do not believe vietnam 
intends to withdraw its troops still they have been launching new 
attacks in areas bordering thailand to take advantage of it said 
many officials 
many western analysts say phnom penhs army could have problems 
fighting the guerrillas alone the khmer rouge the largest 
guerrilla group has decades of battle experience 
however ke kim yan said the vietnamese army helped the 
cambodian army very much in gaining experience we are now 
experienced enough to deal with guerrilla warfare 
the general said the khmer rouge began attacking the pailin area 
in july from two bases in thailands border province of trat 
if you capture pailin you gain not only in military but 
economic strategy ke kim yan said 
it would be easy for them to get their military supplies in 
from bases in trat province it is a mountainous and forested area 
so you can hide your men there and there are rubies so you can get 
money to feed all your men he said 
the general said his forces have suffered few casualties at 
pailin except for some troops who stepped on the increasing number 
of guerrillaplanted land mines 
fighting in other parts of cambodia currently is limited to 
smallscale hitandrun guerrilla attacks he said 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge who took power in 1975 tried to 
force an agrarian revolution on the country during that time 
hundreds of thousands of cambodias 8 million people died from 
executions famine and civil unrest 
the other members of the resistance coalition are the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front of former 
cambodian prime minister son sann and followers of former cambodian 
head of state prince norodom sihanouk 
in a statement issued in beijing on thursday and seen in bangkok 
today sihanouk denounced as a sham vietnams pledged withdrawal 
sihanouk also rejected a recent thai ceasefire proposal for his 
country and flatly refused to enter talks with phnom penh 
however a thai foreign ministry spokesman prachyadavi 
tavedikul said his country and other southeast asian nations still 
will campaign for the cambodian resistance coalition to retain its 
seat in the united nations as the official cambodian government 
the issue is expected to come up when the un general assembly 
convenes in new york this month some dipolomats expect reduced 
support for the coalition because of vietnams promised pullout

ministry and didnt think he belonged in court 
elizabeth sacco a former ptl employee who was laid off in 1986 
testified thursday that shes still loyal to bakker and im proud 
of it i feel loyalty because ive seen what this man built a 
greedy man doesnt have his hair turn gray in five years 
i wouldnt have taken his job for 10 million a year 
ms sacco who answered correspondence for the ministry was one 
of the first witnesses to testify for bakker as the defense phase of 
the 3weekold fraud trial got under way todays session of the 
trial however was canceled after the remnants of hurricane hugo 
battered the city cutting off power to most buildings and downing 
trees that blocked many streets 
bakker is charged with overselling the 1000 lifetime 
partnerships which bought their owners three nights of lodging 
each year for life and diverting 37 million of the proceeds to 
finance his lavish lifestyle 
if convicted of all 24 fraud and conspiracy counts bakker could 
face 120 years in prison and more than 5 million in fines 
prosecution witnesses had testified they had difficulty booking 
rooms at ptls heritage usa theme park near fort mill sc the 
government alleges that bakker sold more than twice as many 
partnerships as there was room for at the park 
james johnson who bought eight partnerships in bakkers church 
said he always was able to get reservations when he called ptl and 
didnt believe the partnerships were oversold 
the only regret i have is that i dont think this should have 
been brought before this court johnson said the church should 
have taken care of it 
louise grimes who operates a gas station in hopkins sc said 
the money she sent to ptl for six partnerships was well spent 
she said she had used the partnerships several times to book 
rooms at the heritage grand hotel sometimes visiting with her 
grandchildren 
under questioning by defense attorney george t davis she 
described the atmosphere at heritage usa 
i want to say its heavenly but i dont know what heaven is 
like she said i can tell you that people were happy there 
it did not take a mastermind to see that jim and tammy were 
telling the truth atlanta builder and businessman sam gasaway 
testified referring to bakker and his wife the purpose of the 
ministry is to reach out and help people 
i found them to be upright people truthful in what they 
said gasaway said theyre not the kind of people who should be 
accused of what they are accused of

this morning before getting out of bed to drink milk and eat some 
cold cereal saca said

fed intravenously and medicated saca said he would sharply reduce 
the dose of sedatives duarte has been receiving for the past two 
days 
he wants to be more alert to be able to talk with his family

since tuesday when his condition deteriorated sharply while he was 
attending a meeting of regional christian democrats in guatemala 
duarte had been receiving chemotherapy periodically until last 
month when he was judged too weak to survive its debilitating 
sideeffects the treatment reduced the oncestocky engineer to a 
gaunt shadow of his former self

president in 1972 duarte left the country and returned after a 1979 
coup he joined the ruling junta in 1980 and was named president in

cartels a source at the presidential palace said today 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said ms de 
greiffs resignation would be announced later today the official

security was tightened in bogota following 12 bombs that shook 
the capital

thursday night that president virgilio barco accepted de greiffs 
resignation 
the 32yearold lawyer won praise worldwide after she traveled to 
the united states in august to ask for help protecting hundreds of 
judges facing death threats by cocaine traffickers 
the traffickers have repeatedly threatened ms de greiff her 
3yearold son and husband since she took office july 16 
they stepped up the threats when the government began cracking 
down on the cocaine cartels after sen luis carlos galan the 
countrys leading presidential candidate was assassinated aug 18 
six people have served as justice minister in the past three 
years and nearly all were threatened with death 
one of ms de greiffs predecessors was killed by drug lords in 
1984 and another was wounded on a budapest street in 1987 after 
becoming the ambassador to hungary 
radio caracol said barco accepted ms de greiffs resignation and 
offered her the ambassadorial post in portugal but that she declined

injuring a young boy police said 
the damage was believed to be in the millions of dollars 
hundreds of army troops police and private security guarded 
buildings across the city of 6 million people 
the bombings came as the colombian senate debates allegations 
that government officials and others have conspired with drug 
traffickers 
this weekthe lawmakers asked the goverment to make public a list 
that allegedly contains the names of government officials 
politicians journalists and officials in the army and police 
believed to be on the payroll of cartels 
barco said no such list exists 
on thursday newspapers published the names of 25 lawmakers and 
politicians recently denied visas to the united states allegedly 
because they had drug connections 
foreign minister julio londono paredes said he was asking 
washington to find out why the names were leaked 
the us embassy said there is no special list but that thousands 
of colombians are denied tourist visas every year many because they 
plan to stay in the united states and others for suspected drug ties 
sen bernardo guerra serna said he was denied a us visa and 
blamed public statements he has made about the futility of the drug 
war 
this war is going to go on until we legalize drugs not only in 
colombia but worldwide he told colombian reporters

the aids virus has the ability to turn one of 
the bodys major disease fighters against the immune system itself 
leaving the patient unprotected against infection according to a 
new study 
in a report published today in science dr michael k hoffman of 
the sloankettering institute said experiments in his laboratory 
show that an antibody made by the immune system to attack the aids 
virus is turned by the virus into a weapon against the immune system 
itself 
the finding said hoffman suggests that some types of vaccine 
against the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv that causes aids 
could actually help the disease instead of protecting the body 
in terms of vaccination our data provides some alarming news 
because you would have to realize if you immunize with a vaccine 
you also produce antibodies that might be rather harmful he said 
among the antibodies that an hivinfected individual produces 
there are some that are harmful and actually participate in the 
immune systems own destruction 
an aids vaccine hoffman said could cause exactly what you 
want to prevent immune deficiency 
the principle targets of hiv are immune cells called t4 
lymphocytes the t4 is one type of white blood cell and is a key 
soldier in the bodys war against disease aids kills by destroying 
or disabling these lymphocytes leaving the body defenseless against 
infection 
t4 lymphocytes and the aids virus have molecules on their 
surfaces that can link like a key in a lock the molecule on the 
lymphocyte is called cd4 and the aids surface molecule is called 
gp120 when these molecules join the aids virus is able to invade 
the lymphocyte 
in fighting against the virus invader the body produces an 
antibody or diseasefighting molecule that attacks the gp120 
molecule 
hoffman said experiments in his lab show that the gp120 of the 
virus actually forms what he called a complex when it joins with 
the gp120 antibody and the cd4 molecule on the surface of the 
lymphocyte when this happens he said the lymphocyte is 
inactivated and is no longer able to fight disease 
if the finding is verified in other laboratories hoffman said it 
would explain why even t4 lymphocytes that are not actually infected 
by the aids virus are nonetheless often unable to fight disease in 
a patient 
that has been a mystery for a long time he said this 
would provide a possible explanation of that 
hoffman said the purpose of the study was to determine on a 
molecular level how the immune deficiency develops in an aids 
patient 
nobody really has the foggiest idea he said we think this 
gives us a pretty good clue about what might be happening but 
more studies are needed to draw final conclusions 
hoffmans coinvestigator in the study is dr robert s mittler 
of bristolmyers co in wallingford conn 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
aids is a contagious disease that is incurable the virus that 
causes aids most often is spread through close contact with blood 
blood products or semen from infected people 
as of july 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 102621 
americans of whom more than half 59391 have died

the supreme court today legalized a 
prosolidarity student union and upheld its right to strike over 
political and school issues 
chants of nzs nzs the polish initials for the independent 
students association broke out in the packed courtroom when the 
justices legalized the group which was banned after the 1981 
martial law crackdown 
it should have happened a long time ago said one student 
among the 100 spectators 
the students won the right to include a strike provision in their 
charter a clause that had blocked legalization of the association 
even after the solidarity movement was legalized in april 
nzs is polands largest student union with a strong and vocal 
following at universities and high schools it is the last of the 
solidarity movements to be legalized following the ban on 
associations independent of the communist government that was 
imposed after the december 1981 martial law crackdown 
since 1980 it has been an alternative to the 
communistsanctioned polish students association 
nzs was denied registration on may 23 even though solidarity and 
the independent farmers union rural solidarity were legalized after 
april accords reached in roundtable talks with communist 
authorities 
in may the court said that the labor law did not apply to 
students and that they therefore could not claim the right to 
strike the student association refused to change its charter which 
claims the right to strike 
registration was delayed again sept 9 even though solidaritys 
tadeusz mazowiecki had been installed as the east blocs first 
noncommunist prime minister and the government prosecutor told the 
court it had no objection to the groups registration 
despite the ban nzs has since 1987 been well represented at 
solidarity demonstrations and has staged its own protests to draw 
attention to problems at schools including low stipends outdated 
equipment the lack of research and library materials and other 
shortages 
the pressure to legalize nzs grew as the oct 2 start of the new 
academic year approached there was concern that failure to register 
the association would be met by student protests that could create 
instability as the new government tries to reverse polands economic 
crisis 
students joined by professors and members of parliament 
celebrated the decision in the hallways of the warsaw courthouse 
at last one said 
weve been functioning anyway but it is nice to be legal 
again another said 
education minister henryk samsonowicz a solidarity supporter who 
was warsaw university rector until he was removed under martial law 
met wednesday with the national coordinating committee of nzs to 
discuss the way the union would function after it was legalized 
student strikes demanding the groups registration took place 
nationwide during the spring students also struck in sympathy to 
workers during a wave of labor strikes in may and august of 1988 
the students then put banners across the university gates held 
rallies signed petitions slept on the floors of academic buildings 
and sometimes obstructed access to the campus the government had 
complained that the striked played havoc with normal campus life

virginias highest court in the nations 
first appeal of a murder trial based on dna evidence today upheld 
the conviction and death sentence of a man in the rapemurders of 
two women 
the state supreme court in unanimous rulings said dna test 
results submitted as evidence at two of timothy w spencers trials 
were shown to be a reliable scientific technique and the tests 
were properly conducted 
spencer a 26yearold former resident of a richmond halfway 
house was linked to the 1987 rape and murders of susan tucker and 
debbie dudley davis through socalled dna fingerprinting 
dna is the basic genetic material found in human cells everyone 
except identical twins is believed to have a unique dna pattern 
spencer was convicted after samples of semen found at the crime 
scenes in the two cases were compared to dna patterns in spencers 
blood experts testified that the samples matched 
the record is replete with uncontradicted expert testimony 
from scientists about the reliability of dna fingerprinting the 
state court said 
indeed spencer acknowledges that the evidence establishes that 
the dna tests are accepted as reliable within the scientific 
community and that he was unable to find or produce one qualified 
expert to debunk either the theory of dna printing or the statistics 
generated therefrom the court said 
jeffery l everhart an attorney who represented spencer in the 
davis killing argued that the dna procedure which has been in use 
for only a few years is too unproved to be relied upon exclusively 
to put the defendant at the scene of the crime 
spencer also was convicted and sentenced to death in two other 
murders and those cases are still on appeal to the state supreme 
court

this morning but warned it could spin off tornadoes as it headed 
across north carolina toward inland virginia then up the 
appalachian mountains to new york and new england 
donald maurer a spokesman for the new york state disaster 
preparedness commission in albany said many people living inland 
wrongly believe theyre immune from tropical storms in the

guard petty officer ken arbogast in boston in that case the 
hurricane was far out in the atlantic 
at 9 am hugos center was located just north of hickory nc 
in the blue ridge foothills and it was moving toward the north 
northwest at 25 to 30 mph the national weather service said fears 
of flooding moderated somewhat as the storm picked up speed on its 
march northward ensuring that rain wouldnt linger quite as long 
over any one place 
were just hoping there arent thunderstorms ahead of it 
because that would mean a flood threat said weather service 
metrologist bill coneaux 
maximum sustained winds were estimated to have decreased to 60 
mph with higher gusts in squalls hickory had gusts of up to 73 mph 
this morning 
in maryland and delaware from 5 to 10 inches of rain and wind 
gusts of up to 70 mph were expected to buffet the chesapeake region 
this afternoon 
with the storm expected to hit the baltimorewashington area 
around the afternoon rush hour the district of columbia federal 
and maryland governments told employees they could leave early if 
necessary transit authorities added service and officials closed 
schools in the capital and its suburbs 
ocean city md canceled its annual sunfest festival set for 
this weekend as hotels reported an increasing number of tourists 
calling off their beach visits 
in nelson county va where 128 people were killed in floods and 
mudslides caused by hurricane camille in 1969 workers hurriedly set 
up a network of electronic rain gauges to act as an early warning 
device sheriff william harris said 
but to the 50 or so surfers in the water at virginia beach on 
thursday evening thoughts of the coming storm centered on the waves 
its pretty good right now said joe wool 23 the waves 
are breaking about head high 
farther north a flash flood watch was posted statewide in both 
delaware and maryland in addition to a high wind warning for new 
castle county del hagerstown in western maryland could have 
winds of 30 to 50 mph with higher gusts the national weather 
service said this morning 
tropical storm warnings remained in effect this morning from 
virginia beach northward to manasquan nj including chesapeake 
and delaware bays 
commanders at dover air force base in delaware ordered the 
evacuation of their fleet of jet transports late thursday 
in new york forecasters said vestiges of hugo could cause severe 
rain and flooding 
hugo could hit new york state some time tonight or saturday 
before passing through southern new england according to 
meteorologist robert barton in albany 
barton said there could be 2 to 4 inches of rain in parts of new 
york south of albany including new york city 
in connecticut forecasters said the state faces winds between 20 
mph and 40 mph in the hartford area with 2 to 4 inches of rain 
likely by saturday 
we will be spared a direct hit from the storm said mel 
goldstein director of the weather center at western connecticut 
state university in danbury we should be ready for some power 
outages and some localized flooding 
some connecticut residents particularly those living near long 
island sound were not taking any chances

customers buying everything from flashlights to waterproof tarps 
one guy came in and bought a generator he said he was just 
taking it for precaution said steve mcdow a salesman at the 
super handy hardware center in greenwich 
in massachusetts heavy rains with flooding in lowlying areas 
were expected in the boston area according to jim roets a national 
weather service meterologist 
the storm already has postponed a statewide shoreline cleanup

former gov evan mecham says the state supreme 
court should have jurisdiction over his his effort to be reinstated 
and that he should be paid more than 600000 
one of the very key things that the judicial branch is for on 
the higher levels is to make sure the executive nor the legislative 
branch violates the constitution and violates peoples rights 
mecham said after a hearing thursday in state supreme court on his 
petition for special action 
mecham who last year became the nations first governor removed 
by impeachment in nearly 60 years is asking the states highest 
court to review his case 
the ousted governor called comments by justice stanley feldman 
and deputy attorney general kathy cook saying they could not enter 
into the case baloney 
ms cook told the justices that the separation of powers 
prevented them from examining the legislative branchs impeachment 
provision and feldman appeared to agree saying we cant make 
the senate do anything they are a separate branch of government 
ms cook also said mecham and his supporters suffered no 
violation of their constitutional rights 
mechams lawyer however said lawmakers violated the state and 
federal constitutions when they impeached and ousted mecham last 
year he asked the justices to restore mecham to office and pay him 
more than 600000 
either the constitution means what it says or it isnt worth 
the paper its written on mechams attorney donald macpherson 
told a packed courtroom 
the justices took the case under advisement but did not say when 
they would decide what to do with it 
mecham is running for governor in 1990 and wants the money to 
help him in his new campaign he was removed from office april 4 
1988 on charges he misused money in a state protocol fund and tried 
to obstruct an investigation into the actions of an underling

christian leader michel aoun today 
accepted a sevenpoint arab peace plan aimed at ending the 
6monthold bloodbath between his forces and syrian troops who 
control 70 percent of the country 
arab league envoy lakhdar alibrahimi made the announcement after 
an hourlong meeting with gen aoun at his office in a bunker under 
the bombravaged presidential palace in beiruts suburb of baabda 
i am glad to inform you that the general has accepted the terms 
of the plan and has agreed that we start working to implement 
them said ibrahimi assistant secretarygeneral of the 22member 
arab league 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads a 
syrianbacked cabinet vying for legitimacy with aouns christian 
government and parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem have already accepted the plan 
shiite militia chieftain nabih berri and druse warlord walid 
jumblatt who are syrias main allies in lebanon also have endorsed 
it 
ibrahimi an algerian diplomat was asked by an arab league 
committee to head a security committee to supervise the ceasefire 
and monitor ships to ensure no weapons supplies reach lebanese 
factions 
aoun initially said he would not send a representative to such a 
committee because it did not include a syrian representative he 
said syria was trying to portray the crisis as one among lebanese 
factions even though syrian forces in lebanon are the main party 
fighting his christian troops 
but france and the united states traditional backers of the 
christians and several arab governments voiced support for the 
peace plan and urged aoun to display flexibility to avoid further 
bloodshed 
thank god all the brethren in lebanon have agreed that we 
start implementing this plan ibrahimi said 
the arab league plan drafted by leaders of saudi arabia morocco 
and algeria calls for a ceasefire lifting of blockades and 
opening beirut airport 
it also invites the 73 surviving members of lebanons 99seat 
parliament to meet outside the country to formulate political 
reforms these would give the countrys moslems an estimated 55 
percent of the population an equal share of power with the 
traditionally dominant christians 
in another development an oil tanker carrying badly needed 
gasoline for lebanons besieged christians played hideandseek for 
three hours with syrian artillery before slipping into port before 
dawn 
police said the lebaneseflagged timex star ran the gantlet of 
radarcontrolled syrian shellfire to deliver its cargo of 660000 
gallons of fuel at jounieh 12 miles north of beirut 
the captain ducked into a bay north of jounieh putting 
mountains between him and the syrian radar and blocking it then he 
hugged the coast to slip into port a police spokesman said 
the spokesman who demanded anonymity said the syrians used 
longrange artillery in moslem west beirut from mountains 
overlooking the christian enclave and in north lebanon in their 
effort to sink the timex star 
the christians critically short of fuel after a 6monthlong 
syrian blockade began unloading the fuel 15 minutes after the 
tanker docked 
syrian attempts to sink the tanker caused an artillery duel 
between the syrians and aouns forces in and around beirut that left 
two people killed and seven wounded police said that raised the 
toll to 929 killed and 2738 wounded since the latest fighting began 
march 8 
the christians control a 28mile strip of coast north of beirut 
with their enclave ringed on its three landward sides by the syrians 
and their lebanese moslem militia allies the coastal strip is their 
only lifeline 
in the 14yearold civil war more than 150000 people have been 
killed and more than 1 million of lebanons 4 million people have 
been displaced

neighbors were breakfasting heading to work 
or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned 
their homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of 
bodies being carried away 
there was a terrific crash which reminded me of the blitz 
after that the ceiling started to fall down around me said joan 
betteridge a pensioner in the southern england town of deal where 
the blast at the royal marines school of music occurred 
the irish republican army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion 
which police said killed 11 people and injured 22 
nearby resident sean minnock said i was asleep but woke up 
with a hell of a jolt the bedroom ceiling fell in on me i woke 
to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor 
from the wrecked smokeclouded barracks i could hear 
terrified screams of agony people started rushing about all over 
the place it was horrible to watch and listen to said minnock 
28 
i knew people had been seriously hurt i saw the rescuers pull 
out two bodies i knew they were dead when they put them on the 
floor and put bed blankets right over them 
minnocks wife janet said the roof of their house was torn off 
and all the back windows were shattered 
the house has been blown to bits she said 
mrs minnock was feeding her 2yearold son thomas his breakfast 
when the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the street 
backing onto the barracks 
her nextdoor neighbor heather hackett 26 was standing at her 
kitchen window facing the barracks holding her 4monthold son luke 
in her arms her other boys ben 3 and joshua 2 were at her side 
i looked up from the sink and i just saw the whole building 
explode she said i told the boys to run and as joshua turned a 
sliver of glass embedded itself in his back 
the whole window was blown across the kitchen i just screamed 
and ran out of the room the bang was so loud i thought the whole 
house was coming in 
at first i thought for sure joshua had been seriously injured 
there was blood coming out of his back doctors removed the glass 
and sent him home 
college student simon mitford 17 narrowly escaped being injured 
in the explosion because he got up earlier than usual 
his room was completely wrecked by the blast his brother 
alex said 
of the barracks he said i heard music playing and then it 
went bang and there was glass everywhere it was a twostory 
building but now 90 percent of it is rubble 
i heard a marine scream out the band is under there i was 
scared there was going to be a second explosion

militant black unions today 
launched a nationwide consumer boycott of whiteowned stores and 
25000 people staged protest marches in a major city and a 
conservative farming town 
the unions seeking to overturn a controversial labor law also 
told their 15 million members to refuse to work overtime for the 
next four weeks 
union leaders said the action could cut industrial production by 
20 percent or force white employers to hire thousands of additional 
black workers 
a coalition of antiapartheid womens groups said they would 
proceed with a major march saturday on government headquarters in 
pretoria despite a ban 
the government for the first time in decades has allowed 
several protest marches this month but the womens march was banned 
because its leaders refused to seek permission 
laura pollecutt one of the march organizers said her colleagues 
had notified authorities of the planned route but did not feel their 
right to protest was subject to government approval 
in durban south africas largest port and thirdlargest city an 
estimated 15000 people of all races including members of the white 
city council joined a peaceful antigovernment march to city hall 
this afternoon 
about 10000 protesters led by the rev allan boesak president 
of the world alliance staged a similar march in oudtshoorn a town 
of 40000 people in southern cape province it was by far the 
largest protest ever in oudtshoorn center of the ostrichfarming 
industry and the scene of frequent confrontations between police and 
activists 
after a 55mile march the protesters presented police with a 
list of demands including a halt to alleged harassment of activists 
and the arrest of vandals who desecrated tombs of three youths 
killed by police during unrest in 1985 
durban and oudtshoorn police kept a low profile in accordance 
with the governments 10dayold policy of permitting some political 
protests but justice minister kobie coetsee filed court papers 
today seeking to ban the womens march 
the union protests were intended to pressure employers into 
renouncing a new labor law which unions say undermines their ability 
to strike union leaders urged all blacks to join the consumer 
boycott which they said was part of a broadbased national defiance 
campaign that began in early august 
there was no immediate word from retail organizations about the 
extent of the consumer boycott which is intended to continue 
through oct 6 but department stores in the eastern cape province 
cities of east london and king williams town where the boycott 
began early were reported virtually deserted on thursday 
the defiance campaign has included protests of segregation laws 
as well as mass marches in cities across the country the first such 
demonstrations allowed by the government for decades 
all the recent marches had been peaceful until thursday when 
some black youths smashed windows of shops and vehicles as marchers 
dispersed in pietermaritzburg capital of natal province no arrests 
or injuries were reported but progovernment media gave headline 
treatment to the incident 
magistrates in several cities issued warnings today that 
organizers of protest marches must request permission at least seven 
days in advance leaders of most of the recent marches have refused 
to apply for a permit 
several prominent activists have been detained during the 
defiance campaign including white cape town lawyer willie hofmeyr 
his father said today that hofmeyr has ended a 28day hunger strike 
and indicated that law and order minister adriaan vlok was 
considering releasing the activist 
the congress of south african trade unions the largest black 
labor federation said no violence or coercion should be used to 
enforce the consumer boycott the 1millionmember congress said 
black shopkeepers should avoid raising their prices during the 
boycott 
the boycott also is endorsed by the national congress of trade 
unions which claims 500000 members 
the target of the union protests is the labor relations amendment 
act enacted by the government last year despite strenuous 
objections from black unions some of its original hardline 
provisions were modified but unions still object to sections which 
prohibit sympathy strikes restrict the frequency of strikes against 
any particular company and make it easier for unions to be held 
liable for strikerelated losses

legislation aimed at freeing a district of 
columbia mother jailed for more than two years in a child custody 
dispute is headed to president bushs desk after passing the senate 
early today 
i havent spoken directly with the president but were told he 
is sympathetic and that the white house staff will encourage him to 
sign it rep stan parris rva said 
the measure would limit civil contempt of court jailings in the 
nations capital to one year in child custody cases passed by the 
house on wednesday the measure is drawn to deal with the case of 
dr elizabeth morgan 
both houses voted by unanimous consent for the bill 
morgan was sent to jail in august 1987 after refusing a judges 
order to produce her daughter hilary for courtordered visits with 
dr eric foretich morgans exhusband and the girls father 
morgan has alleged that foretich sexually abused the child who 
now is 7 years old foretich has repeatedly denied those charges 
morgans attorneys have argued that her continued jailing 
violates her constitutional rights in august a threejudge appeals 
court panel agreed ruling that because she is unlikely to produce 
her daughter the effect of keeping her in jail has gone from 
coercive to unconstitutionally punitive 
foretichs attorney elaine mittleman said today the law is 
unconstitutional and threatened court action to block morgans 
release 
the full district of columbia court of appeals is now considering 
the case 
the congressional measure which would apply retroactively to the 
morgan case would allow prosecutors to file criminal contempt 
charges after someone has been jailed for six months that would 
guarantee a jury trial before a different judge than the one who 
issued the contempt citation 
the measure would expire after 18 months

attack or was bitten by a snake the family later appealed to the 
supreme court saying torture marks were visible on hamdans body

sigmund freud prepared for death the same way he 
probed the human psyche stoically saying goodbye to friends and 
colleagues and calmly asking for a shot of morphine to end his long 
painful battle with cancer 
the american psychiatric association and several other 
organizations are commemorating his death in london on sept 23 
1939 at age 83 
the apa will join affiliate organizations in philadelphia on 
saturday in presenting a symposium through the looking glass 
freuds impact on contemporary culture 
freud propelled the primitive field of psychiatry into the 
mainstream of popular culture transforming the way people thought 
and spoke thanks to freud personal problems are now referred to as 
complexes and an embarrassing verbal mishap is called a 
freudian slip 
although many of his theories and opinions have been questioned 
psychiatrists still hail freuds most central premises 
he brought out the existence of an unconscious process as a 
major determinant of how we think and feel and act said dr 
stephen sonnenberg the apas chairman of the committee of public 
information he also revealed the sexuality of children and 
founded the developmental approach to understanding human growth 
he saw the unconscious was more than just something you happen 
not to remember right now said peter gay a yale university 
history professor and author of freud a life for our time 
the son of a jewish wool merchant sigismund schlomo freud was 
born may 6 1856 in freiberg austria and moved to vienna four 
years later 
he studied medicine and philosophy at the university of vienna 
in late 1874 freud described himself to a friend as a godless 
medical student and an empiricist 
from 187682 he worked in the laboratory of josef breuer a 
prominent physician and physiologist and developed a passion for 
research with studies of the nervous systems of everything from fish 
to humans 
after he left breuer to take a junior post at viennas general 
hospital breuer told him about one of his patients a young 
hysteric with the pseudonym anna o who became sick in 1880 
a few months after her father fell fatally ill 
freud built on the case insisting there were sexual anxieties 
behind anna os neuroses and applying his ideas to other 
hysterics 
by 1892 using the famous couch given by a former patient and 
piled high with pillows freud had developed the basic methods 
still used by psychiatrists today observation interpretation free 
association and the gradual working through of afflictions 
freud worked and lived for 47 years in the vienna house known as 
berggasse 19 he married martha bernays in 1886 and had three sons 
oliver enrst and martin and three daughters anna mathilde and 
sophie 
rigorous selfcritical relentlessly curious freud drew on the 
experiences of himself and his patients and tapped into new ideas 
in his 1899 book the interpretation of dreams he theorized 
that dreams were wish fulfillments and revealed hidden desires or 
fears he also offered a rough sketch for what was later called 
the oedipus complex writing that young children are in love 
with the parent of the opposite sex and driven to kill the one of 
the same sex 
in 1923 he published the ego and the id proclaiming the 
mind consisted of an id which sought pleasure a superego 
the source of morality and the ego the mediator between the two 
freuds remarks about women whose sexual lives he once referred 
to as the dark continent were often attacked he confessed in 
the late 1920s that nearly 30 years of researching the feminine 
soul had produced no answers 
he insisted that women suffered from penis envy which 
brought on feelings of jealousy and inferiority 
the cancer that eventually killed him first emerged in february 
1923 when freud admittedly hooked on cigars developed a benign 
growth on his jaw and palate he underwent surgery although his 
hearing was affected resulting eventually in almost total deafness 
in his right ear he refused to give up cigars 
in september 1938 six months after the nazis marched into 
austria the cancerous growth returned and surgery was again 
required he began to receive radium treatments but continued to 
see patients 
with the persecution of jews in austria an enfeebled freud left 
vienna in june 1938 and spent his remaining days in london 
his health rapidly deteriorated and on sept 21 1939 freuds 
longtime physician dr max schur injected him with three 
centigrams of morphine one more centigram than the normal dosage 
causing a deep peaceful sleep freud lapsed into a coma the next 
day and died in the early morning of sept 23 
the philadelphia symposium coincides with the opening of an 
exhibit from his personal collection that will be shown in 10 us 
cities culminating nov 35 with a conference at the university of 
south carolina 
at londons freud museum converted from the hampstead house 
where he spent the last year of his life a new exhibit opened 
featuring previously undisplayed items

key senate clean air sponsors said today 
theyve reached a political compromise on acid rain that would 
benefit seven states that cleaned up emissions from coalfired power 
plants 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine and sen max 
baucus dmont predicted their agreement would win support for 
clean air legislation the compromise is not included in president 
bushs clean air plan which is undergoing consideration by a house 
subcommittee 
both the administration and baucusmitchell plans are designed to 
reduce the major component of acid rain sulfur dioxide by 10 
million tons and prevent any growth of emissions after the 
reductions are achieved 
the bush bill would require the reduction by the end of the year 
2000 and the mitchellbaucus requires the improvement by jan 1 
2000 
the agreement would exempt states from making further sulfur 
dioxide reductions through the start of 2000 if more than one half 
of their coalfired power plants utilize pollutionreducing 
equipment called scrubbers 
according to a list handed out by the senators the provision 
would benefit baucus state of montana kansas minnesota north 
dakota new mexico utah and wyoming 
current law requires all new coalfired power plants to use 
scrubbers including states that burn clean low sulfur coal mined 
in the west 
this requirement has imposed a huge and environmentally 
unjustified burden on the west baucus said mitchell said 
millions of dollars have been spent on the scrubbers 
acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxide and is carried hundreds of miles before raining down 
to earth acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams 
damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs

the defense minister said friday that 
government troops can defend cambodia against a guerrilla coalition 
despite a surge in nearby fighting that has accompanied the 
withdrawal of vietnamese soldiers 
defense minister tea banh spoke at a farewell ceremony for 
departing soldiers on the second day of vietnams troop withdrawal 
vietnam has promised to have all of its 26000 troops out of 
cambodia by sept 26 
officers from the two countries embraced and hundreds of 
townspeople laughed and cheered as girls tied cambodian scarves 
around the necks of vietnamese troops 
im very very happy to be going home said nguyen hoang thy 
21 who spent three years in cambodia its been sad because we 
lost a lot of people fighting here 
vietnam says more than 25000 of its people have died in cambodia 
since it invaded on christmas 1978 to oust the khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of people during its rule from 1975 to 
1978 
the khmer rouge is the strongest in the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition fighting the government installed by vietnam many 
analysts say cambodias army estimated at 50000 is poorly trained 
and led and could have problems fighting the guerrillas alone 
in an interview with reporters in phnom penh on friday deputy 
defense minister ke kim yan said as many as 450 khmer rouge 
guerrillas were shelling the pailin area of battambang province with 
up to 2000 mortar rounds per day 
we are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose pailin ke 
kim yan said 
pailins forests and mountains could provide good hiding places 
for the guerrillas while gem mines in the area could help bankroll 
the opposition forces 
the guerrillas maintain bases along the thaicambodian border 
not far from battambang 
we have built up our home forces both quantitatively and 
qualitatively to the point that they can take the place of 
vietnamese troops in defending the territory along the western 
region tea banh told the farewell ceremony 
other farewell ceremonies were held in pursat and kompong chhnang 
provinces north of phnom penh 
in the town of pursat on wednesday night two hours of steady 
artillery shelling was heard in the distance 
cambodian officials say 20 foreign observers are monitoring the 
vietnamese pullout 
i wont report that i have proof of a complete withdrawal but 
we believe that vietnam is withdrawing all its troops said bali 
ram bhagat an observer from india who watched the troop movements 
at battambang 
at battambang townspeople lined the streets cheering and waving 
cambodian and vietnamese flags as the vietnamese waved back from 
their of soviet and aging usmade trucks 
orangerobed buddhist priests showered the departing vietnamese 
officers with water in a blessing 
india is the only major noncommunist country that recognizes the 
phnom penh government instead of the guerrilla coalition besides 
india the only official nonsocialist government officials seen 
observing the troop movements were from belgium 
china arms the guerrillas while thailand shelters them

vice president dan quayle on friday denounced 
cambodias khmer rouge guerrilla group as mass murderers and 
said the noncommunist resistance is the best hope for the wartorn 
country 
quayle attending a meeting of the international democratic 
union made his comments at a news conference with other 
conservative politicians from around the world as vietnamese forces 
were withdrawing from cambodia 
the withdrawal poses the threat that the fanatical khmer rouge 
may eventually defeat the vietnamesebacked cambodian government 
forces and other resistance groups 
the vice president was asked how the united states could oppose 
soviet aid to cambodias government when the aid was to be used to 
combat the communist khmer rouge which was ousted from power after 
vietnams 1978 invasion 
washington favors the noncommunist resistance groups led by 
prince norodom sihanouk and hopes the cambodian people can 
determine their own future quayle said 
we are very sensitive and very aware of the past atrocities 
that were committed by the khmer rouge he said the mass 
murderers of the khmer rouge should not and shall not return to 
power 
the best course he said is to strive for democracy through the 
other resistance groups the noncommunist resistance offers the 
best hope for the future of cambodia 
the khmer rouge are blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians in a radical campaign to create a pure communist society 
quayle also said the united states hopes china will return to 
more moderate policies that prevailed before military force was used 
to crush prodemocracy demonstrations in june until china changes 
he said washington will continue the sanctions imposed by president 
bush including a ban on highlevel contacts and other measures 
the ball is in chinas court nothing has changed in china 
to change our policies that were clearly articulated by the 
president quayle said 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu said his country will lift 
an advisory against traveling to beijing but will not resume 
negotiations on economic aid until after chinese authorities lift 
martial law in the capital japan is the source of about 80 percent 
of chinas bilateral economic assistance 
in speeches earlier to the conference quayle and british prime 
minster margaret thatcher said it would be dangerous for the west to 
become complacent because of democratic reforms in the soviet union 
and other east bloc nations 
the international democrat union is a group of rightofcenter 
political parties in 26 countries whose leaders meet every two years 
mrs thatcher left for moscow on friday afternoon and is to hold 
talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev before returning to 
london 
quayle is to travel saturday to visit us military bases in 
northern japan and next week he holds talks with kaifu and other 
japanese leaders before traveling to the philippines and malaysia 
despite clashes in manila on friday between police and about 
1000 leftists who oppose quayles visit a senior us 
administration official said plans for the trip to the philippines

an explosion today flattened a military 
barracks and tore through nearby homes killing 11 people and 
injuring 22 police said the ira claimed responsibility for the 
blast 
more than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble 
of a threestory building that collapsed at the royal marines school 
of music near deal stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that 
were damaged or destroyed 
chief police inspector alan butterfield of kent who who provided 
the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort first 
reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was 
accounted for 
he said many of the injured were seriously hurt 
there was a terrific crash which reminded me of the blitz 
after that the ceiling started to fall down around me said 
pensioner joan betteridge 
defense secretary tom king inspecting the wreckage said it 
is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb but all the 
evidence is quite clearly that this is an ira atrocity 
british military installations are a frequent bombing target of 
the irish republican army in its campaign to rid northern ireland of 
british rule but todays explosion in the coastal town 70 miles 
southeast of london was the worst ira attack on the british mainland 
in more than seven years 
the explosion occurred at at 826 am in a lounge in the 
barracks one of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade 
ground said a ministry spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping 
with british custom 
dozens of homes near the school were damaged including four that 
were destroyed witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles 
away 
the defense ministry would not say how many servicemen and 
civilians were included in the casualty figures however king told 
reporters the attack was directed against unarmed bandsmen 
firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to 
search through the debris said kent fire brigade spokesman kevin 
simmons 
ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11 
ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals the ambulance 
service said 
a statement telephoned to ireland international a dublin news 
agency said we have visited the royal marines in kent in 
response to prime minister margaret thatchers visit to northern 
ireland nine days ago 
the ira said mrs thatcher went to the british province with a 
message of war but we still want peace and we want the british 
government to leave our country it was signed p oneill a nom 
de guerre the ira usually uses to claim responsibility for actions 
outside northern ireland 
irish prime minister charles haughey issued a statement in dublin 
condemning the attack calling it an outrage 
the last ira bomb attempt on the british mainland was in february 
when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in 
shropshire western england just before a bomb exploded one 
soldier was killed and nine wounded in an ira bomb attack on an army 
barracks in north london in august 1988 
in july 1982 eight soldiers died in ira bombings near the 
household cavalry barracks in central london and at a bandstand in 
the capitals regents park where an army band was playing three 
people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings 
the music school is the training center for young recruits who 
want to play in the seven royal marines bands up to 250 young men 
most between 16 and 20 are based at the school where they receive 
military and musical training 
the roof of janet minnocks house was torn off by the force of 
the blast and all the back windows were shattered 
the house has been blown to bits she said we are all 
shaken up 
mrs minnocks nextdoor neighbor heather hackett said she was 
standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of 
the explosion she was holding her 4monthold son luke in her arms 
with her other boys ben 3 and joshua 2 at her side 
i looked up from the sink and i just saw the whole building 
explode she said i told the boys to run and as joshua turned a 
slither of glass embedded itself in his back the whole window was 
blown across the kitchen i just screamed and ran out of the room 
the bang was so loud i thought the whole house was coming in 
sean minnock said i was asleep but woke up with a hell of a 
jolt 
as workers tried to patch holes in his roof he said the 
bedroom ceiling fell in on me i woke to find huge slabs of plaster 
on the bed and floor i wondered what it was as soon as i got up i 
looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the 
barracks

while hurricane hugos 135 mph wind 
roared outside mayor joseph p riley jr watched the fury it vented 
on his beloved 300yearold city 
riley city officials and a few reporters stayed in charlestons 
historic city hall through thursday night as the areas worst 
hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the civil 
war began 
late in the day there was hope hugo might spare charleston but 
the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward 
this city which had survived a number of near misses from great 
storms in recent years 
from the moment it became apparent hugo might strike the

secretary of state james a baker iii 
noting a new openness and candor raised expectations today of 
superpower arms control agreements as he opened talks in a lakeside 
lodge with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the sessions which wind up with a fishing date sunday morning 
are designed to produce a general time frame for president bushs 
first summit meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
sometime next year 
the soviets also are hinting they are in a mood to compromise on 
some tough arms control issues and baker posing for pictures with 
shevardnadze took an upbeat stance 
i believe and i think most would agree that there is a new 
opennes and candor in our relationship he said and i think 
that hopefully well be able to take some steps that are 
unprecedented 
shevardnadze asked to comment on bush administration statements 
that a summit would be held sometime next year said well be 
discussing this today 
baker said i think we will have an announcement before we 
leave about a general time frame for this 
the two men began the day with a discussion with close advisers 
then spoke briefly to reporters on the terrace of the jackson lake 
lodge overlooking the grand tetons mountain range and a pair of 
moose grazing on the flatlands below 
in a meeting with several dozen aides from both sides 
shevardnadze declared that it is high time to move from mutual 
understanding to mutual action because from our meetings i 
understand that conceptually there is a full understanding between 
the two sides 
baker suggested that they move immediately to another meeting 
with their closest advisers forgoing a planned session with the 
entire delegation and allowing working groups to negotiate on sharp 
reductions in nuclear chemical and conventional forces as well as 
other issues 
the two posed for pictures before starting their two days of 
talks deep in the rocky mountains that could set a course for 
further superpower weapons cutbacks 
 
baker suggested that they move immediately to another meeting 
with their closest advisers forgoing a planned session with the 
entire delegation and allowing working groups to negotiate on sharp 
reductions in nuclear chemical and conventional forces as well as 
other issues 
we want to preserve and strengthen the improving international 
environment baker said as he arrived thursday night 
shevardnadze told reporters on his arrival aboard a us air 
force jet that his meeting with president bush at the white house on 
thursday was a good beginning for the talks 
we see the emergence of good prospects the soviet minister 
said although bush said no summit was likely until near the middle 
of 1990 we need some fresh ideas and hopefully the good fresh air 
of wyoming will help to bring them forward shevardnadze said 
shevardnadze speaking to reporters after his meeting with bush 
said we have concluded that a summit is necessary there is no 
doubt about that 
bush said in an abctv interview thursday night that there would 
be a summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev asked whether 
it would be early next year he replied i wouldnt say early 
a top soviet arms control negotiator viktor karpov told 
reporters that a deadlock over star wars strategic defenses was 
blocking a proposed strategic arms reduction treaty start 
a senior us official however later said i dont think it 
is correct to say there is a deadlock 
the soviets want the americans to spell out how they will adhere 
to an agreement reached at the december 1987 summit that both sides 
will honor the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty that curbs 
strategic defenses 
karpov reviving an idea broached in 1988 said the soviet union 
sought agreed guidelines on the extent to which certain weapons 
could be tested in space an idea that the united states has spurned 
although no start deal is expected during the wyoming meeting 
and perhaps not for the summit next year baker and shevardnadze 
were expected to announce several other agreements before they fly 
to new york on sunday afternoon for a united nations meeting 
chemical weapons the two sides reportedly are close to an 
agreement to exchange information on their chemical weapons programs 
and to open stockpiles and plants to inspections by the other side 
baker and shevardnadze hope to resolve details including whether 
us chemical weapons stored in west germany would be covered 
human rights the two sides were to issue an agreement on 
expanding dialogue beyond traditional issues such as soviet 
emigration to new areas including occupational safety the 
environment and criminal justice 
ice curtain an agreement was expected to allow easier visits by 
alaskan eskimos to their distant kin in soviet siberia banned since 
the kremlin blocked passage across the bering strait in 1948 
although public attention centered on arms control and prospects 
for a summit baker and shevardnadze began their talks aboard the 
plane with a discussion of the soviet economy and the ethnic 
problems that were dealt with at a stormy soviet communist party 
central committee meeting in moscow this week 
shevardnadze discussed mistakes that had been made in the 
past and explained how moscow would grant some baltic republics 
greater economic autonomy said one senior us official

but councilman rodney ellis a leland friend said he would move 
forward with the idea which he hopes the council will consider next 
week even though most of the 50 calls his office received opposed 
the name change 
renaming the airport is a fitting tribute for someone who has 
served with distinction ellis said 
some council members said they felt torn between their desire to 
honor thee congressman whose plane crashed in ethiopia and to 
adhere constituents wishes 
councilman larry mckaskle said he could not support the change 
when his constituents were so overwhelmingly opposed councilman 
frank mancuso recalled similar moves to rename the airport 
louis macey a former councilman proposed to change the name 
to eisenhower airport mancuso said when kennedy was 
assassinated they wanted to name it after him theres going to be 
an outcry over this 
mancuso said a name change could be expensive because signs 
brochures and other materials would have to be reprinted 
mckaskle and mancuso said they would favor naming a street or 
park in lelands memory 
in washington sens lloyd bentsen and phil gramm introduced 
legislation thursday that would name a downtown houston federal

held at the sorbonne opened with a moment of silence to honor those 
killed june 34 when soldiers marched into beijing to crush the 
studentled movement hundreds and perhaps thousands died

shoulder to shoulder said wuer kaixi the 21yearold beijing 
university student who delivered compelling speeches in beijings 
tiananmen square at the height of the spring protests our 
strength continues we are hopeful be confident 
among those in the crowd of about 500 were photographer henri 
cartierbresson actor yves montand political leaders and human 
rights activists from throughout europe and four members of polands 
oncebanned solidarity movement which has inspired the chinese 
group 
we poles know the cost of freedom human rights fighting for 
these things takes a long time solidarity member zbigniew chlap 
told the packed university amphitheater we hope that before long 
it will be possible to establish in china this chinese solidarity 
delegates to the meeting were divided into four regional groups 
china europe asia and north america thirty delegates and more 
than 20 observers have come from the united states 
prominent chinese exiles including former communist party 
members artists intellectuals students and business people plan

leaders 
the group will be based in paris with branch offices in north 
america and asia where significant support has come from chinese 
living in taiwan and hong kong the group hopes to mobilize the 
support of more than 35 million chinese living outside their 
homeland

for an effective opposition party to communist rule in china if 
conditions ever permit exiles to go home

executives before the crackdown said the prodemocracy movement 
has moved from an emotional stage into a more deliberative one

organization and clear goals 
we can no longer depend on reform within the system to achieve 
a better china we must form an independent party to counterbalance 
the communists now is the time he said 
the federation which emphasizes that it is independent and 
nonviolent will push for international economic sanctions to 
intensify chinas economic difficulties with that it hopes to 
force the government toward political change

flight attendants want american airlines to weigh 
their job performance not their bodies 
a company policy requires overweight attendants to lose the 
excess weight at a rate of 1 pounds per week by a specified 
deadline if the attendant does not he or she is disciplined then 
suspended and finally fired 
attendants say the policy is the strictest among major carriers 
they also complain the standards are based on outdated tables for 
women of small or medium build and dont take childbirth or age 
into account 
we want the company to change its archaic discriminatory and 
unhealthy policy said colleen brenner vice president of the 
american association of professional flight attendants which 
represents 16000 american employees 
for example under the policy a 5foot2 american flight 
attendant cannot weigh more than 118 pounds 12 pounds less than 
the weight standards at pan am a 5foot6 attendant can weigh a 
maximum of 133 pounds 22 pounds less than pan am 
american spokesman ed stewart said the latest version of the 
guidelines resulted from a federal court settlement in the 1970s he 
defended the policy as a grooming standard that is important to the 
airlines image 
the attendants filed a federal lawsuit last year that will not be 
heard until 1991 negotiations between american and the union on the 
weight issue faltered about a month ago 
the union hopes to resume negotiations with a publicity campaign 
to draw attention to the dispute two billboards have gone up near 
dallasfort worth international airport with the slogan weigh my 
job performance not my body 
similar billboards are planned in new york chicago and los 
angeles

the acting no 2 official of the general 
services administration resigned abruptly after being told that 
adverse information about him had turned up in a security 
investigation gsa officials said friday 
the information surfaced a year ago but had been held from the 
man and other top gsa officials the gsa said 
richard g austin acting administrator of the agency that serves 
as the federal governments landlord said david godfrey submitted 
his resignation as chief of staff on sept 15 effective oct 15 
austin said he had several conversations with godfrey after 
learning of information about him that had been turned up in a 
security investigation 
dale bruce a gsa spokesman said the agencys security office 
had known about the information or at least a portion of it 
for a year but had not made it known to the administrators office 
i find this unacceptable austin said he said he has ordered 
two of his top assistants to review the process that we had in 
place and assure that a similar situation like this doesnt 
happen again 
bruce described the information only as what we call adverse 
information in his security file austin however said it 
included possible substantial outstanding debts incurred in 
texas 
godfrey was a midland texas banker real estate developer and 
business engaged in oil and gas operations before he became the 
regional administrator for the gsa in 1987 
a telephone call to godfreys office seeking comment was referred 
to the agencys public affairs office 
bruce said security personnel apparently withheld the information 
because with the 1988 presidential election coming up they 
thought the problem would go away and take care of itself as the 
new administration took over 
bruce said the matter first came to austins attention about a 
month ago when godfreys name came up for promotion from acting 
chief of staff to chief of staff he said the acting administrator 
sent the agencys general counsel and a representative of the gsa 
inspector general to texas to really look into the matter and 
they determined the seriousness of the problem 
the fact the information was not divulged over this period of 
time is totally reprehensible bruce said 
sally k marshall the gsas personnel director declined to 
comment

president bush taking a break from 
foreign policy concerns to help a republican gubernatorial 
candidate said today that liberal democrats cherish new taxes 
like moths drawn to a flame 
in a speech at fundraiser for gop candidate rep jim courter 
bush painted the gubernatorial contest as a choice between the old 
and new new jerseys 
he said republican leadership would champion the environment 
education jobs and the war on drugs and that new jerseys 
residents should oppose those liberal democrats who cherish new 
taxes like moths drawn to a flame 
this election will decide whether new jersey continues to have 
the kind of leadership which balances a sound economy and sound 
ecologyor whether its leadership says no to highter taxes and 
yes to extending the prosperity of the last eight years bush 
said 
organizers said the 500aperson event raised 700000 for 
courters uphill fight 
bush interrupted his concentration on foreign affairs to appear 
on courters behalf a day after meeting with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze to discuss ussoviet relations he was 
beginning a fourday trip that was to culminate with a united 
nations address on monday 
before leaving for new jersey bush attended a ceremomny at the 
justice department honoring that agencys 200th anniversary then he 
took the mike on an agriculture department radio callin show and 
fielded questions from farm broadcasters for about 15 minutes 
in his radio remarks bush reiterated his support for a reduction 
in the capital gains tax now headed for house action saying lower 
rates would greatly benefit farmers when they sell equipment or 
their farms 
half of all farms sold will be eligible for an exclusion from 
paying higher capital gains rates under the measure supported by the 
administration bush said 
courter is opposed by democratic rep james florio in the contest 
to succeed republican gov thomas kean 
florio a liberal democrat who ran a close campaign in 1981 
against kean has been given a doubledigit lead over courter in 
public opinion surveys kean is not seeking reelection 
the nov 6 election marks one of two gubernatorial races in the 
nation this year the other is in virginia 
todays visit by bush was part of a hardfought effort to keep 
the governors seat in the republican column and the president was 
arriving as both florio and courter debuted their first television 
ads 
the campaign has been marked by controversy over abortion and 
homosexual issues 
florio favors the right to abortion while courter has been 
accused of vacillating on the issue he has said he personally 
opposes abortion but would not force his views on state residents 
courter has also rankled homosexuals by saying he supports 
legislation to bar them from jobs that involve children although he 
later softened the comment by saying he would not push for such 
changes in the law 
bush will spend the night at his vacation home in kennebunkport 
maine and then take a day trip saturday to boston where he will 
speak to a luncheon of the archdiocese of boston catholic lawyers 
guild 
on monday he will travel to new york for his first speech as 
president to the united nations general assembly 
aides have been working on the speech and were expected to factor 
in the results of the shevardnadze meetings shevardnadze and 
secretary of state james a baker iii headed to wyoming on thursday 
night to continue the discussions that began at the white house 
a range of arms control issues were on the agenda as well as 
laying the groundwork for a superpower summit meeting between bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev at a yettobedecided time 
while at the united nations where bush served as us ambassador 
in the mid1970s the president will meet with numerous ambassadors 
and ministers as well as un general secretary javier perez de 
cuellar 
bush also will host a luncheon for heads of delegations and a 
reception for dignitaries on monday evening

federal and state investigators inspected a 
delivery trucks brakes today to see if they could have failed 
before it rolled past a stop sign and rammed a school bus into a 
watery pit killing 19 students 
at least 64 people were injured after the bus was struck by a dr 
pepper truck thursday morning four students remained in critical 
condition at hospitals this morning including one who was 
unconscious and on a respirator officials said 
the national transportation safety board and the texas department 
of public safety planned to inspect the bus and the truck throughout 
the day said dps sgt israel pacheco 
theyre checking the mechanical condition of the vehicles 
particularly since the dr pepper truck driver was claiming that the 
brakes failed pacheco said 
both drivers had records of traffic violations the dps said 
truck driver ruben perez 25 was convicted of speeding in 1987 bus 
driver gilberto pena 46 was ticketed for running a red light in 
march 1988 but records didnt indicate whether he was driving a 
school bus at the time 
perez was treated and released thursday and pena remained in a 
hospital today in stable condition officials said 
the dps said today that the number of people on the bus was 86 
including the driver rather than 81 as previously reported pacheco 
said several students who escaped the bus with minor injuries walked 
away from the accident and were not immediately counted 
the bus was designed to carry 83 people said herman light 
quality assurance director for the manufacturer blue bird body co 
of fort valley ga 
pacheco said state law allows for one student to be standing for 
every student seated on the bus 
hidalgo county district attorney rene guerra who visited the 
scene said the case will be presented to the next grand jury 
presently there may be some criminal negligence here he 
said it might possibly be involuntary manslaughter if 
recklessness can be attributed to the driver or the company 
the truck passed a state inspection last week according to

the state department on friday accused panama 
of engaging in widespread repression alleging that gen manuel 
antonio noriega is refusing to cooperate with an organization of 
american states mandate for a human rights inspection 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said the noriegaled government 
has decided not to allow the interamerican human rights commission 
to visit panama until after nov 1 
this move is clearly designed to ensure that the commissions 
report on panama wont be ready for consideration by an oas foreign 
ministers meeting that convenes nov 13 in washington boucher said 
the oas issued a call aug 23 for the commission to visit panama 
at the earliest possible date he said 
while noriega uses delaying tactics to try to minimize adverse 
publicity the human rights situation in panama continues to be 
atrocious basic human rights such as freedom of the press and 
freedom of assembly are denied boucher said 
scores of political prisoners remain in regime jails we and 
the rest of the international community look forward to hearing the 
commissions report and we will continue to press for the 
restoration of human rights and democracy in panama

about 25000 activists of all 
races marched friday to protest the whiteled governments policies 
and thousands of women planned to defy a government ban and hold 
another rally over the weekend 
militant black unions launched a twoweek nationwide consumer 
boycott of whiteowned stores and told their 15 million members to 
refuse to work overtime for the next four weeks 
union leaders said the noovertime protest could cut industrial 
production by 20 percent or force white employers to hire thousands 
of additional black workers the unions are protesting a 
controversial labor law that was enacted last year despite vehement 
objections from black unions 
some of the original hardline provisions of the labor relations 
amendment act were modified but unions still object to sections 
that prohibit sympathy strikes restrict the frequency of strikes 
against a particular company and make it easier for unions to be 
held liable for strikerelated losses 
in durban south africas largest port and thirdlargest city an 
estimated 15000 people including members of the white city 
council joined a peaceful antigovernment march to city hall 
activists raised the green black and gold banner of the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement on the flagpole at 
durbans city hall and police allowed it to remain during the rally 
we ask president fw de klerk and law and order minister 
adriaan vlok to come down from their ivory towers and join the 
people said jay naidoo secretarygeneral of the 1millionmember 
congress of south african trade unions 
the congress is leading the consumer boycott along with the 
national congress of trade unions which claims 500000 black 
members 
police raided 11 offices of the congress around the country 
friday and confiscated documents related to the boycott the labor 
federation said 
meanwhile about 10000 protesters led by the rev allan boesak 
staged a similar march in oudtshoorn a city of about 40000 people 
300 miles east of cape town 
it was by far the largest protest ever in oudtshoorn center of 
the ostrichfarming industry and the scene of frequent 
confrontations between police and activists 
were asking for trouble just to be black in a conservative 
white town like this boesak said 
but he added its just about time that places like this take 
notice of the fact that the march for freedom has begun and nobody 
not even oudtshoorn will turn us around 
after a 55mile march the protesters presented police with a 
list of demands including a halt to alleged harassment of activists 
a coalition of antiapartheid womens groups vowed to ignore a 
government ban and proceed with a march saturday on government 
headquarters in pretoria 
justice minister kobie coetsee said the government obtained a 
court injunction to stop the march because organizers did not apply 
for approval two white supremacist groups sought and received 
permission to hold rallies saturday in pretoria 
the government for the first time in decades has allowed 
several protest marches this month and says it will not disrupt 
peaceful demonstrations that have been authorized in advance 
naidoo and other union leaders urged all blacks to join the 
consumer boycott which they said was part of a broadbased national 
defiance campaign launched in early august 
there was no immediate word from retail organizations about the 
extent of the boycott 
however department stores in the southern cities of east london 
and king williams town where the boycott began early were 
reported virtually deserted thursday 
the defiance campaign has included protests of segregation laws 
as well as marches in several cities 
the marches had been peaceful until thursday when some black 
youths smashed windows of shops and vehicles in the southeastern 
city of pietermaritzburg 
no injuries and only one arrest were reported but progovernment 
media gave headline treatment to the incident 
the government said friday that organizers of protest marches 
must request permission at least seven days in advance leaders of 
most of the recent marches have refused to seek a permit but the 
government approved them anyway

president bush cleared the way friday for the 
distribution of federal disaster relief money for some mainland 
areas devastated by hurricane hugo approving a request for aid by 
south carolina gov carroll campbell jr 
the federal assistance coordinated by the federal emergency 
management agency will included money to help states clear roads 
restore power and other essentials as well provide lowinterest 
loans and in some cases grants for repairs 
much of the water damage to residences is covered by federal 
flood insurance held by many people who live in low coastal areas 
although fema officals said not all people have such insurance wind 
damage normally is covered by homeowners insurance they noted 
south carolina has a lot of damage but the infastructure is 
going to come up pretty quickly grant peterson associate 
director of fema told a news conference 
peterson who has been in touch with state officials affected by 
the hurricane praised local authorities for evacuating most people 
along the shoreline hit by hugo 
their actions have saved literally hundreds of lives he said 
bush signed the disaster declaration for south carolina even as 
the extent of the destruction remained unclear similar requests for 
federal assistance were expected from other states affected 
peterson said he had not yet received a detailed assessment of 
damages along the south carolina coast where hugo roared ashore but 
said it already is clear this hurricane is going to be 
expensive 
as hugo turned northward friday after coming ashore in the 
charleston sc area federal relief officials were continuing 
their efforts to help the virgin islands and puerto rico which had 
been pummeled by the storm earlier in the week 
st croix in the virgin islands is devastated absolutely 
devastated said peterson he detailed the difficulties relief 
officials have had in restoring electrical power to the island 
saying that 90 percent of the power polls have been toppled and the 
generating plant itself is in jeopardy 
bush earlier this week declared both the virgin islands and 
puerto rico as disaster areas making them eligible for federal 
assistance peterson said that 143 million has been earmarked for 
st croix and st thomas and 11 million for puerto rico 
as part of the relief activities still under way according to 
fema officials military transports on friday were airlifting to the 
islands 
four 750 killowatt generators for st croix to restore 
electrical power and two mobile air traffic control facilities to 
the islands airport so it can be reopened for commercial service 
more than 8000 blankets donated by the red cross basic medical 
supplies and 600 rolls of plastic sheeting for temporary roofing on 
damaged buildings 
a shipment of 100000 readytoeat meals with more expected to 
be shipped later 
earlier this week bush directed the military to help local 
officials restore order on st croix where there had been 
widespread looting 
peterson meanwhile said femas disaster relief fund is down to 
about 40 million but he said congress has appropriated 100 
million for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 and if thats not 
enough the agency will go to capitol hill and ask for more

rental housing is so scarce in vail these days 
that mayor kent rose says he may be forced to resign and move 
roses predicament is a glaring example of what some are calling 
the worst housing crunch ever in vail with more than 5000 seasonal 
employees expected to arrive in the next two months virtually no 
rental properties are available 
id like to stay in town and continue what im doing said 
rose a structural engineer ive got two more years left on the 
council but deeper than that ive been here for about 18 years 
now and would like to be able to live in the community that ive 
invested in this is really hard 
rose learned just before labor day that the townhouse he has 
rented for more than a year is up for sale 
unwilling to risk having to find a new home during the ski season 
when rental property is next to impossible to find rose gave 
himself until the end of this month to find a home for his family 
if he doesnt find a place rose said he may have to look for 
housing outside vail which would force him to resign as mayor 
according to some property managers rental costs have risen by 
10 percent to 20 percent during the past year and although there 
are tiny efficiency apartments that rent for 400 to 600 the 
average rent for a twobedroom condominium runs closer to 800 or 
900 
i dont know if the seasonal workers are going to find a 
place to live rose said i guess the old cordwood theory 
applies stack them in as tight as you can get them

prime minister geoffrey palmer 
flies to new york next week to address the united nations and is 
hoping the visit also will heal the rift between his antinuclear 
nation and the united states 
new zealanders feel the diplomatic cold shoulder they have been 
given by successive us administrations has gone on too long since 
they banned american warships from their ports in 1984 
foreign minister russell marshall told reporters palmers trip 
could prove the catalyst to let new zealand out of the diplomatic 
sin bin 
almost every other country in the world except libya iran north 
korea and new zealand have access to top levels of the us 
administration he complained 
in an interview this week palmer said he will not seek 
appointments with us officials but sent a clear signal that 
unofficial contacts would be welcome 
as part of the process of meeting various people at the united 
nations obviously i will be having bilateral talks with a number of 
different government officials he said adding he would meet any 
americans if they seek a meeting with me 
but palmer said he is not disposed to go cap in hand seeking 
higherlevel access in washington 
the american administration has not warmed to our policy of 
nuclearfree new zealand he said they have decided the anzus 
australia new zealand us military alliance should be 
inoperative as a result of that policy 
i think they have really locked themselves into a position they 
cant easily retreat from but we accept their position 
palmer 47 once emigrated to the united states he lived there 
for six years graduated in law from the university of chicago and 
was professor of law at the university of iowa and university of 
virginia he has a son studying law at yale and will visit him there 
during his fourday stay starting oct 2 
weve got many shared democratic values free speech and common 
attitudes on a lot of international issues palmer said of the two 
countries im very fond of the united states i love its 
diversity and its pluralism and its commitment to free speech i 
always quote to americans when they talk about our nuclear policy 
the words of patrick henry give me liberty or give me death 
new zealand banned us warships because washington refuses to 
confirm or deny whether they carry atomic weapons 
palmer said he will address the general assembly on the dangers 
of driftnet fishing in the pacific a matter on which he thinks new 
zealand and the united states have a common interest 
he said he would be speaking for small island states of the 
southwest pacific whose stability economies and environment are 
threatened 
japanese and taiwanese trawlers set nets up to 30 miles long that 
are environmentally disastrous catching whales seals birds 
everything he said 
drift net fishing is depleting tuna and salmon stocks a matter 
of concern to americans and canadians he said 
president bushs attitude to environmental issues encourages me 
a great deal said palmer i welcome the greening of america if 
i can put it that way

a pair of 10cent stamps found on a 
142yearold letter are among the first us stamps issued and could 
be worth as much as 1 million collectors said 
the philatelic foundation a nonprofit stampauthentication 
agency based in new york has certified that a 142yearold envelope 
mailed to the marion county clerk on july 2 1847 is the earliest 
known use of a us stamp 
the discovery of this historic rarity was the stuff philatelic 
lore is made of and rivaled the greatest finds in the history of 
stamp collecting the foundation said in a statement 
it may well be the closest philatelists will get to an actual 
firstday cover foundation chairman roberto m rosende said 
the two black stamps which picture george washington are known 
to collectors as us 2 and first were issued on july 1 1847 in 
new york they were among the first us stamps issued to 
postmasters to replace handinked impressions as proof of postage 
paid 
the stamps and their envelope are major assets of the estates of 
two indianapolis men delmere b blackburn and dr harry d mark 
blackburn died in april 1987 and mark died last month both estates 
are pending in the probate division of marion superior court 
the two men shared ownership of the rarities which they 
discovered in some books they had purchased at the estate sale in 
the late 1960s of indianapolis lawyer john w becker 
the stamps will be sold through a national dealer said john f 
sullivan jr an attorney representing one of the estates 
obviously the price will be whatever a willing buyer will pay 
but we think it could be worth 1 million he said 
stamp experts including eric scott part owner of the stamp shop 
in indianapolis believe sullivans estimate is excessive some say 
the envelope could bring as much as 200000

checchi of northwest decision 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
transportation secretary samuel skinner today 
told the new owners of northwest airlines his decision on the 
departments fitness review of the airline a department spokesman 
said but an announcement was not due until next week 
skinner has the option of pulling the airlines operating 
license but there has been no indication that this is likely 
transportation department spokesman hal paris said a decision has 
been made in the departments review of the takeover by wings 
holdings ltd of northwests parent company nwa inc he said 
skinner met this morning with california investor alfred checchi 
who heads wings 
paris said results of the departments fitness review of the 4 
billion takeover would likely be made public next week 
he said the departments public affairs office had been given no 
details of the meeting but skinner would have told checchi whether 
any restrictions might be put on the airlines operating license 
because of the buyout 
paris said conditions could include requiring the airline to 
furnish regular financial reports and putting restrictions on the 
carriers management 
skinner informed checchi of his decision before making it public 
because he didnt want mr checchi reading about the findings in 
the paper the spokesman said 
checchi led a group including klm royal dutch airlines that 
agreed in june to pay 121 a share for nwa northwest is the 
nations fourthlargest airline 
skinner has expressed concern about leverage buyouts and 
increasing foreign investment in us airlines the checchi takeover 
saddles northwest with 31 billion in debt 
without mentioning northwest skinner said in a speech to the 
international aviation club tuesday that he would make adjustments 
in a heavily leveraged airlines operating certificate if necessary 
to protect the public interest 
or if absolutely necessary he added and i hope that 
doesnt take place we will revoke the certificate 
the justice department also investigated the northwest sale but 
did not raise any objections said spokeswoman amy brown 
the departments review was prompted by antitrust issues raised 
by klms interest in the sale brown said

the pilot and copilot of a jetliner that 
careened into the east river had their licenses suspended and have 
agreed to be interviewed by investigators who hope they can explain 
why they aborted their takeoff federal officials said today 
information recovered from flight data and cockpit voice 
recorders failed to explain the crash which killed two women 
passengers officials said there were reports of the pilot 
vanishing and the copilot claiming his colleague had been acting 
irrationally 
spokesmen for both the federal aviation administration and the 
national transportation safety board said thursday that they did not 
know where the cockpit crew went after their usair boeing 737 ran 
off a runway at laguardia airport late wednesday 
but a spokesman for the ntsb which is running the investigation 
said today that the absence of the pilot and copilot was not 
unusual and had not hampered the probe 
its not at all unusual for us not to interview a pilot on the 
same day as the accident spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said in this 
case he said investigators arranged on thursday afternoon through 
the pilots union and the airline to interview the pilots 
pilot michael martin and copilot constantine kleissaf have the 
right to decline ntsb interviews but if they do the ntsb can 
subpoena them said rachel halterman an ntsb spokeswoman 
weve tried to contact him but we have not been able to do 
so fred farrar a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration said thursday 
he added there was no indication of why he was aborting until 
we know why the guy aborted the takeoff we have no way of knowing 
the cause of the accident 
farrar said today that the two had their licenses suspended and 
would have to go through a recertification procedure before they 
could fly again he said he did not know if the license suspension 
was for the crash or for not being available after the crash 
the tail section of the jet was lifted from the water this 
morning the port authority said 
the crash of flight 5050 late wednesday split the fuselage of the 
plane which was headed for charlotte nc the tail of the plane 
was partly submerged 10 feet from the runway while the nose skidded 
onto a trestle in the river that held runway lights 
of the 59 survivors including all six crew members 45 people 
were treated at hospitals and eight remained hospitalized as of 
thursday according to usair 
local lawenforcement officials were probing reports that the 
copilot told port authority police shortly after the crash that the 
pilot was behaving oddly in the cockpit 
we suspect martins behavior may have played a part in the 
accident a law enforcement source said 
investigators quoted kleissaf 29 as saying that he was at the 
controls of the jetliner as it roared down the runway and that 
martin started mumbling and acting irrationally newspapers 
reported today 
the new york times said the copilot gave his report to port 
authority police but port authority spokesman john hughes said he 
knew of no interviews that agency police had with the crew 
usair chairman edwin colodny declined to discuss any possible 
causes of the crash saying the ntsb had jurisdiction 
the captain is taking advice of his own counsel colodny said 
at a news conference 
farrar said it was unclear whether the pilot or copilot was at 
the controls during the crash 
weve tried to contact the pilot but we have not been able to 
do so said farrar there was no indication of why he was 
aborting until we know why the guy aborted the takeoff we have no 
way of knowing the cause of the accident 
the cockpit recorder had no noises or voices that suggested 
there was any problem with the takeoff or why the takeoff was 
aborted said james kolstad acting chairman of the ntsb 
the flight data show the plane swerved slightly instead of moving 
straight down the runway and showed some deviations in rudder 
movement kolstad said but it was not immediately clear how that 
might have affected takeoff 
the pilot had flown 737s for only two months and the copilot was 
in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time the times reported 
quoting airline industry officials 
officials said whoever was at the controls of the plane radioed 
the control tower that he was aborting takeoff moments before the 
jet slid into the east river 
survivors clung to the wings of the broken aircraft or grasped 
driftwood after the plane slid into the water 
the pilot seemed to be accelerating but didnt have enough 
power to get the plane up passenger larry martin said he put 
on the brakes the plane took a dip and the next thing i knew all 
hell broke loose 
stunned passengers scrambled out doors and onto wings some 
escaped down an emergency chute and found themselves in about 25 
feet of water 
flight attendants threw them seat cushions which are designed to 
float 
police scuba divers freed some 15 people from the cabin while 
rescuers in boats scooped people from the water and wings 
we just grabbed on to a big piece of wood and held on for dear 
life said passenger tom newberry 27 who was heading to north 
carolina to be married saturday 
police said the two passengers killed were betsy brogan 37 of 
gray tenn and her motherinlaw alyce brogan 69 of vixton va 
port authority officials said light rain at the time of the crash 
was not a factor the port authority of new york and new jersey 
operates the airport 
the plane was delivered in january and had no history of 
mechanical problems usair spokeswoman nancy vaughan said 
in june the faa ordered most boeing 737400s grounded because of 
two incidents in which engines failed airlines were ordered to 
replace certain engine parts

gov bob martinez on friday ordered an 
abortion clinic closed following reports of botched abortions and 
directed a state agency to come up with tougher rules to protect 
women at private clinics 
martinez denied he was using the situation to enact emergency 
regulations on abortion just weeks before the legislature takes up 
the issue in special session 
this is a pure prohealth issue martinez said this is for 
the health of individuals irregardless of philosophy on the 
substance of the abortion issue 
yet in a letter to health and rehabilitative services secretary 
greg coler the republican governor said conditions at the miami 
clinic are precisely why i have called for increased regulation of 
abortion clinics to protect the health of women 
martinez told coler to begin steps to revoke the license of the 
womens service center following a report in the miami herald about 
improper abortions by unlicensed physicians resulting in ruptured 
uteri and hysterectomies 
there is no legal reason no health reason for this order 
said susan hoffman director of the center weve done nothing 
against the law weve helped thousands of women i see this as 
totally ludicrous 
she said she had received no official notice from the agency on a 
license revocation 
peter dunbar the governors general counsel said any emergency 
regulations would be in effect for 90 days after that the rules 
would be subject to public hearings and health and rehabilitative 
services board approval to become permanent 
by that time the legislature will have decided whether to go 
along with martinezs proposals to further restrict access to 
abortions the session is scheduled for oct 1013 
neither martinez nor dunbar would be specific about the kinds of 
regulations being sought but both said they would be designed to 
protect the health of women seeking abortions not to restrict their 
access to an abortion at any of the 47 licensed private clinics in 
the state 
were going to look at creatively working under the authority 
of the existing statute and do as much as we can to fit that 
dunbar said 
a prochoice republican legislator rep carol hanson said she 
supports the governors action as long as it is not extreme 
theres a whole conglomeration of standards that we could

cardinal jozef glemp leader of the 
countrys roman catholic church on friday announced significant 
progress toward ending the dispute over a convent at auschwitz 
his remarks came one day after jewish leaders in london reported 
glemp agreed in a letter to move the convent from the perimeter of 
the former nazi death camp in southern poland on tuesday the 
vatican issued a statement saying it should be moved 
on his return from london on friday glemp spoke to reporters and 
briefly praised british jewish leaders for their calm approach 
to the controversy 
that is why there is significant progress that will 
influence positively the conclusion of this argument he said 
he did not refer to the london letter and reporters did not ask 
him about it however he said we understand better what it means 
in the jewish sense to respect a place that is sacred 
glemp noted jews and christians have different traditions about 
cemeteries with christians more likely to put places of worship at 
burial grounds 
the primate had opposed moving the convent despite an agreement 
between catholic cardinals and jewish leaders that the carmelite 
nuns would be moved to an interfaith cultural center away from the 
camp the center has not been built 
although the polish church has made no official statement all 
indications were that glemp bowed to the wishes of polishborn pope 
john paul ii and will no longer oppose the move 
stefan wilkanowicz acting as a mediator in the conflict on 
behalf of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said thursday night 
that the decision to move the convent had been settled 
the convent angered many jews who suspect the catholic church of 
trying to insert itself into what they regard as a jewish 
catastrophe of the 4 million who died at auschwitz 25 million 
were jews 
the solidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza friday published for the 
first time in poland a 1987 agreement in which the church originally 
agreed to move the convent it also published the text of the 
vatican statement which had not been prominently carried by state 
media 
auschwitz could be considered the biggest cemetery in the 
history of the jewish nation the newspaper said 
the church failed to meet a feb 22 deadline to relocate the 
nuns that deadline was in the 1987 agreement signed in geneva by 
jewish leaders and archbishop franciszek macharski of krakow 
after protests macharski last month said the 1987 commitment 
could not be fulfilled because of the aggressive atmosphere 
the glemp letter was made public in london by sir sigmund 
sternberg a philanthropist who heads the international council of 
christians and jews glemp handed the letter to sternberg at a 
dinner at the polish embassy in london on tuesday 
it said it is essential not only to move the convent outside 
the perimeter of the site but also to set up the new cultural 
center 
shimon cohen a spokesman for the chief rabbi of britain lord 
immanuel jakobovits said the letter will undoubtedly be a 
substantial contribution to restoring catholicjewish harmony

president bush trying to help 
republicans score a comefrombehind victory in the new jersey 
governors race portrayed democrats on friday as soft on crime 
eager to raise taxes and champions of the failed policies of the 
1970s 
in a sharply partisan speech bush said there was a lot at stake 
in the nov 7 election the future versus the past policies that 
work versus policies that dont a better future for our children 
or one of lost opportunity 
the race one of two governors contests this year pits 
republican rep jim courter against democrat james florio to succeed 
gop gov thomas kean the other gubernatorial contest is in virginia 
i am the underdog in this race courter said acknowleging he 
trails florio in public opinion polls 
florio a liberal democrat ran a close race against kean in 
1981 the governor is not seeking reelection 
the failed policies of the 1970s just arent good enough 
bush said not for new jersey not for the united states of 
america theyre not good enough to tackle drugs or crime or to 
protect the environment or do better as a nation in education 
theyre not good enough for our kids 
bush campaigned for courter at a state republican fundraising 
luncheon before flying to maine for a weekend at his seaside 
compound in kennebunkport 
before settling in at his vacation home bush planned to make a 
brief stop at a tree farm in nearby wells to make a new pitch in his 
campaign for a reduction in capital gains taxes which are imposed 
on profits from sales of real estate stocks and other assets 
bush using a tree farm to advance his campaign for a capital 
gains tax cut because tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on 
profits from their sales 
thats because trees are considered tangible assets rather than 
merchandise 
the administration contends that many tree farms are small 
marginal operations before 1986 tax reform act tree farmers could 
pay the thenlower rate on capital gains and make a go of it now 
with the higher rates many are going bankrupt the administration 
contends 
bush told the gop fundraiser that he rejected democrats charges 
that his plan was a tax break for the rich it is a tax adjustment 
that is going to create jobs in america and that is why i am going 
to continue to fight for it 
bush will make a threehour excursion saturday to speak a 
luncheon of the archdiocese of boston catholic lawyers guild 
on monday he will travel to new york for his first speech as 
president to the united nations general assembly he will return to 
washington late that night after hosting a reception and dinner for 
un dignataries 
sponsors said the new jersey luncheon raised 700000 for the 
gop bush told the audience 
in new jersey bush told republicans this election will decide 
whether new jersey builds on what you began eight years ago or 
whether it risks everything by returning to the past whether new 
jersey has the inspired leadership it needs to win the war on drugs 
and crime or whether it reverts to failed social policies that 
blame everyone but the criminal 
this election will decide whether new jersey continues to have 
the kind of leadership which balances a sound economy and a sound 
ecology or whether its leadership says no to higher taxes and 
yes to extending the prosperity of the last eight years bush 
said 
he said republican leadership would champion the environment 
education jobs and the war on drugs and that new jerseys 
residents should oppose those liberal democrats who cherish new 
taxes like moths drawn to some kind of a candle 
the old new jerseys attitude was if one tax didnt work try 
another one he said 
the gubernatorial campaign has been marked by controversy over 
abortion and homosexual issues 
florio favors the right to abortion while courter has been 
accused of vacillating on the issue he has said he personally 
opposes abortion but would not force his views on state residents 
courter has also angered homosexuals by saying he supports laws 
to bar them from jobs that involve children although he later 
softened the comment by saying he would not push for such changes

christian leader gen michel aoun on 
friday accepted an arab peace plan aimed at ending a blood bath 
between his forces and syrian troops that has claimed almost 1000 
lives in the past six months 
we declare to our people all our people in the liberated as 
well as the syrian occupied areas that september 23rd is the 
beginning of the chance to achieve peace aoun said in a 
twominute television address 
syria which controls 70 percent of lebanon and its lebanese 
allies have already accepted the arab league plan 
aoun said he agreed to the arab league plan which begins with a 
ceasefire after appeals from the international community all 
the arabs and all the friends and in line with the lebanese 
peoples desire 
immediately after aoun spoke a television announcer reported 
that two mortar rounds had crashed into a christian army position 
above beirut but they caused no casualties or damage 
several previous ceasefires called by the arab league have 
failed to end the fighting and aoun has blamed the violations on 
the syrians 
the shrunken population of beirut appeared to take the call for 
peace seriously many citizens took to the streets and began firing 
guns in the air in a traditional expression of joy 
others drove through streets blanketed with debris honking their 
car horns 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said we hope that this will result quickly in a ceasefire by all 
the parties to the conflict 
aoun conveyed his acceptance of the plan to arab league envoy 
lakhdar ibrahimi during a meeting in his bunkeroffice under the 
bombravaged presidential palace 
after the 40minute meeting aoun told reporters we wish 
success to the peace plan weve given peace a chance and god 
willing there will be peace 
the results will be positive if the intentions are sincere if 
not we reserve the right to take proper decisions at the proper 
time he said 
ibrahimi assistant secretarygeneral of the 22member arab 
league said after his meeting with aoun that the lebanese as of 
now will be able to reopen their shops go to schools and return to 
their homes about 90 percent of beiruts 15 million people have 
fled the city 
ibrahimi an algerian diplomat was asked by an arab league 
committee to head a security committee to supervise the ceasefire 
and monitor ships to ensure that no weapons reach lebanese factions 
aoun initially said he would not send a representative to such a 
committee because it did not include a syrian member aoun saw that 
as submitting to syrias efforts to portray the crisis as one among 
lebanese factions even though syrian forces in lebanon are the main 
opponent of the christians 
but france and the united states traditional backers of the 
christians and several arab governments voiced support for the 
peace plan and urged aoun to be flexible to avoid further bloodshed 
ibrahimi arrived in beirut on sunday a day after the peace plan 
was announced by the arab committee 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads a 
syrianbacked cabinet vying for legitimacy with aouns christian 
government and parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem have accepted the plan 
shiite militia cheiftain nabih berri and druse warlord walid 
jumblatt syrias main allies in lebanon also endorsed it 
the plans first six points focus on the ceasefire and steps to 
enforce it they include a call for the lifting of blockades on 
ports and the countrys only international airport a halt in 
weapons imports and propaganda campaigns and a plea to foreign 
countries to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to lebanon 
the last clause calls for a meeting of the 99seat parliament on 
sept 30 outide lebanon to discuss political reforms to statisfy 
moslem demands for an equal share of power with the christians 
christians have dominated the government legislature army and 
judiciary since independence from france in 1943 when they were the 
majority 
moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the population 
of 4 million even though there has been no official census since 
1932 
aoun has complained that the arab plan makes no reference to a 
syrian withdrawal from the country and ibrahimi made no reference 
to that in his statement 
the syrians maintain 40000 troops in moslem regions under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate 
before ibrahimis meeting with aoun police reported that two 
people were killed and seven wounded in artillery and rockets duels 
in and around beirut overnight 
that brought the overall toll to 929 killed and 2738 wounded 
since the christiansyrian confrontation erupted march 8 it has 
developed into one of the most destructive rounds of violence since 
the civil war broke out in april 1975

the rush of ethnic germans from eastern 
europe promises greater wealth a baby boom stable taxes and a 
steady work force to power west germanys economy a study released 
friday predicts 
the governmentcommissioned study from the german economics 
institute warned of shortterm problems including higher 
unemployment and housing shortages but said positive economic 
effects should be felt by 1993 
west germany already enjoys one of the worlds most vibrant 
economies and experts now speak of a second wirtschaftswunder 
the postwar economic miracle that built an industrial giant from the 
rubble of the third reich 
immigrant contributions to the gross national product a measure 
of national wealth could be as high as 79 billion by the year 
2000 the colognebased institute said 
its nearly 400page report carefully skirted consideration of how 
the picture would change if the two german states were reunited or 
if the recent stream of refugees were to continue or accelerate 
government spokesman hans klein told reporters that 235000 
ethnic germans from the soviet union poland and other east bloc 
nations have arrived in west germany this year more than in all of 
1988 in addition more than 100000 east germans have escaped or 
emigrated to west germany 
because bonn recognizes east germans as citizens they are not 
counted as immigrants with other ethnic germans arriving from 
abroad 
some government officials predict as many as 500000 ethnic 
germans will arrive by years end 
klein described the stream as a great and multifaceted gain 
but he reiterated it is not the political goal of this 
government that all ethnic germans from abroad come to us 
bonn officials have been pressing east european leaderships to 
work toward improvements to make life better for ethnic germans 
abroad 
while east germans are a minority among ethnic germans migrating 
to west germany attention has focused on them because of hungarys 
decision to open its border with austria and thereby provide an 
escape route to the west 
about 18500 east germans have fled through hungary to west 
germany since sept 10 at least another 7000 escaped illegally 
through hungary in the weeks leading up to the mass release 
the economic report predicted the influx of east europeans 
excluding east germans would fall between 2 million and 35 million 
over the next 10 years 
it said 14 million immigrants refugees and exiles of german 
origin have come to west germany since the end of world war ii 
they account for more than a quarter of west germanys population 
of 61 million 
institute director otto vogel said the immigrants bring with 
them middle and longterm improvements for growth and wellbeing a 
stronger public financial picture stabilization of the social 
security system a rejuvenation of the population urgent relief of 
manual labor shortages and in general a more flexible job market

a houston judge and religious leader who was 
president bushs choice to head the office of government ethics has 
been removed from consideration for the post as the result of an fbi 
background check white house officials said friday 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said that paul 
pressler was taken out of the running because of a personal 
situation unearthed by the fbi probe and not because there was any 
evidence of wrongdoing 
pressler is a houston civil court judge and a national leader of 
the fundamentalist movement within the southern baptist convention 
pressler who was in san francisco on friday could not be 
reached for comment a woman answering the phone at his hotel 
extension said hes not taking any calls from reporters 
the washington post which first reported that presslers name 
had been removed from consideration in a story in fridays editions 
cited ethics problems in the background of the man bush wanted 
to run the ethics office 
white house officials confirmed the account but said without 
further elaboration that the problem was one of a potential ethical 
problem he just wasnt the right man for the job said one 
official 
thus the job remains vacant even though bush made the post a 
major issue in his 1988 election campaign and promised to name a 
tough administrator to head the office shortly after taking office 
last january 
its a position of great importance for the president were 
looking for the best candidate said deputy press secretary alixe 
glen 
presslers name was sent to the federal bureau of investigation 
in july for a routine background check 
the ethics position part of the office of personnel management 
reviews personal financial filings of federal oficials and 
interprets conflictofinterest laws and rules 
the post said that pressler had been a controversial candidate 
for the post even before the fbi check because of the key role he 
played in the fundamentalist movement one that would buy more 
animosity than good will 
during his campaign bush made ethicsingovernment a major 
issue in a july 1988 campaign speech for instance he said he 
would enforce an exacting code of conduct 
to give effect to this commitment i will establish an office 
at the highest level of government that of senior counselor to the 
president whose first responsibility will be ethics

editors note sam dimeo a reporter who lives on the island of 
st croix watched as looters stripped stores bare after hurricane 
hugo devastated the island leaving many homeless and hungry here 
is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hurricane hugo taught 
me two lessons there is little you can do to prepare for the 
devastation of a killer storm and a hurricane can bring out the 
worst in people as easily as it mows down trees and homes 
the first lesson i learned while holed up with my wife and two 
children in a small bathroom for seven hours with only a mattress 
covering the doorway the mattress was sucked in and out by the wind 
like a pumping heart 
the house shook the roof splintered and through it all the wind 
howled it was a lesson of fear fear for the safety of my 
7yearold son my 3yearold daughter and my wife 
i kept thinking of tornados hurricanes spawn tornados 
the tornado never came but when dawn arrived it was a shock to 
see so much devastation including my own house in ruins 
an inspection of the island showed that virtually no telephone or 
power pole was left untouched by hugos wrath i drove my small car 
in and around downed poles trees roofs and assorted pieces of 
roofs 
the real blow came when my neighbor and i drove into the business 
area of town and witnessed the frenzied looting 
these were not mobs or rioters or crazy people out to hurt maim 
and kill they were simply sick people stealing first from hardware 
stores and supermarkets then from any business they could find 
they werent taking basic items for survival 
i saw mothers and fathers looting with their children carrying 
toys plants and plastic halloween pumpkins 
store owners said they were very politely shoved aside by the 
scavengers as they cleaned out stores of such nonessential items as 
bolts of cloth and jewelry 
one store owner said he had a gun to keep the mob away but the 
gun apparently didnt scare anyone they pushed him aside and 
emptied his store even of such items as sports trophies 
in town the stores were systematically looted television and 
radio sets and vcrs were popular items 
one manager of a major department store said his establishment 
and two others nearby survived hugo but not the looters 
a witness saw a woman carrying two full cases of carrot cake mix 
on her head others drove around in trucks loaded with loot 
they seemed so matteroffact about taking what didnt belong to 
them items that would do little to relieve the stress of living 
without electricity and telephones 
an insurance agent told me that people always seem to respond to 
major disasters by looting he said he believed it was a primal 
instinct perhaps he is right

police on friday arrested a group of jewish 
refuseniks who demonstrated near the kremlin to push for their right 
to emigrate a witness said 
the demonstration was timed to coincide with meetings in 
washington between foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and 
president bush and other us officials 
vadim kotlyar said his uncle mark kotlyar and most of a group 
of about 30 demonstrators were hustled onto buses by police about 
five minutes after they began their demonstration on the steps of 
the lenin library in downtown moscow 
kotlyar a soviet emigre who now lives in sun valley idaho said 
police told the protesters they did not have official permission for 
the demonstration 
no force was used in arresting the demonstrators and no one 
resisted he said 
the people were taken into buses kotlyar said it seemed 
that almost all of them were detained it was done very swiftly 
his uncle from kiev has been denied permission to emigrate for 
more than a decade because soviet officials claim he has access to 
state secrets kotlyar said 
one of the leaders of the group alexander rappoport was 
sentenced to five days in jail said his wife elena 
three others were given jail sentences and the remainder of those 
arrested were fined and released she said 
the law requires that demonstrators receive permission from city 
authorities to hold demonstrations but protesters say that in many 
cases city authorities deny permission for no reason or never 
respond 
refuseniks regularly call demonstrations during meetings between 
soviet and us officials to publicize their plight 
us officials say human rights questions are among those that 
they are planning to discuss with shevardnadze 
jewish emigration from the soviet union has climbed rapidly in 
the last two years 
more than 30000 have emigrated already this year including 
6000 who left last month according to figures of the 
intergovernmental committee on migration in geneva 
the increase has created a huge backlog of soviet jews who wish 
to settle in the united states 
but others are denied permission to emigrate either because of 
their alleged access to state secrets or because relatives refuse to 
waive financial claims against them

consumers taking advantage of bargains 
increased their spending in august by 09 percent even though 
incomes rose only 04 percent the government said friday in another 
report pointing toward continued economic expansion 
the commerce department said the jump in consumer spending 
followed a 06 percent gain in july and was the largest since a 11 
percent advance in april 
income growth meanwhile slowed from a 07 percent advance in 
july in large part because of strikes against several major 
telephone companies nevertheless personal incomes have increased 
for nine consecutive months 
consumers are still basically positive in their attitudes 
largely based on a favorable job outlook said david jones an 
economist with aubrey lanston amp co a new york government 
securities dealer 
as long as the job sector holds up and it certainly seems 
likely to do so i think consumers will continue to spend at least 
when theyre given a bargain 
jones pointed to strong rebateinduced sales of automobiles in 
august as an example of consumer bargainbuying and a major element 
of that months consumer spending gain 
in a sense thats good he said as long as consumers buy 
only when given a bargain that will limit the potential for 
inflation 
william k macreynolds forecasting director for the us chamber 
of commerce also attributed the boost in consumer spending in part 
on declining prices and said the report indicates that consumer 
confidence will keep the economy from slipping into a deep 
downturn 
this is a good sign for businesses which have suffered from 
slow growth in consumption and falling profits since last october 
he said 
consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic 
health because it accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity other recent reports show an economy continuing 
to grow although at a slower pace as the federal reserve continues 
to keep shortterm interest rates high to contain inflation 
personal consumption spending which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt rose 318 billion in august compared 
with a 211 billion advance in july 
purchases of durable goods cars and other bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years rose 229 billion after 
gaining 34 billion in july 
macreynolds said the resurgence in durables spending doesnt 
create new inflationary pressures because prices in that sector have 
risen less than 2 percent in the last year and durables production 
has lagged behind the rest of the economy leaving ample capacity to 
expand 
nondurable goods purchases fell 36 billion after increasing 
48 billion in the previous month 
purchases of services which includes housing costs rose 125 
billion compared with a 13 billion increase in july 
americans disposable or aftertax income rose 04 percent in 
august down slightly from a 07 percent aftertax increase in july

fell 67 percent after gaining 17 percent in the previous month 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
decreased 92 billion in august compared with a 235 billion 
increase in july payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by 32 
billion up from a july increase of 21 billion

senate authors of cleanair legislation said 
friday that they have worked out a compromise that would exempt 
seven states from rigid requirements to reduce acidrain emissions 
the compromise authored by sen max baucus dmont and majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine is designed to win support for 
their acidrain proposal 
baucus home state of montana as well as kansas minnesota 
north dakota new mexico utah and wyoming would be exempted because 
they use scrubbers on more than 50 percent of their coalfired 
generating capacity scrubbers are pollutioncontrol devices that 
use a spray of water to trap pollutants and cool emissions 
acid rain reduction will be onethird of any cleanair 
legislation passed by congress along with curbing ozone pollution 
and controlling airborne toxic chemicals 
bush has submitted a comprehensive clean air bill to congress 
thats moving through the amendment process it is before the house 
energy and commerce environment subcommittee 
the senate has not begun to amend cleanair legislation but is 
expected to use the baucusmitchell compromise as the vehicle when 
the process begins there 
mitchell and baucus said at a news conference that their plan 
also calls for a 10 million ton reduction of sulfur dioxide over 
1980 levels the same improvement president bush wants 
acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are 
chemically transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric or nitric 
acids sometimes carried hundreds of miles in the air and return to 
earth in rain or snow 
the pollution has been associated with destruction of aquatic 
life in lakes decline of forests deterioration of buildings and 
human lung damage 
the senate compromise also would 
achieve the 10 million ton sulfur dioxide reduction by jan 1 
2000 while the bush plan targets the end of the year for the same 
result 
a requirement that emissions couldnt increase once the 
reduction is achieved a cap that also is a feature of the bush 
legislation 
place the burden for the initial sulfur dioxide reductions on 20 
power plants burning dirty coal rather than the 107 plants that 
would carry the burden under the bush legislation 
a 2 million ton reduction by the start of 2000 for nitrogen 
oxides the bush bill would slow growth of that pollutant but still 
permit an increase of 1 million tons in the air over the next decade 
provide that new sources of acid rain emissions take into 
account the efficiency of the power plant which could be an 
important factor in easing global warming 
every region of the united states wants to reduce acid rain but 
there are fierce disputes about who will pay the bill 
the states that would benefit from the compromise contend they 
are victimized by a provision in current law that requires that all 
new coalfired power plants use scrubbers including those that burn 
socalled clean low sulfur coal mined in the west 
the requirement baucus said has imposed a huge and 
environmentally unjustified burden on the west today we propose to 
end that hoax 
mitchell said millions of dollars have been spent on the 
scrubbers by states that suffered the adverse effects of current 
law even though their coalfired plants produce little pollution 
after 2000 the mitchellbaucus plan would eliminate the scrubber 
provision for new plants 
the compromise plan doesnt address another regional dispute that 
remains to be negotiated the contention of nine mostly midwestern 
states that they would be paying a disproportionate share of acid 
rain reductions 
the brunt of the cost would be passed on to electic ratepayers 
whose utilities burn polluting high sulfur coal

the baltic republic of lithuania on friday pushed 
moscows limits on its sovereignty in party and government affairs 
despite a warning to restive republics from the national communist 
party 
the supreme soviet or legislature of the republic approved a 
law on economic independence declaring that all natural resources in 
lithuania belong to the republic not to the national government 
its communist party published a draft of its party platform 
calling for a federation of communist parties from the 15 soviet 
republics rather than a unified party as president mikhail s 
gorbachev demanded 
the separate moves represented the latest challenges to central 
rule from the baltics which have faced growing calls for 
independence from moscow 
asked in a telephone interview whether he expected the lithuanian 
party program to conflict with moscows effort to prevent party 
organizations in the republics from straying too far national 
parliamentarian mecys laurinkus said of course im convinced of 
that 
tass reported that gorbachev who closed a party central 
committee meeting on ethnic relations wednesday said a federation 
of parties would mean an end to our party in the form in which it 
was founded by lenin and would strike an irreparable blow to 
socialism 
gorbachev and the central committee told the baltic republics 
about a month ago that separatists were leading them into an abyss 
and the soviet leader said in opening the central committee meeting 
tuesday that separatist demagogues could not be tolerated 
the soviet news agency reported the lithuanian party challenge 
came in its party platform which was published friday in 
lithuanian russian and polish 
the lithuanian party declared that it was separating itself from 
past stalinist repression and dogmatic marxismleninism josef 
stalin absorbed lithuania latvia and estonia into the soviet union 
then killed or exiled thousands of their residents 
the republics supreme soviet approved a decree from the 
lithuanian government on economic independence said laurinkus and 
other members of the sajudis political movement 
they said they expected conflicts with moscow on that front as 
well but it was unclear how severe they would be 
at the first session of the national supreme soviet parliament 
this summer lithuania latvia and estonia won the right to develop 
much greater economic independence beginning jan 1 
the national communist party platform on ethnic relations 
approved in moscow on wednesday recognizes republics rights to own 
the natural resources on their territory 
but lithuanian legislators said there likely would be differences 
of interpretation that must be worked out by the fall session of the 
national supreme soviet which begins monday 
in soviet central asia the legislature of the kazakhstan 
republic on friday followed moves by many other republics and 
declared kazakh the official language tass said 
it said russian was recognized in the law as the language of 
communications between ethnic groups in the republic of 16 million 
people kazakhs make up only about 40 percent of the republics 
population

on the eve of a meeting of finance officials of 
the worlds seven biggest economic powers the bush administration 
insisted friday that efforts to stabilize the value of the dollar 
have not fallen apart 
but many private economists expressed criticism about the current 
state of international economic coordination and said they were 
expecting little more than vague rhetoric at the end of daylong 
discussions on saturday 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan will host the talks with their counterparts from 
japan west germany britain france canada and italy 
it will be the first meeting of finance ministers and central 
bank presidents from the seven nations since last april since that 
time the socalled group of seven has seemingly lost its control 
over international currency markets 
the dollar is currently trading above the ceilings set by the 
group of seven despite numerous rounds of coordinated intervention 
the process by which countries buy and sell currencies on the open 
market in an effort to influence the price 
some analysts blame the bush administration for the failure to 
get the dollar under control saying that brady unlike former 
treasury secretary james a baker iii has been too complacent about 
the dangers a high dollar poses to the us economy 
baker in 1985 launched an effort with other g7 countries to push 
the dollar lower in order to curb recordhigh us trade deficits a 
weaker dollar makes us goods more competitive on overseas markets 
while making imports more expensive for american consumers 
but brady has been much less of an activist in this area 
generally choosing to play down concerns that the dollars strength 
was threatening to abort improvements in the us trade deficit 
a senior treasury official briefing reporters on friday 
disputed contentions that the economic coordination effort had 
broken down saying that it was the administrations view that 
economic coordination is working well 
we think we have had a considerable measure of success in terms 
of improving the performance of the world economy said the 
official who spoke on the condition that his name not be revealed 
he noted that the us trade deficit which fell by a sharp 22 
percent in 1988 has declined 11 percent further so far this year 
providing evidence that while the improvement has slowed it has not 
come to a halt 
the official said that if the dollar were to continue 
strengthening for a lengthy period of time this obviously is a 
matter of concern because obviously we have more trade 
adjustments to accomplish 
many private economists were looking for a communique to be 
issued at the end of saturdays closeddoor talks stating in general 
terms the groups continued commitment to stabilize the dollar 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said he was not 
looking for anything stronger than vague expressions of concern 
about the dollars strength and the need to see the value of the 
greenback stabilized 
they should be doing something to bring the dollar down i 
think they would like to but i dont think they know what to do 
wyss said 
many analysts said that controlling the dollar is virtually 
imposible without commitments on the part of the japanese and the 
west germans to boost interest rates higher interest rates in those 
countries would make dollardenominated investments less attractive 
and thus help to push the dollar lower 
david jones chief economist at aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said that he was looking for 
steppedup intervention and more public comments in coming weeks in 
an effort to push the dollar lower even if the new determination is 
not reflected in saturdays communique 
he said the bush administration is coming to the realization that 
without some action a growing trade deficit could weaken the 
economy around the time of next years midterm congressional 
elections thus hurting republican chances 
the group of seven discussions were being held before the start 
of the annual meetings of the 152nation international monetary fund 
and its sister lending organization the world bank 
imf officials have been pushing for a doubling of the funds 
resources to allow it to better handle the crushing 13 trillion 
third world debt burden but the senior treasury official said 
friday that the united states still has not reached a conclusion 
that such an increase is needed 
however dutch finance minister h o ruding chairman of the 
imfs policysetting interim committee told reporters friday that 
he expected the eventual outcome of the debate would result in the 
imf seeing its resources boosted by between 50 percent and 67 
percent

will not extend a truce that runs out at midnight because the 
government has not responded positively to their peace efforts 
salvador samayoa spokesman for the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front also accused the salvadoran military of 
trying to sabotage peace talks and of using the 11day truce to 
increase repression in the central american country 
he warned the guerrillas will take their war from the countryside 
to cities and other more populated places 
samayoa also criticized the united states for giving 5 million 
in aid to president alfredo cristianis rightwing government 
its an immoral decision on the part of the us at a time 
when salvadorans are starting a peace process he said speaking 
to reporters at the foreign correspondents club in managua 
the rebels had announced a sept 1323 ceasefire for peace talks 
that took place in mexico city 
the conference was considered a success and both sides agreed to 
meet again in costa rica on oct 1617 for more talks about halting 
el salvadors nearly 10yearold civil war 
samayoa said guerrilla representatives still plan to attend the 
costa rica talks but he acccused powerful sectors in the 
salvadoran military of trying to block them 
there will be no extension to the military truce the truce was 
implemented for political reasons but there hasnt been a positive 
response from the government which is using the talks as a 
smokescreen to deepen repression 
he said up to 60 people have been detained recently by the 
military throughout el salvador he did not give further details 
samayoa also said a un commission traveling around the region 
to supervise peace efforts had not been allowed to visit the eastern 
provinces of morazan and salatenango and an area called las flores 
areas over which the guerrillas claim control 
describing a new guerrilla strategy he said the war now will 
be in cities roads and communities in places of greater population 
density 
at least 70000 people have been killed in the war

the federal deficit through august is running 
117 percent behind last year the treasury department said friday 
despite the first funds spent by a new government agency created to 
deal with savings and loans failures 
the august deficit of 222 billion was down 4 percent from the 
same month a year ago and followed a 182 billion deficit in july 
revenue last month totaled 763 billion up 98 percent from a 
year ago while spending was up 63 percent to 984 billion 
for the first 11 months of the fiscal year which ends sept 30 
the deficit totals 1459 billion 117 percent lower than the same 
period for fiscal 1988 
however both government and private analysts expect the deficit 
for all of fiscal 1989 will be 5 billion to 15 billion greater 
than the 1552 billion budget gap in 1988 the bush administration 
is forecasting just under 170 billion in red ink while the 
congressional budget office expects a 161 billion deficit 
earlier this summer congress voted to add 20 billion for sampl 
rescues and the initial expenditures showed up in the budget 
statement the first time in august totaling 142 billion 
the resolution trust corp the new agency set up to deal with 
the hundreds of failed thrifts said thursday it planned to spend 8 
billion by the end of the month to rescue or close those sampls that 
had failed and hold another 12 billion in reserve for emergencies 
and to pay off high interestbearing certificates of deposits issued 
by failed thrifts 
military spending continued to be the largest spending category 
totaling 253 billion in august and 2671 billion so far this 
year up 24 percent from 1988 
other large spending categories were 
interest on the national debt the fastest growing item 173 
billion last month and 2446 billion so far in fiscal 1989 up 129 
percent from the previous year 
social security 195 billion in august and 2083 billion so 
far this year up 62 percent from 1988 
other programs in the department of health and human services 
153 billion last month and 1569 billion so far in 1989 up 85

senate leaders friday postponed final passage 
of an airline smoking ban a boost in the ceiling on 
governmentbacked mortgages and other measures held back by a 
ninedayold legislative logjam 
leaders of both parties had hoped the senate would formally adopt 
four spending bills friday including one containing a ban on 
cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights and another 
lifting dollaramount limits on home loans backed by the federal 
housing administration 
but that scenario changed when democratic and republican 
senators and the administration remained unable to agree on how to 
enlarge a 79 billion package of antidrug initiatives president 
bush has advanced republicans have refused to allow votes on final 
passage of the four bills while discussions on the drug plan proceed 
the white house rejected a proposed compromise thursday night 
sources said sending the parties back to the bargaining table 
friday the democrats have proposed spending more than the gop 
wants and have suggested defense cuts to pay for the drug effort 
that bush considers excessive 
it would be tragic if the president were to reject this at this 
point senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told 
reporters 
mitchell and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said 
they hoped the measures could be approved monday 
since partisan fencing over drugs began sept 12 the senate has 
completed all work short of final passage on four spending bills for 
fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
congressional leaders set a goal months ago of completing all 13 
annual spending bills for 1990 by sept 30 so far one has been 
sent to bush for his signature 
an 119 billion transportation bill would make it illegal to 
smoke on any domestic airline route current law forbids smoking on 
flights lasting two hours or less effecting fourfifths of all 
routes the senate finished all work on the bill and was prepared to 
vote its final approval on sept 14 
last tuesday the senate completed debate on legislation boosting 
the limit on mortgages the federal housing administration can insure 
from 101250 to 124875 that was part of a 672 billion bill 
financing veterans housing and space programs 
a 144 billion foreign aid bill increasing us aid to el 
salvador poland and hungary was finished by the senate on wednesday 
thursday lawmakers completed writing a 1574 billion measure 
for health and labor programs that slightly eases the limits on the 
use of federal monies for abortions 
the provision would allow medicaid assistance for lowincome 
women to be used to abort pregnancies caused by rape or incest or 
those that threaten the womans health such aid can now be used

nearly half the benefit of a democratic 
proposal to allow all workers taxdeductible individual retirement 
accounts would go to those with incomes above 75000 the senate 
finance committee said friday 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the committee and author 
of the ira proposal released the figures to show that the plan 
still would provide far less benefit to the richest americans than 
would president bushs competing plan to cut the capitalgains tax 
the capitalgains cut recommended by bush would deliver 151 
percent of its benefits to those with incomes under 75000 
according to a study by the staff of the joint committee on 
taxation that compares with 509 percent for bentsens bill and 
147 percent for the capitalgains cut voted by the house ways and 
means committee 
at the other end of the income scale those over 200000 a year 
would get 67 percent of the tax benefits of the ira proposal 60 
percent of bushs capitalgains reduction and 602 percent of the 
ways and means cut in capitalgains taxes 
the finance committee staff noted that the estimates do not take 
into account that bentsens proposal would permit penaltyfree 
withdrawals from iras to make the down payemnt on a first home or to 
pay for a college education 
it is anticipated that those proposals would provide even more 
benefits to lower and middleincome americans the finance 
committee staff wrote 
the house may consider next week a plan by the democratic 
leadership to eliminate the capitalgains cut from the ways and 
means bill and substitute the ira expansion democrats contend iras 
would do more to encourage saving than would a capitalgains 
reduction 
the 1986 tax overhaul restricted taxdeductible iras to 
lowerincome workers and to those with higher incomes who are not 
covered by company pensions 
bentsens plan would allow any worker regardless of income who is 
not now eligible for a fully deductible ira to deduct up to 1000 a 
year in contributions

some doctors and hospitals illegally deny 
lifesaving treatment to infants born with severe physical and mental 
disabilities said a government report released friday 
decisions to withhold medical treatment food and fluids to these 
disabled children persist in many instances with the tacit 
cooperation of federal state and local government agencies despite 
a federal law prohibiting the practice the study concluded 
the 500page report medical discrimination against children 
with disabilities was released by the us commission on civil 
rights 
the studys conclusions are based on anecdotal evidence an 
examination of how hospital infantcare review committees and child 
protection agencies have enforced the law and a national random 
survey of physician attitudes published late last year 
in that survey 75 percent of the responding physicians said they 
would be neutral or would discourage surgery for infants with spina 
bifida and another severe disability hydrocephalus 
the study concludes that decisions to deny such treatment often 
are not made on the basis of medical judgments and are 
discriminatory 
many times the commission said such decisions are based on 
erroneous judgments concerning the quality of life or social 
judgments that such a persons continued existence places an 
unacceptable burden on families and taxpayers 
this report deals with discrimination not medical judgments 
said commissioner esther buckley 
when medical care is denied to a person with a disability 
because the doctor thinks it is horrible to live a life with a 
disability that is discrimination buckley said at a news 
conference friday 
discrimination on the basis of disability is illegal and in my 
view immoral whether it is practiced by an employer a school a 
hotel a hospital social worker or a doctor making treatment 
decisions echoed commissioner robert a destro 
dr norman fost chairman of the bioethics committee of the 
american academy of pediatrics said the report ignores dramatic 
changes in the treatment of handicapped newborns 
i dont know of a single case of an infant with downs syndrome 
with medical care being withheld in the last three years said 
fost explaining that most instances of treatment denial prior to 
1984 involved infants with downs syndrome or spina bifida 
he charged that the report fails to address the current massive 
problem of overtreatment of these infants as a result of doctors 
fear of legal liability 
its extremist to say that the quality of a patients life is 
irrelevant to medical decisions fost charged the commission 
would have us believe that doesnt matter 
the 4year study was prompted by the 1986 supreme court baby 
doe decision in which the court struck down federal regulations 
that would interfere in parental decisions regarding medical care 
for babies with severe birth defects 
the report criticizes hospitalbased infant care review and 
ethics committees and their monitoring by the department of health 
and human services 
citing a 1987 hhs inspector generals report the study noted 
that the department examined 20 to 36 cases of treatment denial at 
10 hospitals but told child welfare agencies about just three of the 
cases 
the report chided the agenys lack of efforts to estimate from 
the sample studied how many such cases there have been nationwide 
since the courts ruling the commission said that there may be 
hundreds of potential infant doe cases since passage of the 1984 
child abuse amendments 
but the study offered no numbers of documented cases of treatment 
denial since enactment of the legal protections 
destro said most states are not certain which children are 
covered by the law and which arent 
one state utah went so far as to add an entirely new category 
of cases in which treatment could be denied he said 
replying to the report hhs spokeswoman janet hartnett said 
we have conducted a comprehensive statebystate review and 
have concluded that all states which receive funds under the child 
abuse prevention and treatment act are in full compliance with these 
requirements for the protection of disabled infants 
asked if the department agreed with the commissions conclusions 
an official who requested anonymity said there would be no comment 
on the report until a detailed review of it was conducted 
the commission voted in january to approve the final draft of the 
study its release friday followed additional staff work on the 
report to answer questions raised at the time of the vote by members 
of the panel 
commission chairman william b allen was the sole dissenter on 
the eightmember panel

supercomputers satellites and the expertise of 
several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path 
hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee 
the south carolina coast 
but hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science 
forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models 
to track hugos path into charleston sc 
all the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and 
forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those 
models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations satellite service 
pinpointing the exact point of hugos landfall was difficult but 
forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for 
evacuation 
overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea 
where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a 
timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie 
the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the 
intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane 
just hours before it slammed into charleston 
it is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we 
dont have very reliable computer models for that mcadie said 
we really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength 
the hurricane specialists were surprised by the lastminute 
increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force 
reconnaissance 
hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for 35 
years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools 
were reports from aircraft or ships 
we had no radar or satellites then so needless to say our 
forecasts were less accurate clark said 
in the late 1960s the weather service began using satellites to 
obtain a global weather picture information from the satellite is 
used to improve the accuracy of the largescale models that 
television viewers see every night 
using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the 
national meteorological center in suitland md send information to 
the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to 
account for current weather conditions and the position of the 
hurricane 
to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze 
supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar 
storms and the current path of the hurricane 
then they make an educated guess about the landfall 
meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts 
institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system 
congress and the american people are suffering from the 
collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by 
satellites and that just isnt true emmanuel said 
satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough 
information about the wind and temperatures that affect a 
hurricanes path 
most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes 
comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very 
good job emmanuel said 
forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving 
every year so longrange forecasting should become more precise 
we have to remember that those models used are only guidance 
products pyke said and that its ultimately the job of the 
forecaster to predict the storms path

the school board has approved a plan to 
hire armed police officers to patrol high schools 
under the program which the bossier parish school board approved 
unanimously thursday night a teachingcertified police officer 
would be hired for each high school to assist in law enforcement to 
counsel troubled youth and to teach safety and drug education 
its designed to be a preventive measure that will blend 
education and law enforcement said david walden a public schools 
drug education supervisor in bossier in northern louisiana if 
the current trend of violence in the schools is not abated this 
program is going to be milquetoast compared to whats coming down 
the pike 
the officers would wear uniforms or plainclothes and carry 
standard service revolvers walden said the program could begin as 
early as spring officials said 
the school system which had 24 drugrelated suspensions last 
year has had three this year and one gun confiscation he said

tropical storm hugo brought 90 mph gusts heavy

the basement said dr john roper who had back surgery two months 
ago and described the storm as the most terrifying experience of his 
life ropers house in charlotte was hit by a 60foot oak

a government spokesman said friday that 
hungarys supreme court will review the trial of the late cardinal 
jozsef mindszenty who was sentenced to life in prison on trumpedup 
charges of treason 
the government action in presenting the case for review is 
considered to amount to mindszentys defacto posthumous 
rehabilitation 
spokesman zsolt bajnok said the government also decided to 
rehabilitate nearly 100000 hungarians deported or interned in the 
early 1950s under the stalinist rule of thenleader matyas rakosi 
the decisions are part of the leaderships review of hungarys 
past that has led to rehabilitating imre nagy leader of the 1956 
antistalinist uprising who was executed in 1958 and recognition of 
his attempted reforms many of them are embraced by the current 
leadership in its own reform drive 
bajnok told reporters the chief prosecutor concluded that the 
trial against mindszenty was solely political and lacked all factual 
basis 
seven other cases are also to be presented for review 
mindszenty was arrested in 1948 as an enemy of communism after a 
humiliating trial he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1949 on 
spurious charges of high treason 
hungarian revolutionaries freed him from prison in 1956 in the 
tumultuous days of the uprising after the revolt was crushed by the 
soviets mindszenty found shelter in the us mission in budapest 
until 1971 when he left the asylum under an agreement worked out 
between the vatican and the hungarian government 
mindszenty stayed briefly in rome then settled in vienna where 
he died on may 6 1975 at age 83 
the government decided last february to review all political 
trials conducted from 1945 to 1962 
bajnok said about 55000 hungarians were interned and 43000 
deported from 1949 to 1953 he said about 17000 of these people are 
still alive 
he said they would receive a token increase on their pensions of 
8 a month 
referring to hungarys struggle to rejuvenate its stagnating 
economy and pay back its 17 billion foreign debt bajnok said the 
government does not have the funds to pay genuine compensation 
he said the government would also pay a pension supplement to the 
22000 people sentenced after the 1956 uprising 
survivors of reprisals complained the government decision was 
unacceptable 
tibor zimanyi head of a group of internment camp veterans told 
the associated press the token pensions were a humiliation of 
those who had been persecuted unjustly 
gabor roszik the first opposition member to be elected to 
parliament proposed that parliament declare oct 23 the day the 
1956 revolt broke out a national holiday the official mti news 
agency said house speaker matyas szueros has proposed it be a day 
of national remembrance 
the hungarian daily esti hirlap meanwhile reported on friday that 
three czechoslovak border guards chased into hungary in pursuit of 
13 east germans seeking to emigrate to the west and assaulted one of 
them 
it said the incident took place last saturday at the rajka border 
crossing 
it said east germans in three cars drove straight through the 
czechoslovak border checkpoint then jumped from the cars and ran 
onto hungarian territory 
the guards ran after them and physically assaulted one of 
them before returning to their post the daily quoted col tibor 
vidos a chief border guard official as saying 
vidos protested the czechoslovak side admitted the border 
violation apologized and promised that measures have been taken 
to avoid similar incidents in the future esti hirlap quoted him 
as saying 
hungarian radio quoted another official as saying all 13 traveled 
on to west germany 
about 18000 east germans have crossed to the west from hungary 
since budapest leaders opened the countrys borders for them on 
sept 11 
many east germans said they crossed to hungary illegally from 
czechoslovakia which lies between east germany and hungary after 
being turned back by czechoslovak border officials

on the forests of the northwest will be shown without any 
commercials after nine companies bowed to pressure from loggers and 
yanked their advertising turner broadcasting system inc said 
friday 
while turner broadcasting declined to release the names of the 
companies they included ford motor co dean witter reynolds inc 
which was advertising its discover card and stroh brewery inc 
earlier this month stroh withdrew its underwriting of the 
audubon societys television series after northwest loggers 
threatened to quit drinking that brand of beer 
due to concerted and apparently organized pressure from the 
timber industry many of the advertisers scheduled for the upcoming 
world of audubon special ancient forests rage over trees have 
canceled their commercials for that time period turner 
broadcasting said in a statement released in atlanta 
turner said the show will be broadcast as scheduled sunday night 
with public service announcements and promotions for future shows 
replacing the commercials 
turner broadcasting is committed to the goals and objectives of 
the national audubon society the statement said we will 
continue to telecast world of audubon specials despite pressure from 
special interest groups 
david krupp a ford spokesman in detroit confirmed that his 
company had canceled its participation in the show on northwest 
forests but added that ford would continue to advertise in other 
audubon society televsion specials 
the ford dealers in the northwest area asked us to cancel and 
because we try to accommodate when we can the requests of our 
dealers and customers we decided to withdraw said krupp 
dean witter reynolds canceled its lone 30second commercial 
because as a general rule we try not to be controversial said 
james flynn a company spokesman on long island ny 
flynn said that while his company hadnt received any direct 
telephone calls from loggers its parent company sears had 
received a handful 
company officials were also aware of strohs decision to drop its 
underwriting for the series said flynn 
the timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a 
bitter struggle for months over the future of logging in the virgin 
forests of the northwest which provide prime habitat for the 
northern spotted owl 
the audubon society is among the environmental groups that have 
sought to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered 
species and logging in the oldgrowth forests halted 
national audubon will never be intimidated by timber industry 
bullying said peter berle audubon president we have not and 
will not change one second of this documentary 
berle said pressure from the timber industry represented the 
last gasp in a desperate effort to stop the american people from 
seeing a major doumentary film about the public debate over 
protection of the northwests remaining ancient forests on public 
lands 
we firmly believe the public will be furious about this attempt 
at censorship which runs counter to every principle of free speech 
embodied in the first amendment

group said friday that us aid to angolan rebels has increased more 
than fivefold 
randall robinson director of transafrica said in an interiew 
that us aid rose from 15 million to 80 million a year to make up 
for lost aid from south africa 
the aid is covert and no verification could be obtained from 
other sources robinson said he received his information from 
congressional sources 
the united states has supported the union for the total 
independence of angola unita in its 14year civil war with the 
luanda government which has been backed by 50000 cuban troops and 
soviet and east german advisers 
under a ussponsored agreement signed in december cuba agreed 
to withdraw and south africa agreed to grant independence to 
neighboring namibia 
earlier south africa had pledged to stop its support for unita 
that support reportedly totaled 80 million annually and consisted 
mostly of nonlethal items 
robinson said he would leave saturday for angola to meet with 
marxist president jose eduardo dos santos and that he would invite 
dos santos to visit the united states 
robinson said he had received assurances from members of congress 
that the angolan leader would be welcom on capitol hill despite the 
absence of us diplomatic relations 
he urged president bush to receive dos santos as he will jonas 
savimbi head of unita next month 
were responsible in a major way for the devastation of 
angola said robinson whose group has been at the forefront of 
legislation to impose sanctions on south africa we ought to stop 
fueling that 
he urged the bush administration to grant diplomatic recognition 
to angola which gained membership with overwhelming support in the 
international monetary fund and world bank earlier this week 
the united states has said it will only establish diplomatic ties 
when the government reaches a peace agreement with unita and agrees 
to fair elections 
the sides signed a temporary usbacked ceasefire in june but 
the truce and peace talks have crumbled

farm broadcasters said that in considering aid to poland or the 
soviet union one of the things that is absolutely essential is the 
reform of their systems 
they have got to move toward market economies and i want to 
help the polish people id like to help the soviets the people i 
dont want to see the people in these republics that are struggling 
for their more freedom to be set back 
bush said the united states has got to insist as we help with 
aid on the reforms that are necessary otherwise we are simply 
putting money down a rathole 
yeutter said in a statement that the pork bellies will help 
ease food shortages and high prices facing the polish people at this 
time in consultations with usda officials the polish government 
requested pork product donations to help meet current critical food 
needs facing the country 
the food for progress program allows the use of us food 
resources more effectively in support of countries making 
commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in their 
agricultural economies the announcement said

the senator presiding over the impeachment 
trial hearings of us district judge walter nixon said friday he 
plans to introduce a constitutional amendment moving such trials 
from the senate to the supreme court 
the high court has the most constitutional perspective on both 
the protections and the sensitivity of federal judgeships said 
sen wyche fowler dga in an interview 
the amendment which he said would be cosponsored by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny would apply only to federal judges 
leaving the trial of other federal officials impeached by the house 
of representatives to the senate 
an impeachment voted by the house serves as an indictment for 
trial before the senate a twothirds vote of the senate is required 
for conviction which carries only one penalty removal from office 
and disqualification from ever holding federal office of honor 
trust or profit such a removal does not bar ordinary criminal 
proceedings 
in the 200year history of the united states under the 
constitution the senate has tried only 15 impeachments three of 
them have been in the last three years and all three were of federal 
judges 
impeachment proceedings are tremendously timeconsuming fowler 
said he spent all of august reading up on the nixon case prior to 
the fourday trial before his special 12member committee earlier 
this month 
that committee will summarize the undisputed evidence for the 
full senate in a report that also will include the disputed evidence 
with explanations of each sides position the summaries and 
explanations with a transcript of the committees hearings will go 
to each senator to read before the full senate takes up the case 
the senate will spend at least one full day hearing arguments 
from the house prosecutors the defense attorneys and nixon himself 
if he chooses to speak the senators then will debate in secret 
the impeachment of nixon chief federal judge in southern 
mississippi arises from his conviction of perjury for lying to a 
grand jury about his involvement in a drug case against a son of a 
wealthy businessman he is serving a fiveyear sentence 
the trial of us district judge harry claiborne in 1986 took the 
committee 10 days and 18 hours of senate floor time before the 
senate voted to remove claiborne from office according to sen bob 
dole rkan who was majority leader at the time the senate floor 
proceedings took more time than all but the most major issues 
senate committee hearings in the impeachment case against us 
district judge alcee hastings of florida took four weeks during the 
summer his case is awaiting action by the full senate 
under the constitution federal judges are appointed for life and 
can be removed from office only by resignation death or an 
impeachment conviction by the senate 
fowler said the supreme court has more time for these cases 
his plan for a constitutional amendment is not the first call for 
a change in the discipline of federal judges 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on courts intellectual property and the administration 
of justice has proposed strengthening federal laws governing the 
judges and setting up a commission to study the impeachment process 
the number of us district judgeships has grown from 409 to 575 
in the last 11 years and is expected to expand 
having experienced three criminal prosecutions against federal 
judges in the recent past a growing number of felony cases brought 
against sitting judges can be expected as judgeships are added to 
the judicial system kastenmeier said in a recent article 
published in the kentucky law journal

to task friday for reprinting an article about moscow political 
maverick boris yeltsin for political purposes 
the article which claimed yeltsin had gone on a drinking and 
shopping binge during a us visit was reprinted from the italian 
paper la repubblica on monday but the communist party daily 
apologized for reprinting it thursday saying the reporter who wrote 
it had not seen anything of the kind 
in an editorial and letter from the reporter vittorio zucconi 
la repubblica charged friday that pravda tried to use the article 
for political rather than journalistic ends 
the editorial board of la repubblica deplores the political 
use by pravda the editorial said 
it said the reprint was part of a political confrontation 
taking place in moscow 
yeltsin the former communist party chief of moscow was stripped 
of that post almost two years ago by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev who denounced him as overly ambitious 
in a remarkable political comeback in march yeltsin won 89 
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate 
to represent moscow in the new national legislature the congress of 
peoples deputies 
the leftofcenter repubblica one of italys largest newspapers 
expressed regret that yeltsin suffered unjust political 
damage from pravdas use of its article 
a flushed and angry yeltsin who returned home monday from his 
ninecity us tour accused pravda of seeking revenge for the 
fact that americans received us with admiration 
in his letter friday zucconi said he had based his account on a 
sept 13 article in the washington post and on russian emigrant 
sources 
if the sources gave inexact information to the post to us and 
to other publications which spoke with them or if they later 
changed their account in view of the fuss made by pravda we can 
only acknowledge and offer our regrets his letter said

a food and drug administration advisory 
committee on friday recommended strengthening warnings against side 
effects of the worlds leading sleep medication halcion to 
indicate a possibly greater risk of temporary amnesia than other 
drugs in its class 
the panel also recommended stronger warnings concerning possible 
side effects of all hypnotic sleep drugs 
the recommendations resulted from the psychopharmacological drugs 
advisory committees review of a relatively high number reports 
about side effects associated with the use of halcion compared with 
other sedativehypnotics the reports included amnesia anxiety 
aggression and hallucinations all of which are included in the 
current warning label for the drug 
the panel recommended a stronger warning on amnesia only 
the fda has six months to act on the recommendations 
panel members said the number of adverse reactions reported may 
not be an indication that halcion carries greater risks of unwanted 
side effects than other drugs in its class 
given the limitations of the information we did not sense 
there was a special problem of side effects with halcion said dr 
daniel e casey panel chairman and chief of psychiatric research 
and psychopharmacology at the veterans administration medical center 
in portland ore 
since halcion was approved for sale in the united states in 1983 
about 43 million prescriptions of the drug have been written and the 
fda has received 1693 reports of adverse side effects possibly 
associated with use of the drug ranging from amnesia to death said 
charles anello deputy director of the fdas office of epidemiology 
and biostatistics 
by comparison 35 million prescriptions have been written for 
restoril a sedativehypnotic made by sandoz pharmaceuticals corp 
since 1981 and the fda has received 266 reports of unwanted side 
effects he said 
officials of the upjohn co which makes halcion said the higher 
reports for halcion are probably partly due to media reports about 
the drug 
publicity about the drug included an article in california 
magazine a year ago by a woman who entitled her experience with the 
drug halcion nightmare network television features about the 
drug and reporting on a case last year in which a utah woman shot 
her mother after having taken halcion charges against the woman 
were dismissed 
upjohn spokesman godfrey grant said the company was pleased the 
advisory committee has essentially come to the conclusion that there 
are few if any concerns that need to be addressed 
the epidemiological data upjohn presented to the panel does not 
support a significant problem but we did acknowledge there could be 
some concern with inappropriate dosing he said referring to 
higher doses of the drug 
there is no emergency and we dont see a public health 
hazard said paul leber director of the fdas division of 
neuropharmacological drug products 
though the committee agreed to recommend a specific relabeling 
for halcion to note that it may carry a greater risk than other 
hypnotics for temporary amnesia the panel also decided to address 
concerns for the entire class of sleeping pills three drugs are 
included in this class halcion restoril and dalmane made by 
roche products inc 
committee members said they were concerned about travelers 
amnesia a temporary amnesia that can affect travelers who take 
one of the sleep drugs when they awake they can function normally 
but later wont recall their activities during this period such as 
going through customs at the airport leber said 
the labels for these drugs already warn of amnesia as a possible 
side effect but the committee recommended the fda consider adding 
mention of travelers amnesia to the labels 
panel members also asked the fda to provide material to 
consumers to alert to the possibility of side effects of the 
sedativehypnotic drugs so consumers could discuss these with their 
doctor 
this could be expressed in many different ways panel 
chairman casey said

the justice department declined friday to seek 
permission to make an oral argument during the supreme courts 
consideration of a minnesota law resticting abortions for teenagers 
the decision to forgo oral argument appears to signal that the 
department will not use the minnesota case as the occasion to renew 
its argument that the landmark 1973 abortionrights decision be 
overturned 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian said the bush 
administration still has as a legal goal the overturning of that 
decision roe v wade 
but eramian said its premature to say if the brief solicitor 
general kenneth starr still plans to file in the minnesota case will 
address that issue 
eramian said the department intends to join the attorney general 
of minnesota in defending the law which requires teenagers to 
obtain the permission of parents even those not a part of their 
lives to get an abortion 
but the minnesota case may not present the best opportunity for 
the justice department to continue its argument that the high court 
should overturn roe v wade said a department source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the solicitor general often called the 10th justice in legal 
circles must be careful to preserve his special relationship with 
the high court by not pressing legal arguments that have been 
freshly rebuffed by the justices the source said 
it could be insulting to the justices if the justice department 
quickly returns to the supreme court to raise the same legal point 
that the court rejected in july when the justices refused to 
overturn roe v wade the source said 
the justice department specifically urged the high court to use 
the missouri case to overturn the 1973 precedent a request made in 
oral argument by former solicitor general charles fried 
the high court in that case held that the missouri law did not 
run afoul of roe v wade and therefore the 1973 precedent was left 
intact even though the statute prohibited abortions in state 
facilities or in hospitals on state land 
because it involves a law restricting the rights of teenagers 
hodgson v minnesota does not deal as squarely as the missouri case 
with the fundamental issue of a womans constitutional right to 
abortion 
the fact that the minnesota attorney general is not seeking to 
overturn roe v wade in his argument before the court may also be a 
factor in the justice departments reasoning 
the abortionrights issue is a politically vexing one for 
president bush who has shifted his stance from prochoice to 
antiabortion in the last decade 
political polls taken since the supreme courts ruling in the 
missouri case show that restricting abortion rights is not popular 
a poll commissioned by the wall street journal and nbc news 
released friday showed that 46 percent of those surveyed would vote 
or would be likely to vote for a prochoice candidate while 28 
percent would support an antiabortion candidate the poll indicated 
that young voters were prochoice by a 21 margin

nasa said friday that it still hopes 
to launch space shuttle atlantis on schedule oct 12 despite 
disruptions caused by hurricane hugo 
officials had said thursday the launch probably would be 
postponed at least two days because of preparations made to move 
atlantis off the launch pad to the safety of an assembly building in 
case the storm headed this way 
that effort was halted early thursday when hugo passed harmlessly 
300 miles east of here 
electrical communications and fuel line connections between the 
pad and shuttle had been disconnected in case a move became 
necessary those had to be reattached and retested a task expected 
to add at least two days to the launch preparation time the 
officials had said 
the schedule is tight but we feel we still have a chance to 
make the oct 12 date nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said friday 
a firm launch date will be set on oct 3 following a twoday 
flight readiness review by shuttle managers 
atlantis will carry a crew of five astronauts who are to release 
the galileo spacecraft on the start of a sixyear journey to the 
planet jupiter 
meanwhile preparations moved ahead for launching a navy 
communications satellite aboard an atlascentaur rocket set for 
liftoff at 412 am monday that launch was delayed three days 
after workers drained the rockets fuel tanks because of hugos 
potential threat

the remnants of hurricane hugo made a surprise sweep through west 
virginia on friday downing power and telephone lines snapping 
trees and causing flooding before fizzling and meandering toward 
ohio 
theres basically nothing left of him said weather service 
meteorologist alan reznek in charleston wva his punch is gone 
the center of the storm advanced farther westward than expected 
targeting eastern ohio western pennsylvania and western new york 
before it was expected to wear itself out in canada it was moving 
to the north at 30 mph 
charleston sc got the full brunt of hugo which wrecked a 
string of caribbean resort islands beginning early sunday there 
were 20 confirmed deaths in the caribbean but an official on puerto 
rico said the death toll for the region was 26 people about 50000 
people are homeless 
ten of the 11 us deaths were in south carolina eight died in 
counties surrounding charleston and one in the columbia area said 
warren hardy of the states office of emergency preparedness in 
north carolina a 6monthold baby was killed in union county when a 
tree fell on a house 
a hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm moist air over open 
oceans when these giant storms hit land they lose their wallop 
although they can still manage considerable bluster 
hugo was downgraded into a tropical storm at 6 am and decayed 
more as it went inland but places in its path could expect several 
inches of rain and high winds by 6 pm hugo had lost the 
characteristics of a tropical storm although the weather system 
featured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains 
its last location was just west of pittsburgh pa at latitude 
405 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west officials said no 
further tracking would be done 
earlier hugo was expected to skirt west virginia but 
communities in the southern part of the state instead were lashed by 
fierce winds and inundated with water 
its blowing 45 or 50 miles an hour said fred kitts of the 
mercer county sheriffs department in princeton weve had trees 
fall on houses cars trailers there are power lines everywhere 
heavy rains brought rapidly rising water which forced some 
evacuations friday in the oakvale area of mercer county said 
officials with the countys emergency services there were no 
immediate reports of injuries 
at 4 pm edt the weather service said the center of the rapidly 
weakening storm had moved out of west virginia into southeastern 
ohio bob sheets director of the national hurricane center said 
the storm was expected to pass through eastern ohio and western 
pennsylvania late friday or early saturday 
the weather service issued a small stream and urban flood warning 
friday evening for cuyahoga and medina counties in northeast ohio 
about 2 inches of rain fell in medina during a 90minute period 
late friday afternoon 
an outer band of the tropical storm hit virginias western half 
earlier friday knocking down power lines and trees with winds 
gusting as high as 81 mph and forcing residents in lowlying areas 
of several counties to evacuate 
but the eye of the storm swept through the narrowest part of the 
state entering in washington county and exiting in tazwell county 
and dumped far less rain than anticipated five to 10 inches of 
rain was expected in areas where 3 inches or less fell 
it passed a lot farther west than we thought it would and it 
didnt stay here too long said janet clements spokeswoman for 
the state department of emergency services no serious injuries were 
reported 
in washington government agencies schools transit officials 
and property owners preparing for the worst were relieved when the 
brunt of the storm missed the nations capital 
in new york city rain and blustery winds were the biggest 
concern the threat of high tides and flooding and closed down the 
statue of libertys island 
emergency management coordinators in new jersey also expected the 
the worst from hugo but instead saw only some rainstorms and gusty 
winds

investigators probing the wreckage of a french 
airliner that exploded over an african desert have found evidence of 
explosives on board the dc10 the government said friday night 
in a brief statement the transport ministry said the inquiry 
commission of officials from france niger and chad had found 
indications which tend to support the hypothesis of the presence 
of explosives aboard the dc10 of uta 
the mysterious crash tuesday in southern niger killed all 171 
people aboard uta flight 772 
the transport ministry said further tests should be able to 
quickly settle the question of the cause of the crash but provided 
no details of what evidence was found or what tests would be carried 
out 
until now french officials have refused to rule out the 
possibility of an accidental explosion in flight while agreeing 
with uta president rene lapautre that a bombing was the most likely 
explanation for the crash the carrier uta or union des transports 
aeriens is a private french company that serves africa and the 
pacific 
earlier in the day french authorities denied reports that they 
had prior warnings of imminent terrorism 
none of our services none of our ministries received either 
threats or intelligence about preparations for antifrench 
attacks said a spokesman for president francois mitterrand 
the news weekly lexpress reported friday that the french embassy 
in beirut urgently alerted paris to a lebanese magazines reports of 
terrorist plans french intelligence agents also relayed the 
warning according to lexpress 
on sept 15 the lebanese magazine ashshiraa quoted islamic 
militants loyal to iran as accusing france of reneging on a 1988 
deal that led to the release of three french hostages held in 
lebanon 
it said the militants were planning attacks on french interests 
in africa 
france has denied making any deal for the hostages beyond 
agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with iran there have been 
reports france also agreed to free anis naccache a proiranian 
lebanese serving a life sentence for the attempted murder in 1980 of 
former iranian prime minister shahpour bakhtiar in france naccache 
has not been released 
france provoked fresh resentment among moslem groups last month 
by sending warships off the lebanese coast to protect french 
citizens and sympathizers in the wartorn nation 
a french foreign ministry official confirmed the embassy in 
beirut sent copies of the ashshiraa article to french officials but 
added all our embassies send us reports regularly 
the content of the article is extremely vague he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with policy you 
couldnt draw the conclusion from it that there would be an attack 
on a uta plane en route from ndjamena to paris 
ashshiraa gained fame for exposing secret arms deals between the 
united states and iran but it has been wrong on several stories 
concerning hostages held in lebanon 
ndjamena capital of chad was the dc10s last stop before it 
disintegrated the flight originated in brazzaville congo 
in niger helicopters began evacuating bodies friday to be flown 
to paris for identification rescue workers found the planes voice 
recorder in debris strewn widely over dunes and rocks 
a team of american investigators joined french authorities to 
examine the wreckage experts from mcdonnell douglas and general 
electric joined them fbi agents also were expected to join the 
investigation 
police were checking the planes passenger list and the nine 
people who left the plane at ndjamena 
some speculation in paris has focused on hezbollah a proiranian 
shiite moslem group believed to be the umbrella for factions holding 
most of the 16 western hostages in lebanon 
telephone calls to the airline and to reporters on tuesday hours 
after the crash claimed responsibility for the bombing on behalf of 
islamic jihad which is believed to work under hezbollah 
the calls were not authenticated and french newspapers reported 
without citing sources that police discounted the calls 
in 1984 the same brazzavilleparis uta flight was bombed on the 
ground in ndjamena in 1984 killing one person chadian authorities 
blamed libya but investigators never established responsibility 
several islamic factions threatened to fire on french ships after 
france announced it would send a fleet to lebanon the proiranian 
revolutionary justice organization threatened france and the western 
hostages in lebanon 
recent events have proven that frances rulers have forgotten 
the lessons and still insist on following the american criminal 
policies the terrorist group said in a statement this month 
the revolutionary justice organization will not allow 
france to intervene in the region under any pretext

soviet politician boris n yeltsin met with 
thousands of supporters on friday and celebrated pravdas apology 
for reprinting an article claiming he drank and spent his way across 
the united states on a recent tour 
im thankful for your understanding and for the fact that you 
did not believe this lie slander this action that evidently was 
directed against me he told cheering supporters in zelinograd 19 
miles northwest of moscow 
just over 1000 people jammed into a hall in zelinograd and 
photographers on the scene said about 20000 more listed to his 
speech on speakers outside 
it was yeltsins first public appearance since he returned from a 
ninecity tour of the united states on monday that same day the 
communist party daily pravda reprinted an article by the italian 
newspaper la repubblica saying the silverhaired populist engaged in 
a drinking and spending binge in the united states 
pravda apologized to yeltsin on thursday printing a small item 
saying the journalist who wrote the story hadnt actually seen 
yeltsin do any of the things he described yeltsin previously 
described the report as garbage 
la repubblica on friday apologized for the article saying its 
sources for the article misled their reporter 
on tuesday and wednesday yeltsin took part in a full meeting of 
the communist party central committee on ethnic issues the central 
committee has the power to take disciplinary action against its 
members including removing them from the party policymaking body 
they expected after this planned action that i would declare at 
the plenum that i was leaving the central committee yeltsin told 
the crowd which frequently interrupted him with cheers and applause 
during his hourlong remarks 
i was only smiling sitting in the hall he added 
yeltsin said he also didnt back down from criticism he made of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform program while in america 
at the end of the plenum gorbachev says yeltsin returned 
from america he says how good it is in america and we were all 
criticized by him including we central committee members and the 
presidium headed by me yeltsin told the crowd 
i told him right it was just like you describe it 
gorbachev brought yeltsin to moscow in 1985 to serve as moscow 
communist party chief and yeltsin quickly became a leading advocate 
of gorbachevs policy of greater openness 
but yeltsin was forced out of his job in november 1987 after 
criticizing the party at a central committee meeting and 
subsequently lost his post as a candidate or nonvoting member of 
the ruling party politburo 
he completed a remarkable political comeback this year first 
winning 89 percent of the vote in moscow for a seat in the new 
congress of peoples deputies and then being chosen a leader of a 
group of deputies that is the soviet unions first organized 
legislative opposition in almost 70 years 
yeltsin gained wide popularity for attacking special privileges 
enjoyed by top party and government officials he also accuses 
gorbachev of proceeding too slowly in his reform program

senate talks aimed at financing the war on 
drugs broke off friday amid squabbling between republicans and 
democrats over how much to take away from defense and provide for 
drug treatment education and prevention 
there comes a time when you have to fish or cut bait senate 
appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd dwva told 
reporters at the end of five days of closeddoor bargaining he said 
the white house made the going tougher by being a shadow 
participant in the talks 
failure to reach agreement threatens partisan skirmishing and a 
logjam of money bills on the senate floor with eight days to go 
before the start of the new fiscal year when the money will be 
needed 
no further negotiations were planned although byrd said im 
always at the other end of the telephone the leader of republican 
negotiators sen mark hatfield rore said he hoped well all 
take a cleareyed mondaymorning view 
democrats were proposing to add 1 billion to the 79 billion 
drugfighting program announced by president bush of the extra 
money 800 million would be aimed at stemming demand for drugs 
through education and prevention programs as well as treatment the 
socalled demand side of the drug problem the rest would go to 
local law enforcement 
the democratic program would be financed through an 
acrosstheboard cut of 03 percent in federal spending plus 
additional selected cuts to be determined by congressional 
committees 
these additional selected cuts would be at an overall rate of 
0144 percent committees however would be free to reduce spending 
in some areas more and other areas less 
republicans were offering to add 850 million to the program 
including 750 million for demandside programs and the rest for 
local law enforcement it would be financed through an 
acrosstheboard cut in spending of 04 percent according to 
hatfield 
republicans however were holding out for additional flexibility 
to protect defense procurement from the full brunt of 
acrosstheboard cuts 
over a week of negotiations byrd cut his proposed increase by 
more than half and the inclusion of selected cuts which were not 
part of his original proposal represented a partial concession to 
the bush administration 
he told a news conference republicans asked for concessions and 
we said okay well do that but lets beef up that treatment side 
that prevention side he and other democratic lawmakers scoffed at 
the notion that their proposal would weaken defense 
the administration was unwilling to let a 300 billion defense 
budget bear a less than one half of one percent cut to beef up the 
war on drugs sasser told reporters 
hatfield said that he was surprised that the democrats did not 
press on with negotiations 
i was highly expectant that this was the day we were going to 
finalize the agreement hatfield said he acknowledged that at one 
point the negotiators had discussed the possibility of raising the 
overall increase to 900 million but that this was never 
incorporated in a formal offer 
the breakoff in talks threatened what sen james sasser dtenn 
chairman of the senate budget committee described as some 
procedural disorder on the floor of the united states senate 
republicans have been holding up final action on four 
appropriations bills and eight others are still being fashioned in 
the senate 
earlier majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
republican senators seemed ready to accept a billiondollar boost 
for the 79 billion bush wanted but he said there were still 
problems at the white house 
i believe the only obstacle or the only remaining participant 
to give consent is the president mitchell said 
republican senators indicated the administration was concerned 
about the impact on the pentagon and added that they too had 
concerns 
to the extent that defense has to be hit i think that we have 
to impose the maximum of flexibility said sen john warner 
rva emerging from a meeting with top administration officials 
take tanks it would mean a severe reduction in the number of 
tanks that could be produced next year said sen ted stevens

former president nixon angered at a planned abc 
drama about his last months in office suggested in a letter sent by 
an aide friday that the shows sponsor atampt change its wellknown 
corporate slogan to reach out and smear someone 
the letter to american telephone amp telegraph co board chairman 
robert e allen was written and signed by the nixon aide john h 
taylor 
in a phone interview from nixons office in woodcliff lake nj 
taylor said the letter reflected the former presidents views 
although he said the letters words are his own and not those of 
nixon 
the letter also said nixon had cancelled his longdistance atampt 
service at home and switched to a rival company mci because of 
the formers sponsorship of abcs the final days 
taylors letter included another one he sent monday to the 
governments general services administration requesting a similar 
switch to mci for nixons office that letter called abcs planned 
movie a distorted malicious portrait of the last days of the 
nixon administration 
atampt values all our customers and mr nixon too said burke 
stinson a spokesman for the company he said atampt regrets losing 
any customer but still will sponsor the abc movie and hopes that 
viewers will judge for themselves the fairness of the film 
the threehour movie to air on oct 29 dramatizes the 
bestselling book by bob woodward and carl berstein that was their 
account of nixons downfall in 1973 and 1974 during the watergate 
scandal nixon portrayed in the movie by actor lane smith resigned 
in august 1974 
among other things the book depicts nixon in his final white 
house days as a deeply disturbed man who once reportedly talked to 
portraits hanging on the white house walls nixon through friends 
and his lawyers have denied such allegations 
in his letter for nixon which he made available to a reporter 
taylor enclosed an eightpage complaint about the movie that nixons 
attorney william e griffin sent last march to capital citiesabc 
inc chairman thomas s murphy head of the networks parent company 
that complaint taylor said includes what his letter to allen 
called a summary of criticism by journalists in major newspapers 
and publications in their reviews of the book upon its publication 
in 1976 
in view of the highly questionable nature of the book even in 
their eyes taylor wrote allen perhaps you should change your 
corporate slogan to reach out and smear someone 
stinson whose companys catch phrase is reach out and touch 
someone declined to comment on taylors suggestion 
much of the journalistic criticism cited by taylors letter 
centered on the books literary form and use of anonymous sources 
woodward a washington post editor has said he and bernstein stand 
by the accuracy of what they wrote 
griffins complaint to abcs chief executive implied the 
possibility of a lawsuit in an area of law that lawyers call the 
right of publicity or the right to commercially exploit ones 
own name and image 
nixon his attorneys letter said objects strongly to being 
depicted by an actor without his consent 
it is his contention that being depicted in this manner purely 
for the profit of capital citiesabc and for the entertainment of 
its audience is a violation of his privacy and an infringement of 
his right to use his name and image to promote his own writings and 
statements about foreign policy and other issues facing our nation 
and the world 
no specific threat of a lawsuit was made taylor who said nixon 
had authorized the complaint that his lawyer sent to abc said he 
didnt know if a lawsuit would be filed against abc if it aired 
the final days 
dick connelly an abc spokesman confirmed that the company had 
been contacted by president nixons attorney and that our 
general counsel responded to his letters 
he declined to say how many letters abc had received from nixons 
lawyer or how abc replied to them 
however he said referring to abcs movie about nixon we did 
not modify the program we are satisfied with its fairness and 
accuracy and believe this production will speak for itself

the federal aviation administration on friday 
suspended licenses of the pilot and copilot of a usair jetliner that 
skidded into new yorks east river but the pilots union said the 
crew broke no rules 
faa administrator james b busey cited the crews delay in 
meeting with investigators and in taking drug and alcohol tests 
after the crash that killed two people wednesday night calling 
their actions highly questionable 
the air line pilots association said there was nothing unusual 
in the crews performance no federal rules were broken and the 
crew has cooperated completely with the investigation 
in a statement announcing suspension of the crews pilot 
certificates the faa did not directly blame the pilots for the 
crackup of the 737400 airliner carrying 61 people but said the 
circumstances of the accident are such that the two pilots may no 
longer be qualified to excercise the privileges of an airline 
transport pilot certificate 
national transportation safety board and faa investigators 
interviewed the pilot michael martin and copilot constantine 
kleissaf for the first time on friday the faa said 
the agency had ordered martin and kleissaf to appear at its 
regional headquarters in the jamaica section of new york citys 
queens borough with their pilot certificates logbooks and other 
relevant documents it lifted that order after the two were 
interviewed the faa said 
officials have been trying to determine why the planes 
latenight takeoff for charlotte nc was aborted after it had 
started down the laguardia airport runway 
a pilots suspension may be appealed to safety board 
administrative law judges either the pilot or the faa may appeal 
the judges decision to the fivemember board whose actions are 
binding unless taken by the pilot to us district court the 
suspensions remain in effect while under appeal 
busey said the failure of the pilots to appear in the hours after 
the crash negated the opportunity to get meaningful toxicological 
tests thereby denying us factual information as to whether drugs 
were or were not a factor 
an faa rule requiring postaccident toxicological tests for 
pilots goes into effect later this year 
for these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 
hours after an accident that took two lives and to do so with no 
explanation is highly quesitionable busey said 
the pilots union said that the captain and first officer followed 
standard alpa procedures after the accident and that usair knew the 
pilots whereabouts at all times 
the union in a statement said the cockpit crew would take drug 
tests 
the union criticized the news media for what it said were 
erroneous accounts about the crash 
it said one report that the first officer told rescue workers the 
captain was mumbling and acting irrationally are likely 
based on the fact that the copilot told rescue workers at the 
accident site that he could not hear the captain when he was calling 
out a postaccident shutdown checklist 
union president henry a duffy said reports concerning drug use 
pending homicide investigatons and improper crew communications 
proved to be wrong 
while we understand the new medias need to report events 
duffy said such erroneous reporting does not serve the publics 
need to know hinders the accident investigation process undermines 
the public confidence in the safety of the system and slanders the 
reputation of hte pilots involved 
the union statement included no reaction to the license 
suspensions

kenyan officials said friday that somali 
forces killed many people in a sweep through southern somalia 
before attacking a kenyan border town in six armored cars and three 
jeeps killing at least four policemen 
some sources suggested the somali soldiers were chasing members 
of a newly formed rebel group 
our people who visited the site were told by the somalis 
fleeing into kenya that they were lucky to have escaped and that 
those who did not make it across the border were mowed down by 
gunfire foreign minister robert ouko told a news conference 
friday 
ouko said he did not know how many somalis were killed in the 
violence wednesday or if it was continuing but he said hundreds of 
refugees were still pouring into kenya each day across the eastern 
border with somalia 
four kenyan policemen were killed four people were wounded and 
one person was missing after somali forces raced into the border 
town of liboi and started shooting wildly without provocation 
said ouko 
he said a nearby telecommunications station was badly damaged and 
looted of firearms and ammunition 
ouko gave no reason for the attacks he said kenya strongly 
protested to the somali charge daffaires but received no 
explanation 
we received a note yesterday that the somalis were planning 
to carry out an investigation we have heard nothing since 
said ouko 
liboi 155 miles northeast of nairobi lies across from the 
somali town of doble the somali army reportedly raided that town 
last month when an estimated 5000 somalis fled across the border 
into kenya 
an insurgency calling itself the somali patriotic front emerged 
in opposition to the somali government after those raids 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said wednesdays 
violence occurred as somali forces pursued the rebels near doble 
it was not immediately possible to get comment from somali 
government officials either in kenya or somalia 
in northern somalia far from the kenyan border the somali 
government has been waging a 6yearold battle against rebels in 
recent months reports have surfaced of government opposition in 
other parts of the country

the case of political extremist lyndon larouche aquestion he turned 
aside as a problem of the federal not state government

the disbursement of state cars one caller angry about a proposed 
prison in the town of new braintree accused dukakis of lying when 
he said the state now owns the property in question

after the show dukakis said he enjoyed his stint as host and 
wasnt deterred by the hostile questioner 
you have that on talk shows he said

1970s he was host of a show called the advocates on public 
television that featured roundtable discussions of controversial 
issues

light our houses blew away local resident gladys cruz told the

northern towns and the capital where a third of the islands

china will not abandon reform policies adopted in 
the past but they should enhance the communist party and improve 
socialism party chief jiang zemin said friday 
jiang in an editorial on the frontpage of the communist partys 
peoples daily also said china will maintain its opendoor policy 
within the guidelines of party directives 
the official xinhua news agency paraphrased jiang as saying 
china will resolutely carry out reforms of both economic and 
political structures but these reforms should enhance and perfect 
the party leadership and consolidate and perfect the socialist 
system 
xinhua said jiang made the comments at a meeting of local party 
representatitives also attended by government leaders including 
premier li peng and president yang shangkun 
the peoples daily editorial acknowledged there was concern both 
in china and abroad that the crackdown on dissent could mean an end 
to reform and opendoor policies 
the suppression of dissent began with the june 34 army attacks 
on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing in which hundreds perhaps 
thousands of civilians were killed 
chinas goals are to develop socialism and liberate productive 
forces which can be achieved only through an opendoor policy the 
editorial said 
this cannot be done unless the closeddoor system is destroyed 
and the ossified ways changed we must never return to the old 
closed system it added 
but the editorial declared that the partys policies did not mean 
china would adopt a capitalist system or western ideas 
it said the nations policies cannot be separated from correct 
political ideology and the leadership of the party 
xinhua reported jiang said friday that the party had made 
mistakes but has corrected them it did not say if jiang mentioned 
any specific mistakes 
it quoted him as warning of subversion from international and 
domestic hostile forces that seek to destroy the communist system 
and overthrow the party leadership 
li peng has said several times this month that martial law 
imposed may 20 cannot be lifted at the present because of the 
threat of internal and external subversion

a judge friday sentenced 10 current and former high 
school athletes to prison terms of up to 25 years for their roles in 
a string of armed robberies in the dallas area over the past year 
the defendants in six months time committed more armed 
robberies than bonnie and clyde did in a lifetime said state 
district judge joe kendall if stupidity were a crime you would 
all deserve life without parole 
kendall ordered an 11th youth sent to a prison boot camp for 
young offenders and another received deferred adjudication for 
their parts in 21 robberies in dallas and suburban duncanville 
kendall sentenced the teenagers including a former high school 
allamerica football player after they pleaded guilty to holding up 
several restaurants including some where they worked 
each of the defendants faced a maximum 99year prison sentence 
before sentencing kendall lectured the youths for about 10

motorists can be arrested for leaving an accident 
scene or can lose their license for refusing to undergo drug 
testing but airline pilots are under no such legal obligations 
aviation officials and legal experts said 
the issue of how long flight crew members must stay at an 
accident scene and how soon they must speak with investigators was 
raised by the crash of a usair jetliner into the east river on 
wednesday night 
the pilot michael martin left the scene shortly after his 
boeing 737 skidded off a laguardia airport runway killing two 
passengers and was not interviewed by investigators for more than 
36 hours 
federal officials disagreed on whether his absence hampered the 
crash investigation a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration said its investigators had been unable to contact the 
pilot and could not say what caused the accident until they learned 
why he aborted the takeoff 
but a spokesman for the national transportation safety board 
which ran the investigation said the absence of the pilot was not 
unusual and had not impeded the probe and that the pilot and 
copilot had agreed thursday to be interviewed on friday afternoon 
its not at all unusual for us not to interview a pilot on the 
same day as the accident said the spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
pilots also are not required to submit to alcohol and drug 
testing after accidents automobile drivers who refuse to undergo 
such tests face an automatic license suspension in most states 
most states have laws making it a crime for a driver to leave the 
scene of a serious motor vehicle accident but theres no statue 
or regulation that requires a flight crew to stay at the scene or 
even talk with us said michael benson a spokesman for the safety 
board in washington 
crew members almost always make themselves available however 
and the board has the power to subpoena them to appear before its 
investigators those who are interviewed have the right to be 
accompanied by an attorney 
when it takes an ntsb investigations team several hours to reach 
a crash scene as it did in the case of the usair crash the pilot 
and other crew members frequently have left the scene if for no 
other reason than to seek treatment of injuries 
but benson said the situation in new york was complicated by the 
involvement of local police very unusual in an airline crash 
he said who reached the scene soon after the accident and were 
frustrated by the pilots departure 
patricia goldman usairs chief spokeswoman and negligence 
lawyer mark moller a member of the american bar associations 
committee on torts agreed that it was not unusual for pilots to be 
sequestered by their union their airline or their lawyers 
immediately after a crash 
usually the likelihood is hes going to be in pretty bad shape 
after an accident and anything he says can be used against him 
moller said 
airlines have their own rules for flight crew conduct during and 
after accidents goldman would not comment specifically on usairs 
rules except to say that they require a pilot who has not been 
injured to stay at the scene of an accident until the passengers are 
off the plane

a man who spent nearly 14 years in prison 
for a murder he says he didnt commit and to which another man 
confessed said friday he wants to do more than clear his name 
darrel f parker filed a 125 million lawsuit in federal court 
against the city of lincoln lancaster county and a former police 
chief claiming his rights were violated by his imprisonment and 
denial of a pardon 
its probably difficult for people to accept my story said 
parker 57 who lives in moline ill 
parker was convicted in the dec 14 1955 strangulation of nancy 
parker his wife of 19 months in a house the couple shared in 
lincolns antelope park 
he confessed to the killing after his arrest but later said 
police coerced the statement from him 
last year parker learned that a murderer on death row told his 
lawyers that he had killed mrs parker the man gave them intimate 
details of the killing but made them promise not to reveal his 
confession until after his death he died of a heart attack in july 
1988 
parkers civil rights action names former lincoln police chief 
joe carroll the city of lincoln and lancaster county it seeks 25 
million in compensation and 10 million in punitive damages 
parker said he initially just wanted to clear his name but the 
money is a factor 
theres lost salary the inability to have and rear a family 
and who can put a price tag on that he said 
the lawsuit alleges that police brought in john reid a chicago 
criminologist and polygraph expert known for his ability to get 
confessions and accuses reid of illegally inducing parker to 
confess reid has since died 
there had been a murder in omaha earlier that year and the 
people in lincoln were frightened parker recalled there was a 
mass hysteria the media seized on that and this was known as the 
nosex after breakfast murder 
prosecutors contended that parker killed his wife after breakfast 
because she refused to have sex with him before he left for work 
thats just not true parker said i was young the police 
were experienced they wanted a confession they wanted to solve the 
murder 
parker was released in 1969 after an appeals court said his 
rights had been violated the us supreme court ordered a new 
hearing to determine whether the confession could be used it also 
ordered a new trial 
the trial never was held an agreement between defense and 
prosecution attorneys called for commuting parkers life sentence 
and granting him parole in exchange for his withdrawal of issues 
stemming from his confession 
he chose parole because you have to lay some things aside and 
get on with living and hope that some evidence will come along 
someday that will straighten things out parker said 
when he found out last year about wesley peerys death row 
confession he decided to try to clear his name 
the past year has been a roller coaster of emotions for us 
said eleanor parker parkers wife of 19 years 
the board of pardons on dec 15 1988 denied parker a pardon 
hearing attorney general robert spire a member of the threeperson 
board said parker had other ways to clear his name

a man from barcelona who copies famous works of art 
brought 244 of them to london and sold them all friday for 238600 
they represent the work of about six months in my studio 
said the painter miguel canals in an interview during the sale 
i am an artist and this is my hobby but as i am a catalan 
people say its my business he confided as auctioneer nicholas 
bonham briskly rattled through the copied titians monets goyas and 
van goghs 
they took from 20 to 40 seconds to sell for a few hundred dollars 
each in the packed bonhams salesroom in chelsea 
i am happy with the prices said canals a short dark man in 
his mid50s watching the sale impassively with his wife fernanda 
from across the floor the renaissance madonnas dutch interiors 
english hunting scenes lifesize portraits and sunkissed 
impressionists looked very much like their celebrated originals 
some had been treated to look aged and tiny deliberate mistakes 
could sometimes be spotted so that future experts will be able to 
distinguish them from the originals said bonham 
naturally a copy of the worlds most expensive painting vincent 
van goghs irises was there the original sold for nearly 54 
million at sothebys in new york in 1987 but cost only 4080 after 
40 seconds bidding on friday 
top price was 7500 for a canvas after claude monet of the 
bridge over the artists famous waterlily pool in his garden at 
giverny near paris 
the canals are the same size as the originals in the same media 
oil pastel crayon or watercolor and set in elaborately gilded 
plaster or wood frames on a quick glance they appear to be the real 
thing each is stamped on the back from the studio of miguel 
canals 
among the buyers were interior decorators who said the pictures 
would look good in smart homes and restaurants 
irish rock singer bob geldof looked in and said i think these 
are a good buy after all half the paintings hanging on the walls 
of the worlds museums are fakes 
merle birkmyre a londoner said when asked why anyone would buy 
one of the paintings from spain i feel people will buy a copy of 
a painting after growing up with a print of it or which they love 
an attorney who specified that he not be identified because i 
have two van gogh original drawings said he bought a van 
gogh and a seurat because they look authentic and they will 
look very nice and most of my friends wont know the difference 
from the originals by midnight 
one copy of a familiar beach scene by eugene boudin was 
miscataloged as after eugene canals 
thats wrong said bonham to giggles from the floor this 
is definitely a boudin 
it went for 600 
bonham said later that canals clients include owners of very 
expensive works of art who commission him to paint a copy for the 
wall while they keep the original in a safe 
canals has halfadozen assistants who may all work on one 
painting as each is a specialist in something faces dresses 
flowers trees or ships 
he said yes he also paints originals but it is not 
important

students sang victory chants friday when 
the supreme court issued a ruling legalizing a prosolidarity 
student union and said the union has the right to strike 
students joined by professors and members of parliament 
celebrated the decision in the hallways of the warsaw courthouse 
when the ruling was read in the courtroom crowded with more than 
100 people there were chants of nzs nzs the polish initials 
for the independent students association 
nzs had been banned after the imposition of martial law in 
december 1981 martial law subsequently lifted was used to suspend 
and then outlaw solidarity the first free union movement in the 
soviet bloc the union had been chartered by the government in 1980 
during nationwide strikes 
solidarity was legalized last april following lengthy 
negotiations and scored such stunning victories in summer elections 
that it and two minor parties were able to form the new coalition 
government ending four decades of communist rule 
nzs had insisted on the right to strike over political and school 
issues and that demand had blocked legalization of the association 
after the solidaritygovernment agreement in april 
nzs is polands largest student union with organizations in 
universities and high schools 
it was formed in 1980 along with solidarity and became a 
popular alternative to the communistsanctioned polish students 
association 
nzs was denied legal registration last may when a court declared 
that a new labor did not apply to students and they could not claim 
the right to strike the association refused to change its charter 
which claims strike rights 
even after it was banned nzs supported solidarity demonstrations 
and organized its own to protest outdated equipment and the lack of 
research and library materials and other shortages 
weve been functioning anyway but it is nice to be legal 
again one student in the courtroom said 
pressure to legalize nzs increased as the oct 2 start of the new 
academic year approached there was concern that failure to register 
the association would be met by student protests that could create 
instability as the new solidarityled government tries to reverse 
polands economic crisis

a judges ruling in a divorce battle over 
seven frozen human embryos that life begins at conception must 
withstand the test of higher courts before it sets a precedent in 
the debate over reproductive rights law specialists said friday 
its one decision at this point said elizabeth bartholet an 
expert in family and reproductive law at harvard law school 
neil p cohen of the university of tennessee law school said the 
ultimate decision will be determined by higher appellate courts 
perhaps even the us supreme court 
and those are the decisions well look to for guidance on this 
issue he said 
lori andrews medical law projects director at the american bar 
foundation in chicago said that even in this formative stage 
circuit judge w dale youngs decision thursday in the case of mary 
sue davis vs junior lewis davis will have to be weighed carefully 
by judges facing similar issues 
when he started this case he had nothing to look to for 
precedent and so other judges will at least have to turn first to 
what he said ms andrews said so it will be very widely read 
it will be very influential 
in a 57page decision young plotted out his conclusion that life 
begins at conception relying on the testimony of a french 
geneticist and a federal appeals court decision in florida affirming 
the use of dna fingerprinting in court 
the judge ruled that seven embryos conceived by the davises 
outside the womb through in vitro fertilization were people not 
property and he awarded temporary custody to mrs davis to bring 
them to term 
junior davis who had fought to be part of any decision on the 
disposition of the embryos and not to be forced to become a father 
against his consent said he would appeal to the tennessee court of 
appeals and potentially beyond 
young said after issuing the decision that he would welcome 
review by a higher court 
typically it takes cases two to three years to travel the 
appellate route through the tennessee appeals court and then the 
state supreme court and even longer if the case continues to the 
us supreme court 
janet mayfield the attorney handling davis appeal said a state 
supreme court ruling could come sooner if the courts agree to 
expedite the proceedings for medical reasons 
davis attorneys said they will seek a stay of youngs order 
preventing mrs davis from implanting the embryos until the appeals 
are over there has been some question about how long the seven 
frozen embryos would remain viable 
however dr i ray king who oversees the knoxville clinic where 
the embryos are stored said from our standpoint there would not 
be a time restraint that we know of in other species we can go five 
to 10 years easily i would expect in humans it is probably going 
to be similar to that 
there is also a question of whether the tennessee appellate 
courts will address directly the question of when life begins 
usually judges want to decide something on its narrowest grounds 
and not open up a pandoras box mayfield said 
she said davis appeal would focus on the apparent conflict 
between youngs decision awarding custody to mrs davis with state 
law requiring both parents to consent to donating the organs of 
their children and a state policy requiring the reporting of deaths 
and miscarriages that doesnt mention embryos 
even without appellate review ms andrews of the bar foundation 
suggested the decision though at this point applying strictly to 
youngs jurisdiction could prompt an array of legal cases elsewhere 
on the grounds that embryos are persons 
some possibilities inheritance disputes doctors unwilling to 
perform in vitro procedures for fear of being accused of murder if 
all of the implanted embryos fail to come to term the success rate 
typically is one in five and even tax disputes on whether frozen 
embryos can be counted as dependents on tax returns 
if the ruling withstands appellate review the dimensions could 
be even larger further limiting in vitro fertilization practices 
and potentially entering the area of abortion rights 
the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision giving women 
the right to an abortion did not address the issue of when life 
begins and failed to find constitutional grounds for considering a 
fetus a person 
but the philosophy that would say that life begins at 
conception would also say its appropriate for the state to 
intervene in the womans decision about what to do with that 
pregnancy as early as day one ms bartholet of harvard said 
and the same court that came down with this decision would 
presumably say in the context of abortion that it is ok for the 
state to prohibit abortion from day one and roe vs wade clearly 
says the opposite of that she said 
young said his decision was not concerned with abortion law but 
as ms andrews put it this case has created more potential legal 
problems than it has solved

hurricane hugo killed 10 people in 
montserrat and turned this peaceful hilly island into a junkyard of 
smashed houses and snapped trees residents were repairing their 
homes friday with relief supplies that have been arriving all week 
heavily damaged buildings included the hospital two hotels and 
the american university of the caribbean a medical school 
its disastrous it will never be the same said nancy flynn 
a nurse who was studying at the university 
montserrat was one of the islands hardest hit when hugo ripped 
through the caribbean on sunday and the appointed governor of the 
british colony said he had feared a death toll perhaps 10 times as 
high 
its miraculous the casualties were so low remarked gov 
christopher turner who said he survived four hurricanes in previous 
assignments this one was so bad i thought 50 to 100 deaths would 
be more reasonable 
many victims were elderly unable to escape their collapsing 
homes he said 
ms flynn said that despite severe damage to the hospital about 
40 people were treated there for cuts broken legs and other 
injuries 
people were lying in the beds with water dripping on them 
she said there was no hospital left 
doctors had to suture cuts without anesthetic and beds lacked 
sheets she said 
turner estimated damage at about 100 million he said 30 percent 
of the homes will have to be rebuilt and another 30 percent will 
need extensive repairs 
the governor said that about 3000 of the islands 12500 
residents were left homeless and about 1200 remained in shelters 
friday 
the 39squaremile island lacked power but some water and phone 
service was being restored he said adding the entire island 
will need rewiring ships cannot dock here the storm wiped out 
the wharf in downtown plymouth supplies were being flown in by 
british and canadian c130 military planes that landed on a 
3500foot runway rated for 40000 pounds a loaded c130 carries 
100000 pounds 
the british warship hms alacrity which had been in the area for 
a port call flew a helicopter to the island monday turner said 
the ship and a ham radio operator called for help he reported 
the airport reopened monday afternoon by tuesday food 
building supplies and emergency generators were arriving from 
caribbean neighbors the united states canada and britain roads 
and bridges between blackburne airport and plymouth remained intact 
mona ponde swept up the two remaining rooms of her frame house 
which was surrounded by piles of debris from the demolished homes of 
neighbors 
during the hurricane she and her six children and grandchildren 
huddled in the house until the two bedrooms broke away they stayed 
in a neighbors house until the roof flew off the rest of the storm 
they rode out in the police station 
it was terrible said ms ponde who survived hurricane david 
on neighboring dominica island 10 years ago this one like it 
didnt want to stop at all 
at the medical school the 200 students hid under mattresses in 
the dormitory as the hurricane ripped away the schools buildings 
we watched and said oh my god for hours ms flynn said 
the rev jeff hamblin an episcopal priest who attended the 
school said he crouched against a stone and concrete wall in his 
dormitory 
you could feel it move like you were in a car on a bumpy 
ride he said 
nearly all the trees were broken or uprooted one water tank blew 
off its platform and tumbled down a hillside 
turner said there was some damage at air studio where paul 
mccartney elton john and other rock artists have recorded albums 
the governor said he heard that studio owner george martin would 
like to have all the artists who recorded there put together an 
album to benefit island residents 
some residents went into damaged supermarkets to salvage food 
shortly after the storm but residents said no widespread looting 
occurred merchandise remained on some store shelves friday 
police reported seven arrests for petty theft on thursday 
the island went through little of the chaos experienced in st 
croix in the us virgin islands where residents ransacked stores 
and prisoners reportedly were released from the damaged jail to roam 
the streets president bush ordered 1200 troops mostly military 
police to st croix wednesday 
my prisoners are out of prison too but theyre rebuilding the 
hospital turner said 
a relief headquarters called by the british a major incident 
center was operating downtown 
the sounds of hammering were heard throughout the island on 
friday as residents fixed roofs and started rebuilding homes 
montserratians are the salt of the earth turner said its 
a community which has got it together

the nations first murder conviction based on the 
use of socalled dna fingerprinting evidence was upheld friday by 
the state supreme court 
in a pair of unanimous rulings the court concluded that dna 
tests which linked timothy wilson spencer to the rapeslayings of 
two women were scientifically reliable 
dna deoxyribonucleic acid is the basic genetic material in 
human cells scientists believe that everyone except for identical 
twins has a unique dna pattern 
spencer 26 a former resident of a richmond halfway house was 
convicted of murder and sentenced to death in separate trials last 
year for the slayings of susan m tucker 44 of arlington and 
debbie dudley davis 35 of richmond 
the women were bound and strangled by an assailant who broke into 
their homes through a window at both trials evidence was offered 
that semen samples from the crime scenes and blood samples from 
spencer had matching dna patterns 
in dna analysis microscopic fragments of threadlike genetic 
material are treated so that they arrange themselves into 
characteristic patterns which look much like the bar codes used by 
supermarket scanners 
if pattern samples from crime scene match the suspects the 
blood or semen is considered to have come from the suspect since 
the likelihood of matching patterns from different people is 
reckoned at 1 in many millions 
the state supreme court said spencers challenge to the dna 
evidence amounted to saying that we should hold off until another 
day any decision on the reliability of such tests 
but a number of expert witnesses testified that the technique is 
generally accepted in the scientific community 
indeed spencer acknowledges that the evidence establishes that 
the dna tests are accepted as reliable within the scientific 
community and that he was unable to find or produce one qualified 
expert to debunk either the theory of dna printing or the statistics 
generated therefrom the court said 
earlier this year spencer was convicted and sentenced to death

more than 100 members of the house on friday 
asked a conference committee to reject a senate provision limiting 
the power of federal courts to protect the northern spotted owl from 
the timber industry of the pacific northwest 
some critics of the provision said they would mount a floor fight 
if they had to 
lawmakers from the area meanwhile stepped up efforts to reach a 
compromise that would be acceptable to environmentalists the timber 
industry and their colleagues 
the conference committee of members from the house and senate 
next week will try to work out differences between the two versions 
of the interior department appropriations bill to which the senate 
provision is attached 
the critics signed a letter delivered friday to rep sidney 
yates dill the house chairman of the conference committee urging 
that the conference drop a senateapproved amendment that would bar 
federal courts during the next year from enjoining any timber sales 
in federal forests known to contain the northern spotted owl 
the owl lives only in oldgrowth forests of the northwest the 
fish and wildlife service is considering whether to declare it a 
threatened species which would require federal agencies to protect 
its habitat 
what is proposed by the senate is unprecedented and unwise 
minnesota democratic rep bruce vento one of the signers of the 
letter said at a news conference 
when asked whether he would be willing to lead a floor fight if 
changes werent made vento said absolutely this is not just a 
policy question for the northwest we are willing to look at some 
form of relief for the timber industry but this is not the path

local officials 
complained friday that the virgin islands remained without any major 
us relief five days after the devastation caused by hurricane 
hugo even though federal forces were sent to control civil disorder 
i think the governor was wrong in telling the people the 
military was coming without telling them when food was coming 
water was coming said territorial sen lilliana belardo de oneal 
lt gov derek hodge the no 2 official in this popular resort 
announced friday that hugo left homeless about 90 percent of st 
croixs population or more than 45000 people st croix about 70 
miles east of puerto rico is the main island in the group that 
includes st thomas and st john 
hodge said damage was tentatively estimated at 4 billion 
he also said the storm killed at least four people in the us 
virgin islands and injured 700 others a red cross official however 
put the deaths at six 
hugo slammed into the islands sunday during its sweep of the 
northeastern caribbean knocking out water supplies electricity and 
communications 
the island is almost a total disaster said hodge in a radio 
broadcast 
he appealed for the national guard the police and other public 
employees to return to work in full force despite the continued 
chaos on the island he said the national guard was operating at 
40percent strength and the police at 80 percent 
belardo de oneal said she and four other senators had met with 
gov alexander farrelly on friday to find out when people can expect 
relief supplies 
the st croix red cross vice chairman evelyn crittenden 
complained that the army failed to promptly fly in food clothes 
bedding and medicine

a federal judge erred in barring distribution of 
spy magazines parody of cliffs notes because the publics right to 
free expression outweighs any possible confusion among consumers an 
appeals court said friday 
in a 17page ruling three judges of the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals explained their sept 5 decision to lift the lower 
courts injunction 
spy notes published by bantam doubleday dell publishing group 
inc uses the format of cliffs notes the longestablished study 
guide to the classics to poke fun at what spy coeditor kurt 
andersen called the hip urban novel 
the district courts ruling unjustifiably imposes the drastic 
remedy of a prepublication injunction upon the cover of a literary 
parody the judges wrote 
cliffs notes inc sued the doubleday group because it claimed 
the parody looked too much like the real thing and would confuse 
consumers 
us district judge shirley wohl kram granted cliffs notes a 
preliminary injunction on aug 2 and doubleday immediately appealed 
the appeals court lifted the ban on sept 5 and said a full opinion 
would follow 
we conclude that the parody cover of spy notes although it 
surely conjures up the original and goes to great lengths to use 
some of the identical colors and aspects of the cover design of 
cliffs notes raises only a slight risk of consumer confusion that 
is outweighed by the public interest in free expression the 
judges said 
they noted that the cover of spy notes prominently states a 
satire five times in bright red letters on the front and four 
times on the back the judges also said that a substantial portion 
of spy notes potential audience college students or 
collegeeducated adults overlaps with cliffs notes audience 
as a result the name spy in the title the notation a spy 
book emblazoned on the cover of spy notes and the use of a prepack 
marketing device prominently displaying the spy name should alert 
the buyer that spy notes is a parody of some sorts or at least 
that it is not the same product as cliffs notes the judges said 
when the injunction was lifted doubleday spokeswoman jacqueline 
deval said spy notes was expected to be on sale at bookstores around 
the country by the week of sept 18 
spy notes gives humorous plot summaries commentary and questions 
for review on contemporary novels like bright lights big city 
by jay mcinerney and slaves of new york by tama janowitz 
it also includes the novelomatic a slide rulelike device that 
andersen says allows readers to create their own 1980s novel

the mansions of charleston which 
survived the civil war withstood the onslaught of hurricane hugos 
135 mphwinds on friday but the rest of the city bore fresh scars 
from the regions worst storm in 30 years 
the city where the first shots of the war between the states were 
fired in 1861 looked much like a battlefield friday with 
rifletoting national guards troops men posted to prevent looting in 
stores and buildings gutted by the wind and a tidal surge of 12 to 
17 feet 
it looked like just devastation all over the city said 
resident milton demetre one of the chimneys and half the roof were 
gone from his 200yearold house 
the streets were littered with bricks awnings broken glass and 
other debris the storm packing 135 mph winds toppled chimneys 
tore up roofs shattered windows and collapsed houses over dozens of 
square blocks 
most of the storied antebellum mansions that line the battery 
facing charleston harbor appeared to have weathered the storm with 
little damage the roofs of a few homes looked beaten by the 
hurricaneforce winds the biggest threat appeared to be flood 
waters which could be seen as high as the porches 
you come to respect the hurricane you can see it on the radar 
but it doesnt do anything for you you see its really big said 
resident elizabeth lee 
pointing to a house in the citys historic district she said 
that house has been through hurricanes civil wars and all you 
dont understand until youve been there 
there were times we didnt know we would be alive today we all 
woke up and we hugged each other she said 
across the street people had to sidestep broken tree limbs 
tangled in spanish moss 
at st michaels episcopal church a piece of wood was lodged in 
the side of the roof like a spear and stones from the facade of the 
charleston county courthouse littered the ground 
mayor joseph p riley jr placed the damage estimate as high as 
1 billion

president bush trying to help 
republicans score a comefrombehind victory in the new jersey 
governors race portrayed democrats on friday as soft on crime 
eager to raise taxes and champions of the failed policies of the 
1970s 
in a sharply partisan speech bush said there was a lot at stake 
in the nov 7 election the future versus the past policies that 
work versus policies that dont a better future for our children 
or one of lost opportunity 
the race one of two governors contests this year pits 
republican rep jim courter against democrat james florio to succeed 
gop gov thomas kean the other gubernatorial contest is in virginia 
i am the underdog in this race courter said acknowleging he 
trails florio in public opinion polls 
florio a liberal democrat ran a close race against kean in 
1981 the governor is not seeking reelection 
the failed policies of the 1970s just arent good enough 
bush said not for new jersey not for the united states of 
america theyre not good enough to tackle drugs or crime or to 
protect the environment or do better as a nation in education 
theyre not good enough for our kids 
bush campaigned for courter at a state republican fundraising 
luncheon before flying to maine for a weekend at his seaside 
compound in kennebunkport 
before settling in at his vacation home bush made a brief stop 
at a remote tree farm in nearby wells to underscore his call for a 
reduction in capital gains taxes which are imposed on profits from 
sales of real estate stocks and other assets 
farm owner martin morse owner of the 700acre spread told bush 
that tree farmers face substantial costs before there is any income 
and said that they have to face substantial risk 
the farmer said the 1986 changes in the capital gains tax law had 
cost him more than 4000 in one year 
bush rode to the farm in a van that became stuck in the farms 
dusty driveway as he was leaving he was pushed out and drove to the 
golf course for a round with brent scowcroft his national security 
adviser 
after nine holes the president went fishing in the dark for 15 
minutes in the ocean off his home as far as anybody could see he 
caught nothing 
bush used a tree farm to advance his campaign for a capital gains 
tax cut because tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on profits 
from their sales 
thats because trees are considered tangible assets rather than 
merchandise 
the administration contends that many tree farms are small 
marginal operations before the 1986 tax reform act tree farmers 
could pay the thenlower rate on capital gains and make ago of it 
officials contend now with the higher rates many are going 
bankrupt the administration contends 
bush told the gop fundraiser that he rejected democrats charges 
that his plan was a tax break for the rich it is a tax adjustment 
that is going to create jobs in america and that is why i am going 
to continue to fight for it 
bush will make a threehour excursion saturday to speak a 
luncheon of the archdiocese of boston catholic lawyers guild 
on monday he will travel to new york for his first speech as 
president to the united nations general assembly he will return to 
washington late that night after hosting a reception and dinner for 
un dignataries 
sponsors said the new jersey luncheon raised 700000 for the 
gop bush told the audience 
in new jersey bush told republicans this election will decide 
whether new jersey builds on what you began eight years ago or 
whether it risks everything by returning to the past whether new 
jersey has the inspired leadership it needs to win the war on drugs 
and crime or whether it reverts to failed social policies that 
blame everyone but the criminal 
this election will decide whether new jersey continues to have 
the kind of leadership which balances a sound economy and a sound 
ecology or whether its leadership says no to higher taxes and 
yes to extending the prosperity of the last eight years bush 
said 
he said republican leadership would champion the environment 
education jobs and the war on drugs and that new jerseys 
residents should oppose those liberal democrats who cherish new 
taxes like moths drawn to some kind of a candle 
the old new jerseys attitude was if one tax didnt work try 
another one he said

justice minister monica de greiff 
resigned on friday after death threats from drug runners and said 
she did so at the request of president virgilio barco 
she said barco thought he needed another type of person in 
the post 
barco issued a decree naming communications minister carlos lemos 
simmonds a former foreign minister as acting justice minister 
lemos simmonds had been filling in for ms de greiff while she 
was in the united states following threats against her her husband 
and her 3yearold son 
friday night a bomb exploded at a suburban office of el 
espectador a newspaper that has carried on a courageous public 
campaign against drug and drug traffickers bogota police said the 
small device destroyed the front of the advertising office 
el espectadors main building was severely damaged on sept 2 by 
a car bomb that contained an estimated 500 pounds of explosives 
bombings have occurred in colombian cities virtually every night 
for the past month with most of the targets in bogota medellin and 
cali 
in an interview with the radio caracol network ms de greiff 
said she wrote a letter of resignation after being asked to do so by 
the president she was colombias sixth justice minister in three 
years 
the president has every right to ask for changes when he deems 
appropriate she said adding that she would have preferred to 
stay on the job 
i love colombia and i think we all have to be united during 
these difficult times she said referring to the current war 
between the government and the nations powerful drug traffickers 
the president thinks he needs another type of person in the 
ministry and he has every right to ask for my resignation she 
said 
ms de greiff a 32yearold lawyer who accepted the post july 
16 criticized unnecessary controversy surrounding her 
resignation she had consistently denied reports she would quit 
vowing to continue cracking down on the drug cartels 
on tuesday the president offered me the embassy in portugal 
but i think that after assuming this responsibility as minister i 
shouldnt leave right now i must stay in colombia even as a 
private citizen she said 
ms de greiff said she would travel to the united states in the 
next few days to be with her husband and son who are there after 
being threatened with death by the drug cartels 
nearly all her predecessors were threatened with death one was 
assassinated in 1984 and another who resigned to become ambassador 
to hungary in 1987 was shot five times in the face and seriously 
wounded while walking on a budapest street 
during a visit to washington in august ms de greiff appealed to 
the bush administration for 19 million in additional aid to provide 
security for hundreds of colombian judges threatened with death by 
drug traffickers 
the governments war on drugs began after the assassination aug 
18 of sen luis carlos galan a popular presidential candidate who 
had called for tough measures against drug barons 
drug traffickers have responded with a series of assassinations 
threats and bombings twelve bombs exploded in bogota on thursday 
most at offices of colombias two main political parties 
there were newspaper and broadcast reports that barco would make 
major cabinet changes as a result of ms de greiffs resignation 
and a flurry of meetings took place in the presidential palace 
the change comes amid growing tension between the barco 
government and the united states over the denial or cancellation of 
us visas to 25 lawmakers and politicians allegedly because of 
links to cocaine barons 
foreign minister julio londono paredes wrote a letter friday to 
us embassy charges daffaire phillip mclain asking for an 
explanation of the publication in the media thursday of the names of 
colombians denied entrance to the united states 
my government considers that versions of this kind without an 
adequate clarification and precise explanation could generate a 
climate of undesirable relations between our two countries said 
londonos letter which was read over radio caracol 
after meeting with londono at the foreign ministry mclain told 
reporters the united states does not make lists of people who 
receive visas or dont receive visas because of social or political 
activities 
he added there is no blacklist or list of any other color 
the united states embassy has said the privacy act forbids it 
from discussing individual cases of people denied visas 
but testimony in a new york city courtroom tuesday indicated a 
secret list of barred foreigners is kept by the us immigration and 
naturalization service 
us district judge john m walker ordered the ins to partially 
reveal its list following a suit brought by colombian journalist 
patricia lara 35 who was barred from entering the united states in 
1986 to receive the maria moors cabot prize at columbia university 
in new york 
ins officials ordered ms lara to return to colombia without 
telling her why she was banned 
senators whose names were on the list published thursday 
denounced the united states and charged they were being persecuted 
for speaking out against us policy instead of for drug 
connections 
this war is going to go on until we legalize drugs not only in 
colombia but worldwide said sen bernardo guerra serra of the 
governing liberal party 
others went as far as to accuse the united states of instigating 
the climate of terror in colombia 
i will show that we are surrounded by mercenaries encrusted in 
the american embassy said sen juan slebi also of the liberal 
party he also believes drugs should be legalized

the recommendation of the administrative hearing committee is 
that the fraternity be dissolved for three years with no activities 
whatsoever all activities will cease immediately except for

truck driver ruben perez and his assistant who also was in the dr 
pepper truck when it hit the bus thursday 
perez told texas department of public safety troopers thursday

a chinese student wept during an immigration 
hearing friday as she described her fathers imprisonment during her 
countrys cultural revolution and said she would rather die than 
return to her homeland 
if we return its like a death row my life will be like my 
fathers and many others said hoy yu li 27 who along with her 
fiance luo jian guang 32 fled china through hong kong and is 
seeking political asylum 
the two students who were led into court in handcuffs sought 
asylum after leading a protest in tokyo on june 4 against the 
chinese armys bloody repression of unarmed demonstrators in 
beijings tiananmen square 
immigration judge bernard hornbach continued the hearing until 
friday and advised an attorney for the students to seek hoys 
release from custody through immigration officials so she could seek 
medical treatment for ulcerlike symptoms 
during two hours of dramatic testimony hoy described how her 
father a poet deteriorated mentally during his incarceration and 
how her brother tried twice to swim the river between china and hong 
kong before succeeding in 1976 
asked whether she would be willing to return to china hoy grew 
somber and said id rather die 
luo had been studying business and hoy linguistics at a 
university in tokyo for more than two years before the june 4 
protest in front of the chinese embassy in tokyo 
after the protest the couple received anonymous threats at their 
home in tokyo they said using argentine passports and helped by 
students in hong kong they fled to san francisco on august 7 to 
seek asylum

residents in the united states who have spoken out against the 
current regime in beijing there has been only one other case in 
which a chinese came into the united states after tiananmen to seek 
asylum wong said 
the us government estimates there are 73000 chinese students 
in the country president bush decided in june to allow students who 
were in the country at the time of the beijing crackdown to remain 
here 
we seek to prove that being a prodemocracy student 
constitutes membership in a particular social group under the 1980 
refugee act wong said if we succeed this will set a very 
important precedent that may enable other prodemocracy students to 
be granted asylum in the us 
a decision could come immediately after fridays hearing or 
within the next few weeks he said 
immigration and naturalization service attorney beverly phillips 
said the ins had no particular position on the asylum issue but 
filed a brief containing a state department recommendation that it 
not be granted because the students hadnt proven they face 
persecution if they return to china 
since turning themselves over to immigration authorities luo has 
been held in a laredo texas city jail while hoy has been at a 
detention center in san diego 
luo testified that his father was jailed for nine years during 
the cultural revolution because because of developing a plan to make 
his city government in sort of a capitalist way his mother and 
a paternal brother were also jailed he said 
when his father died in july luo said he was afraid to return 
for the funeral 
i would never return to china he said they know my name 
they will imprison me 
both students said their japan visas were due to expire soon and 
they feared applying for extensions because the japanese government 
would ask the chinese government for comment and force them to 
return home

israel called on its arab neighbors 
friday to open immediate talks on a regional ban on chemical weapons 
and accused libya and syria of building up huge stockpiles 
eytan bentsur head of the israeli delegation to an international 
governmentindustry conference on chemical weapons in canberra 
called for separate talks between israel and individual arab states 
on a ban 
but egypt iraq and iran dismissed the idea of such a ban during 
interviews earlier this week they either ruled out regional accords 
entirely or argued that nuclear weapons should be included in the 
talks 
israel is believed to possess both chemical and nuclear weapons 
bentsur appealed to the nations of the middle east not to wait 
for the completion of a global convention but to work on a 
unilateral or regional basis 
he also attacked algeria for its refusal to allow israel to join 
the genevabased conference on disarmament which is working to draw 
up a global ban 
referring to libya and syria two hardline arab states bentsur 
said it is doubly important the convention be universal and 
allbinding in the light of the fact that two states known to be 
producing and stockpiling huge arsenals of chemical weapons who 
constitute a serious threat to the neighboring states have chosen 
not to participate in this conference 
the canberra conference which began tuesday has attracted 
government and industry representatives from 67 nations friday was 
its last day 
it was the first time industry has been involved in talks on a 
chemical weapons ban and led to an international industry agreement 
to help ban the weapons

this is one of a series of periodic reports 
looking ahead to western europe in 1992 when the 12 nations of the 
european economic community remove their trade barriers and 
interlock their policies and goals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after years of focusing its efforts on 
economic and technological progress japan is trying to show west 
europeans it has more to offer than walkmans nikons and hondas 
it is doing so in europalia 89 japan a threemonth art 
extravaganza in hopes of enhancing its reputation within the 
12nation european economic community which will take down internal 
trade barriers and interlock economic policies and goals by the end 
of 1992 
the exhibition is intended to show the depth of japanese culture 
and to offset charges often leveled against japan that it dumps 
goods on the market at unfair prices and follows a course of 
protectionism and economic imperialism in trade policy 
with 1992 closing in the japanese decided to make their move 
into a market which will have 320 million potential customers 
the japanese prime minister told me it was important to 
reinforce the bonds with europe in view of 1992 which worries 
japan said jacques groothaert europalias organizer 
japan is going to great lengths now to give europeans a better 
and different view of its society 
europalia is costing 25 million and shows priceless pieces of 
japans cultural heritage for the first time ever overseas 
it is clear they want to spread a different image said gretl 
van ourti of the europalia japanese committee 
it all contrasts greatly with the past when the japanese used 
to make a bad marketing effort whenever it concerned their own 
image said jeanpierre debever japan specialist at belgiums 
foreign trade ministry 
now they want to put japan in a more positive a softer 
light 
in all more than 500 events from blockbuster art exhibits 
plays ballets to literature and philosophy sessions are expected 
to attract an estimated 17 million people in cities across belgium 
in addition there will be a smattering of events in six other 
european nations 
although europalia is by far the most spectacular effort japan 
has also been using other means to make itself better known 
these range from an increase in trade missions symposia and 
corporate conventions on japan to cocktail parties dinners and golf 
competitions said etsuro yoneyama president of the japanese 
association in belgium 
there is widespread agreement among the japanese here that we 
have to increase such happenings he said 
at the same time trade relations with the eec are slowly 
improving despite a staggering 25 billion trade imbalance in 
japans favor and the barriers europeans face to get a stake in 
asias richest market 
there are still major trade problems expected and many things 
still have to be solved but we are on the right track said eec 
spokesman nico wegter who lauded japans recent initiatives to 
market itself better 
europalia organizers faced many problems to lure japan as the 
first noneuropean nation to their 20yearold festival since its 
inception europalia has highlighted art from a european nation once 
every two years 
at first few japanese companies seemed willing to sponsor the 
event 
they were slow to catch on but changed when they realized what 
a great base it would be for 1992 said debever 
as europalias headquarters are in brussels which also is the 
home base of the eec the festivals marketing effort gained an 
extra dimension and when japans emperor akihito formally endorsed 
europalia as a showcase for japanese art and culture money began to 
stream in 
japanese corporations are financing half of europalias budget 
with the remainder coming from the japanese government and european 
sources 
despite all the good will a cultural divide remains 
while european companies traditionally support the arts in a 
discreet manner japanese firms look for a maximum return on 
investment 
toyota for instance has been elevated to europalias official 
car and chopsticks and sushi at official receptions are brought 
to you by la porte of japan a brussels restaurant 
and ironically japan a nation keen on uniforms in the 
workplace went against european tradition to insist europalia 
hostesses wear no official outfits for fear these would cheapen the 
cultural aspect of the happening

it was as revolutionary as the storming of the 
bastille as beautifully engineered as the eiffel tower that great 
french achievement the brassiere is 100 years old this year 
as the eiffel tower was going up an enterprising french lady 
named herminie cadolle was constructing the first bra called 
soutiengorge in france literally throat support a 
euphemism for bosom uplift 
while her invention has become a wardrobe fixture her 
descendants are still serving up couture bras and other lingerie 
in the quietly exclusive house of cadolle on the rue cambon in paris 
just off the fashionable rue du faubourg sainthonore 
my greatgreatgrandmother was very liberated said poupie 
cadolle 43 an ebullient blonde who carries on the familys custom 
lingerie trade with her mother alice 
elegant women had long suffered the constraints of bust bandeaux 
or body corsets culminating in the sculpted naughty nineties 
torsocincher aptly called the waspie 
as a working woman she was widowed at a very young age 
herminie was distressed by the currently fashionable straitjacket 
so she came up with a frilly twopart garment the first 
beribboned bra it was attached to the corset by net but freed 
the abdomen and soon became an altogether separate item 
suspended from its two shoulder straps this revolutionary 
contraption was colorfully called the bienetre or wellbeing 
although rooted in the french word for arm bras the term 
brassiere is the english usage the french still call the garment a 
soutiengorge 
the soutiengorge was a boon to women who were fainting dead away 
as their whaleboned corsets socked them in the sternum and literally 
knocked the air out of them 
herminie patented her invention but it was soon copied widely 
since then the bra has had its ups and downs 
with the boyish looks of chanel after world war i the bra was 
reduced to little more than a band as women strove for flat chests 
but it surged back gloriously in the sweatergirl years after 
world war ii epitomized by busty movie stars like jane russell and 
later jayne mansfield inspiring the less wellendowed to look for 
an artificial uplift 
bra manufacturers fell all over themselves to give breasts 
sexy shapes that sometimes looked like cannon shells rather than 
bosoms 
in france sex kitten brigitte bardot showing her perky bosom in 
and god created women did a lot for the bra and like many 
other stars she bought hers at cadolle 
but concerns for a shapely bosom were deflated to an alltime low 
after 1968 when militant womens libbers symbolically burned their 
bras or stopped wearing them 
poupie cadolle said she was horrified by all this 
it was a catastrophe to let bosoms sag that way 
her bra sales sagged too by at least 30 percent 
but theyve popped up recently she said welcoming the 
recent return to sexier dress that gives bras and bustiers a boost 
nevertheless she is leery of couturiers 
i think they hate bosoms deep down she said 
however some designers like chantal thomass and jeanpaul 
gaultier see bras as real fashion items gaultier has even used 
metal bullettip bras with oldfashioned garter belts to 
titillate audiences at his showings 
now poupie cadolle plans her own underwearouterwear 
collection of sweet nothings dolled up for party wear feeling that 
the time is ripe for bringing silk and lace out of the lingerie 
closet 
about half mrs cadolles clients are americans and she gets a 
kick out of them 
theyre likely to yell greetings to each other between dressing 
rooms she said whereas french women sneak around perhaps not 
wanting to show that they spend that much money 
a custommade bra in her shop costs about 300 
americans have bigger bosoms than the french she said but shes 
using more fabric for everyone these days since the average size 
has risen from about 34a to 36b mainly due to the birthcontrol 
pill 
shes very upbeat about the future of the bra especially the new 
lowcut reinforced models to emphasize curves for decollete dresses 
colorfully called pigeonniers or balconnets little 
balconies to push chests out like pouter pigeons chests 
but she also sees a return to the old waspie waistcincher 
catching on like wildfire especially with the japanese who dont 
have very curvy silhouettes

in the jk volume of a recent 
encyclopedia brittanica the writer henry james has a sixcolumn 
entry his sister alice is given no mention at all 
the 19thcentury diarist never succeeded in establishing herself 
as a talent which seemed a literary crime to the small group of men 
and women who founded a writers collective in her name 
alice james books an independent press that emphasizes womens 
work was conceived in 1972 as a strike against not only victorian 
mores but also against the maledominated reading lists most 
college freshmen were studying in the 1970s 
at the time the people who sat in the important chairs at the 
publishing houses were men said marjorie fletcher a poet and 
cofounder it was far easier to get a book on baseball into print 
than one by a woman or about womens issues 
the collective publishes about 2100 copies each of two books of 
poetry every summer and spring its authors vary in age race and 
lifestyle but they all share in the ideals from which the 
nonprofit enterprise grew 
when alice james writers agree to join the cooperative they 
agree to nurture their colleagues as well as their own work 
so far about 70 authors have made the twoyear commitment during 
which they guide their own book into print three have received 
beatrice hawley awards a grant named after the poet that allows 
poets outside of new england to publish 
rosamond rosenmeier is just wrapping up work on her first 
collection lines out which appears this fall 
the experience is extraordinary says rosenmeier a writing 
professor at the university of massachusetts in boston 
with the help of a buddy a veteran collective member whos 
already been through the process she has taken her book from pen 
and paper to its final production stages 
its definitely my book rosenmeier said ive had a hand 
in everything choosing the print negotiating with the typesetter 
picking the cover design we even did the pasteup 
that participation and the support collective members lend one 
another are part of the philosophy inspired by alice james who 
struggled in the shadow of her five brothers including henry and 
william a prominent psychologist 
henry james the author of such works as portrait of a lady 
and the ambassadors was so unsettled by his sisters diaries 
which he considered an invasion of privacy that he burned his copy 
according to biographers 
she was a talented woman who never had a chance to develop 
fletcher said of alice james who died at the age of 43 
today fletcher says its a whole new ballgame women have 
gained widespread acceptance so much so that the collective has 
begun casting its net wider and more actively soliciting minority 
writers 
inclusion is the idea 
rosenmeier chuckles to think of the groups regular sunday 
afternoon meetings were all so different she says about a 
dozen writers from all walks of life gather at one members home 
bringing with them plenty of pasta salad fruit cheese and wine 
fletcher says its funny to watch everyone file in when the 
meeting convenes 
everybody finds a chair that somehow issues from her 
personality some sit on the floor the clubby people sit on the 
couch i sit on a chair she says 
the business of running and promoting alice james is always high 
on the meetings agenda the authors take no salary but revenue 
from limited sales through catalogs book fairs and a few stores is 
far from enough to sustain the collectives budget 
the press relies in large part on state federal and private 
grants which fletcher said have dwindled steadily particularly 
under the strain of massachusetts current fiscal crisis 
but jenney milner a parttime office manager and the only paid 
employee said the gatherings inevitably swerve from the pragmatic 
to a freeforall 
thats when they get interesting she said when we talk 
about the philosophy of the press 
and adds fletcher the vagaries of the commercial world or 
damned luck cant change our commitment to empowerment to fairness 
to our philosophy

the aggressiveness of his answer stunned the 
audience 
education secretary lauro cavazos normally one of the most 
easygoing members of president bushs cabinet had just been asked 
if letting parents pick their childs school would lead to 
halfempty dumb dumb schools 
well then why dont we just close those dumb dumb schools 
cavazos told reporters gathered for a breakfast briefing shaking in 
anger he jabbed the air with his finger over the choice 
question hed been asked 
such emotion is something educators hope to see more of from 
cavazos at the education summit meeting wednesday and thursday in 
charlottesville va one reason cavazos a college president before 
becoming education secreatry last year will be the only educator 
sure to attend the meeting of bush and the nations governors 
does cavazos see his role as a burden 
i dont think of it as pressure the 62yearold former 
professor said in an interview 
there certainly have been certain amounts of pressure in his 
role preparing for the summit he said adding this is really the 
presidents summit im just simply a supporter of the president 
and trying to move ahead his program 
cavazos pointed out that other educators may indeed attend the 
summit each governor can bring one aide to the table and the 
secretary conjectured many may bring the heads of their education 
departments 
the summit cavazos said should create the kind of climate 
that will permit education to be examined the only problem all of 
us have is solving that education deficit 
although highly praised for his understanding of education some 
educational leaders are concerned that cavazos conciliatory style 
which won their support after being battered by the abrasive 
outspoken william bennett may hinder cavazos from aggressively 
pushing with the president substantive educational programs and the 
money needed to make them work 
i see this as a beginning cavazos said of the twoday 
gathering people look at this as the end were not going to come 
out of there with a lot of ideas and direction we have a long way 
to go to solve this education deficit 
cavazos chuckled at the mention of money a subject that has been 
avoided like the plague by virtually all those expected to have a 
role at the summit repeating a statement often used by 
administration officials he said i dont think we need more 
money for education 
the education deficit is not a fiscal deficit i see it as a 
deficiency deficit he said pointing to the 3305 billion 
expected to be spent on education by all levels of government this 
year and the 353 billion projected for next year 
when you look at that amount of money that means that 
people out there are investing a tremendous amount of money in 
education and yet when you look at our performance educationally it 
is not an issue of dollars to me it is an issue of changing the way 
we are doing things now 
as the nations top educator cavazos has been working 
extremely close with the white house in planning the summit 
attending extensive meetings and providing background 
information and suggestions that are helping to shape the agenda 
the secretary has been lauded by educators who credit him with 
persuading bush to hold a series of private meetings with various 
groups prior to the summit 
i certainly have pushed the idea because i very much wanted to 
have this happen said cavazos what were trying to do is 
bring in a broad consensus and gather ideas from that 
i want to make it very clear that im optimistic the very fact 
that the president has called this summit is a tremendous historic 
occasion 
cavazos the first hispanic named to a cabinet post has been a 
loyal promoter of bushs education initiatives quietly circulating 
through capitol hill and around the country to spread the bushs 
rhetoric 
key among cavazos own pet projects is bilingual education but 
he has won the most praise for his student loan default regulations 
which educators say have shown the right combination of toughness 
and understanding of the soaring multibilliondollar default 
problem 
initially lukewarm to the idea of parental choice when it comes 
to their childs school cavazos has since enthusiastically embaced 
what has become the centerpiece of bushs education initiative 
without a doubt choice will be discussed at the summit along 
with five other topics that bush and the governors hope will lead to 
national goals on what children should learn 
cavazos has described himself as the systems first beneficiary 
of choice because his father then the foreman of the huge king 
ranch near kingsville texas managed to send his five children to 
the local anglo school and not an inferior one for hispanics 
cavazos grew up on the ranch served in the army for two years 
attended college in texas on the gi bill and earned a doctorate in 
physiology from iowa state university he taught anatomy at the 
medical college of virginia and tufts university medical school 
becoming dean of the latter in 1975 
in 1980 cavazos moved to lubbock to become president of texas 
tech university and in september 1988 thenpresident reagan tapped 
him to succeed bennett as education secretary bush who had pledged 
not only to be the education president but to put at least one 
hispanic in his cabinet kept cavazos on

us district judge walter l nixon jr 
imprisoned on a perjury conviction since march 1988 wants the 
senate to let him go from his jail cell back to the federal bench 
it could happen says sen dennis deconcini dariz who sat 
on the impeachment trial committee for former us district judge 
harry claiborne three years ago but even though the impeachment 
proceedings are separate from nixons criminal trial deconcini says 
he doubts the public would understand an acquittal in one following 
conviction in the other 
claiborne also was in prison at the time of his impeachment and 
the lawyer who defended him is less than optimistic about nixons 
chances poor judge nixon doesnt stand a chance says attorney 
oscar goodman blaming the senates decision three years ago to 
begin having a small group of senators conduct impeachment trials 
and then report to the full chamber 
very few of the senators had any comprehension of what the 
proceedings were all about goodman says 
nixon is the 15th person to be impeached by the house and 
scheduled for trial by the senate in the history of the united 
states for the first 197 years of congress that meant trial by the 
full senate 
but when the senate got the claiborne case in 1986 the first 
impeachment in 50 years it appointed a 12member committee to 
preside over the trial and report back to the full body 
after the report from the committee and a secret debate among all 
the members the senate removed claiborne from office nixons trial 
before the senate panel was completed this month and the committee 
is due to report to the full senate in october 
nixons lawyer david stewart has filed a lawsuit in us 
district court claiming the committee method is unconstitutional 
so have the attorneys for us district judge alcee hastings of 
florida who also is awaiting a verdict he was impeached by the 
house and had his trial july 10aug 3 before a senate committee 
chaired by sen jeff bingaman dnm 
deconcini defends the process saying the constitution is silent 
on how the senate is to conduct its trial furthermore he says the 
constitution doesnt give the courts jurisdiction over the senates 
internal procedures 
during the fourday nixon trial that ended sept 13 a committee 
led by sen wyche fowler dga listened with rapt attention 
though seldom with full attendance to the proceedings the trial 
also was broadcast over the closedcircuit congressional cable 
channel 
nixons story is that of an exemplary federal judge whose 
21year career seldom saw a case overturned on appeal but whose 
associations with an eccentric millionaire and a flamboyant county 
prosecutor in hattiesburg miss led him into a tangle of perceived 
illegality adverse local publicity and a federal investigation that 
ended with a perjury conviction 
deconcini who is not on the nixon committee says there is a 
distinction between a criminal conviction and potential removal from 
office which is what the senate does when it convicts on 
impeachment 
they may sound alike and appear alike but they truly are two 
different things he says the constitution does not say that a 
public official must be removed from office following a criminal 
offense 
it is my judgment that we are to make that decision 
deconcini says 
the key figures in the nixon case are 
drew fairchild estranged son of the richest man in hattiesburg 
miss he was arrested on charges of smuggling a ton of marijuana 
into the local airport and released by federal authorities after a 
plea bargain but didnt pay his attorney and later was indicted on 
state charges 
wiley fairchild 72 at the time whose formal education ended 
after the fourth grade but who made a fortune on his ability to 
find oil he complained to nixon that the local prosecutor had his 
son indicted on state charges as a way to blackmail him for the 
legal fees drew owed his attorney 
paul bud holmes a private attorney and nightclub owner 
before he became county prosecutor who admitted he helped have drew 
indicted to help his friend drews attorney collect legal fees 
carroll ingram attorney and second cousin to wiley fairchild 
who helped the elder fairchild with his business dealings and 
arranged a lucrative oil deal between nixon and the oilman 
nixon 56 who was the youngest federal judge in the country 
when he was appointed at age 39 to the bench by president lyndon 
johnson both the defense and prosecution say he was stretched 
financially by the burdens of raising seven children on his judges 
salary 
reid weingarten 36 an attorney with the public integrity 
division of the justice department who had unsuccessfully prosecuted 
judge hastings of florida nixon claims weingarten wanted to get a 
judge 
the house prosecutors say nixon fixed the case against drew 
fairchild because he was grateful for the oil deal he got from wiley 
and wanted more such investments 
nixon says a conversation he had with holmes about the case was 
merely to pass along wiley fairchilds claim that he was being 
blackmailed but that he never discussed the case or said anything 
that influenced its outcome 
holmes backs up the judge on that but gave testimony that casts 
some doubt on whether nixons actions were an effort to ingratiate 
himself with wiley fairchild for more investments 
the articles of impeachment allege 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case 
against drew fairchild with holmes 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do 
officially or unofficially with the fairchild case and never 
influenced anyone in the case 
nixon undermined the integrity of the judiciary and 
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during 
an interview with federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury 
testimony

its cheap its easy to produce and drug 
dealers tout the fact that its made in america 
methamphetamine known in the 1960s as speed and now widely 
called crank is making a resurgence in the united states as an 
inexpensive alternative to cocaine or crack 
users are beginning to smoke it sending an instant jolt to the 
brain but unlike crack crank can give the user a high that lasts 
several hours 
quickly addictive it can also lead its victims to hospital 
emergency rooms their fists clenched raring for a fight even while 
strapped to gurneys for their own protection and that of hospital 
workers 
i think theres sound reason to say this stuff is more 
dangerous than cocaine or crack says james n hall executive 
director of the up front drug information center in miami speed 
killed in the 1960s and it can still kill in the 90s 
the justice department in a report last month said 
methamphetamine has the potential of becoming the crack problem of 
the 1990s 
dr george m shumaik an emergency room physician at the 
university of california at san diego medical center describes 
crank users as crazy and combative 
the complications are the same as we saw with pcp shumaik 
says of crank users who overdose severely theyre so combative 
and so strong that they can throw you across the room 
the national institute on drug abuse says the number of deaths 
involving crank nearly tripled in 2 years from 34 in the second 
half of 1985 to 91 in the first half of 1988 according to reports 
from 26 metropolitan areas 
there has been an explosive growth in the use of 
methamphetamine over six years the justice department says the 
problem has been especially severe in the western united states and 
southern california 
san diego according to the justice department is the 
methamphetamine capital of the united states 
shumaik says many of those who come to his ucsd emergency room 
suffering from crank overdoses just need a place to come down from 
highs that can last up to 24 hours due to repeat doses 
their hearts will be racing their blood pressure will be high 
theyll be paranoid and anxious but theyll survive 
but severe overdoses can result in seizures increased muscle 
tension or hyperthermia 
theyll be so wired up their muscles so tight so intensely 
clenched that the muscle protein breaks down gets into the blood 
stream goes to the kidneys and can create kidney failure shumaik 
says 
they lose their temperature regulation our record is 109 
degrees ive not seen any of those patients survive 
methamphetamine also is associated with a high sense of 
paranoia even greater than cocaine and definitely a greater degree 
of violent behavior hall says theres a psychotic reaction 
people go crazy with this drug 
smoking speed gives the user an initial shortterm jolt like 
crack for 10 minutes or so but it will have a residual longterm 
effect of several hours a stimulant effect he says 
but users wont be impressed by the lingering stimulation 
so they are very likely while still under the effect of the 
stimulant to redose again and again because theyre chasing the 
jolt seeking that exhilaration 
the result can be an overdose 
in the first six months of 1986 846 emergency room patients were 
found to have used methamphetamines according to nida statistics 
from selected hospitals in the final six months of 1988 those same 
hospitals reported 1444 methamphetamine uses 
most of the increase occurred in atlanta dallas los angeles 
phoenix san diego and seattle 
crank users officials say are overwhelmingly white 
lowermiddle income with a high school education or less they range 
in age from 20 to 35 and generally buy the drug from friends who 
also use it 
frank tarallo the chief of the drug enforcement agencys 
dangerous drugs investigations section estimates clandestine 
methamphetamine labs could produce 25 tons of the drug this year 
the number of labs seized rose from about 350 in 1985 to about 600 
thus far in 1989 
the drug is relatively simple and inexpensive to make although 
the highly volatile and toxic chemicals cause health and 
environmental concerns 
we have found people dead in these labs overcome by fumes 
tarallo says these clandestine labs flush these chemicals down 
the toilet down the drains bury it in back yards sometimes 
contaminating groundwater 
chemicals and equipment run about 400 to 500 per pound of 
crank which can be sold wholesale for 8000 to 17000 tarallo 
said 
individual users pay 50 to 125 for a gram which provides 10 to 
15 doses tarallo said a beginning user might take one or two doses 
per day but a heavy user who has built up a tolerance over several 
years might take a full gram in a day he said 
by comparison cocaine prices range from 55 to 125 a gram 
while crack cocaine sells for 20 a rock in washington dc 
according to mario perez of the dea who says smaller doses sell for 
5 to 10 a normal user who needs to stretch limited funds might 
consume four rocks a day while an extremely heavy user could take 
five to six times that amount 
dealers tarallo says tout the fact that crank is made in 
america no south american drug lords no problems getting 
supplies past customs agents the profits stay here 
hall says some of cranks popularity can be traced to the 
attention given to the dangers of other drugs 
we had users in san diego who reported to us that they saw a 
lot on television about the dangers and risks of crack cocaine but 
heard nothing about this drug so they falsely assumed it was 
relatively safe 
users generally begin using the drug by snorting it later taking 
it orally some inject it many now smoke it 
a form of smokeable methamphetamine known as ice has appeared 
in hawaii which has had a minimal encounter with crack and in the 
san francisco area 
its a nightmare here and there is still only a glimmer of 
understanding of its longterm effects us attorney dan bent in 
honolulu said recently 
tarallo said ices crystalline form translates into a stronger 
form of smoke than the powdery domestically produced crank the 
high he says can last four to 10 hours 
but hall said smoking methampethamine in any form will provide 
the same rush 
speed and cocaine have almost seesawed through this century in 
terms of popularity hall says 
methamphetamine and amphetamine replaced the early cocaine 
epidemic in europe and the united states about the time of the 
closing days of world war i when cocaines effects were becoming 
rather widely perceived among the relatively small group using it 
as addictive and a hazardous drug 
amphetamines gained popularity in the early 60s when they were 
made available as pharmaceutical drugs prescribed as appetite 
suppressants hall says their abuse resulted in a speed epidemic in 
the late 1960s and early 70s 
in the early 70s physicians and pharmaceutical companies 
clamped down on the diversion of the licit drugs into the illicit 
market and the speed craze waned but at the same time cocaine 
became more popular

if you decided to tiptoe out for a night on the 
credit card last friday rest assured you missed nothing with two 
new series that bowed then cbs snoops and nbcs baywatch 
snoops stars tim reid of the late and good franks 
place as a professor of criminology in washington dc and 
daphne maxwell reid his wife as his wife a protocol honcho for 
the state department 
baywatch is a southern california surfandsand lifeguard 
tableau with a bronzed cast led by david knight rider 
hasselhoff he wears a lieutenants uniform is divorced and has a 
young son whose custody he shares with the mother 
each show lasts an hour but snoops appears the lesser of two 
bores 
its stars are amateur sleuths much to the dismay of reids 
police lieutenant pal essayed by john karlen their debut concerned 
the solution of a 4yearold unsolved murder case in which a 
stockbroker was the departed 
the impetus for their efforts questions raised in reids class 
by a brilliant cocky student jon matthews who on his own pursues 
the case also present were a convicted swindler a killer 
millionaire and a beautiful exmistress who now owns a spa for women 
doublecrossing and insider trading were part of the hour but 
the high point of the evening came when the exmistress told the 
millionaire im not going to jail for you arthur id sooner 
die 
our snoops couple often engaged in lighthearted banter this 
no doubt is intended to show the series is sort of a contemporary 
thin man expedition a nick and nora go to washington 
the problem as with more than a few shows emitted by hollywood 
these days was the script it was an epic in lackluster and our 
heroes banter was so strained the show seemed in danger of a 
twostar hernia 
its always possible snoops eventually will improve but not 
baywatch it is full of healthy welltoned male and female 
lifeguard bodies surf scenes and thats it 
other than establishing forgettable characters the premiere 
featured what may be tvs first case of a beautiful windsurfer 
killed by hitandrun jetskiers 
when first reported the accident caused hasslehoff to order i 
want an undercover recovery team code three here as soon as 
possible oh good grammar where is thy sting 
in a later unrelated scene with his son he rued that when he 
was married he didnt do more in preparing the lad for life i let 
your mom be the enforcer while i was out teaching you to surf 
hey kid just say no to surf

there seems no relief from awful newshow scripts another 
example is tuesdays living dolls preview on abc this sitcom 
which starts its regular run saturday appears a good excuse to read 
a book for 30 minutes each week 
the show stars a fine actress michael learned as the owner of a 
top new york modeling agency formerly the mom of the waltons 
she now plays the wise patient den mother and agent for four 
teenage girls training to be fashion models the girls also attend 
schools exercise class and fittings 
these wannabe mannequins different in their varied ways share 
learneds surprisingly big townhouse with her son he is supposed to 
be a teenager too but looks twentysomething these beauties 
drive him bats 
that like the shows efforts to give everyone a subplot and 
depth of character doesnt ring quite true but the lame dialogue 
doesnt help either 
and like many tv shows by the tv generation for the tv 
generation this one feels it needs to refer to a wellknown series 
show to establish a frame of reference 
the teen models attend a school thats flexible one of them 
tells a visitor their place of learning she says lets them 
audition and take jobs like that school on fame 
well at leastthe laugh track loves living dolls

andy garcia doesnt like to talk about acting 
there are methods he insists that must be kept from the public 
intricate preparation that if revealed would spoil his characters 
aura of spontaneity 
on screen he is equally mysterious preferring to play cops who 
let a slight turn of the head or an eye that gleams like an 
officers badge take the place of words 
thats one reason why he was drawn to the character of charlie 
vincent the quiet faithful sidekick of michael douglas 
swaggering hardheaded detective in black rain 
if your thought is clear theres nothing else you have to 
do said the cubanborn actor whose big breakthrough came last 
year as kevin costners eagleeyed sideman in the untouchables 
thats the task now how do you go about doing it to convey 
the beautiful thought once you do all the preparation its really 
spontaneous the character behaving once all the 
intellectualization is done you just do it 
the homework tracing the characters history internalizing his 
conflicts are for the actors eyes only what garcia cares about 
is how audiences feel about charlie who helps nick conklin track 
down a japanese hitman in osaka and gets killed in the process 
when people are in times of need certain individuals come into 
your life that act as a foil or help you come out of that garcia 
said i look at charlie as that angel who came down and provided 
that and when his time was done and the door opened he goes 
hes usually pretty upbeat when youre down he keeps your 
spirits up he always seems to be easygoing and yet is usually the 
most spiritual and painful character 
garcia who emigrated to miami beach with his parents when he was 
5 years old liked movies as a child but felt no special desire to 
act until he went to florida international university 
i dont know it was really a virus situation that just invaded 
me and was brewing bigger and bigger he said i was in my share 
of plays as a kid but so was everyone else in the world 
i do think there is a correlation between the spontaniety and 
spirit of athletic competition and the momenttomoment rush of 
acting 
after college he went to los angeles hoping to break into 
movies first came a spot in the tv pilot for hill street blues 
theater work followed with appearances in anastasia the 
cherry orchard dont trust life and other works 
movies began in 1985 with the mean season starring kurt 
russell 
it was tough but very rewarding and afforded me the luxury not 
to have another job garcia said it was a fresh learning 
experience but its still a stage the stage becomes a street and 
the onlookers are your audience you pay dues and you have the 
learning process that no one can take away from you 
garcias penchant for simplicity colors his approach to choosing 
films rather than agonizing over image and storyline he takes a 
look at who else is involved for the untouchables that meant 
sean connery 
when i heard he was in it i said oh great lets go he was 
a hero when he played james bond 
i admired his work ethic his preparation he was ready to go 
if you werent ready hed blow right by you eight in the morning 
ready to go all great actors are like that the people youre with 
are the spark that opens the door to all that work 
black rain offered several temptations douglas director 
ridley scott blade runner alien and producers stanley 
jaffe and sherry lansing the accused fatal attraction 
he credited scott with allowing him to pursue his character to 
the fullest 
ridley said an interesting thing to me for one scene garcia 
recalled he said i think you should go for whatever you want to 
do because you need to get all the way to the end it comes out 
from using all your energy and within that state of exhaustion 
finding that precious moment 
but garcias tribute to the late hal ashby who directed him in 
8 million ways to die is most in line with the actors taste 
what he likes to accomplish on film and cant resist doing in person 
i liked the fact he never said anything he did say everything 
but without imposing anything 
im an observer to the detriment of many people around me 
garcia said the great danger of being in the public eye is losing 
that perspective and becoming the one being watched instead of the 
one watching but you have to cope you have no choice

music fans no longer have to judge a record 
by its cover 
a new company is offering consumers the chance to sample portions 
of albums using their touchtone telephones at 89 cents a minute a 
nimblefingered fan can form musical opinions for less than the cost 
of a single 
with the cost of compact discs and the large market out there 
this gives a listener a chance to hear an album before he buys it 
said mark munson marketing director for music systems inc 
the fort lauderdale fla company has been operating its special 
charge 900 telephone line since the beginning of august about 5000 
people a week are calling to hear a little music munson said 
music line is the little brother of the party lines and rock 
hotlines that have boomed in popularity during the past few years 
with advancing telephone technology 
callers who hook into the system are asked to choose from among 
more than 100 albums in categories such as rock heavy metal rap 
progressive and socalled black music 
once the selection is made a 10 to 15second snippet of each 
song on the album is played callers can move on to another song or 
album with the press of a button the average caller stays on the 
line for about four minutes 
we sampled the 15 seconds that hopefully are the most 
indicative of the song munson said we dont just start at the 
beginning 
albums on the playlist range from such hit artists as fine young 
cannibals the traveling wilburys and madonna to more obscure 
newcomers such as rappers three times dope and independent label 
rockers nirvana 
a group of harvard business school students were the brains 
behind the idea they started a telephone line in the early 1980s 
but it folded due to high costs a 900 telephone line is considered 
easier and cheaper to run 
with radio stations increasingly reluctant to play more than one 
or two songs from an album music line performs an important 
service munson said 
one act thats generated a lot of calls he said is elektra 
records recording artists 10000 maniacs curious fans can easily 
find out through music line that despite the name 10000 maniacs is 
actually a literate folkrock band he said 
elektra is intrigued by the idea that they are on the system 
munson said that kind of a response is good they see it as a 
valuable service 
but the groups manager peter leak said hes not certain he 
likes the idea of someone outside the group boiling down 10000 
maniacs songs into the 15 seconds they consider most important 
hearing 15 seconds of each song on each album isnt hearing the 
whole album said leak whose new york end ltd also manages the 
cowboy junkies another band featured on music line to imagine 
that it does is not being realistic 
its much preferable he said for a fan to slip on a pair of 
headphones in a record store and hear as much of the album as 
possible many record stores used to have listening booths where 
customers could do this 
music line has no formal relationship with record companies but 
marketing departments in several companies are eagerly providing the 
phone service with compact discs and promotional materials munson 
said 
thats obviously in their best interests he said because 
listeners who like the 15second snippets will go out and buy the 
records 
record company reaction has been more cautious 
weve been approached but we have absolutely no idea what the 
potential of this thing is said robert altshuler spokesman for 
cbs records whose records are being used on music line its too 
early this is a brand new thing 
the service helps record companies in the same way radio play 
does said louis dennis national sales director for warner bros 
records whose lps are also being used 
obviously the more exposure we get the better we are dennis 
said whether this is a revolutionary thing i dont know 
but dennis said when he first saw advertisements for music line 
he alerted warner bros legal department munson said thats been 
the initial reaction of several record companies whose persnickety 
attitude toward unauthorized use of their product has been seen in 
the controversy over home taping 
im not saying they dont have the rights to do it leak said 
of the service im sure they do id like to make sure that there 
are some provisions that people get taken care of it seems a little 
unfair that all the money flows into one pocket 
music line pays a small fee to music publishing firms for use of 
the songs munson said the company is relying on a legal opinion 
that says it owes record companies nothing he said 
if any record company feels they dont want the album on the 
system well take it off the system he said of course its 
in their best interests to be on the system its a new thing and 
of course people always have questions about new things 
the company also wants to assuage the fears of parents who worry 
about teenagers rolling up exorbitant phone bills at a parents 
request the company can block calls coming in from a particular 
phone line munson said the company also offers a moneyback 
guarantee to dissatisfied customers although the process would take 
a few months he added 
the phone service which drew more than 12500 calls in its first 
month has an eventual goal of 2500 calls a day munson said

at greenwood elementary school scores of 
pupils can count on a free hot meal every day they also can expect 
regular lectures on the evils of drugs both come courtesy of uncle 
sam 
the federal government writes billions of dollars in checks each 
year to educate tens of millions of children across america as is 
the case with most schools greenwoods share goes for everything 
fom lunches to lessons 
the work of the federal government in terms of how it helps 
urban centers is critical said jack taylor superintendent of 
waukegan community unit school district 60 we just simply 
couldnt handle the youngsters needs without this type of funding 
it makes the schools decidedly better 
at the start of the 1980s nine cents out of every dollar spent 
by the public schools came from washington today it is barely six 
cents 
the federal share slipped even while the department of education 
budget grew from 148 billion in fiscal 1981 to almost 22 billion 
for fiscal 1989 
while the federal share dwindled state and local expenditures 
have spurted and overall education spending has jumped 29 percent 
in real dollars after inflation since 1981 expenditures per 
pupil in the public schools have risen from 2762 in 198081 to an 
estimated 5246 in the current school year 
president bush told lawmakers in helena mont last week the 
plain truth is that our educational system is not making the grade 
spending more money on education than most other countries 
were getting less return on the investment it is time for change 
perhaps radical change 
just what kind of change will be discussed wednesday and thursday 
in talks between bush and the nations governors 
although washington will provide a seemingly substantial 116 
billion for elementary and secondary education in 1989 including 
the agriculture departments free lunch and breakfast plan the 
federal government often is the smallest and most limited 
partner in the school financing formula 
it accounts nationally for about 6 percent of elementary and 
secondary school spending poor areas generally get more because of 
programs designed for the needy 
in illinois for example the state in recent years has provided 
five to six times as many education dollars as the federal 
government 
the ratio is about the same in district 60 which has 11500 
students in 21 schools in this bluecollar lakefront community about 
10 miles from the wisconsin border the enrollment is equally 
divided among blacks whites and hispanics 
in the 198788 school year the district spent an average 4102 
per pupil the national average that year was 3522 
the districts projected budget for 198990 is 403 million 
more than 92 percent will come from local and state sources while 
federal aid will make up only 729 percent about 29 million 
it seems a small contribution but its an essential one 
when youre talking to a district in the red every dollar is 
very valuable said lawrence pekoe associate superintendent for 
administration its not a matter of getting it from the state 
government or the local taxpayer we just dont have the property to 
tax 
but pekoe also noted educators have few options with washington 
dollars because unlike general state funds they are specifically 
targeted two of the largest federal programs are for poor and 
special education students 
this stringsattached approach is good on one hand because it 
earmarks money for special needs pekoe said you put energy 
into that area you might not if you didnt have the money but it 
also prevents a district from using that money in other ways that 
might be of greater need 
in district 60 free and reducedprice breakfasts and lunches 
last year consumed more than a third of the available federal 
dollars 
the two other biggest chunks of aid went to special education and 
chapter i a remedial program for lowincome students that is used 
in waukegan to boost reading skills about 85 percent of the money 
goes for salaries and benefits 
federal funds for district 60 usually channeled through the 
state also pay for vocational education high school rotc staff 
training in math and science follow through an extension of head 
start library equipment aid to hispanic students and a drug and 
alcohol education program coordinated with the county and featuring 
local police lectures 
local school officials rely on these programs 
consider judith lafferty principal at greenwood where more than 
a third of the 328 pupils are from poor families 
initially i was never really enamored with the free lunch 
program or the breakfast program she said it can be an 
administrative headache 
but for some children these are only the two times during the 
day they know they can get something to eat she added you 
cant teach a kid whos not properly nourished you can wish a 
situation away and try to blame it on their parents thats not 
going to change the fact some of these kids are sent to school with 
nothing to eat 
at greenwood 183 children receive free or reducedprice lunches 
at a federal price tag of more than 44000 each school year each 
free lunch costs about 140 pekoe said 
as for the 48 students who benefit from chapter i reading money 
mrs lafferty said it gives them an opportunity for small group 
instruction and for individual attention which some of these kids 
lack at home they dont have someone read to them they havent 
been exposed to books it helps to build these kids confidence in 
some cases ive seen them improve by leaps and bounds 
the projected cost for the 198990 school year about 76700 or 
nearly 1600 a child 
like so many other educators mrs lafferty would appreciate more 
federal aid 
but what they do im glad ive got that she said it does 
make a difference really

as a child ingmar bergmans parents 
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed to amuse himself he 
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and pretended 
he was at the movies 
now 71 the famed director has written a screenplay about his 
father erik bergman an insecure and depressionprone pastor and 
his mother karin a woman of iron selfdiscipline who cringed at 
any show of love 
in good intentions bergman casts back his memory and his 
imagination to the first 10 years of his parents turbulent 
relationship and marriage 
the play is a sixhour chronicle in four acts to be shown as a 
fourpart television series and a twopart movie production begins 
late next year and the scheduled premiere will be on swedish 
television channel one in 1992 
i feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who 
are in my blood my nerves and my genes bergman said 
bergman gave up film direction after his 1982 fanny and 
alexander which won four academy awards since then he has been 
busy producing stage plays at the royal dramatic theater in 
stockholm which once rejected him for a job when he was an aspiring 
21yearold production assistant 
for good intentions bergman vacated the directors chair to 
danish filmmaker bille august whose pelle the conqueror won the 
1989 academy award for best foreign film bergman said that after he 
saw pelle six times the choice of the 40yearold dane was 
obvious 
august called the screenplay one of the best love stories i 
have ever read it is a great drama and an honor to take part in 
delivering 
as evidenced in his confessionlike autobiography the magic 
lantern bergman has been grappling with confusion for many years 
over his feelings for his parents 
they have appeared on screen before in some of the best of 
bergmans 50 films in fanny and alexander a softspoken 
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and 
hatred 
the 1973 film cries and whispers is about three sisters and a 
servant girl bergman has said they represent four aspects of his 
mother whom he was seeking to understand through his characters 
he nurtured the idea for good intentions ever since 
completing fanny and alexander in his memoirs he wrote about 
his parents from his childhood perspective which was often brutal 
and angry 
it left him unsatisfied i started writing about all the dreams 
and memories of my parents finally i had a script he said it 
took him five months last year to write it 
the new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple a 
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an affluent 
home the characters have fictional names which allows bergman to 
play with facts 
the movie covers the time of the couples meeting in 1909 to the 
year of bergmans birth in 1918 
in his memoirs bergman wrote about his failure to reach his 
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display 
of feeling his emotions he said inhabited a closed room and 
were produced on command but never rashly 
he was raised according to the concepts of sin confession 
punishment forgiveness and grace concrete factors in 
relationships between children parents and god 
he described his father a lutheran minister as nervous 
irritable and depressive he was always fretting and given to 
violent outbursts of temper 
his mother was always tense slept badly and used strong 
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety 
like father she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy 
the book barely touches on his parents feelings for each other 
but a stormy picture emerges when it does 
as a child he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and 
scuffle we didnt know that mother had gone through a passionate 
love affair or that father suffered from severe depression mother 
was preparing to break out of her marriage father threatening to 
take his own life 
divorce in those days was almost unthinkable especially for a 
respected pastor and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple 
yet the reconciliation was mostly for show what was outwardly 
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery 
and exhausting conflicts he wrote

syrian shelling is killing fish in the 
mediterranean off this christian enclave near beirut and threatening 
one of lebanons few natural resources a government ecologist says 
it also has cut sharply into the livelihoods of the enclaves 500 
fishermen but some are venturing out after dark to gather the 
thousands of fish that float dead on the surface after each shelling 
our sea is dying ecologist pierre malichev of the health 
ministry said in an interview its become rotten and polluted 
our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next 
year 
he estimated that millions of fish have been killed along with 
billions of their eggs 
malichev said fish that are not killed by the hundreds of 
exploding 130mm howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets are being 
poisoned by tetryl one of the explosive elements in the shells that 
is released into the water 
all that remains for the fishermen are the dead fish 
after a heavy round of shelling the dead fish float like a 
carpet on the surface said sirop ornakian one of about 75 
fisherman who still go out 
we usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet most times 
i collect about 25 kilograms 55 pounds of fish every trip 
the syrians have been pounding the 28mile coastal enclave and 
its waters for six months to keep cargo ships and tankers from 
running a blockade with supplies for the christian forces of gen 
michel aoun in the battle of beirut 
the shelling has killed our season said kivork manoukian a 
fisherman for more than 40 years usually this time of the year is 
the best for us when we make some money but this years been 
catastrophic 
he and other fishermen sat around the shady courtyard of his 
house in jounieh 12 miles north of beirut smoking an arabic water 
pipe 
this is what our life is now he said 
his friend arten khishkhishian said he does not go out any more 
because his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of 
shrapnel littering the shallow waters off jounieh and the ancient 
port of byblos a few miles north 
ive had to repair my net three times and that cost more than 
100000 pounds 200 he said i decided to stop this shrapnel 
fishing until theres lasting peace 
but the others risk their lives and their boats 15foot craft 
powered by outboard motors to haul in the dead fish sometimes a 
syrian barrage will come unexpectedly police said several fishermen 
have been wounded 
kevork manoukian said that on one recent night it looked quiet 
so i dropped my net 
then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my 
boat he said i ditched my net and made it for the shore in 
panic as more shells exploded around me 
ornakian and other fishermen regularly go out for catches not 
much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting 
with fish in short supply in the enclave the price has doubled 
to the equivalent of about 450 a pound 
ornakian and the others reckon that the money they make from each 
trip the equivalent in lebanese pounds of about 250 is worth 
the chance 
moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off beirut where the 
syrians have deployed batteries of longrange artillery along the 
waterfront to shell the christian coastline 
but the moslems are able to fish south of beirut for 50 miles 
down the coast to the ancient port of tyre where the biggest danger 
they face is an occasional israeli gunboat

in any conversation about the stock market these 
days the word correction is almost sure to come up 
stock prices somebody will declare are undergoing have 
undergone or are about to undergo a correction after reaching 
record highs just before labor day 
after all the market has come a long way in recent months and 
presumably must pause at some point if only to allow investors time 
to get used to the idea of buying at such lofty levels 
the term correction is much beloved among stockbrokers 
useful as it is in soothing the complaints and misgivings of their 
customers when stock prices are going in the wrong direction 
it may be a euphemism akin to correctional institution for 
prison but its an ingeniously designed euphemism that often 
achieves its desired effect 
for one thing it implies that a decline in stock prices is a 
good and constructive thing just a temporary pullback that purges 
the market of overenthusiasm and other excesses and prepares it for 
the next sweeping move ahead to new highs 
for another it allows for great flexibility in the tricky art of 
financial forecasting the optimist has only to proclaim that prices 
are headed higher with of course inevitable corrections along 
the way 
as stock prices were beginning to cave in during the weeks 
leading up to the crash of 1987 many a respected prognosticator 
offered the reassurance that the market was merely going through a 
longoverdue correction 
they may have looked foolish for a while but with the passage of 
time such people can claim they were right after all 
sure it was a correction of monster proportions but it achieved 
what a textbook correction is supposed to do 
it scared complacent money out of the market creating the 
reserve of buying power that could subsequently carry prices onward 
to new highs 
if that was a big correction there have been some much smaller 
ones since over the span of a few days in june for instance the 
dow jones industrial average fell 9181 points or 363 percent 
the earlyseptember decline of 8720 points or 317 percent 
appeared similar to william lefevre an analyst at advest inc in 
new york 
it looks like the latest pause minicorrection or whatever 
has ended lefevre said if the postcrash experience holds and 
we see no reason why it shouldnt then the dow will now work its 
way back up to its old high 2752 and then go on to a higher 
high 
for his part joseph barthel an analyst at wheat first butcher amp 
singer foresees further market weakness over the next few weeks 
but by mid to lateoctober the correction should have run its 
course and the stock market can again reassert itself on the 
upside barthel maintains 
analysts at the merrill lynch market letter talk of a pullback 
still to come 
we are not too happy to be in the crowd expecting a nearterm 
correction they say there is a possibility that the correction 
will take longer to develop than most people expect 
the longer the correction takes to occur the deeper it is 
likely to be in our view that could mean a setback closer to 10 
percent from whatever highs are reached rather than the 5 percent 
retreat that appears to be the general expectation

albert campion acts like a superficial 
flippant twit but what can you expect from a detective who says he 
specializes in fairy tales 
hes fairly hard to fathom said peter davison the english 
actor who plays the 1930s sleuth in campion an eightpart 
series that kicks off the fall season for pbs mystery next 
thursday 
davison was one of several actors who portrayed doctor who in 
a british series that has attained cult status and he appeared in 
all creatures great and small 
his view of the detective he now plays 
people think he doesnt take things seriously or doesnt 
understand whats going on its really a device to keep suspects 
off guard he wears little round hornrimmed glasses weve decided 
those probably arent real and are just part of the image too 
campion is adapted from the books by british crime writer 
margery allingham a peer of agatha christie and dorothy l sayers 
when the new series arrives on pbs so will diana rigg now more 
than 21 years removed from her crimefighting days on the 
avengers she is succeeding vincent price as host of mystery 
davison finds campion himself a bit of a mystery 
hes a slightly enigmatic figure and its not made clear in the 
books what hes really about the actor said hes the youngest 
son of a duke whos gone off to seek adventure in the 1930s it was 
the practice to send the youngest son off to the colonies but he 
didnt want to do that and set himself up as a private detective 
campions manservant davison said is a big bald exconvict 
with a fairly memorable name magersfontein lugg hes given up 
his criminal activities davision explained but hes a source 
of priceless information for campion 
incidentally the actor added campion is not the detectives 
real name someone calls him christopher twelvetrees and someone 
else calls him orlando he said but by any name hes obviously 
a gentleman and wellmannered and is equally at home with the 
aristocracy or criminals and gypsies 
brian glover plays lugg and andrew burt is inspector stanislaus 
oates of scotland yard 
british critics have said the major strength of the campion 
books were the outrageous plots and their many twists the opening 
story look to the lady features witches gypsies and 
criminals plus a priceless chalice and a secret room in a mansion 
tower containing a nameless horror 
davison said allingham wrote some of the books as cerebral 
exercises and some as ripping yarns she also peopled her books with 
a lot of americans but some have been taken out a main character 
in the first show was changed from an american to a scot 
most of the stories take place in england although one is set on 
a cruise ship one shows opening scene set on the french riviera 
in the book was changed to avoid a costly trip to film just one 
scene 
davison grew up in south london and began acting in an 
afterschool drama club i never did well academically he said 
it was always a lastminute scramble to put things together so i 
went to drama school instead of university i worked in a dry 
cleaners and a factory and was a hospital orderly before starting 
school 
davison married about 10 years to american actress sandra 
dickinson has an apartment in los angeles they met at the central 
school of speech and drama 
i dont think we ever said a word to each other in school he 
said i was aware of her but we were in different years then we 
did a rock musical version of a midsummer nights dream at the 
edinburgh festival sandra has become quite wellknown in england 
davison said he never trained for a second career in case acting 
didnt work out 
a lot of actors are trained in something else he said the 
temptation is to take another job when things turn bad when i had a 
bad period i had nothing else to turn to i spent three years in 
repertory theater then i decided i should go into television i 
didnt work for a year 
his first major role was in love for lydia which played on 
public tvs masterpiece theatre he was tristram one of two 
brothers in the series all creatures great and small which was 
based on james herriots stories about his life as a yorkshire 
veterinarian 
he followed tom baker as doctor who a science fiction 
fantasy that has a large cult following worldwide he was the fifth 
actor in the role playing it from 1981 to 1984

despite impressive evidence lately of continued 
economic growth some wall streeters are not yet convinced that the 
threat of a recession has been completely neutralized 
if a business slump should set in they contend the stock market 
is in danger of being caught off guard 
after all they say the stock market is just three weeks and a 
few percentage points away from the record highs set just before 
labor day weekend 
wall streeters seem to be thoroughly sold on the soft landing 
theory that the federal reserve could slow the economy enough to 
restrain inflation without inflicting much economic pain 
should things not work out that way the reasoning goes traders 
could well be in for a rapid reappraisal of the prices stocks ought 
to command 
in theory at least stocks shouldnt be vulnerable to many 
surprises of that kind the collective vision of investors is 
supposed to be so sharp that it can detect future fluctuations in 
the economy earlier than almost any other forecasting system 
but that isnt always the case contends ac moore research 
director at argus research corp in new york 
stock prices many times have gone right up into the teeth of 
recessions he says 
argus this past week advised investors to reduce their exposure 
to stocks in large measure because of a high prospect of a 
recession coming up in moores words 
others who agree with him cite the very sluggish growth of the 
nations money supply over the past couple of years as a forewarning 
of trouble 
federal reserve actions have resulted in a major slowdown in 
economic growth since early 1987 said erich heinemann economist 
at ladenburg thalmann amp co 
prelude to recession employment has slowed consumers are dead 
in the water profits are down 
of course to stay with such a negative view on wall street right 
now you need to be willing to travel without much company 
the resounding consensus in the financial world is that recent 
healthy signs from most sectors of the economy have pretty much 
dispelled the recession fears of a few months ago 
as paul boltz financial economist at t rowe price associates in 
baltimore put it recent economic statistics are pointing to a 
continuation of moderate growth not a recession 
besides the bulls argue the data on inflation have been so good 
in the last couple of months that the fed can feel ready to 
stimulate the economy quickly at the first sign of possible trouble 
for the moment at least stock traders seem unwilling to take 
sides in this debate as a result stock prices spent the past week 
going just about nowhere 
at the close on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
stood at 268161 up 133 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 114 to 19273 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
050 to 46807 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 174 at 38138 
volume on the big board averaged 13909 million shares a day 
against 16552 million the week before 
the main gripe on the street of late hasnt been the state of the 
economy but rather the lack of activity in stocks 
that could change soon contends joseph feshbach technical 
analyst at prudentialbache securities 
i expect the market to be very volatile over the next couple of 
months with a series of rallies and corrections followed by more 
prolonged weakness either late this year or early in 1990 he said 
in his latest commentary 
i therefore continue to believe prudence dictates a defensive 
posture near term

at first glance they appear vastly different a 
singer and television star turned successful businessman and a high 
school dropout who built his way up to become a millionaire 
developer 
but merv griffin and robert campeau to their chagrin have much 
in common both men find their companies struggling because they 
cant handle debts run up in notorious takeover battles 
griffins resorts international inc is trying to restructure a 
900 million debt after failing to meet interest payments to 
bondholders resorts which operates hotels and casinos is not 
generating enough cash to pay bills 
campeau meanwhile was forced to cede control of his retailing 
empire to olympia amp york developments ltd in exchange for a 250 
million loan 
his company campeau corp also could not meet interest payments 
on some of its 115 billion debt and the developer has had to put 
his prize bloomingdales department store chain up for sale 
resorts has attributed some of its problems to competition from 
newer casinos in atlantic city poor management and deteriorating 
physical facilities 
campeaus federated department stores inc and allied stores 
corp have suffered from the same lackluster sales that have 
afflicted other retailers 
but the real problem is that merv griffin and robert campeau paid 
too much for their companies went too deeply into debt and did not 
anticipate that their cash flow would be inadequate to handle their 
interest payments 
griffin battled with developer donald trump over resorts for 
months last year with onagain offagain agreements before finally 
buying the company for 364 million and the assumption of 600 
million in debt griffin issued 325 million in notes to help 
finance the deal 
campeau waged a bidding war with rh macy amp co inc early in 
1988 before winning federated for a total price tag of 88 billion 
he went deeply into debt increasing the liabilities he incurred 
over a year earlier when he triumped in a 34 billion battle for 
allied 
griffin and campeau were all smiles on winning these fights both 
were on top of the world each believing he had cut a great deal and 
achieved glory after years of hard work 
they came by their money in very different ways 
griffin is one of the bestknown entertainers in the united 
states he began his career as a singer and film actor and then 
moved to television where he hosted game shows including play 
your hunch and for 23 years had his own talk show 
but behind the affable exterior griffin presented to television 
audiences was a shrewd businessman he founded his own production 
company merv griffin enterprises which turned out programs 
including the merv griffin show wheel of fortune and 
jeopardy 
he also bought radio stations and assembled an extensive real 
estate portfolio with holdings in beverly hills and northern 
california 
in 1986 griffin sold his production company in 1986 to cocacola 
co for a reported 250 million but kept his role as chairman 
campeaus background is less spectacular 
he was born into a poor ontario family and left school at 14 to 
help support his brothers and sisters campeau was a factory foreman 
in ottawa in 1949 building a home for his family in his spare time 
when he got the idea to sell the house instead and make a profit 
campeau continued building houses and was on his way to becoming 
a prominent builder over the years he developed part of the 
lakefront area of toronto now a fashionable area put up office and 
government buildings and became increasingly wealthy in the process 
he tried his hand at takeovers in canada and failing there 
turned his sights toward the united states and allied 
neither campeau nor griffin is exactly going about with hat in 
hand now but they are taking some lumps to try to keep their 
companies going 
in exchange for the loan from olympia amp york campeau gave up 
control of his company and bloomingdales may not be the only 
assets he will be forced to sell 
this is not the first time campeau has surrendered control of his 
company in 1969 he sold a majority share in return for cash for 
expansion a move he regretted but later bought back the stake at a 
premium 
griffin has had to ask his companys bondholders to back a debt 
restructuring he could have a hard time getting their approval 
ninety percent of each class of bonds must approve the restructuring 
for it to take effect

more than a dozen government lawsuits alleging 
age discrimination by employers may have to be dismissed unless 
congress restores protections overturned by the supreme court a 
government lawyer testified 
charles a shanor general counsel of the equal employment 
opportunity commission spoke at a house hearing thursday in support 
of legislation to reverse a june ruling that bias in fringe benefits 
is not automatically banned under the age discrimination in 
employment act 
the high court ruled 72 that federal law bans biased benefit 
plans only where the disparities are part of an attempt to 
discriminate in some nonfringebenefit aspect of employment 
such as hiring or firing 
shanor said the eeoc has more than 30 cases pending in courts 
around the country in which it alleges that employers discriminated 
against older workers by limiting their fringe benefits 
we estimate that over half of these cases would require 
dismissal absent remedial legislation shanor told a joint 
hearing of the house select committee on aging and two education and 
labor subcommittees 
eeoc vice chairman r gaull silberman told the hearing there is 
no good policy reason for allowing arbitrary unjustifiable 
discrimination against older workers in this one area when all other 
aspects of their employment are protected she said more than 400 
cases pending before the eeoc at the administrative level could be 
affected by the supreme court ruling 
the court ruled in a lawsuit filed by june betts a county speech 
pathologist in ohio who at age 61 was denied disability benefits 
when alzheimers disease left her unable to work the benefits were 
available only to those age 60 or under 
betts daughter carolyn testified that her mother now in a 
nursing home at age 65 is being denied a benefit that a 
25yearold employee would have been entitled to under the same 
circumstances 
my mother and people like her earned these benefits as surely 
as younger employees ms betts said is it right that they 
should be taken away from her because of her age 
scott j macey vice president of the erisa industry committee 
which represents more than 125 of the nations largest employers 
said the group opposes discrimination against older workers but is 
against the proposed legislation 
the bill would impose unnecessary and harmful restrictions on 
employers effectively preventing employers from targeting benefits 
to the employees who need them most macey said

union carbide corp says it has developed a 
process for making foam seat and furniture cushions that eliminates 
the use of environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons 
an international treaty has called for phasing out 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs because the gasses damage the 
atmospheric ozone that ozone layer provides protection against the 
suns ultraviolet rays 
the united states has set a goal of eliminating cfcs by the year 
2000 if substitutes are found 
the technology developed by union carbide chemicals and plastics 
co of danbury conn will begin to be made available to 
foamcushion manufacturers before the end of the year with 
widespread use expected within two years company spokesman steven 
gabelman said thursday 
about 10 percent of all cfcs released into the air worldwide come 
from the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam cushions found in 
bedding seats furniture and various padding according to industry 
figures 
the chemical industry has been scrambling in recent years to 
develop substitutes for cfcs which are used as a blowing agent in 
manufacturing the foam among other uses 
union carbide announced a year ago that it had developed a 
product called ultracel foam which eliminates the need of a blowing 
agent such as cfcs in the manufacture of highgrade flexible foam 
about 20 percent of the market other companies quickly developed a 
similar product 
thursdays annoucement involves a similar process geolite foam 
technology that would be used in manufacturing lowergrade foams 
widely used for quilting fabrics pillows chair cushions 
insulation and packaging that covers the remaining 80 percent of 
the flexible foam industry according to union carbide 
the process as well as use of a special polymer eliminates the 
need to rely on a blowing agent to expand the flexible foam said 
john televantos director of research and development for union 
carbides speciality chemical division 
the environmental protection agency estimates that about 35 
percent of cfcs are used in refrigeration and air conditioning 
areas where industry also has moved toward their gradual 
elimination another 34 percent are used in various plastic foams 
from fast food packaging to cushions 
the new process involves only foams used as flexible cushions 
televantos said the geolite process is expected to be widely 
accepted as a substitute for cfcs because it results in no reduction 
in the quality and firmness needed for seat and furniture cushions 
and costs about the same or less than the process that uses cfcs

energy analysts say amerada hess corp should not 
have problems meeting its commitments to us customers despite 
severe damage from hurricane hugo to a major refinery at st croix 
virgin islands which sent gasoline futures prices surging 
the 545000barreladay facility which was wrecked when the 
storm smashed into the virgin islands earlier this week supplies 
markets in the eastern united states 
by drawing on inventories or buying on the cash market hess 
should be able to supply its customers analysts said the company 
has refused to comment on how it will meet its obligations but a 
company spokesman stressed there would be no disruption in supplies 
news that hurricane damage would shut down the huge refinery for 
about 60 days sent gasoline futures prices soaring for the second 
day thursday 
the october contract for unleaded gasoline closed 212 cents 
higher at 6186 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange 
for a twoday increase of 419 cents heating oil for october 
delivery rose 103 cents to 5758 cents a gallon after rising 160 
cents in the previous session 
contracts for delivery later in the year posted much smaller 
gains 
analysts said gasoline prices on the futures market could go even 
higher in the shortterm hess has said the refinery would resume 
partial operations in about 30 days 
weve gotten to the point where refined product markets are in 
such basis equilibrium that when they lose any production it does 
cause tightness said peter beutel assistant director of the 
energy group at elders futures inc so probably we will see prices 
move up 
sustained higher prices could be passed on to retail customers in 
another 30 days or so analysts said but if they erode fairly 
quickly as some anticipate there could be little effect at the 
gasoline pump 
we believe the excess capacity will be made up by refineries 
abroad said james steel energy analyst at refco inc it also 
will probably push us refineries back above the 90 percent level 
us refiners recently slowed to about 898 percent capacity 
after pumping at a strong 92 percent during the peak summer months 
steel said 
hess also announced thursday that it would not be able to provide 
petroleum products for ships loading at its refinery in st croix 
were talking about other ships not ours that buy an 
occasional load from us said a hess spokesman who did not want to 
be identified we stand by our original statement that we will 
meet all our commitments to us customers 
crude oil futures traded on the new york exchange were mixed 
with the contract for november delivery falling 6 cents to 1962 a 
barrel contracts for later delivery rose slightly 
ameradas refinery was shut down saturday in preparation for 
hugo the refinery had been producing about 400000 barrels a day of 
gasoline distillates and other products most of which are used in 
the united states

jp morgan amp co incs painful decision to add 
2 billion to its reserve cushion against loan losses is bad news 
for third world nations in debt analysts say 
morgan the nations thirdlargest banking company cited 
intensifying political and economic problems in debtor nations

drastic it boosted its reserves to 100 percent of its medium and

morgan and other big banks that have begun facing up to the 
likelihood of huge losses on loans to developing countries are 
unlikely to resume largescale lending to those nations for many 
years analysts said 
bankers do have short memories but once a bank loses a billion 
dollars on any sort of a loan they dont come back very quickly 
maybe 20 years from now said stephen berman an analyst at county 
securities usa in new york 
morgan the parent of morgan guaranty trust co said it would 
continue doing business in developing countries but would focus on 
merchant banking rather than general lending merchant banking 
involves providing advice trading and investing and finance 
we will continue to consider lending in appropriate specific 
transactions we intend to continue to play a constructive role in 
developing countries morgan spokeswoman kathleen baum said 
the talks in washington will concern treasury secretary nicholas 
bradys plan to relieve the 13 trillion third world debt through 
debt forgiveness rather than new lending 
some banks are concerned that the brady plan may have caused 
debtor nations to lose their sense of urgency about keeping up on 
their loan payments morgan said debtor nations seem to have 
overestimated how much help is forthcoming from the industrial 
nations 
we are very concerned about debtor countries rising 
expectations of the magnitude of debt reduction possible under the 
brady initiative lewis t preston morgans chairman said in a 
statement 
the treasury department said morgans increase in reserves was 
not a direct result of the brady plan it said banks would actually 
need lower reserves under the plan since they would be scratching 
some shaky loans off their books 
but analysts said the brady plan is forcing bankers to 
acknowledge the depth of their troubles in developing countries 
they are responding by doing everything possible to extricate 
themselves 
morgans financial strength allowed it to cleanse its books more 
completely than chase or manufacturers hanover it means the company 
will not suffer any further losses even if developing countries 
dont pay another cent on their medium and longterm loans 
some banks just want out berman said early on in this 
process everybody sort of pulled together followed the lead of 
citibank everybody is sort of cutting and running now and pursuing 
their own interest 
morgan now has a total of 3 billion in loanloss reserves with 
28 billion of that unofficially allocated to loans to developing 
countries that 28 billion is equal to 70 percent of morgans 
total loans to developing countries and 100 percent of the 
mediumand longterm loans to those nations in an indication of 
morgans strong finances moodys investors service inc and 
standards and poors corp on thursday both confirmed their 
investmentgrade ratings on morgan senior debt 
the last big round of additions to loanloss reserves came in 
late 1987 and many banking companies have not taken any action 
since then 
for example chemical banking corps loanloss reserves equal 
just 28 percent of its medium and longterm loans to developing 
countries 
at chase and manufacturers hanover the corresponding reserves 
are 46 percent and 36 percent respectively 
before the formal sessions of the imf and world bank in 
washington finance officials of the worlds seven richest countries 
were scheduled to hold talks all day saturday to review global 
economic issues

a prized part of texas air corp its 
computerized reservation system is now on a list of possible items 
for sale by the nations biggest airline company because of a cash 
crunch 
sources said thursday that texas air is discussing the sale of a 
stake in its reservation system to a general motors corp unit 
electronic data systems corp partly to ease the pressure caused by 
the strike and bankruptcy proceeding at texas airs eastern airlines 
texas air spokesman art kent in houston and roger still a 
spokesman for electronic data systems in dallas both declined to 
comment on the matter thursday but sources close to the situation 
said the airline company was looking for a partner for the 
reservation subsidiary called system one 
the wall street journal reported in its thursday editions that 
talks between texas air and electronic data systems were advanced 
and that barring a snag an agreement could be reached soon 
the journal indicated the companies were discussing the sale of 
system one in its entirety but sources told the associated press it 
would likely be a partial sale 
analysts estimate the value of system one the nations 
thirdlargest airline reservation system at 300 million to 400 
million 
the participation of gm in system one would mark the first 
nonairline owner of a computer reservation system which might be 
more acceptable to government regulators who have expressed worries 
about consolidation in the field 
in addition to the work it performs for gm eds is involved in 
health insurance government and financial institution data 
processing and is looking for sources of revenue that will make it 
less dependent on its parent 
selling system one would be a radical move for texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo who has underlined the importance of computer 
reservation systems to airlines competitiveness those systems have 
been undergoing rapid changes and consolidations recently 
earlier this week delta air lines disclosed it was discussing 
merging its reservation system with pars an operation jointly owned 
by trans world airlines inc and northwest airlines and american 
airlines sabre reservation system has been seeking a partner after 
the justice department quashed its plans to link up with deltas 
system 
system one was transferred from eastern to texas air in april 
1987 for about 100 million a member of the air line pilots 
association one of the three unions on strike against miamibased 
eastern since march 4 has a lawsuit pending in new york state 
supreme court challenging the transfer and claiming that texas air 
paid too little for system one 
courtappointed bankruptcy examiner david i shapiro is studying 
the transfer as part of his investigation of transactions between 
texas air eastern and sister carrier continental airlines shapiro 
was out of the country thursday and unavailable for comment 
the reservation system is the heart of any airline said hank 
weber an alpa spokesman in miami its an indication that he 
lorenzo really is in need of money quickly 
talk about the reservation system comes at a time when texas air 
is taking a number of steps to shore up the foundations of its 
airline empire late last month lorenzo announced that he was 
considering selling all or part of houstonbased continental 
last week a federal bankruptcy judge approved a plan in which 
texas air would help with a payment of 983 million eastern owes to 
employee pension plans texas air is lending eastern 45 million 
toward the payment eastern is paying 27 million with the proceeds 
of asset sales and the rest has been deferred until july 
texas air has given no indication of what it might do with the 
proceeds from any sale 
the airline is just looking at their options said raymond 
neidl an analyst for investment firm dillon read amp co inc the 
sale of part of system one certainly would give them money to 
expand and enhance the system 
louis marckesano an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia said texas air appears to be trying to raise cash 
it sounds like a continuation of this business with continental 
he said 
in the mayjuly quarter texas air posted a 1093 million net 
loss as losses at eastern far outweighed a modest profit at 
continental the company lost 2559 million in the same quarter 
last year

american airlines historically a leader in 
lowering the cost of air travel also has shown its enormous 
influence in raising prices too 
several of americans principal competitors have matched its 
initiative that will increase some discount fares by more than 15 
percent and double cancellation penalties 
delta air lines continental airlines and pan am corp said 
thursday they were following americans move the increases 
proposed by american earlier this week will take effect sept 29 
united airlines and northwest airlines were still studying the 
matter and hadnt decided yet spokesmen for those carriers said 
american based in dallas is one of the largest us carriers 
and helped pioneer fare discounts in the deregulated airline 
industry in the past it has often been the first to announce 
innovative discounts that competitors were forced to match 
under the fare increases the popular maxsaver cutrate fare 
often used by vacationers which must be purchased 14 days in 
advance will be increased by 10 to 20 round trip a maxsaver 
ticket on american between dallas and los angeles for example 
would jump from 338 to 358 round trip the maxsaver tickets 
would remain nonrefundable 
in addition fares will be raised on sevenday advance tickets by 
30 to 60 round trip the same dallaslos angeles round trip ticket 
bought seven days in advance would go from 378 to 438 the penalty 
for changing or canceling a reservation would double to 50 percent 
of the ticket price 
atlantabased delta said a sharp rise in fuel prices along with 
a large number of discount tickets sold recently prompted the 
airline to match the increases 
delta has held the line on discountfare increases for over a 
year while we have seen record numbers of passengers utilizing the 
most deeply discounted seats whit hawkins deltas senior vice 
president of marketing said in a statement 
at the same time deltas costs have been rising most recently 
impacted by a 665 centspergallon increase in the cost of fuel 
the increases follow a recent rise in a type of discount fare 
popular with business travelers reflecting an effort by airlines to 
partly recoup revenue lost from bargains offered this summer to fall 
vacationers 
american said it proposed the fare hikes in an effort to improve 
its passenger yields 
an airlines yield reflects the average revenue from passengers 
for each mile flown and is a critical barometer of financial 
strength 
many airline industry analysts expect little improvement in 
yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990 
in midaugust the airlines announced steep fare cuts for the 
fall season extending summer travel bargains they slashed 
roundtrip fares by as much as 160 to lure passengers in the 
historically weak autumn season most fares to europe were reduced 
by 100 into next spring 
last week in an effort to recover some of the losses the 
airlines boosted supercoach oneway fares favored by business 
fliers because they have more lenient advancepurchase requirements 
than cheaper discount fares and dont require a saturdaynight stay 
those fares were raised by around 20 for a oneway ticket

the reichmann family emerging from intensive 
maneuverings with a bigger piece of campeau corps retail and real 
estate empire may not seek the spotlight but doesnt shun deals 
that make public attention hard to avoid 
there are more scholars than business tycoons among my 
forebearers all we children inherited was character determination 
and will power and perhaps a little brains paul reichmann 
who generally serves as the family spokesman said in a rare 
interview with the local report on business magazine 
paul albert and ralph reichmann were born in austria after their 
parents moved there in 1928 there were further moves to france 
spain and morocco before the family arrived in canada in 1956 
their privately held olympia amp york company now ranks as the 
worlds largest developer of office space with interests in about 
30 cities in canada the united states and britain among them are 
such huge projects as the world financial center in new york and 
canary wharf in london 
all of this a fortune estimated at 6 billion came from a 
company that was tiny at the start of the 1960s 
the move into real estate came when the family decided to build 
its own warehouse for its montreal tile business olympia floor and 
wall tile in the late 1950s within a few years the reichmanns were 
building office towers helped in part by a move to the booming 
toronto market of the 1960s 
olympia amp york was incorporated in 1969 the familys move into 
the international top leagues usually is traced to the decision to 
buy eight office buildings in manhattan in 1977 when that market was 
at a low point 
recently an attempt was made to buy the sears tower in chicago 
their takeovers of newsprint producer abitibiprice in 1981 and 
gulf canada resources in 1985 placed them in visible spheres outside 
of real estate 
a struggle to take over the canadian liquor company hiram walker 
made it clear that even the savvy seemingly charmed reichmanns 
could run into difficulties that attempt ended with a swap of their 
49 percent interest in the liquor company for 10 percent of the 
large british conglomerate alliedlyons plc 
the reichmanns are devout orthodox jews who live relatively 
modestly in the affluent toronto suburb of north york the three 
brothers have 14 children 
albert 60 is the president paul 58 the senior executive vice 
president and secretary and ralph 55 the executive vice president 
and treasurer of olympia amp york developments ltd 
paul reichmann told report on business in december that the 
family business is not particularly interested in just growing 
bigger 
what drives us is usually the challenge to be creative to do 
something interesting no successful businessman really has money in 
mind after a certain point he said when we do something we 
want to do it right its not monument building its more than 
that 
they gained 25 percent of torontobased campeau corp after 
providing financing that helped in its the takeover of federated 
department stores inc in february 1988 that stake expanded this 
week to an estimated 35 percent with the recent round of campeau 
difficulties 
their movements are rarely heralded in advance and even senior 
olympia amp york executives have been known to complain that they 
dont know what project would attract the brothers attention next 
although certainly not publicity seekers the family usually 
paul does emerge to talk to reporters at times when their interests 
favor public attention their reputation for shunning the limelight 
increased after they filed an 86 million 102 million canadian 
libel suit in january 1988 against toronto life magazine for an 
article called the mysterious reichmanns the untold story 
the family then sued the toronto sun and the globe and mail 
newspapers for their reports on the story and the suit 
paul reichmann told report on business which is a part of the 
globe and mail that the decision to sue was the most agonizing one 
he ever made because the familys privacy would be jeopardized even 
more 
he said the suit was filed to set the record straight about his 
parents activities in north africa during world war ii and not to 
discourage publicity about the family 
because of our position in world jewry and in canadian business 
we had no choice he said we will spare no cost time or effort 
until every part of this story is proved false in a court of law

four utilities seeking to control public 
service co of new hampshire begin their battles today before the 
bankruptcy judge who will decide the fate of the states largest 
electricity producer 
among the bidders is public service itself forced into us 
bankruptcy court 20 months ago under the financial stress of its 
lead share in the 62 billion seabrook nuclear plant 
the other contenders are united illuminating of new haven conn 
with a plan calling for merger with public service northeast 
utilities of berlin conn that states largest electric utility 
and new england electric system of westborough mass 
judge james yacos will hold hearings on the proposals through 
midnovember when stockholders and creditors will vote if they 
pick one yacos likely will abide by their choice if they choose 
two he could pick one or find another solution 
public service believes it is the frontrunner because its plan 
has the creditors and stockholders approval 
the other plans do not the other utilities would have to reach 
such agreement and get approval from the securities and exchange and 
federal energy regulatory commissions public service needs only 
state regulator approval 
but new england electrics plan has the primary endorsement of 
gov judd gregg because it had the lowest rate projections the 
state however has no vote in bankruptcy court although yacos 
could consider the states wishes 
public service has noted that its rate plan falls under the 
guidelines endorsed by gregg when the northeast plan was introduced 
in july 
public service valued its plan at 22 billion regardless of 
whether seabrook operates the plant has been completed for three 
years but lacks an operating license 
public service northeast and united illuminating all called for 
seven annual rate increases of 55 percent if seabrook operates 
public service and northeast also tacked on 11 percent a year for 
five of those years if the plant is canceled and another 24 
percent by the end of the period if lowerprice contracts cant be 
renegotiated with small power producers 
this week united illuminating said it was willing to cut the 55 
percent annual rate increases to five years with the total rate 
increase at 31 percent instead of the 45 percent in the initial plan 
the nees plan called for increases of 48 percent during the 
seven years a 39 percent overall increase 
united illuminating also valued its plan at 22 billion and 
northeast valued its at 19 billion regardless of seabrook new 
england electric was 19 billion if it does not operate 20 
billion if it does 
public service with almost 400000 customers filed for 
bankruptcy under the burden of its largest 36 percent share of 
seabrook 
united illuminatings 175 percent is the secondlargest share of 
seabrook nees and northeast own smaller shares

the dream of weightwatching ice cream 
lovers may be coming true a fat and cholesterolfree ice cream 
that contains nearly onethird less calories 
kraft general foods will introduce its new product sealtest 
free nonfat ice cream into new england markets during the first 
week of october 
kraft a division of of philip morris cos inc says the desert 
has the appearance and taste of ice cream rich in butterfat 
in the new product the butterfat is replaced with cellulose gel 
a naturally occuring fiber found in fruit and vegetables 
while the company is calling its new product ice cream it may be 
in for a regulatory battle since the food and drug administration 
requires at least 10 percent butterfat for the product to be called 
ice cream 
a spokesman for the fda in washington emil corwin said he was 
unaware of krafts plan for the product 
but if it is a matter of giving wrong information on the label 
it certainly would be an fda concern he said

the meat industry is investigating several new 
screening techniques that could reduce the incidence of carpal 
tunnel syndrome among meatpackers who suffer the painful wrist 
injury at an unusually high rate 
the techniques involve machines that measure the sensitivity of 
fingers to vibration or to a lowlevel electrical current said dan 
macleod whose minneapolis consulting firm ergotech inc is 
researching the devices with funding from the meat industry 
macleod said the machines promise earlier detection of the first 
symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome a degenerative nerve and muscle 
disorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible and is often 
attributed to the sort of forceful repetitive motions demanded of 
meatpackers 
in the early stages of carpal tunnel syndrome one of the signs 
is that you lose your sense of feeling in your fingertips macleod 
said thursday in a telephone interview 
these things are good for overview screening of people who 
should be referred for diagnosis he said 
engineers can also use the devices to determine whether 
experimental changes in working positions or equipment design 
actually protect workers from injury macleod said 
it gives us a technology that we can use to see if were doing 
any good he said 
meat industry leaders say they are testing the machines as part 
of an effort to reduce repetitivemotion injuries which occur at a 
higher rate in their business than in any other 
the american meat institute an industry trade group is also 
working with labor and the occupational safety and health 
administration to develop guidelines for making meatpacking plants 
safer said manly molpus the groups president 
let me assure you that osha is not the meat industrys enemy 
workplace accidents injuries and illnesses are our enemies 
molpus said in remarks prepared for a news conference on thursday 
the first day of the trade groups fourday meeting in chicago 
bob moore an economist at the bureau of labor statistics said 
cumulative trauma disorders of which repetitivemotion injuries are 
a majority in the meat industry occured at a rate of 3923 per 
10000 workers in 1987 more than 10 times the rate for general 
manufacturing and nearly 40 times the rate for all privatesector 
businesses 
many meatpackers have jobs requiring rapid repetition of cutting 
chopping pulling or lifting motions 
osha has levied heavy fines against several meatpackers in recent 
years for violating laws designed to protect workers from 
repetitivemotion injuries and other cumulative trauma disorders 
two of those cases involving ibp inc of dakota city neb and 
chicagobased sara lee corp owner of the meat processer hillshire 
farms led to settlements requiring the companies to implement 
safetyimprovement plans within three years 
earlier this year osha said it planned to make the meat industry 
a model in the use of ergonomics to enhance worker safety the meat 
institute described ergonomics in a news release as the science of 
fitting the job to the worker rather than making the worker fit the 
job 
as part of its plan osha invited the meat industry and labor to 
help prepare guidelines for improving worker safety osha officials 
have said they hope to make the guidelines available to the industry 
by late fall

bankers trust co plans to become the first bank 
to handle the public sale of a corporate bond issue as allowed under 
a recent federal reserve board ruling 
in july the fed over the objection of wall street investment 
houses granted banks the power to sell new corporate bond issues to 
the public overturning a restriction contained in the 
depressionera glasssteagall act 
that law was designed to segregate the businesses of banking and 
securities it was prompted by the practice of banks in the 1920s of 
selling corporate securities at inflated prices with the proceeds 
used to repay bank loans 
under the change approved by the fed banks must sell any bond 
issues through separately financed subsidiaries in order to ensure 
that federally insured bank deposits are not involved in the 
financings these subsidiaries may not borrow from their parent 
banks 
in addition the fed imposed rules against the sharing of 
information between the subsidiaries and the banks loan officers 
bankers trusts proposed bond issue involves 150 million in 
highyield or junk securities for morningstar foods inc of 
dallas a producer and distributor of dairy products 
the new yorkbased bank loaned 80 million to help a group of 
texas investors buy morningstar from southland corp operator of 
the 7eleven convenience stores in 1988 
some predict the entrance of banks into junk bond financing at a 
time when the junkbond market is unsettled could produce a backlash 
if this does not scare the federal reserve it will certainly 
scare congress william j fitzpatrick general counsel to the 
securities industry association told the new york times on todays 
editions 
having just rescued the savings and loan industry i dont 
think congress wants to see the banking industry involved in such 
risky businesses he said 
the trade association has fought the entrance of banks into the 
securities field

department reported today 
the rise in consumer spending followed a 06 percent gain in july

consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic 
health since it accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
the advance in personal incomes followed a 07 percent increase 
in july the slower pace was attributed to strikes against several 
major telephone companies personal incomes have risen steadily 
since a 03 percent decline in november 1988

provided fresh evidence that the economy is not in danger of 
toppling into a recession

income rose 04 percent in august down slightly from a 07 percent 
aftertax increase in july 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable

the junk bond markets turmoil may have inflicted 
lasting damage making it more difficult to sell new issues and even 
raising doubts among the investment houses that are its staunchest 
backers experts say 
this was the first time that the market has really frozen 
said paul getman an economist with wefa group an economic 
consulting firm it tells me that it is not a fully developed 
real market markets do not freeze 
junk bond prices plunged a week and a half ago after campeau 
corp a major retailer and junkbond issuer said it would have 
trouble paying its bills campeaus crisis mushroomed throughout the 
junkbond market and for several days many junk issues had sellers 
but no buyers 
you shouldnt forget how this one incident that was limited to 
one issue in the market triggered such adverse reaction elsewhere 
said john lonski senior economist at moodys investors service inc 
it makes you wonder what would happen to junk bond prices if there 
were several campeaus together which is not an unlikely possibility 
god knows whats going to happen once a downturn finally 
hits he said 
junk bonds primarily are issued by companies that do not have an 
investmentgrade evaluation from a major credit rating agency they 
also are used to raise the cash needed in corporate takeovers 
because of their poor ratings and high risk of default they pay 
more interest than investmentgrade bonds 
the 200 billion market in junk bonds lost an estimated 10 
billion in value in the turmoil it also prompted a pullout by many 
investors in junkbond mutual funds the only place where small 
investors would have direct exposure to the highyield market 
though the market recovered somewhat last week jitters remain 
the junk bond market still faces considerable uncertainty 
said lonski he added that the campeau debacle was a shocker 
since the torontobased company was not considered to be in such 
precarious condition 
lonski said nervousness in the junk market was evident before 
campeau just prior to the crisis the average difference in yields 
between junk bonds and 10year treasury bonds considered among the 
safest investments was 54 percentage points or nearly 14 
percentage points greater than the yield spread at the start of the 
year 
the overall junk bond market may not fully recover to where it 
was at the start of this year until it has been put through the test 
of a recession lonski said 
some experts are less pessimistic james c goss a highyield 
analyst at the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps inc said its 
not the first time the market has taken a hit but then recovered 
it was an important event but i dont know that it signaled 
the end of the market goss said 
goss and other marketwatchers said one outcome of campeaus 
troubles is that investors are going to demand that new junk issues 
involve less leverage by the issuing companies and more realistic 
plans about how the debt is going to be repaid 
many experts said campeau paid too much for allied stores corp 
and federated department stores inc deals that led to its trouble 
and was forced to sell assets at prices below its expectations to 
raise cash the easy availability of money through selling junk 
bonds doesnt lead to bargain hunting they say 
in addition many analysts said theres going to be more 
awareness of the distinction between good junk and bad junk 
good junk bonds are issued by companies such as rjr nabisco inc 
financially strong companies in industries that dont usually suffer 
in recessions bad junk comes from weaker companies in cyclical 
businesses 
finally analysts said more realism should be evident among the 
investment houses that promote junk bonds and their clients that 
issue them 
youll find that investment banks are going to scrutinize a lot 
more closely these deals that they are putting together said 
getman they are getting stuck with unsold junk bonds for the 
first time in the past they passed these deals off on the public 
i guess this is going to be one of the nice examples where wall 
street is going to fleece itself as well as the public he said

about 300000 california residents are 
eligible for refunds of highinterest loans packed with expensive 
extras under settlement of a lawsuit that could cost itt consumer 
financial corp up to 100 million 
the company did not admit wrongdoing but state attorney general 
john van de kamp said itts loan practices since 1986 amounted to 
consumer fraud on a grand scale 
van de kamp said the minnesotabased company took advantage of 
people in desperate need of money and charged them up to 35 
percent interest on loans and unnecessary extras 
every person who lost money to itt can recover every dime plus 
interest there is no cap on total refund due to consumers van de 
kamp told reporters thursday when the settlement was reached in 
alameda county superior court 
the settlement came on a civil complaint filed by van de kamp 
that accused itt of assorted deceptions lies and baitandswitch 
tactics 
van de kamp said itt mailed millions of california residents 
invitations to apply for guaranteed loans of 2300 promising 
the money was preapproved with no security required and no credit 
checks 
applicants who took up itt on the offer were immediately 
subjected to full security checks they were presented with 
readytosign loan agreements that pledged their household goods and 
cars as security often far in excess of the loans van de kamp 
said 
applicants were often signed up for life disability property 
and vehicle insurance insurance that they did not need and did not 
know they were buying he said 
in a statement itt did not admit any misdeeds but said the 
practices alleged by the state without doubt were contraventions 
to our procedures and not a pattern of behavior condoned by the 
company 
restitution could be as much as 100 million to 300000 loan 
holders but the number of consumers who apply for refunds likely 
will be closer to 100000 van de kamp said the lower number of 
consumers would cost itt 25 million to 50 million with an 
additional 105 million to be set aside in trust for people who are 
located later 
loan holders are to be contacted by letter with an explanation of 
how to apply for refunds

in the newsroom of the st louis postdispatch 
editors reporters and clerks left their desks and gathered around a 
microphone to hear a talk from the chief 
our confidence is strong our spirits are high our adrenalin 
is running and weve done this without steroids said joseph 
pulitzer jr chairman of the pulitzer publishing co and grandson 
of the founder of the postdispatch 
it was a pep talk for the journalism troops who are preparing to 
begin the nations newest newspaper war a battle the newspaper 
industry is watching closely 
the confrontation starts monday when the tabloid newcomer the 
st louis sun owned and edited by ralph ingersoll ii hits the 
street 
ingersoll whose ingersoll publications co owns a chain of 43 
free weekly or biweekly newspapers with a circulation of 700000 in 
the suburbs of st louis is trying to buck the trend of newspapers 
closing up or merging because they cant attract enough readers or 
advertising to make money 
so far the specter of competition has been good for the historic 
postdispatch which will be 111 years old in december said 
nicholas g penniman iv the newspapers publisher 
the paid daily circulation of the newspaper has been steadily 
increasing this summer penniman said compared with the same period 
last year daily circulation is up about 8000 and sunday 
circulation has increased by about 15000 
part of the increase is because of baseball part of it is 
because we are making aggressive attempts to sell the postdispatch 
and thirdly i think people appreciate the postdispatch and enjoy 
it he said 
penniman said the postdispatch now has a daily circulation of 
about 380000 and a sunday circulation of about 565000 the sun 
hopes to have at least 75000 subscribers at the outset it already 
has signed up more than 50000 said robert m jelenic president 
and chief executive of the sun 
penniman said that as far as the postdispatch can tell it has 
lost only 50 subscribers to the sun and the amount spent on retail 
advertising by the postdispatchs 10 largest accounts is up about 5 
percent from last year 
meanwhile in the postdispatch newsroom ideas and ideals have 
been flying 
its a little bit like an athletic competition said david 
lipman the managing editor theres no question theres a sense 
of anticipation and excitement about the competition 
he said the sun has allowed editors to make changes that had been 
proposed for at least a year including increasing sports and 
business coverage and adding a news summary 
the postdispatch also has redesigned several sections of the 
paper and hired a fulltime writing coach longtime chief copy 
editor harry levins 
lipman said the changes were not made to match the sun which has 
touted itself as planning to be a colorful easytoread laptop 
newspaper with extra emphasis on sports 
we would have made these changes whether there was some new 
competition or not he said we are going to continue putting 
out an everimproving newspaper no matter what distractions or 
attractions come to st louis 
expectations of st louis residents toward the two newspapers may 
differ according to charles klotzer editor of the st louis 
journalism review 
i think the first questions that are asked about the sun and 
the postdispatch depict immediately how the newspapers are viewed 
in the community klotzer said 
when we talk about the sun we ask do you think its going to 
make a profit and when we talk about the postdispatch we ask 
do you think its going to be a better newspaper 
penniman speaking to a recent missouri newspaper meeting said 
some people believe well be like the 800pound gorilla and crush 
the sun but he added that this would not be true 
we dont want to be the only paper in st louis we want to be 
the best he said

house speaker thomas s foley today called 
president bushs plan to cut the capital gains tax a positive harm 
to the economy and vowed to pass a democratic alternative despite 
a veto threat 
bush meanwhile denied his policies were designed to help the 
rich and declared this should not be a partisan issue 
i think were doing very well in enlisting support for the 
democratic plan that would raise taxes for the richest 600000 
couples and individuals to pay for new tax deductions for individual 
retirement accounts foley told reporters we have a pretty good 
popular constituency 
a wall street journalnbc news poll seemed to back that up 
showing that 49 percent of voters prefer expansion of iras while 38 
percent favor bushs capital gains tax reduction idea the poll 
noted that the preference for iras was even greater among 
middleincome voters 53 percent to 35 percent 
the democrats proposal also includes a scaleddown version of 
the capital gains tax cut sought by bush bushs version foley 
said is a positive harm to the economy an inequitable tax 
reduction favoring the least financially deserving of the income 
groups in the country 
the president interviewed live thursday night on the abctv 
program prime time live was asked what he would do if democrats 
on capitol hill succeeded in passing their own tax bill 
i will veto a rate increase bush said you heard it for 
the first time here but i have sent that signal up to the hill 
responding to that foley said well then well try to send 
it to him and let him veto it 
bush also defended his proposal for a cut in the capital gains 
rate saying it is not a tax break for the rich the house ways 
and means committee approved a version of the presidents plan 
taking questions from farm broadcasters today on an agriculture 
department radio program bush said the capital gains tax cut he is 
seeking would put money in the little guys pocket 
ive heard some on the hill deride this as just another tax cut 
for the rich but that simply is not the case bush told his radio 
audience 
he claimed that under existing law only onethird of 
soleproprietor farmers could qualify for a 100 percent exclusion 
from the capital gains tax under his measure he said half would 
qualify for this exclusion 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said thursday that 
democrats were ready to tackle the tax hike accusations 
i like how the lines are drawn gephardt said the bush 
proposal gives a tax break for the rich paid for by the middle 
class our proposal gives individual retirement accounts to the 
middle class paid for by the superwealthy 
the democratic proposal which house leadership plans to bring 
before the full house next week would 
eliminate restrictions passed in 1986 so that all workers 
regardless of income could have a deductible ira plan the money 
could be withdrawn before retirement without paying a penalty if 
used to finance the down payment on a first home or for college 
education 
pay for the iras and reduce the deficit by raising taxes on the 
nations wealthiest 600000 couples and individuals 
under current law the tax rate for uppermiddleincome americans 
is 33 percent but it drops back to 28 percent for those at the 
uppermost income levels the democrats would raise that top rate to 
33 percent 
for example a single person with 75000 taxable income now pays 
a top rate of 33 percent on a 10000 pay raise or investment 
windfall but a 250000ayear earner pays only 28 percent tax on a 
similar increase in income 
eliminate the 33 percent rate bracket for capital gains so it 
would never climb above 28 percent that would be a tax break for 
those uppermiddleincome people who now pay 33 percent on capital 
gains just as they do on earned income 
the democratic plan would be offered as an alternative to the 
capital gains tax cut approved by the house ways and means committee 
with the presidents support that plan would cut the effective 
capital gains rate to 196 percent for the next two years and then 
protect such income from taxes caused by inflationary increases in 
the propertys value

the trouble with uncle sam trying to soak the 
rich is that even if he took every taxable nickel they earned it 
wouldnt be enough hed run through it in less than a couple of 
weeks 
it seems there just arent enough rich people no matter what 
youve heard they dont have enough money either and if you take 
it all in one year therell probably be even fewer of them the next 
based on 1986 tax returns 35875 individuals had adjusted gross 
income of more than 1 million that might seem like a lot but in a 
relative sense it isnt just 003 percent of all taxpayers 
examining the data the tax foundation which describes itself as 
a nonprofit research organization determined that the groups 
adjusted gross income was 823 billion taxable income was 663 
billion and tax owed totaled 337 billion 
that taxable income was the result of an effective tax rate of 41 
percent had the rate been 100 percent it would have put another 
326 billion into uncle sams pockets it would have lasted him 12 
days 
there just arent enough millionaires to accomplish what the 
soaktherich folks desire they must dig deeper for pay dirt the 
rich category must be expanded to include those with taxable 
income of 500000 or more 
now were talking you say but no were really not 
based on the foundations examination 92621 individual returns 
showed taxable income of 500000 or more in 1986 had they been 
taxed 100 percent it would have provided an additional 537 
billion sufficient for 198 days 
there just arent enough halfmillionaires either the category 
of rich must be expanded again this time to include the well 
off or those with taxable income of 200000 or more now were 
really talking 
really in 1986 there were nearly 400000 of them had they been 
taxed 100 percent the government would have been 884 billion 
richer those are big bucks in any comparison but uncle sam would 
have run through them in a month 
efforts to dig deeper into the tax lode produces similarly 
frustrating returns to attempt doing it inevitably would have an 
effect opposite to that intended take all a persons taxable 
income and the person will stop producing it 
and though they appear wealthy some of these taxpayers probably 
arent some for example are rich just once in a lifetime 
when they sell the farm or the family business their wealth is the 
result of years of work 
to dig deeper is eventually to strike the middle classes 
upper and lower whence most of the revenues already come they 
have no more to give already the buck has stopped at the middle 
class 
if the rich cant help then certainly the poor cannot either 
how therefore do you relieve the middle class of its burden 
you probably cannot america is a nation of middleclass 
citizens no other nation has produced more a big middle class has 
long been one of the nations proudest boasts 
it is the nations strength its symbol of accomplishment its 
proof of the system its stability it is also the nations 
taxpayer and aside perhaps from a bottle of aspirin or some other 
token relief is not in sight

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting reduced fears of a cropdamaging freeze this weekend in 
the midwest 
the steadying of the markets follows sharply higher corn and 
soybean futures in the two previous sessions on forecasts for a hard 
freeze in the corn belt this weekend and early next week 
but this mornings forecasts showed less of a chance for 
widespread frost and a return to normal temperatures next week 
wheat futures weakened in reaction to the international wheat 
councils downward revision to 31 million metric tons from 36 
million metric tons of estimated soviet grain imports for the 
current wheat marketing year which runs from june through may 
the revision follows soviet statements that they plan fewer grain 
imports 
we could be looking at a decrease in demand while us 
production has increased sharply from a year ago which would be a 
negative scenario said gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine 
corps floor operations at the board of trade 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 394 a bushel corn 
was cent lower to 1 cents higher with december at 231 a bushel 
oats were cent to 1 cents higher with december at 142 a 
bushel soybeans were cent lower to 8 cents higher with november 
at 582 a bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 30 cent lower to 18 cent higher with october 
at 7140 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 10 
cent higher with september at 83 cents a pound hogs were 18 cent 
to 57 cent higher with october at 4245 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 05 cent to 90 cent higher with february at 4965

amway corp has agreed to pay 381 million to 
settle charges it avoided paying canadian duties and in exchange 
the government dropped a 1254 million suit against the direct 
sales company an official said friday 
a spokesman for revenue minister otto jelinek said the government 
filed notice to drop the suit wednesday in the federal court of 
canada amway initiated negotiations to settle the case a year ago 
he added 
its not a bad settlement said the spokesman who asked not 
to be identified 
amway officials at the companys headquarters in ada mich were 
not immediately available for comment 
canadas revenue agency had accused the amway of avoiding custom 
duties by undervaluing merchandise it exported from the united 
states to canadian distributors during a sixyear period beginning 
in 1974 
the 9yearold lawsuit sought money for unpaid customs duties 
sales taxes and the value of the amway products that crossed into 
canada during those six years 
amway officials had said they were confident that revenue canada 
could not collect because the agencys lawyers failed to include 
that claim in their original suit 
in 1983 amway pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to 
fraud allegations and paid a 25 million fine to the province of 
ontario 
amway is second to avon products inc in direct sales worldwide

canadian government 381 million to settle a 1254million tax 
fraud lawsuit filed 10 years ago officials said friday 
it was done with the intent of saving a lot of time and expense 
in these complex legal procedures said jean ouimet a spokesman 
for revenue canadas customs and excise division 
the settlement combined with a 21million criminal fine paid by 
amway to the province of ontario in 1983 brings to 59 million the 
amount the giant directsales company has paid to end its legal 
troubles in canada 
canadas revenue agency had accused amway of avoiding custom 
duties by undervaluing merchandise it exported from 197480 from the 
united states to canadian distributors 
the lawsuit which was dropped wednesday sought money for unpaid 
customs duties sales taxes and the value of the amway products that 
crossed into canada during those six years 
in 1982 canada also brought criminal charges against amway 
cofounders richard devos and jay vanandel and two other top 
executives in connection with the case those charges were dropped 
in 1983 after amway pleaded guilty and paid the 21 million fine 
otto stolz amways general counsel said the company is under a 
gag order not to discuss the particulars of the settlement 
amway is second to avon products inc in direct sales worldwide

jaguar plcs board of directors on friday 
characterized ford motor cos plans to buy a stake in the company 
as an unwelcome initiative and vowed to preserve the british luxury 
auto makers independence 
ford announced tuesday it intended to buy as much as 15 percent 
of jaguars shares the maximum allowed under current british 
government restrictions 
in its response jaguar said in a brief statement following a 
board meeting that its directors confirmed that the ford 
initiative was unwelcome 
in addition directors determined to continue to pursue plans 
that would preserve jaguars independence which they believe to be 
in the best longterm interests of everyone associated with the 
company 
a jaguar spokesman declined to elaborate 
jaguar stock rose 52 cents a share to finish at 918 on londons 
stock exchange takeover speculation has pushed jaguar stock sharply 
higher this week on monday the day preceeding the ford 
announcement jaguar closed at just 640 a share 
ford said it sought longterm relationship with the unprofitable 
british automaker but ford added that it was too early to say 
whether it would seek to acquire jaguar once the governments 
restrictions on its ownership are lifted at the end of the year 
until the end of 1990 the maximum holding allowed in jaguar is 
15 percent and the government has the right to veto any takeover 
the government imposed those restrictions when it privatized jaguar 
in 1984 
ford characterized its approach as friendly jaguar said it was 
notified of fords plans shortly before the us automaker made the 
announcement 
there has been speculation that fellow us car manufacturer 
general motors corp along with other auto makers also were 
interested in pursuing jaguar 
while jaguar has held out the possibility of collaborating with 
another car maker a spokesman earlier in the week affirmed the 
companys desire to remain independent 
jaguar has been battered by flagging sales in its principal us 
market during the past year the company expects to sell 20000 cars 
in the united states this year down from 20700 in 1988 
for the first six months of the year jaguar posted an aftertax 
loss of 17 million on sales of 870 million 
analysts said ford which already has a huge european presence 
and is negotiating a possible transaction with swedish automaker 
saab could benefit from an association with the wellknown jaguar 
luxury car line 
ford of europe which is headquartered in brentwood england 
makes 18 million vehicles a year it has 21 european plants 11 of 
them in britain and employs more than 110000 people

transportation secretary samuel skinner today 
told the new owners of northwest airlines his decision on his review 
of the 4 billion takeover of nwa inc a department spokesman said 
but an announcement was not due until next week 
skinner has the option of pulling the airlines operating 
license but there has been no indication that is likely 
transportation department spokesman hal paris said a decision has 
been made in the departments review of the takeover by wings 
holdings ltd of nwa northwests parent company he said skinner 
met this morning with california investor alfred checchi who heads 
wings 
paris said results of the departments fitness review of the 4 
billion takeover would likely be made public next week 
he said the departments public affairs office had been given no 
details of the meeting but skinner would have told checchi whether 
any restrictions might be put on the airlines operating license 
because of the buyout 
paris said conditions could include requiring the airline to 
furnish regular financial reports and putting restrictions on the 
carriers management 
skinner informed checchi of his decision before making it public 
because he didnt want mr checchi reading about the findings in 
the paper the spokesman said 
checchi led a group including klm royal dutch airlines that 
agreed in june to pay 121 a share for nwa northwest is the 
nations fourthlargest airline 
skinner has expressed concern about leverage buyouts and 
increasing foreign investment in us airlines the checchi takeover 
saddles northwest with 31 billion in debt 
without mentioning northwest skinner said in a speech to the 
international aviation club tuesday that he would make adjustments 
in a heavily leveraged airlines operating certificate if necessary 
to protect the public interest 
or if absolutely necessary he added and i hope that 
doesnt take place we will revoke the certificate 
the justice department also investigated the northwest sale but 
did not raise any objections said spokeswoman amy brown 
the departments review was prompted by antitrust issues raised 
by klms interest in the sale brown said

soybean futures prices fell steeply friday 
leading the grain markets lower amid receding fears of a hard frost 
in the midwest this weekend 
the buying erased the gains made in the previous sesssion when 
soybeans led a strong rally linked to forecasts for a nearrecord 
cold snap in cropgrowing areas still vulnerable to frost damage 
but many meteorologists altered their outlooks on friday 
most of the forecasts now are minimizing the chance for frost 
this weekend said gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine 
corps floor operations at the board of trade 
theyre talking about minimal frost in isolated areas with the 
potential for a return to normal temperatures next week he said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 5 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 389 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to cent higher with december at 229 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cent lower with december at at 140 a bushel

opec ministers gathering for weekend talks on the 
oil market appeared at odds friday over whether to lift their 
production ceiling in the final three months of the year 
even before the start of discussions scheduled for late saturday 
some ministers arriving in geneva expressed concern over what they 
consider to be weak crude prices eight ministers comprising the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries price monitoring and 
longterm strategy committee are scheduled to meet 
an increase in opec production which some believe the ministers 
might authorize would likely cause prices to slip analysts say 
theres no need to raise the ceiling as long as the price 
objective is not met said algerian oil minister sadek boussena 
but issam abdul raheem alchalabi iraqs oil chief said i 
would like to see a reasonable increase in the ceiling he didnt 
specify a level 
however observers as well as some opec ministers have said they 
dont expect a resolution to the volatile issue of permanent quotas 
at this latest meeting instead it appeared the quota issue would 
be bumped to november when the full cartel is to meet in vienna 
we can always discuss it but there will not be a decision in 
this area said boussena 
the 13nation cartel is pumping about 22 million barrels a day 
according to various estimates well over the output cap of 195 
million barrels set by opec for the last six months of the year 
the ministers agreed in june to meet this month to decide whether 
to lift the ceiling 500000 barrels a day to 20 million barrels or 
perhaps more 
although world oil prices are weaker than they were last spring 
and remain below the catels benchmark of 18 a barrel strong 
demand has kept them surprisingly firm despite opecs excess 
production 
opec secretarygeneral subroto has estimated that demand for the 
cartels oil might be around 22 million barrels a day in the 
octoberdecember quarter 
a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec averaged 1704 a 
barrel last week it had topped the 18mark last spring 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of american oil has 
been trading in the range of 1950 to 20 a 42gallon barrel 
chalabi arriving in midafternoon from an energy conference in 
montreal told reporters that the opec ministers would review 
conditions in the constantly changing oil market 
he said some countries were opposed to an output increase because 
they want to defend the price others he said think supply 
and demand warrant a much higher ceiling 
boussena said there was a link between the cartels 
production level and its price and he noted that prices had not 
reached opecs benchmark in the last three months 
ecuadors diego tamariz also seemed worried about prices 
we still have to obtain the goal of 18 he said adding that 
we should work on it 
fergus macleod an analyst at the investment firm of barclays de 
zoete wedd in london said prices would likely fall 50 cents or a 
dollar a barrel if the cartel were to lift the supply cap without 
curtailing members cheating 
an increase of 500000 barrels a day he said would probably 
kick up total output to about 225 million barrels 
the ministers were also expected to begin tackling the tough 
issue of how to meet some members demands for a higher share of the 
production pie each country is given a quota or a daily production 
level 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have in recent months ignored 
their quotas and pumped as much as double their shares of about a 
million barrels each analysts estimate 
kuwaits oil minister ali khalifa alsabah said his promise at 
the june meeting to hold the line on production was conditional 
if everybody sticks to the quota fine if anybody breaks it 
the others have the same right he told reporters outside the 
luxury hotel where the ministers will hold their discussions 
the talks will technically be held by a monitoring panel of 
ministers from algeria indonesia iran iraq kuwait nigeria 
saudi arabia and venezuela the others gabon ecuador libya 
qatar and the united arab emirates were also invited to attend 
saudia arabias oil minister hisham nazer was reported 
recovering from surgery in the united states and was not attending

chrysler corp said friday it is selling about 
half its stock in the japanese automaker mitsubishi motors corp and 
will receive about 310 million after taxes 
an analyst said the move indicates the no 3 american automaker 
which is in the midst of a 1 billion costcutting program is being 
cautious about the future of the us auto market 
chrysler said the sale of mitsubishi stock will drop its holdings 
in its japanese partner to 121 percent from 218 percent a group 
of 25 japanese financial institutions is buying the stock for about 
592 million chrysler said 
chrysler which owns an assembly plant with mitsubishi in 
illinois said the stock sale was not directly connected with the 
automakers financial trimming 
the fact is we didnt need the 310 million to meet the 
shortterm cash needs of implementing our billiondollar cutting 
program chrysler chief financial officer robert miller said 
he said chrysler was not making much money on the mitsubishi 
stock investment and selling 45 percent of its shares would help 
boost the us companys cash reserves 
but analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new 
york said the sale was an indicator of chryslers overall caution 
on the outlook for the business in the united states 
it was not producing a cash return and now that they own half 
of what they owned before in mitsubishi they still will have the 
same business relationship and will be able to take a good bit of 
cash out he said 
miller said the deal would not affect the cooperation between the 
two companies 
by selling we dont think the partys over by any means 
miller said 
mitsubishi motor sales of america inc the japanese companys 
us marketing arm in cypress calif had no comment on chryslers 
move spokesman kim custer said 
chrysler and mitsubishi are involved in the joint manufacturing 
venture diamondstar motors corp in normal ill where plymouth 
laser mitsubishi eclipse and eagle talon are manufactured 
mitsubishi also supplies more than 500000 v6 engines to chrysler 
annually 
in 1971 chrysler bought into mitsubishi at the time a privately 
held company 
since then chrysler has been on a financial roller coaster the 
us government guaranteed loans during the late 1970s that chrysler 
eventually paid off seven years early 
chrysler announced july 27 that it would slash 1 billion from 
its 26 billion annual budget by the end of 1990 
chrysler motors corp chairman ben bidwell head of the companys 
vehiclemaking arm blamed the cuts on a slumping sales market 
rising costs especially in consumer incentives and forecasts of a 
softer economy 
earlier this week chrysler motors president bob lutz said the 
company expected total us car sales of 142 million vehicles in 
1990 4 percent to 5 percent below this year and 101 percent below 
1988 the secondbest year in auto history

by the time tom monaghan made it official 
dominos pizza inc employees already knew pizza no longer was the 
founders reason for being 
monaghan 52 rich beyond his dreams is at a crossroads 
church charitable work and other outside interests are more 
important than pepperoni double mozzarella and guaranteed delivery 
in 30 minutes or less 
it is not fair to give divided attention to dominos pizza and 
my foundation work he said 
his personal activities including work against abortion and 
speaking in favor of the contras in nicaragua also attract 
attention to the company he nurtured for 29 years 
what he had hinted before he told employees and franchise 
holders in a letter earlier this month monaghan would consider 
selling the company and other personal properties such as his 
antique cars an 81 million bugatti among them for the right 
price hes keeping the detroit tigers baseball team which he 
bought for 55 million in 1983 
the letter generated a flurry of publicity about the possible 
sale frontpage stories in detroits newspapers for several days 
last week monaghan stopped talking and the focus turned to choosng 
an investment banker to handle the sale the lowend estimate of its 
worth is 250 million the high end is 1 billion 
monaghan had talked about selling before in june he named david 
black vice president of operations since 1981 as president and 
chief operating officer giving black most daytoday 
responsibilities while monaghan retained the posts of chairman and 
chief executive officer 
i love the daytoday work at dominos but i want to serve the 
church more i always wanted to be a priest he told thousands of 
employees at that time via closedcircuit television 
and he said then he would consider selling the company if it 
would benefit his dominos pizza foundation 
monaghan said in a july 1988 interview that pizza wasnt his 
first priority even when he started dominos in 1960 by trading a 
car for a controlling interest in a pizza store in ypsilanti mich 
west of detroit his real goal he said was an architect career 
dominos has grown into the nations secondlargest pizza chain 
with 5100 stores in 17 countries and estimated annual sales of 21 
billion figures from the national association of pizza operators 
show pizza hut is no 1 with 7000 restaurants and estimated annual 
sales of 32 billion 
monaghan has become one of the nations wealthiest people using 
that money to pursue youthful interests forbes magazine estimated 
his net worth last year at 480 million 
architecture books line his office shelves and he owns a 
collection of furniture designed by frank lloyd wright including a 
198000 chair a 264000 dresser and a dining room set purchased 
for 16 million in 1987 
monaghans collection of classic automobiles numbers about 300 
including the 1931 bugatti royale berline de voyage bought in 1986 
for 81 million and a 1942 buick roadmaster convertible that is his 
favorite to drive 
in 1985 he began construction on the 300acre 250 million 
dominos farms headquarters complex in ann arbor mich 
the company also has a resort on drummond island in michigans 
upper peninsula where employees and other guests are housed in a 
frank lloyd wrightinspired lodge and entertained on the 173foot 
schooner domino effect 
monaghan has pursued roman catholic church work with equal zeal 
as a foster child he attended a catholic school in traverse city 
and for a time he attended a seminary school in grand rapids until 
kicked out in 10th grade for misbehaving 
now his dominos foundation supports a catholic missionary priest 
in honduras and monaghan twice has met pope john paul ii 
he founded legatus an international organization for catholic 
corporate chief executives that schedules events from dinners with 
mass and a speaker to workshops on business ethics he said last 
year its the thing that i feel best about of anything i do 
monaghans conservative catholic activities have had 
repercussions the national organization for women supports a 
dominos boycott because of his financial support for antiabortion 
causes 
company spokesman ron hingst says the protests dont hurt sales 
rockwell wouldnt speculate on their impact though he said outside 
activities can distract a chief executive 
its certainly possible an individual can spend too much time 
away from a company he said 
the pizza business itself has attackers too dominos attorneys 
are contending with damage suits by traffic accident victims who 
blame pizza drivers hurrying to meet dominos 30minute delivery 
deadline to avoid giving a 3 discount on the pizza they are 
carrying 
security is another problem carrying money and pizza can make 
drivers robbery targets one driver was killed in 1987 in a 
confrontation with gang members in san bernardino calif 
monaghan told the detroit news the sale announcement was based 
strictly on personal reasons 
ive got just about everything ive ever dreamed about he 
said and the great lesson of that is its not that big a deal

a group of thomson mckinnon inc employees filed 
a 100 million lawsuit friday claiming that executives of the wall 
street brokerage bankrupted an employee trust fund and used company 
assets to pay for apartments and a yacht 
the federal suit also alleges that a deal to sell struggling 
thomson mckinnon this year fell through after buyer prudentialbache 
securities inc discovered the brokerage was overvalued by 80 
million to 95 million 
after the deal collapsed prudentialbache in july purchased only 
thomson mckinnons retail brokerage offices and customer accounts 
the company denied the allegations in the lawsuit filed by 16 
current and former thomson mckinnon employees in us district court 
in manhattan as a class action on behalf of an estimated 2800 
employees who owned stock in the firm which traces its formation to 
1885 
the lawsuit claims thomson mckinnon executives used assets in an 
employee stock ownership plan or esop in a well planned and 
executed scheme to personally profit at the expense of the firm 
its subsidiaries and the esop 
thomson mckinnon allegedly kept apartments in puerto rico and 
manhattan for senior officers bought and maintained a 13 million 
yacht for the companys president gave executives disguised weekly 
cash payments for personal use and paid school tuition for former 
chairman john j maloney jrs 13 children 
the lawsuit alleges broad financial mismanagement including a 
125 million loan to a real estate investment trust that went 
bankrupt and a costly decision to move the companys offices shortly 
after the 1987 stock market crash 
the firm also regularly overstated the companys earnings and 
assets to induce employees to buy into the esop the lawsuit claims 
the financial mismanagement it alleges led to the collapsed deal 
with prudentialbache 
donald g mccabe general counsel for thomson mckinnon securities 
inc the firms brokerage arm said the defendants will most 
firmly deny the allegations and that the lawsuit is without 
merit 
he declined immediate comment on specific allegations in the suit 
the lawsuit says employees held about 77 percent of the stock in 
stock in thomson mckinnon as part of their regular compensation and 
the esop was worth about 140 million in 1986 
a year later it was estimated at 125 million the plaintiffs 
claim but on july 31 this year the employees received a letter from 
thomson mckinnon chairman j ronald morgan stating that it is 
possible the esop will have no value whatsoever 
the letter distributed after the deal for the brokerage 
division also stated the esop would be canceled because the sale of 
the full company to prudentialbache had fallen through 
the lawsuit claims employees would have received the cash 
equivalent of the stock following a sale but lost that money when 
the deal fell through because of the alleged mismanagement 
the suit seeks more than 100 million in damages or the amount 
in the esop allegedly dissipated by executive mismanagement 
in addition to thomson mckinnon morgan and maloney the lawsuit 
names company chairman philip m fahey six other senior executives 
and the accounting firm coopers amp lybrand

executives at retailer rh macy amp co made a 
smart move this past week while their campeau corp counterparts 
scrambled to come up with cash to keep their department stores 
running 
they publicly reassured backers who had put money into macys 
debtfinanced buyout in 1986 that their investment was doing just 
fine 
instead of ignoring the situation macys tried to deflect the 
shock waves rippling through the retail industry since campeau 
dropped a bombshell in disclosing a severe cash shortage 
big problems like campeaus and nagging small ones that wont go 
away have shaken the foundations under retailing and raised 
questions about what it takes to thrive or even survive in a 
business where so much rests on having the financial flexibility to 
respond quickly to what customers want 
campeau a torontobased retailing and realestate company built 
by an ambitious robert campeau staved off an emergency last week 
thanks to a money transfusion from a major stockholder 
obtaining the 250 million loan caused campeau to lose control of 
the company he founded and yield to others who might unwind the 
strings of chain stores campeau collected with heaps of borrowed 
money 
campeau is trying to sell bloomingdales its flagship property 
the companys properties alos include burdines jordan marsh 
lazarus and sterns 
even before campeaus problems there were signs that things 
werent right in retailing 
australianowned lj hooker corp the owner of oldline 
department stores b altman amp co and bonwit teller sought refuge 
in bankruptcy court after also running into trouble trying to stay 
on top of a mountain of debt 
the nightmares of campeau and hooker heavily involved in 
property development like campeau shows what can happen when 
companies try to mix merchandise retailing with other businesses 
says richard echikson chairman of millburn njbased retail 
consultants inc 
an exception is crown american corp one of the countrys major 
shopping mall developers which has had a happy experience as a 
store owner since buying hesss department stores of allentown 
pa in 1979 crown american has successfully expanded the chain to 
72 stores from 17 
frank pasquerilla founder and currently chairman of crown 
american has been praised for keeping people with retailsmarts in 
charge at hesss 
pasquerilla was smart enough to leave the merchant alone 
says echikson 
even retail titan sears roebuck and co has been looking 
vulnerable it still could lose its no1 ranking despite an 
aggressive campaign to meet its discounting competitors headon with 
a lowpricing policy of its own 
so far sears only seems to have spurred a pricecutting battle 
that while making bargain hunters happy could have unpleasant 
consequences for retailers who cut their profit margins to the bone 
to maintain market share 
stephanie shern of the accounting firm ernst amp young says sears 
hasnt emphasized rapid response in distribution unlike 
fastgrowing walmart stores inc with its hightech 
satellitecontrolled communications system or toys r us inc where 
poorselling games or gizmos arent allowed to linger 
the guys who understand how to buy that product and get it on 
the shelves quickly without a lot of warehousing costs will do 
best shern said 
at no2ranked k mart corp the cardinal rule in retailing 
know your customer seems to be getting confused 
the discounter has forged unlikely alliances with 
actresscumclothingdesigner jacqueline smith hostess 
extraordinaire martha stewart and other luminaries to spruce up its 
dowdy image the risk alienating its traditional customers who are 
thinking about price not prestige 
retailers catering to specialized groups such as 
fashionconscious women seem to be doing well these days analysts 
expect these niche merchants to continue flourishing if theyre 
willing to adapt such as changing their presentation to suit a 
maturing population of women shoppers 
specialty apparel retailer limited inc seems to be doing just 
that its flagship limited stores have subtly changed the looks of 
its merchandise while the kookier stuff for teenyboppers is now 
found in limited express shops 
oldfashioned courtesy is back in fashion among retailers 
nordstrom inc seems to be prospering as it expands outside its 
historic western area by investing in polite employees who are 
winning raves from patrons 
whats going on in retailing is typical for a mature industry 
the solution to slow growth isnt as simple anymore as building 
another store says shern adding stores must come up with ways to 
make themselves distinctive 
making matters more difficult for sellers is that buyers may be 
losing interest in shopping the gogo days are long gone for the 
current economic cycle and people are busy enjoying possessions they 
already own pentup demand has been satisfied 
plus grownup baby boomers with new families have decided its 
finally time to start saving up for juniors college education 
there is greater restraint impulse and frivolous purchases are 
way down says kurt barnard a new yorkbased retail consultant 
and publisher of barnards retail marketing report 
in such an environment its no wonder that robert campeaus dream 
of a continentspanning retail empire couldnt become a reality but 
campeaus downfall wasnt just the outcome of a poor business 
environment 
with the benefit of hindsight analysts say campeau paid too much 
when he laid out 66 billion for federated department stores inc 
in 1988 after spending 36 billion to get allied stores corp two 
years earlier 
campeau misjudged retail sales prospects and made unrealistic 
assumptions about cash flow at federated and allied analysts say 
robert campeau having demonstrated a knack for property 
development apparently thought that if he excelled at building 
stores he knew about what went on inside them 
by contrast macys seems to be balancing its financial and 
merchandising interests better but of course only time will tell 
whether its making the right decisions

us bankruptcy judge james yacos ruled 
friday that public service co of new hampshire can reorganize under 
federal law which means the company can bypass state regulators in 
setting electricity rates in its reorganization 
the decision was issued from the bench yacos said he would have 
a formal ruling next month 
under state law public service cannot charge ratepayers for the 
seabrook nuclear power plant until it operates commercially the 
idle plant has been finished for three years but lacks a fullpower 
commercial operating license public service was forced into us 
bankruptcy court 20 months ago under the financial stress of its 
lead share in the 62 billion plant 
under federal regulations the company could seek wholesale rate 
regulation bypassing state control 
nicholas ashooh a spokesman for the utility said however that 
public service has no intention of seeking federal regulation 
we plan to continue to talk with the state to achieve a 
mutually agreeable resolution he said 
martin gross the utilitys lawyer stressed that public service 
will try to reach an agreement with the state with state 
regulation 
larry smukler the states chief negotiator said the decision 
is adverse to us to the public interest of new hampshire 
he said the state will appeal the decision adding that the 
state of new hampshire will not let this federal regulation 
happen 
he said the states last resort will be to acquire the company 
voluntarily or involuntarily under the states recently enacted 
power authority legislation 
the decision is seen as giving the utility leverage in its 
negotiations with the state to set rates in the reorganized company 
yacos and parties to the bankruptcy were in federal bankruptcy 
court to discuss the plans filed for reorganizing public service 
yacos reassured critics from public services unsecured 
creditors committee who say new hampshire gov judd gregg is 
manipulating the value of the utility for political reasons 
in papers filed this past week with the court the creditors 
committee asked yacos to reassert strong control over the case 
the governor has given his endorsement to a buyout offer from new 
england electric system of westborough mass the endorsement 
superseded his earlier approval of an offer from northeast utilities 
of berlin conn 
united illuminating of new haven conn also seeks to merge with 
the troubled utility 
yacos will hold hearings on the proposals through midnovember 
when shareholders and creditors will vote if they choose one yacos 
likely will abide by their choice if they choose two he could pick 
one or find another solution 
public service believes it is the frontrunner because its 
reorganization plan has the creditors and shareholders approval 
the other plans do not the other utilities would have to reach 
such agreement and get approval from the us securities and 
exchange commission and the federal energy regulatory commission 
public service needs only state regulatory approval 
but new england electrics plan has greggs endorsement because 
it had the lowest rate projections the state however has no vote 
in bankruptcy court although yacos could consider the states 
wishes 
public service with almost 400000 customers filed for 
bankruptcy protection from creditors under the burden of its largest 
36 percent share of seabrook 
united illuminatings 175 percent is the secondlargest share of 
seabrook nees and northeast own smaller shares

allegheny international incs plan to emerge 
from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization has developed another 
hitch 
its latest plan the sixth it has filed in 19 months is being 
rewritten because senior bondholders and certain lenders insist on 
being repaid in cash rather than highrisk junk bonds 
that will force changes in other major parts of the plan 
although the amount of distributions to creditors and shareholders 
probably will not change said allegheny attorney bruce mccullough 
among the changes may be a revision in how the reorganized 
company a former conglomerate now best known for making sunbeam and 
oster appliances will pay retirees pensions and health benefits 
the company previously had proposed paying benefits from a fund 
to be financed by selling such noncore assets as real estate and 
its halfinterest in titanium metals corp of america that proposal 
may be scrapped mccullough said 
the pension benefit guaranty corp the government agency that 
insures pensions has objected to that arrangement as too uncertain 
robert sable an attorney for bondholders and other unsecured 
creditors said at a hearing in us bankruptcy court thursday that 
a revised plan could be ready in 20 or 30 days

anchor glass container corp directors have 
agreed to seek a buyer for the nations secondlargest glass maker 
in an attempt to thwart a unsolicited 280 million takeover bid from 
a mexican company 
anchor spokesman thomas davies on friday said several suitors 
have expressed interest in buying the entire company since the 
hostile bid was launched last month by a subsidiary of vitro sa 
which has extended its 20ashare offer until sept 28 
davies would not identify any of the parties interested in 
anchor whose board has urged shareholders to reject the offer by 
vitro one of mexicos major glass manufacturers 
a committee of anchor directors said a sale could be completed by 
the end of october 
obviously there cannot be any guarantee a sale will take 
place said davies 
vitro based in monterrey mexico announced friday its 
subsidiary thr corp has been tendered about 72 percent of the 
139 million anchor shares outstanding thr and its affiliates owned 
about 143 million shares before the tender offer was announced 
in trading friday on the new york stock exchange anchor rose 37 
cents a share to 1937 it was trading below 10 a share before 
the tender offer was announced 
in a news release late thursday a committee of anchor directors 
said that based upon the interests indicated to date by third 
parties it has determined that a sale of the company in its 
entirety is the method most likely to succeed in maximizing 
shareholder values at this time 
a vitro spokeswoman declined to comment on its plans or anchors 
announcement 
vitro has filed a suit in delaware chancery court challenging 
anchors antitakeover defenses 
anchor lost 85 million last year on sales of 9778 million 
while vitro earned more than 150 million on revenues of nearly 11 
billion

as american banks take careful steps to skirt the 
black hole of third world loans they seem to be stumbling blindly 
into another possible multibilliondollar debt trap highrisk junk 
bonds 
three big new york banks set aside extra money this past week to 
cover possible losses on loans to developing nations 
the moves by jp morgan amp co chase manhattan corp and 
manufacturers hanover corp reflected the deepening pessimism about 
the ability of the socalled lessdeveloped countries to repay the 
huge sums lent to them in the 1970s to spur economic growth 
while those bulletbiting measures suggested a more realistic 
view of the third world debt crisis some banking experts worried 
that the same mistakes might be repeated in the junk bond market for 
takeovers and refinancings 
prudentialbache securities inc for example recently issued an 
investor alert about the danger of bank stocks primarily because of 
the increasing involvement of many banks in socalled highly 
leveraged transactions which includes junkbond lending 
this is a large potential problem prudentialbache said 
exposures are meaningful and the loanloss risk is real 
keefe bruyette amp woods a wall street firm that follows the 
banking business said in a study that most big us banks had 
highly leveraged transaction exposure that exceeded 100 percent of 
their equity base many had more exposure in this area than they had 
in third world loans 
still the banks seem to be forging ahead into this new market 
partly because of a fundamental tenet in the banking business they 
get high interest rate margins and can charge big fees 
the trend seemed to accelerate this past week when bankers trust 
co announced plans to become the first bank to manage a corporate 
bond sale under recently relaxed federal rules on the types of 
business that banks can conduct bankers trust will manage a 150 
million issue of junk bonds 
one of the ironies banking analysts see in the bank move into 
junkbond lending is that they were reluctant to get involved in 
this business 10 years ago when it was new and highly profitable 
now they are among the last segments of the financial industry to 
see junk bonds as an opportunity even when there are signs that the 
junkbond market is faltering earlier this month junk prices 
plunged in the worst shakeout ever as retail giant campeau corp 
suffered a financing crisis 
i think part of what banks are doing is an irresistible urge to 
do what others do said james grant editor of grants interest 
rate observer and a frequent critic of the use of corporate debt 
in that theyre not so different from the washington press 
corp and others who do business in groups he said banks are 
following the leaders its a timehonored axiom that banks tend to 
catch on to trends at the tail end 
the insurance added against third world debt losses was 
nonetheless impressive morgan was the most aggressive of the three 
banks adding 2 billion to its reserves the move will result in a 
18 billion loss to the bank for the current financial quarter 
chase boosted its badloan reserves by a third to 29 billion 
and manufacturers hanover boosted its reserves by nearly 1 billion 
to total 24 billion for chase the move will result in a 
thirdquarter loss of 11 billion and manufacturers will take a 
775 million thirdquarter loss 
in other business and economic news this past week 
major airlines raised fares for business travelers and tightened 
cancellation penalties the move instigated by american airlines 
was seen as a way for airlines to absorb the cost of higher fuel 
prices and fall travel bargains offered during the summer 
goverment reports suggested the economy is growing modestly but 
the news did little to help the languishing stock and bond markets 
the labor department said consumer prices steadied in august the 
first time in three years they didnt rise signaling lower 
inflation the commerce department said consumer spending jumped 
sharply in august and the economy grew at a 25 percent rate in the 
second quarter 
another large us tiremaker agreed to sell itself to a foreign 
competitor french tire giant michelin group will buy uniroyal 
goodrich tire co in a 15 billion deal 
elsewhere among corporate buyers and sellers cosmetics concern 
noxell corp agred to merge with procter amp gamble co in a 13 
billion stock swap chrysler corp said it would sell nearly half 
its stake in japans mitsubishi motors corp for 592 million and

decisions that may be made at this weekends meeting of the finance 
ministers and central bankers from the group of seven major 
industrialized nations 
the group includes representatives from the united states japan 
west germany france britain italy and canada

rise as high as 555 an ounce before finding substantial resistance

fairly good resistance he said

matching an american airlines initiative that will raise some 
advancepurchase fares by more than 15 percent and double 
cancellation penalties 
united airlines and eastern airlines were among competitors of 
dallasbased american that followed its move on thursday delta air 
lines continental airlines pan am corp and trans world airlines 
matched americans increases 
we feel that it makes economic sense at this time said robin 
matell a spokesman for strikebound eastern at its miami 
headquarters 
northwest airlines hadnt decided yet and planned to study the 
matter over the weekend spokesman doug miller said from eagan minn 
were still holding out he said theyre going to think 
about it a little bit longer 
that most major airlines went along however virtually assured 
that the fare boosts would stick the increases proposed by 
american earlier this week will take effect sept 29 
under the changes the popular maxsaver cutrate fare often 
used by vacationers which must be purchased 14 days in advance 
will be increased by 10 to 20 round trip a maxsaver ticket on 
american between dallas and los angeles for example would jump 
from 338 to 358 round trip the maxsaver tickets would remain 
nonrefundable 
also fares will be raised on sevenday advance tickets by 30 to 
60 round trip the same dallaslos angeles round trip ticket bought 
seven days in advance would go from 378 to 438 the penalty for 
changing or canceling a reservation would double to 50 percent of 
the ticket price 
most of the carriers said they were matching the move mainly to 
stay competitive atlantabased delta also said a sharp rise in fuel 
prices along with a large number of discount tickets sold recently 
prompted it to follow suit 
american one of the nations largest carriers said it proposed 
the fare hikes in an effort to improve passenger yields an 
airlines yield reflects the average revenue from passengers for 
each mile flown and is a critical barometer of financial strength 
many airline industry analysts expect little improvement in 
yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990

president bush defended his capital gains tax 
cut friday but house speaker thomas s foley said support was 
growing for a rival democratic plan that would widen availability of 
individual retirement accounts and increase taxes on the wealthy to 
pay for it 
foley called the bush plan a positive harm to the economy 
but the president stood by his proposal and visited a maine tree 
farm to showcase a business that might benefit from the legislation 
at the morse tree farm near wells bush was urged by coowner 
martin morse to bring back the capital gains exclusion morse 
argued that tree farmers face substantial costs long delays and 
unique risks before there is any income from their crop 
one 12hour storm can wipe out 30 years work he told the 
president adding that he was sure some tree farmers in south 
carolina had been devastated by hurricane hugo 
bushs visit was meant to put pressure on lawmakers with timber 
in their districts profits from tree sales are considered capital 
gains under the bill and dropping the top tax rate would be a boon 
to those sellers 
ive heard some on the capitol hill deride this as just 
another tax cut for the rich but that simply is not the case 
bush said of his proposal before leaving washington 
on the contrary he told an agriculture department radio 
audience it would put money in the little guys pocket 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo joined the 
longdistance debate retorting from st louis the bush proposal 
doesnt put money in the little guys pocket it picks his 
pocket 
democrats fighting the bush plan said statistics show 80 percent 
of the benefits would go to people earning 100000 or more a year 
and foley said the democrats would keep pushing their own plan 
which would raise taxes on the rich to pay for the new ira tax 
breaks despite bushs promise to veto it 
i think we are doing very well in enlisting support foley 
told reporters we have a pretty good popular constituency 
foley cited a wall street journalnbc news poll that said 49 
percent of the people questioned prefer expansion of iras while 38 
percent favor bushs capital gains tax reduction idea the poll 
noted that the preference for iras was even greater among 
middleincome voters 53 percent to 35 percent 
a showdown vote on capital gains is expected next week during 
house debate on a huge budget bill that also carries such 
contentious issues as revising or repealing the medicare 
catastrophic illness plan and expanding federally subsidized child 
care 
in advance of the capital gains battle both sides agreed it was 
close and they were fighting over the conservative mostly southern 
branch of the democratic party including the group that pushed a 
bushbacked plan through the house ways and means committee the 
house republican minority is united in supporting bush 
six democrats sided with the ways and means panels 13 
republicans to pass an amendment that would cut the maximum capital 
gains rate from 33 percent to 196 percent it would then rebound to 
28 percent beginning in 1992 but no tax would be levied on gains 
unless they exceeded inflation 
in their hunt for votes the democratic leadership included a 
small capital gains cut in their own plan setting the top rate at 
28 percent but their main feature was a return of ira tax breaks 
the democratic proposal would eliminate restrictions passed in 
1986 that keep many workers especially in the upper middle class 
from having a deductible ira plan under the new plan the money 
could be withdrawn before retirement without paying a penalty if 
used to finance the down payment on a first home or for college 
education 
to pay for the iras and reduce the deficit the democrats would 
raise tax rates for the nations wealthiest 600000 couples and 
individuals 
under current law the tax rate for uppermiddleincome americans 
is 33 percent but it drops back to 28 percent for those at the 
uppermost income levels the democrats would raise that top rate to 
33 percent 
while bush was followed by an entourage of reporters and 
television cameramen the house democratic leadership worked to log 
some television time including appearances on weekend talk shows 
i think that there may be some groups that are going to support 
the ira proposal and may even do it with television and radio 
foley said but we have no plans to buy television time he said

procter amp gamble co the consumer products powerhouse will 
enter the roughandtumble world of womens cosmetics with its 13 
billion acquisition of noxell corp maker of the no 1 cover girl 
cosmetics line 
the stockswap deal announced friday which was approved 
unanimously by the boards of both companies also will add noxells 
noxzema skin cream clarion makeup and lestoil household cleaner to 
bulging pampg arsenal of megabrands 
the consolidating cosmetics industry already had grabbed the 
spotlight this year this summer unilever the britishdutch 
consumer giant completed a 155 billion acquisition of the faberge 
and elizabeth arden lines of cosmetics and toiletries following 
that deal avon products inc successfully rebuffed takeover 
overtures from rival doortodoor marketer amway corp 
the procter amp gamble merger announcement sent noxell soaring 10 
to 3125 friday in overthecounter trading on the new york stock 
exchange pampg fell 2 to 11987 
under terms of the agreement pampg will exchange 0272 shares of 
its common stock for each of noxells 405 million common and class 
b shares in a taxfree transaction based on the closing price for 
pampg the transaction would have a value of 3260 per noxell share 
noxell based in hunt valley md will be operated as a pampg 
unit the 75yearold company has 2200 employees and annual revenue 
of roughly 522 million from sales in the united states canada and 
europe 
analysts applauded the move as strategically sound while pampg has 
a number of successful skin care products including oil of olay 
bain de soleil and clearasil it has no cosmetics lines 
pampg has done a lot of work in skin care technology and this 
will add another leg to their delivery systems said jay freedman 
of kidder peabody amp co 
he said cover girl is the no 1 mass market cosmetics line in the 
united states 
for its part noxell was attracted by pampgs resources for 
research and development last year pampg spent more than 650 million 
on research and product development 
in addition pampg can add international marketing support which 
should enhance the longterm growth of these brands said john 
smale pampgs chairman and chief executive 
noxell chairman and chief executive george bunting jr said in a 
statement an association with the right company appeared the 
ideal way to achieve this and procter amp gamble is clearly the right 
company 
pampg which is based in cincinnati reported worldwide sales of 
214 billion last year among its brands are ivory soap crest 
toothpaste pampers and luvs disposable diapers tide laundry 
detergent duncan hines cookies folgers coffee crisco cooking oil 
and pringles potato chips 
known for its slow but steady approach to business pampg has had a 
healthy appetite for acquisitions this decade 
since 1981 the company has spent more than 3 billion buying up 
stakes in 16 companies worldwide among its larger deals pampg 
acquired richardsonvicks international maker of vaporub vicks 
cough drops and formula 44 in 1985 for 12 billion 
that same year the company acquired gd searles 
overthecounter pharmaceuticals business for more than 300 
million adding to its battery of healthcare products that includes 
peptobismol and metamucil fiber supplement 
like other pampg buyouts the noxell deal was forged as a friendly 
transaction pampg does not plan any immediate significant changes at 
noxell although some employee relocations may become necessary 
the merger is subject to approval by noxell shareholders the 
federal trade commission and the securities and exchange commission 
approval by pampg shareholders is not required because the company 
has sufficient numbers of authorized stock shares not yet issued to 
provide the merger basis pampg spokesman william dobson said 
the merger should be completed by years end dobson said
