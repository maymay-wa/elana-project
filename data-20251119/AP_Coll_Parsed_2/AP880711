earlier monday an explosion killed two men and destroyed a car 
parked near a marina where the cruise ship the city of poros was 
to dock in the athens seaside surburb of paleo faliron 
a senior greek police officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity said we are assuming the two attacks are connected 
but theres no hard evidence for that so far 
he said no one had claimed responsibility for the ship attack 
a merchant marine ministry spokesman said 400 of the 471 people 
aboard were accounted for but some who jumped ship during the 
attack were still missing police earlier said 571 passengers were 
on the ship 
people who jumped overboard to escape are still being brought 
in by other ships so we dont yet know how may still be missing

the ministry spokesman who also demanded anonymity said no 
americans were among the injured a list of passengers was not 
available however harbor officials said no americans were on the 
ship 
the ships owner a kyrtatos could not be reached and the 
companys central athens office remained closed after the attack a 
merchant marine ministry official said the company had not provided 
the ships manifest

poros was returning from a oneday cruise to the islands of poros 
hydra and aegina

ships deck at least three of the dead were foreigners only one 
of the dead was immediately identified as the ships first mate 
antonis demaizis 
merchant marine minister evangelos yiannopoulos condemned the 
attack as a barbarous action of a particularly hateful kind and 
said coast guard patrols were searching harbors and marinas for the 
speedboat 
the ship had left the island of aegina in the saronic gulf and 
was steaming back to the trocadero marina in paleo faliron port 
police said passengers were sunning themselves on the deck when 
the gunmen opened fire 
a swedish passenger who asked not to be identified said he saw a 
swarthy man in his early 20s pull an automatic weapon from his 
backpack and open fire as he ran along the deck 
then he threw two hand grenades and fire broke out and the 
deck caved in there were burning sheets of metal falling on the 
people in the saloon below said the tourist who was bruised but 
otherwise unhurt 
passengers jean wogewda of lorient france and his wife 
natalie were both wounded in the gunfire wogewda was shot in both 
legs but managed to crawl away 
i was on deck when i heard automatic fire i turned around and 
was thrown into the air by the impact of the bullets hitting my 
legs wogewda said as he lay in a piraeus hospital 
i saw the man who was shooting and i couldnt believe it and 
thought it was a joke when i saw others falling to the deck it 
turned out to be real 
i only saw one gunman as he reloaded his weapon then he 
hurled a grenade at the ships smoke stack setting off a fire then 
he approached my group and started firing at us again he said 
police said three gunmen took part in the attack 
wogewda said panic set in and many passengers scattered quickly 
for cover others grabbed life jackets and jumped over the railing 
and into the water 
in the confusion the gunmen slipped off the liner boarded a 
speedboat that had pulled alongside and sped away police said 
ships in the vicinity including greek navy destroyers on 
maneuvers rushed to the area plucked passengers from the warm 
mediterranean waters and took them to the port of piraeus 16 miles 
away 
the 208foot city of poros smoke pouring from its side steamed 
to piraeus at full speed 
police said the two men killed in the explosion that destroyed 
the parked car were believed to be of arab origin the car had been 
rented to a 36yearold lebanese man hamoud al hamid police said 
the car contained explosives hand grenades and automatic 
weapons police said 
an amateur photographer aboard a hydrofoil passing near the city 
of poros after the gunmen fled shot film that was screened on greek 
tv the film showed a helicoper hovering over the liner and at 
least 10 smaller vessels coming to the ships aid 
two weeks ago the american military attache to greece navy 
capt william e nordeen was assassinated by a boobytrapped car 
that exploded as he drove past in his bulletproof car on his way 
to work the terrorist organization november 17 claimed 
responsibility 
four palestinian terrorists on oct 7 1985 hijacked the 
italian luxury liner achille lauro during a mediterranean cruise 
the terrorists killed american passenger leon klinghoffer and threw 
the body and the wheelchair of the 69yearold invalid overboard 
italian courts later convicted seven palestinians of planning or 
carrying out the attack including mohammed abbas the leader of 
the palestine liberation front who was tried in absentia and 
sentenced to life imprisonment 
abbas was on a plane carrying the four hijackers out of egypt 
when us fighter planes forced the egyptian airliner to land in 
sicily where they were arrested italian magistrates said then 
they didnt have enough evidence to hold abbas and let him leave 
the country oct 12

the sandinista government on monday 
ordered us ambassador richard melton and seven other american 
embassy officials to leave the country within 72 hours accusing 
them of state terrorism 
it also closed the opposition newspaper la prensa for 15 days 
shut down the roman catholic radio station radio catolica and 
arrested an opposition leader 
us secretary of state george p shultz on tuesday called the 
expulsions order an absolute outrage he did not say what 
action he planned to take 
he spoke in manila while on an asian tour 
melton notified the state department at 7 pm that he and the 
seven staff members were given 72 hours to leave nicaragua said 
department press officer rudi boone in washington boone said the 
department was drafting a statement 
the developments came one day after police clashed with 
thousands of demonstrators at an antisandinista rally 
president daniel ortega on sunday described the demonstration as 
being part of a us plan to undermine his leftist government and 
vowed to act with force against violations of public order 
foreign minister miguel descoto announced the decision to expel 
the americans he said they were engaging in activities 
complementary to the state terrorism the administration of us 
president ronald reagan is carrying out against nicaragua 
descoto said he called melton to his office monday afternoon to 
advise him of the decision which declared the ambassador and the 
seven others unwelcome descoto also said he gave melton a sealed 
letter advising shultz of the expulsions 
speaking with reporters at a foreign ministry news conference 
descoto called melton a robot of the maniacal assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs elliott abrams 
descotos letter identified the seven other us diplomats as 
john e hope first secretary in charge of economic and commercial 
affairs hugh v simon jr first secretary delvin junker and 
david nolan both second secretaries john s creamer and aubrey a 
carlson third secrtaries and vice consuls and robert bruce 
murray an assistant attache 
descoto said us embassy officials were at sundays opposition 
demonstration in nandaime about 40 miles south of managua 
melton he said came to nicaragua in his mind to fill a 
leadership vacuum in this country and he became confused 
the government earlier accused melton of carrying out a 
destabilization plan against nicaragua 
melton filled the post left vacant since july 1987 when 
ambassador harry bergold returned to washington 
it was believed to be the first time nicaragua had declared an 
american ambassador persona non grata 
on june 6 1983 the government expelled three us diplomats 
accused of taking part in an alleged plot to poison descoto the 
united states responded by closing several nicaraguan consulates in 
the united states 
melton presented his credentials here in may when he arrived in 
nicaragua april 12 melton 52 said it was a decisive moment in 
usnicaraguan relations 
la prensa the only opposition daily in nicaragua reopened oct 
1 1987 after being shut down by the government for more than a 
year 
the government allowed la prensa to reopen as part of its 
efforts to comply with a regional peace plan that ortega and the 
four other central american presidents signed in august 1987 radio 
catolica shut down in jan 1 1986 for failing to broadcast 
ortegas yearend message to the nation also was allowed to reopen 
last october 
in closing radio catolica the interior ministry accused the 
station of inciting to violence disorder and lack of respect for 
constitutional government 
monsignor bismarck carballo the stations director called the 
order unjust and arbitrary 
an official in the interior ministry press office speaking on 
condition of anonymity said police arrested secretarygeneral 
miriam arguello of the conservative party for being the principal 
instigator of yesterdays events in nandaime 
pedro joaquin chamorro a director of the usbacked rebels 
known as contras said in miami earlier monday the sandinistas 
are demonstrating once again that they are not prepared for 
democracy 
chamorro said the contras have been negotiating in good faith 
with the sandinistas but that continued repression inside 
nicaragua would leave them little choice but to return to armed 
struggle 
police arrested 42 people including carballos brother in 
breaking up sundays antigovernment protest an interior 
department statement said monday the march had been authorized by 
sandinista officials beforehand 
police said 10 officers were hurt and that protesters threw 
rocks at police which responded with tear gas 
witnesses said police started the fracas 
the sandinistas came to power in a popular revolution in july 
1979 that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist proamerican 
somoza dynasty 
the us government backed trained and supplied the contras 
since 1981 in their fight against the sandinistas 
this is to show the people want democracy ms arguello said 
before the fighting broke out later a civilian struck her with a 
large club as a group of police applauded 
the march was held to protest government economic policies 
the sandinistas have been losing popularity because of the 
shattered economy and the ongoing war

a vote tally released monday gave the 
government partys candidate for president a majority but the slow 
count fed rumors of party infighting and fraud 
interior secretary manuel bartlett said early monday that carlos 
salinas de gortari of the governing institutuional revolutionary 
party known as the pri for its spanish initials had 5289 percent 
of the votes counted 
cuauhtemoc cardenas of the leftist national democratic front was 
second with 2910 percent and conservative national action party 
candidate manuel clouthier third with 1668 percent bartlett said 
election officials said 1324 million votes had been counted from 
wednesdays election but did not say how many of the nations 38 
million registered voters cast ballots 
pri officials in cardenas home state of michoacan conceded that 
cardenas won 58 percent of the vote there to salinas 25 percent 
cardenas was a popular governor of the state from 198086 
party officials in mexico city also said privately cardenas was 
expected to win in the federal capital 
cardenas has claimed national victory and clouthier has claimed 
to be ahead in the vote both accuse the government and pri of 
fraud 
salinas had claimed victory before any results were announced 
mondays release of results provoked heated protests from 
opposition members of the federal election commission 
they contended at an open committee meeting that the count gave 
the impression of a salinas victory before the information had been 
verified by district committees and the rest of the official 
computing process 
bartlett the commission chairman retorted public opinion 
demands information lets give information 
officials said the commission still was receiving results from 
district commissions on elections for the chamber of deputies 
which by law has precedence in counting over the senate and 
presidential races 
partial official returns gave 170 of the 500 seats in the lower 
house to the pri 13 to national action party and two to parties 
that support cardenas 
clouthier on monday said irregularities in this years elections 
made for the most fraudulent results in history 
he the violations he alleged lastminute changes of polling 
place locations ink used to mark voters thumbs was not indelible 
brigades of voters who went from precinct to precinct and people 
allowed to vote without showing credentials 
clouthier asked a nationwide referendum be held july 3031 on 
the validity of the elections 
the main source of frustration in the slow count was the 
election commissions promise before the voting that returns would 
be reported the same day officials said the commissions computer 
broke down late wednesday and has not been used since 
districts began their official counts at midnight saturday a 
time set by law 
opposition parties kept vigils outside district offices and the 
federal election commision in mexico city in an effort to prevent 
manipulation of the results 
even officials of the pri which has controlled the major 
government offices since its founding in 1929 acknowledge the 
count is unusually slow their excuses includes the computer 
problem weather and a large turnout 
three theories have emerged about what has gone wrong fighting 
within the pri negotiations with the opposition and fraud by the 
governing party 
bartlett was an important rival of salinas for the presidential 
nomination salinas one of the partys young technocrats has 
said he prefers a smaller margin of victory that is credible but 
the old guard is said to favor maintaining the partys usual 70 
percent or so by whatever means necessary 
a backstage tradeoff perhaps an acceptance of salinas victory 
in exchange for more opposition congressional seats would be a 
typical pri tactic a close associate of salinas said there had 
been conversations but not negotiations clouthier and cardenas 
say they would not make such trades 
fraud by the pri and government has been common in mexican 
election despite laws officials say are designed to guard against 
cheating 
the strong opposition vote and postelection mobilization to 
demand that it be respected reflect a political awakening in mexico 
cardenas and clouthier have urged that protests be peaceful and 
legal unless the authorities provoke violence

vice president george bush whose 
presidential campaign was embarrassed by the legal difficulties 
surrounding attorney general edwin meese iii plans to propose a 
tough new conflictofinterest code for public officials aides say 
bushs proposals still being drafted will build upon his 
previous advocacy of a strong ethics office within the white house 
according to aides who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
the vice president the certain republican presidential nominee 
will spell out his proposals in a speech later this month in new 
mexico to the business and professional womens association the 
aides said 
with the announcement last week by meese that he would resign 
this summer bush will make ethics in government a major thrust of 
his fall presidential campaign the aides said 
meese said he would resign even while claiming that an 
independent counsels report had vindicated him of any wrongdoing 
meeses legal difficulties had been a source of concern for the 
bush campaign and sources said that bush was relieved that the 
attorney general had decided to step down in a short statement 
last week bush praised meese for doing the right thing in 
resigning 
now with the question of meese resolved bush hopes to take the 
offensive on the ethics issue campaign sources said 
in addition to the vice presidents proposal of a strict 
conflict of interest code bush campaign officials are seeking to 
have a denunciation of house speaker jim wright dtexas included 
in the 1988 gop platform the sources said 
bush and other republicans have been outspoken in their 
criticism of wright over alleged financial irregularities in the 
allocation of proceeds from wrights book of political reflections 
while details of bushs conflictofinterest proposal are still 
sketchy aides said the plan would clearly spell out rules that 
future cabinet members and other presidential appointees would have 
to follow 
bush associates said the vice president was stung by accusations 
last week by democratic chairman paul kirk that he had used public 
funds to pay for campaign appearances 
bush aides deny the allegations asserting that campaign funds 
have paid for the trips cited by kirk the bush aides said the kirk 
allegations had further motivated bush to propose a strong 
conflictofinterest code 
the vice president spent most of his weekend here at his 
oceanside home resting 
in his sole public appearance bush told a lithuanian festival 
that recent reforms undertaken by the soviet union raise hopes that 
the soviets may relax their grip on eastern european nations 
this is a time of change in the soviet union and for the 
lithuanian people it is a time for hope bush said 
he spoke at a lithuanian franciscan monastery that was 
established in 1947 by franciscan fathers who escaped from 
lithuania when that country fell to invading soviet troops 
the united states has always condemned the violation of your 
national sovereignty and in the years ahead we will never condone 
the forced occupation of lithuania by the soviet union bush said 
he challenged the soviets to make good on their pledges of 
reform by allowing more freedoms in eastern europe 
but if this is a time for hope it is not a time for 
complacency or weakness bush said 
only the united states is strong enough and committed enough 
to stand up for the freedoms of oppressed people all over the 
world he said

democrat michael dukakis recognizing that 
george bush has succeeded in recent efforts to tar his image has 
begun countering with increasing attacks on the republican vice 
president 
even with the question of selecting a running mate hanging over 
him and obscuring broader campaign themes dukakis has expanded and 
strengthened his criticisms of bush 
campaigning across the west in his final preconvention swing 
this past weekend dukakis hit at bush with accusations that his 
notax pledge was a sham ridiculed him on plantclosing 
legislation needled him for backing off his proclaimed opposition 
to offshore drilling and even associated him through the 
administration with the pentagon procurement scandal 
while it was sometimes delivered in dukakis softspoken 
understated manner or buried deep in his customary stump speeches 
dukakis comments were the result of a decision within the campaign 
to be more forceful in answering a month of attacks from bush 
the vice president has been going after dukakis regularly on his 
massachusetts record saying his opponent supported tax increases 
and furloughs for convicted murderers 
while theyre throwing high inside fastballs you need to 
throw some brushback pitches too said campaign adviser kirk 
odonnell using a baseball analogy you dont want to see bush 
getting his spikes in so deep he controls the plate youve got to 
keep him honest 
a washington political hand brought in to advise the dukakis 
campaign on communicating its message odonnell traveled with the 
massachusetts governor last week and was advocating a toughened 
response to the vice president 
the move which other aides referred to as a decision to 
engage the vice president is a result of bushs apparent 
success in his own attacks 
bush has been banging him around on specific issues to try to 
paint him as a liberal and with some success odonnell said 
in fact the dukakis campaign appears in the midst of a critical 
transition period as it continues to grapple with jesse jackson 
and convention politics but at the same time points ahead to the 
real campaign against the republicans 
after enjoying a lofty doubledigit lead over bush in public 
opinion polls during much of the spring polls in the last several 
weeks have shown a narrower lead 
while the change is in part due to the end of the primary 
season during which dukakis had the aura of a winner every week 
odonnells comments suggested a recognition within the dukakis 
campaign that some of bushs darts had hit their mark 
dukakis in an interview with the los angeles times said he had 
concluded he will have to match bushs negative attacks on him and 
the massachusetts governor agreed with the suggestion the fall 
presidential campaign as a result could be nasty 
yes its unfortunate dukakis said but as i did in the 
primary you give fair warning you try to keep it positive but if 
attacks continue youve got to respond 
dukakis sharpest response has been on the issue of bushs 
promise to oppose new taxes an assertion bush has used to depict 
his democratic rival as likely to raise taxes if elected 
dukakis has pointed to bushs support for legislation on health 
care and trade that would raise taxes and fees for some americans 
saying both candidates support the changes but that bush isnt 
being candid in acknowledging they are taxes 
back where i come from if it looks like a duck and walks like 
a duck and quacks like a duck its a duck dukakis said 
ridiculing bush in los angeles 
i want the vice president to stand up and tell the truth 
which is that he and the president supported a 6 billion tax 
increase he said sunday 
dukakis has been critical of the reagan administration and bush 
by association for months over attorney general edwin meese the 
irancontra affair the war on drugs and support for panama 
strongman manuel noriega 
but he displayed a reluctance to engage in real responses to 
bush and during the late primaries responded more than once by 
mildly saying bush should quit criticizing others 
hes now looking beyond the convention said dukakis press 
secretary dayton duncan hes starting to really look forward to 
it being him and bush

as democrats start packing their bags for 
atlanta and the coronation of michael dukakis ohio democratic 
congresswoman mary rose oakar is hoping they leave one item behind 
overconfidence about beating george bush 
everyone thinks hes sort of wimpy i dont see him that 
way oakar said in an interview hes a war hero wait until 
you see them pull all that stuff out 
i have some great anxieties that we think this is our year and 
were not going to have the zeal and lust to win that we should 
have said oakar the vice chair of the house democratic caucus 
which dukakis will appear before on wednesday 
oakar is worried the vice president is already making moves to 
shore up relations with two groups never totally comfortable with 
president reagan women and the elderly 
the sixterm cleveland congresswoman also a leader of the 
partys platform committee said the image of bush as a preppy 
milquetoast doesnt square with the popular and savvy gop 
politician she has come to know on capitol hill 
at the annual house gym parties where bush shows up to have his 
picture taken with democrats and republicans alike hes one of 
the boys said oakar 
frankly on a onetoone basis he is not the socalled 
elitist type that he appears to be he is much more appealing 
in a smaller crowd than he is on dan rathers show she said 
i think george bush is much more formidable than a lot of 
people give him credit for the liberal congresswoman said 
ohio with its 23 electoral votes is rated by both sides as a 
key battleground ohio sen john glenn has figured prominently in 
speculation about possible running mates for dukakis 
bush has been laying the groundwork for reconciling all of the 
problems reagan always had such as the womens problem and the 
elderly issue two areas that ought to be natural democratic 
constituencies oakar said

attorney general edwin meese iii is 
complaining about news leaks of a special prosecutors report less 
than a week after he declared that the document vindicated him 
meese who has announced he will resign by early august said 
sunday that whoever leaked details of the report should be held in 
contempt of court 
meese also denied a claim by his former deputy that he offered 
his close friend e robert wallach a job in the justice department 
while meese was aware wallach was under criminal investigation 
wallach a lawyer and longtime meese confidant is awaiting 
trial in new york on a racketeering indictment accusing him and two 
others of taking illegal payments from wedtech corp a bronx 
ny defense contractor to influence government officials 
independent counsel james mckay filed his report on meese in 
federal court last week an indication that he does not plan to 
seek indictments of the attorney general the report is still under 
court seal but both meese and president reagan maintained last 
week that it vindicates the attorney general 
however the new york times on saturday quoted portions of the 
report raising ethical questions about meeses conduct including 
the job offer to wallach 
the times said the report gives a detailed account of 
discussions between meese and wallach about the possibility of 
wallach joining the justice department although meese denied to 
both the fbi and a grand jury that he made wallach a job offer in 
both instances meese later changed his testimony acknowledging 
some discussion of a job for wallach the times said quoting the 
report 
at no time whatsoever was there any thought whatsoever of bob 
wallach taking any job in the justice department while there was 
any possibility he was under criminal investigation meese said 
sunday on nbctvs meet the press 
meese acknowledged however that there had been some discussion 
of a possible job for wallach which went out of my mind after i 
found out about the criminal investigation 
but the special prosecutors report according to the times 
concluded that the job offer remained open even after meese became 
aware of the investigation on april 6 1987 
it quoted thendeputy attorney general arnold i burns as 
telling investigators he was astonished when meese told him 
after that date that the offer to make wallach counselor to the 
attorney general was still good 
the report said that meese on april 17 1987 denied to the fbi 
that wallach was being considered for a job but four days later 
called the fbi to correct his statement acknowledging that a job 
had been offered two weeks earlier the times reported 
meese also told a grand jury last october that he had not 
offered wallach a job since july 1985 but quickly corrected his 
statement when he was shown a copy of an fbi report on his previous 
statements 
the times also said the report showed meese was closely 
involved in discussions about a proposed 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline it said he gave conflicting accounts of whether he knew 
of alleged plans to have pipeline funds funneled directly to 
israels labor party in a bribe scheme

europe and the united states are beginning to 
adopt similar strategies for disposing of wastes spurred by common 
recognition that theres not enough space to bury it all and 
burning causes too much pollution 
for centuries western europeans marveled at the luxury of 
available land in north america says a report from the 
nonprofit institute for local selfreliance this luxury allowed 
for ready access to disposal sites for solid wastes as well as for 
a casual disregard of the maintenance of soil fertility for 
agriculture 
but as that luxury decreases new methods are being tried 
a company in oakland calif has long collected wine bottles 
washed them and sold them back to vintners at less than the cost of 
new bottles now the practice is spreading to michigan 
massachusetts and new york 
italy has passed a law that in 1991 will ban all packaging 
unless it can be recycled or will decompose naturally 
the institute report favors recycling but says little has been 
invested in it and that some professional planners are skeptical 
neil seldman one of the authors nevertheless sees recycling as 
the path that must be followed 
youll have the bottle manufacturers asking for a national 
bottle bill because they dont want to have to deal with 50 
different bottle bills so i would say that within a few years we 
will have that he predicted 
state bottle bills typically require consumers to pay a small 
deposit which is refunded by shops when the empties are returned 
the bills have been strongly opposed by business interests 
especially container manufacturers 
brenda platt the institutes staff engineer said that some 
communities states and governments are now setting a threetiered 
set of priorities for disposing of waste 
first source reduction or discouraging the use of 
materials that become waste seldman cited a proposal in 
philadelphia that would put one tax on bottles and a double tax on 
secondary packaging the cardboard or plastic that goes around 
a sixpack 
source separation the separate handling of different kinds 
of waste in both homes and businesses ms platt spoke approvingly 
of a three container system in some communities of west 
germany with a green container for one type of waste 
if you dont put your recyclables in the green can theyll 
take away the green container and give you maybe a black one and 
youre labeled as the slob of the neighborhood she said peer 
pressure can do a lot to encourage recycling 
largescale burning and burial of waste only as a last resort 
iowa new york the netherlands sweden and italy have 
endorsed this hierarchy she said 
the report says the average american produces about 1300 pounds 
of waste annually compared with a little over 1100 pounds for the 
average west german the us figure is for 1986 the german figure 
for 1984 
disposal methods vary widely the united states burns only about 
5 percent of its waste while switzerland burns more than 60 
percent the united states still can bury nearly 85 percent while 
mountainous switzerland can find space for less than 20 percent 
switzerland recycles over 20 percent or uses it as compost for 
farmers twice the proportion in the united states 
the institute is a research organization that serves local 
governments citizen groups and industry the west german 
governments marshall fund of the united states financed the study

in agriculture somebody always gets more or 
less than the next guy and the government says drought is no 
exception 
the drought will result in a substantial redistribution of 
earnings the interagency drought policy committee said in its 
july report to president reagan farmers outside drought areas 
will reap higher incomes from higher crop prices 
but the report added farmers in drought areas will have 
reduced quantities of crops to sell and will also receive smaller 
income support deficiency payments as a result of rising prices 
one of the tasks facing government is to ensure the fairness of 
drought relief so that some farmers dont harvest 
taxpayerfinanced windfalls while others see their incomes shrivel 
in the dry winds of summer 
farmers who lose tomato crops may feel that they are just as 
deserving as those whose corn is lost to july heat so congress 
and the administration are looking at ways to help all distressed 
farmers including those who grow nonprogram crops which are 
not covered by acreage controls price supports and deficiency 
payments 
some advocate using money saved from lower deficiency payments 
and other reduced program benefits to spread among droughtsavaged 
farmers 
overall the agriculture department had expected to spend around 
17 billion on those commodity operations but now because of 
droughtinduced higher prices the deficiency payments will be 
much less the drought has already chewed across some of the areas 
that have benefited most from the annual subsidies 
according to usda budget officials the net spending for 
commodity programs in the 1988 fiscal year that runs through sept 
30 was projected at nearly 177 billion down from 224 billion 
in 1987 and the record of 258 billion in 1986 
for fiscal 1989 or the year that will begin this oct 1 
outlays were projected at 171 billion that is the money for the 
most part that will cover the deficiency payments and other 
benefits farmers will get for 1988 production 
revised estimates have not been officially announced by usda 
but some private analysts suggest that outlays may drop to a range 
of 8 billion to 12 billion depending on the final outcome of the 
1988 harvests and market prices 
the departments economic research service working from those 
and other sources looks at farm income on a calendar year basis 
so the figures are not exactly comparable however the agency also 
has been revising its estimates to reflect drought impact 
for example according to agency economists direct government 
payments to farmers were initially expected to be in the range of 
13 billion to 15 billion in calendar 1988 down from about 17 
billion in 1987 that range has since been trimmed to 12 billion 
to 14 billion and further adjustments are expected 
government subsidies in the form of direct payments including 
cash and redeemable paymentinkind certificates have made up a 
larger part of farmers overall cash income in recent years 
in calendar 1987 for example when net cash income was a record 
56 billion direct federal payments totaled 17 billion 
according to other figures provided by usda at the request of a 
reporter about 10 states normally account for nearly twothirds of 
the total commodity payments each year a few move in and out of 
the top 10 but analysts say the proportion continues about the 
same each year 
in 1987 the top 10 states collected about 106 billion or 
more than 63 percent of payments nationally totaling more than 
167 billion all have been hit by this years drought 
iowa farmers headed the list in 1987 with farm subsidies 
totaling about 191 billion others in the top 10 included 
illinois 148 billion texas 144 billion nebraska 127 
billion minnesota 119 billion kansas 9654 million north 
dakota 719 million indiana 6702 million south dakota 5039 
million and missouri 4898 million

a battle is brewing behind the scenes on 
capitol hill as three new england lawmakers fight for a single 
vacancy on the powerful house appropriations committee 
the struggle has taken on more importance than the usual 
jockeying for coveted committee assignments because it pits two 
massachusetts democrats who had been mentioned as possible 
successors to massachusetts gov michael s dukakis in 1990 reps 
joseph p kennedy ii and chester g atkins 
kennedy atkins and rep bruce a morrison dconn began 
lobbying fellow democrats for their support in april just days 
after rep edward p boland dmass announced he would not seek a 
19th term according to another massachusetts democrat rep brian 
donnelly 
donnelly a member of the house steering and policy committee 
which recommends members for new committee assignments confirmed 
information obtained from various congressional sources 
donnelly and other lawmakers said the house democratic 
leadership has all but promised to keep bolands appropriations 
seat within new england but only if the regions democratic 
members can rally behind one candidate if they cannot they risk 
losing the seat 
seats on the appropriations committee are among the most coveted 
in congress because of its control over spending committee members 
are well positioned to include federal money for favored home state 
projects 
many consider atkins the favorite his home state of 
massachusetts boasts a majority of the regions democratic house 
members and he could reasonably expect an added amount of loyalty 
stemming from his position as chairman of the state party the 
secondterm congressman is stressing his experience as chairman of 
the massachusetts senate ways and means committee 
kennedy is only a freshman and it would be unusual for a member 
so low on the seniority ladder to secure an appropriations seat 
but kennedy is considered by some observers to be a wild card 
because of his familys legacy 
theres no question when youre a kennedy you bring special 
advantages to the process thats a fact of life said morrison 
who works with kennedy on the house banking committee he has 
more clout than the average freshman 
kennedy declined to comment 
morrison has been lobbying members aggressively perhaps in the 
hopes that he could put together a coalition of connecticut 
democrats and other nonmassachusetts members while kennedy and 
atkins split the massachusetts vote one lawmaker suggested 
the battle has already had ramifications on the massachusetts 
gubernatorial race that is expected to develop for 1990 if dukakis 
does not lose his quest for the presidency and decide to seek a 
fourth term at the statehouse 
atkins recent statement that he would not run for governor in 
1990 was seen by many democrats as an attempt to convince house 
speaker jim wright and new england lawmakers that he intends to 
stay in the house and therefore is deserving of the appropriations 
seat 
thats correct atkins said they wanted to be assured 
that whoever gets that seat that they have a longterm commitment 
to the house thats the kind of committee where when you get on it 
and you work you become more effective over time my colleagues 
wanted to know that i was going to be in a position where i could 
do that 
atkins in a recent interview stressed that the competition has 
been friendly and that all three members have discussed the 
position among themselves 
the campaign is being run in a very lowkey way so that we can 
avoid any kind of divisions that would make it difficult to keep 
the seat in the region he said weve been able to maintain 
very excellent relations with each other and cooperation with each 
other its very polite genteel and low key 
donnelly said the contest is very much still up in the air 
most members are not going to make commitments until after the 
elections because these are very difficult personal decisions to 
make these are not political decisions theyre personal 
decisions he said

sen john glenn and rep george miller rent 
rooms but thats about as far as that particular comparison can go 
glenn the former astronaut from ohio who is under consideration 
for the democratic vice presidential nomination says his interests 
in two hotel management companies brought him income of 287349 
last year 
at the other end of the lodging business miller a california 
democrat collected between 5000 and 15000 in 1987 from three 
house colleagues who rented rooms in his townhouse near the capitol 
these are some of the details contained in 1987 financial 
disclosure statements filed recently by glenn miller and a handful 
of other lawmakers who received permission to submit their reports 
after the may 15 deadline 
glenns report which like others gave most information only in 
broad dollar ranges showed that he remained one of the wealthiest 
members of the senate which is frequently called the 
millionaires club 
listing a myriad of investments he reported assets of from 
7753163 to more than 15 million with liabilities at no more 
than 865000 glenn said his income last year was between 
1280906 and 2704480 including his congressional pay of 
87483 and marine corps pension of 16584 
miller reported earnings last year of from 122397 to 132397 
including his official salary 29914 in speaking and writing fees 
and rent from roommates marty russo dill charles schumer 
dny and leon panetta dcalif 
millers only listed assets were his houses in washington and 
martinez calif worth a combined 200000 to 500000 his 
liabilities mortgages on the properties were from 60000 to 
115000 
his only reported gift was a membership in the big c 
athletic club in concord calif worth 1000 
patrick leahy the vermont democrat who chairs the senate 
agriculture committee said he received 39927 from speaking and 
writing fees with at least 24959 coming from farm organizations 
and agribusinesses 
he also got free trips from the chicago board of trade the farm 
commodities trading market but the windy city wasnt on the 
itinerary one board of trade trip took leahy and his son to west 
palm beach fla another transported the senator and his wife to 
london 
sen dan quayle rind reported 49255 in speaking and 
writing honoraria in 1987 his free trips paid for by business 
groups took him to the mountain resort of white sulphur springs 
wva sun valley idaho ft myers fla monterey calif and to 
salt lake city for a charity skiing event 
among quayles reported gifts were 287 worth of golf 
merchandise at the kemper open in suburban maryland and 825 in 
golfing gear from a constituent professional golfer fuzzy zoeller 
of new albana ind 
the depressed condition of us oil and gas production was 
evidenced by the disclosure statement filed by sen malcolm wallop 
rwyo his petroleum leases on at least 912 acres of land brought 
him just 7442 in royalty payments 
wallop also reported income of at least 216433 assets of at 
least 146 million liabilities of at least 500000 and between 
995000 and 19 million worth of sales in stocks and bonds

who bought from 56 million to 115 million in securities and 
sold from 25 million to 48 million worth he showed capital 
gains ranging from 284102 to 666000 and dividend income of 
14552 to 57000 
rep robert garcias assets included a legal defense fund 
containing between 5000 and 15000 to pay lawyers representing 
him in the ongoing wedtech defense contracting probe

americas b1 bombers may not be able to 
fulfill their mission of penetrating soviet air defenses in the 
1990s according to congressional and administration officials 
citing new test results 
recent tests have shown problems with the b1s electronic 
countermeasures or ecm system used to foil enemy radar house 
armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said in a 
memorandum sent to panel members and disclosed on sunday 
plans to build the b1 were shelved during the carter 
administration but revived under president reagan as he persuaded 
congress that a penetrating bomber was needed to bridge the gap 
between the aging fleet of b52s and the b2 or stealth bomber 
expected to become operational in the 1990s 
reagan won approval for a version called the b1b by pledging to 
keep the first 100 planes under a 28 billion ceiling the planes 
became operational in 1986 although they are still undergoing 
tests and adjustments 
aspin said in his twopage memorandum said that ecm has been 
the chief question mark in the b1bs future as a penetrating 
bomber it looks like we have our answer the air force is now 
admitting that because of a design flaw it will never work as 
advertised 
the memo excerpts of which were obtained by the associated 
press quoted a letter from air force officials to the committee 
late last month saying that there are limitations within the 
current system architecture 
aspin said in his memo that the air force acknowledged that 
those limitations will prevent the b1b ecm from ever achieving 
full operational capability 
despite the problems air force officials said the plane should 
be able to penetrate soviet air space until the introduction of the 
stealth bomber which is designed to appear as small as possible on 
enemy radar screens 
air force officials confirmed the information in aspins memo 
but a spokesman capt jay de frank said the current round of 
flight tests verified that the most important ecm techniques work 
giving us a high degree of confidence that we can penetrate enemy 
defense and accomplish our mission 
the air force is trying to achieve what it calls mod1 
capabilities on the bombers ecm system meeting specifications 
that were supposed to be achieved in 1986 according to air force 
and congressional officials 
the current hardware aboard the plane is not capable of meeting 
higher mod2 capabilities those thought necessary for the plane to 
cope with expected improvements in soviet air defenses by the 
1990s congressional sources said 
the current system has a limitation which precludes achieving 
mod2 capabilities without modifying the hardware de frank said 
we are evaluating options to address these limitations 
the exact nature of the limitations is classified for security 
reasons but one congressional source said ecm devices aboard the 
b1 simply do not have the capacity to handle the job 
its a little like trying to pour a 12ounce drink into a 
7ounce glass it just cant be done said one source speaking 
on condition of anonymity they are a long way from being where 
they were supposed to be in 1986 
the system is designed to receive signals from soviet radar and 
jam them masking the b1 and protecting it from soviet air 
defenses sources said the current system can cope with what the 
air force calls significant threats but cannot handle 
secondary threats 
those threats although secondary may be sufficient to prompt 
the air force to alter or reroute the missions of some of the b1s 
to increase the probability that they could return safely the 
sources said 
we had always thought we could correct the problems but we 
got test results within the last six weeks which showed a basic 
problem with the architecture of the ecm said one administration 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
aspin has been critical of the b1 and last year released a 
report citing shortcomings in the ecm and other systems in 1987 
congress approved a 600 million program to test and correct the 
defects by 1991 
one widely publicized problem leakage from the b1s fuel 
tanks has already been fixed and solutions are thought possible 
for other headaches including flight instability and poor 
coordination between its terrainfollowing radar and guidance 
controls administration and congressional sources said

roses not derricks bedeck the 
streets of this capital of north sea oil and the tough scots who 
live here are proud of that 
oil changed many lives made some people rich and pushed out 
the ailing fishing industry but it has not spoiled the city 
sandwiched betweeen the rivers don and dee or changed aberdonians 
they say 
aberdeen lives with oil not for it and felt largely unscathed 
by the two decades of vast changes it brought at least until last 
weeks oil rig tragedy claimed 166 lives including many 
abderdonians 
aberdeen doesnt see itself as an oil town says the rev 
james stewart of the kirk church of st nicholas the seat of the 
citys ancient church of scotland congregation its a town on 
which oil has made a deep impact but it has sufficiently deep 
roots in the past and in the hinterland to see itself as something 
more 
the city of 214000 residents stresses this in a brochure for 
tourists since the discovery of north sea oil aberdeen has 
justifiably earned the title of europes offshore oil capital 
the city however has not been spoiled by this new industry 
only occasionally can an oil rig be seen far out on the horizon 
under tow to a new location or at anchor waiting a new contract 
stewarts stone church looms over a city built of granite from 
rowhouses to two early 16th century universities splashes of color 
come only from miles of roses lining the streets for aberdeens 
11th attempt to win the britain in bloom competition 
aberdeen is a tough nofrills city 
its a town where the character of the people in some ways is 
a reflection of the stone of which the city is built says 
stewart a scotsman who arrived in the city a few years after the 
oil boom began in the early 70s 
granite is a very hard stone and theres a kind of 
independent toughness about the aberdonians its not a city which 
wears its heart on its sleeve 
in the days after wednesdays oil rig disaster that seemed true 
memorial services were held and some flags flew at halfstaff 
but shoppers thronged the main street as crying seagulls drifted 
overhead 
the city mourned but privately 
were a closeknit people said kathleen skene head 
bartender at the aberdeen petroleum club once the elite haven of 
north sea pioneers oilwise americans and since the world oil 
slump a haunt of fish merchants and businessmen 
most people know someone or know of someone whos been lost 
it certainly affected a lot of lives she said 
once aberdeen folk were considered lucky to have oil on their 
doorstep said the sunday post newspaper which calls itself 
scotlands largest sunday paper now like many mining communities 
before them they have found the earth doesnt give up its riches 
without a price 
the first north sea oil was struck in 1969 and brought to shore 
in 1975 at the time aberdeen was in decline 
but from 1970 to 1984 jobs rose by 54 percent house prices 
rose nearly 20 percent a year and annual passengers through 
aberdeen airport rose 1370 percent to more than a million the 
city says 
with oil came a lot of outsiders what the aberdonians call 
inabootcomers in their dialect especially from the united 
states 
i think when oil first started we definitely resented the 
americans because they had the good jobs they made the money and 
a lot of aberdonians didnt benefit said ms skene not 
everyone made money 
others welcomed oil from the start 
it meant a complete turnaround from fishing to the oil 
scene said manager frank naughton of north star fishing co a 
major fishing fleet now used mostly as oil support boats with

after flailing at mosquitoes 
and sloshing shindeep through silty water so cold it hurts the 
little band of artists schlopschlopschlops through the mud 
keeping an eye on the tide 
then they drop their bulky bags and get to work as motorists on 
a bridge gawk 
in minutes the brown of the vast mud flats is broken by row 
upon row of color a plethora of pink a bevy of birds a phalanx 
of flamingos plastic in the mud the transformation becomes art 
courtesy of the flamingo institute 
this is the result of a long alaska winter robert wick said 
with a grin he and fellow art teacher hj slider founded the 
institute a year or so ago they prefer to call themselves 
curators we wondered what we could do as artists to break up the 
monotony 
they acquired about 100 plastic flamingos of the yard variety 
and periodically set up the flock in unusual places for arts sake 
or for money but they say they are performance artists serious 
artists in the same vein as christo the sculptor who 
periodically wraps islands or bridges with plastic and fabric 
in the mud of knik river the chevrons of flamingos are slashes 
of color cars slow down occasionally one honks 
one minute the birds are there the next with the tide 
changing they are back in their bags and headed for high ground as 
art gives way to mother nature 
slider said she sees the flamingos not as birds but as a way to 
splash pink across alaskas drab wilderness flamingos just happen 
to be the medium to transport the color theyre handy and 
durable and versatile she said 
wick said he sees the birds as a way to inject satire and humor 
into art 
were not dealing with it as flamingo formations we deal with 
it as a color he said theres a whole lot of absurdity in 
this the height of kitsch but you can turn it around and make a 
statement with it the bottom line is i guess pure aesthetics 
the institute claims about a dozen active members and a few 
dozen supporters the active members ante up 10 
for about 50 the institute in the past has set up about a 
dozen flamingoings for birthdays weddings or other occasions 
about four were more serious art pieces the rest were 
commercial wick said the only reason we do these gags is to 
get money were raping our art to get more flamingoes 
the birds bought at 8 a pair made their first appearance in 
august on anchorages park strip where they were set up like an 
orchestra wick said 
with a few exceptions the institute workers have had few 
problems setting up the flock a state department of fish and game 
worker questioned them about having a permit when they set up the 
flamingos in a bird refuge south of anchorage and officials 
refused permission for an installation up on top of a visitors 
center in anchorage 
they said we were an irresponsible group said institute 
member alice gant 
once the birds are set up institute members usually hover 
nearby to protect their flock people will carry them away 
slider said 
wick said he envisions setting up a flock anchored offshore a 
flotilla of flamingoes or perhaps a flock on a glacier 
you just dont know where they are going to show up slider

a legislative body of the episcopal church passed 
an proposal sunday on the ordination of homosexuals that left both 
proponents and opponents saying they had prevailed 
the house of deputies one of the churchs two governing bodies 
passed an amendment during the churchs 69th general convention 
that states no one shall be denied access to the selection 
process for ordination except provided by canons of this church 
in order to become part of the churchs canon law the deputies 
amendment would have to be adopted by the house of bishops the 
churchs other governing body before the convention comes to an 
end monday 
currently official church canon law contains no provisions 
barring homosexuals from being ordained but a 1979 resolution 
opposes ordination 
church spokesman richard henshaw said sundays vote was 
confusing 
this may be one of those rare moments when both sides think 
they have a victory he said 
opponents to the ordination of practicing homosexual priests say 
the deputies amendment reaffirms a 1979 church resolution that 
said we believe it is not appropriate for this church to ordain 
a practicing homosexual 
the church is clear on its position that it will not ordain 
homosexuals there is a difference between orientation and 
behavior no one has the right to ordination said dean james r 
gundrum of south dakota 
but proponents of homosexuals becoming eligible for ordination 
say the amendment contradicts the 1979 resolution because it refers 
to canon law not a mere resolution 
as a canon it would supersede a resolution said the rt 
rev paul moore jr bishop of new york it says nothing is 
barred outside the canons theres nothing in the canon which bars 
homosexuals from being considered 
debate on the deputies proposal prompted the rev david 
collins president of the house of deputies to say all of us 
are having a problem understanding what the heck were doing right 
now 
the general convention meets every three years to establish 
policy for the churchs 27 million members 
the church makes a distinction between homosexual activity 
which it says is sinful and homosexual orientation which it says 
it not

the man who once declared himself 
president for life is now a prisoner in his home a lonely and 
bitter old man whose 30year grip on this nation is being erased 
from the public consciousness 
family friends say habib bourguiba who turns 85 on aug 3 is 
deeply unhappy with his life in the secluded villa where he has 
been kept under house arrest since his ouster eight months ago 
the ailing exleader has become virtually a nonperson in the 
tunisia of president zine el abidine ben ali who was prime 
minister when he replaced bourguiba in a bloodless coup on nov 7 
tunisian media today rarely refer to the man whose word was law 
for more than three decades and whose photograph was once a daily 
fixture in the nations newspapers 
a multitude of bronze statues of bourguiba in various poses are 
being dismantled without fuss by local authorities throughout this 
north african arab nation 
the innumerable streets avenues and institutions that carry his 
name are gradually being renamed 
the dismantling cannot be done too abruptly the weekly maghreb 
newspaper explained because with all his faults and qualities 
he had become a father to us all a part of our collective 
consciousness 
he was a father even for his adversaries for five 
generations a father who fascinated us who inspired fear and who 
oppressed us we loved him and then hated him he ruled us by our 
own wish and by fear we cannot obliterate him from our collective 
memory even if we try the newspaper wrote 
on the day after the coup newlynamed prime minister hedi 
baccouche said bourguiba would be temporarily confined in the villa 
at mornag 12 miles southeast of the capital 
but baccouche added he would be treated with the honor and 
respect due a great leader and the architect of independence from 
french colonial rule 
bourguiba was removed from office after seven prominent tunisian 
physicians declared him mentally and physically crippled by 
senility and unfit to carry out his duties 
the constitution provided for the automatic succession of the 
prime minister ben ali to the presidency in case of the 
presidents death or incapacity 
one of ben alis first acts in office was to change sections of 
the constitution that had been tailormade for bourguiba and 
contained undemocratic provisions such as the automatic 
succession of the prime minister a presidential appointee 
only a few of bourguibas family members are allowed to visit 
him in the treeshaded singlestory mornag villa among them are 
his son former foreign minister habib bourguiba jr 
other politicians and former aides are strictly barred 
bourguibas niece saida sassi who played a key backstage role 
in the last years of bourguibas rule has turned his care over to 
a male nurse and a few servants 
at the height of her power mrs sassi was reputed to have been 
able to make and unmake ministers at will she was said to be the 
nations real ruler because of her influence over bourguiba 
she lived in the villa for a few weeks after the coup then 
moved to france 
sources said bourguiba deeply resented her departure which 
deprived him of the last companion with whom he liked to talk the 
weekly tunishebdo newspaper said mrs sassi left because the 
patriarch kept beating her with his cane 
officials in the ben ali government said bourguiba has firmly 
refused to endorse the nations new leader 
few tunisians now publicly praise bourguibas role in the 
nations history but many older officials of the ruling party are 
believed to secretly retain their admiration for him particularly 
in the region of his home town of monastir in central tunisia 
during his 32year virtual dictatorship he became the first 
leader of any arab nation to grant equal rights to women to 
condemn the crippling annual fas of the religious festival ramadan 
and to advocate an arab peace settlement with israel 
the government has thus far turned a deaf ear to his request to 
be allowed to end his days in monastir 
sources say bourguiba is particularly embittered because ben ali 
has not replied to the three letters bourguiba has written to his 
successor since his ouster one of which asked that he be moved to 
monastir 
the two men have not met since the coup 
because of his weakening eyesight an employee reads him the 
newspaper the old man watches tunisian television and italian 
broadcasts from nearby sicily but cannot look at the screen for 
long periods because of his eyesight 
the nurse accompanies him on his daily walks in the villas 
twoacre garden three successive police checkpoints on the single 
approach road keep outsiders away 
when bourguiba complained recently that his police guards were 
throwing their cigarette butts all over his garden ben ali sent a 
team of gardeners to clean up and rejuvenate the entire property

beach boy brian wilson who sang of good 
vibrations and endless summers before sinking into drug addiction 
and isolation has returned from the deep end with a critically 
acclaimed solo album and an optimistic outlook 
with the help of his controversial psychologist eugene landy 
wilson kicked the drug habit dropped his weight from more than 300 
pounds to a firm 190 and cut an album that critics put in a league 
with the beach boys 1966 classic pet sounds 
this album is better than pet sounds wilson said in a 
recent interview theres no comparison to the two but this one 
has more to offer it has more to offer the teenagers the older 
folks and the inbetween people 
landy credited as the new albums executive producer works 
with the 46yearold wilson 24 hours a day and considers himself 
wilsons friend therapist and musical collaborator 
landys tactics have raised charges of ethical violations and 
sparked a state investigation into his license but musically the 
landywilson relationship has been a healthy one pop critics say 
the los angeles times for example called the new album 
brian wilson a remarkable work that recalls the exhilarating 
sweep of the beach boys most endearing recordings

two men claimed victory and a third said he 
was leading sunday in the race to become mexicos new president 
opposition party activists staked out vote counting centers and 
blocked a major bridge and highways 
the nation appeared to be in for a long count 
results from congressional races began trickling into the 
federal election commission late in the day but as the night wore 
on there was no word on the presidential race which is reported 
last 
the commission has been under fire since it failed to deliver on 
its promise of results on election day it has not explained the 
delay 
the opposition has accused the commission of buying time to cook 
the numbers in favor of the governing party there was also 
speculation the party was using the time to deal with at least 
partial defeat 
meanwhile as part of the most ambitious votemonitoring effort 
in mexicos history opposition supporters staked out the district 
committees waiting to see if the official returns matched tallies 
posted earlier by poll workers 
the governing institutional revolutionary party or pri claimed 
victory for its candidate carlos salinas de gortari a few hours 
after the polls closed wednesday 
cuauhtemoc cardenas candidate for the leftist national 
democratic front claimed victory saturday based on projections 
from his party own count of 67 million votes the country has more 
than 38 million registered voters 
we have won the presidential elections he told reporters 
we will not recognize authorities that might rise out of 
electoral fraud 
pri spokesman juan enriquez rejected cardenas claim sunday 
figures we have show thats absolutely wrong he told the 
associated press it appears that we will be slightly above or 
slightly below 50 percent 
the third major candidate manuel j clouthier of the 
conservative national action party or pan said saturday that a 
count carried out by his supporters showed him ahead 
voters in 31 states and the federal district which includes 
mexico city also elected a 500seat chamber and 64 new senators 
in mexico city crowds gathered at several of the committees 
marched and sang the national anthem as city police and soldiers 
watched them while guarding the ballots 
in northern mexico hundreds of pan supporters occupied the 
cordoba bridge linking ciudad juarez with el paso texas in one of 
several coordinated actions of civil disobedience throughout 
northern chihuahua state 
the bridge protesters set up tents listened to radios and 
watched a soccer match on portable television sets they waved pan 
flags and chanted victory victory 
traffic stoppages also took place in the cities of delicias 
jimenez and parral all in chihuahua state the protesters demanded 
that the election commission respect its partys claims of 
victories in three congressional districts now held by the pri 
the election commission originally said it would start releasing 
returns on wednesday night hours before the polls closed it said 
its computer was broken it later blamed the delay on bad weather 
the postponement heightened suspicions in an election already 
clouded with accusations of fraud by the opposition and citizen 
watchdog groups 
the pridominated election commission refused to let the gallup 
organization do exit polls that might have given an early clue to 
the winner 
anything other than total victory in the presidential contest 
and the 64 senate races would be a major reversal for pri 
every pri presidential candidate since 1929 has been accorded at 
least 70 percent of the vote and the only senate seat the party 
ever gave up went to the candidate of an alliance including pri 
the party has never lost a gubernatorial race and it holds all but 
11 of the contested seats in the chamber of deputies 
salinas 40 a harvardeducated economist was the architect of 
president miguel de la madrids austerity plan de la madrids 
sixyear term ends dec 1 salinas campaigned as the candidate of 
the progressive center and promised to modernize the nations 
stagnant politic and economic institutions 
cardenas 54 is a former michoacan governor and pri senator who 
left the party when it refused to hold presidential primary 
elections he vowed to take the nation back to the mexican 
revolutions ideals of economic and social justice 
clouthier is a 54yearold businessman who advocates more

a private study says social security should be 
placed at least partially in private hands so the federal 
government wont be tempted to dip into a surplus expected to reach 
500 billion in 27 years 
the morgan guaranty trust co says such a move would give the 
united states a chance to dramatically increase its savings rate 
the study suggests that workers be allowed to divert 2 
percentage points of their payroll tax into individual investment 
accounts similar to individual retirement accounts starting in 
1990 when the tax climbs from 751 to 765 percentage points 
in exchange for the private accounts the workers would 
eventually get reduced social security benefits 
the approach would ensure that most of the social security 
reserve is productively invested said the study in the july 
issue of morgans world financial markets report the report is 
published by morgan guaranty trust co a subsidiary of jp morgan

oregon with its unpopulated timberlands and 
crowded prisons has become a haven for illegal drug production and 
drugrelated crime 
oregon is looked at as a great place to commit a crime said 
charles turner us attorney for oregon its a scandal an 
absolute disgrace 
the national organization for reform of marijuana laws claims 
oregon now leads the nation in marijuana growing because 
authorities have cracked down on growers in hawaii and california 
previously the two leading states 
although some dispute that claim by most accounts oregon 
produces at least the thirdlargest marijuana crop in the country 
valued at 600 million 
the us drug enforcement administration says oregon now also 
ranks third in methamphetamine or speed production behind 
california and texas 
oregon was ranked fifth for serious crimes in 1986 the most 
recent year for which figures are available according to the fbi 
the states largest city portland was tied with chicago in a 
recent study for the thirdhighest rate of drug use among crime 
suspects 
the study conducted in 10 cities by the national institute of 
justice found 75 percent of the suspects in portland who 
volunteered for drug tests after their arrest tested positive for 
drug use a percentage surpassed only by new york and san diego 
word has spread among drug dealers that oregon has no room in 
its jails and prisons law enforcement officials say in addition 
turner said oregon had the highest number of inmate escapes in the 
nation last year 
if we know that for a fiveyear felony a person is only going 
to serve 42 days what kind of deterrent is that turner said 
if we have a significant drug trafficker we need to take him out 
of circulation 
the legislative emergency board this spring approved 55 
million to expand the states prison capacity but it will take 
time to implement the plan pushed by gov neil goldschmidt 
the chaos in the corrections system along with oregons huge 
tracts of undeveloped land makes the state an ideal spot for 
marijuana farming and other illicit ventures authorities say 
its easy to hide in those conditions state attorney 
general dave frohnmayer said in a recent interview marijuana and 
methamphetamines require privacy and concealment 
turner said federal agencies have few people to patrol the 
immense forests 
it just didnt happen the people let it happen said the 
outgoing director of the state dea office connell mcgeehan 
accusing oregonians of having a lax attitude toward drugs 
if there is a tolerant attitude some believe it might have 
started in 1973 thats when the legislature made oregon the first 
state to remove criminal penalities for possessing less than an 
ounce of marijuana 
its one of the things that suggested to people to come and 
roost here and grow pot turner said 
the law may have sent a larger message frohnmayer said but 
he added im not sure we want to clog our courts with minor 
users 
oregon voters two years ago trounced a measure to legalize 
private growing and use of limited amounts of marijuana but 
efforts continue to put a similar proposal on the ballot in 
november 
john sajo of portland leader of the initiative drive said 
police exaggerate drug statistics and might even have caused 
increased pot growing there was a promise of riches he said 
people heard about all this money in it

teamsters president jackie presser who died 
after leading the nations largest union for five years is being 
remembered both as a great leader and a man who maintained the 
teamsters reputation for corruption 
jackie will be remembered for guiding the teamsters through 
difficult and successful contract negotiations during some of the 
hardest years for organized labor the period of ronald reagans 
allout attack on the trade union movement said tom turner 
president of the metropolitan detroit aflcio 
presser 61 died late saturday in a suburban cleveland hospital 
of cardiac arrest after being treated for brain cancer 
a federal lawsuit filed in new york last month claims the 
international brotherhood of teamsters is dominated by the mafia 
presser was a defendant in the lawsuit 
the teamsters leader also was awaiting trial in us district 
court in cleveland on felony embezzlement and racketeering charges 
for allegedly participating in a payrollpadding scheme at 
teamsters local 507 in cleveland it was pretty much more of the 
same and the union went downhill ken paff national organizer 
for the dissident teamsters for a democratic union said sunday of 
pressers tenure 
presser said many times in public that he made millions of 
dollars off the union he saw it as a business and he inherited it 
from his father we believe the union is a grassroots union that 
almost everything good we have in this country comes from unions 
said paff a member of the small but vocal opposition within the 
larger 16million member union 
because of his health problems presser who was paid about 
800000 a year temporarily relinquished his duties in may to 
teamsters secretarytreasurer weldon mathis 
a statement released sunday by mathis and the unions executive 
board said pressers death will be deeply felt 
he will long be remembered for his progressive ideas and deep 
commitment to the labor movement the statement said he was a 
great communicator and spokesman for the needs and concerns of 
working people 
presser was an fbi informant and his attorney john climaco 
said presser participated in the payrollpadding scheme with the 
agencys approval 
in a 1986 report the white house commission on organized crime 
concluded that presser would not have become teamsters president 
without the help of the head of the new yorkbased genovese crime 
family anthony fat tony salerno 
in may salerno was acquitted on charges of rigging the 
elections of presser and roy williams pressers predecessor 
presser who denied ties with the mob was known for a sometimes 
flamboyant personality he weighed 350 pounds and once entered a 
union convention in las vegas while seated in a red chariot guided 
by men dressed as roman soldiers 
presser used his influence to win a teamsters endorsement for 
ronald reagan in 1980 and was rewarded by being named labor 
cochairman for reagans inaugural 
pressers last major public appearance was in october 1987 when 
he spoke to the aflcio biennial convention at that meeting the 
teamsters were welcomed back into the union coalition after 30 
years of exile on allegations that the union was influenced by 
corrupt forces 
despite pressers death the government will continue its effort 
to take control of the teamsters said the prosecutor who brought 
the new york suit june 28 
everybody hoped that former teamsters president jimmy hoffa 
would clean up for his predecessor dave beck us attorney 
rudolph giuliani of manhattan told nbc everybody hoped that 
frank fitzsimmons would clean up for hoffa everybody hoped that 
williams would clean up for fitzsimmons and everybody hoped that 
presser would clean up for williams 
so you can always hope but from the point of view of fairly 
and effectively enforcing the law you cant depend on hope he 
said 
beck was convicted of embezzlement hoffa of obstructing justice 
and mail fraud and williams of trying to bribe a senator 
fitzsimmons was investigated but never indicted and died in office 
in 1981 
presser the son of teamsters organizer william big bill 
presser ascended to the teamsters presidency in 1983 after 
williams conviction 
pressers funeral is scheduled for tuesday in cleveland heights 
presser is survived by his fifth wife cynthia his son gary 
his daughter bari lynn and his mother faye

at least 2000 people gathered at the 
sweptclean site of a collapsed department store to mourn the 14 
dead and hear the disaster and rescue described as our finest 
hour as well as our greatest tragedy 
the disaster is now over the rubble is cleared away the 
victims are taken care of and now we are expected to return to life 
as usual rabbi arthur rutberg said sunday a day after the last 
of the bodies was recovered 
the threestory amigo store collapsed thursday during a 
torrential rain that prompted numerous passersby to duck inside for 
cover 
fourteen people were killed and six were pulled alive from the 
rubble at least 47 people were injured dozens crawled to safety 
the disaster drew hundreds of volunteers from thoughout the rio 
grande valley many of of whom worked with little rest for three 
days straight searching for the living and the dead 
the greatest lesson of this disaster is that brownsville 
texas is a great community that can work together as one unified 
and cooperative entity rutberg told victims relatives friends 
and others 
our lives and our community can never be the same again not 
only for those who suffered great losses but for all of us this 
has been our finest hour as well as our greatest tragedy 
the service was intended as an emotional release for the 
community said the rev tom pincelli another speaker 
i dont think we can just walk away we want to give a 
psychological conclusion to what transpired he said 
those at the ceremony included 8yearold denise carerra who 
was pulled from the rubble virtually unscathed while her mother and 
4yearold brother perished and bernard levin the store owner 
who did not speak or make himself available to reporters 
denises aunt guillermina silva de carerra thanked the crowd 
tearfully i wish i knew everyones names so that we knew who to 
thank by name thank you we felt the spiritual and moral 
support 
a brownsville woman at the service said she had watched the 
rescuers after the accident inside i feel sad said martha 
mancilla meyers nothing like this has ever happened in 
brownsville before 
officials have said the weight of an estimated 2 inches of 
rainfall from a 45minute downpour may have caused the flat roof to 
give way others speculated that the roofs drainage holes were 
clogged 
investigators began examining debris placed in the border citys 
dump representatives from every agency that participated in the 
rescue were to gather this week to review the accident and rescue 
efforts said mayor ygnacio garza 
a team from the southern building codes congress international 
based in birmingham ala arrived to assist in the investigation 
glenn winslow an investigator for the organization said that 
because the building was destroyed and much of its debris hauled 
away a thorough investigation may be impossible 
a damage assessment team of officials from the department of 
housing and urban development and the federal emergency management 
agency also was in brownsville to determine whether the city is 
eligible for disaster assistance 
meanwhile charter palms hospital a mental health center 
offered free counseling to everyone involved including onlookers 
the mayor said city officials are considering building a 
memorial plaza on the department store site 
its now time to bring this chapter to an end a little more 
than three days ago i stood in the street in front of a collapsed 
building and declared a state of emergency for the city of 
brownsville garza said 
tonight i stand here on this spot with all of us and all of 
you to state that this emergency is now over let us go and pray 
let us go in peace let us go forth

prince norodom sihanouk said today he 
has resigned as head of the cambodian resistance coalition 
surprising the united states and other countries that hoped he 
would play a key role in cambodian peace talks 
for serious reasons that are for the moment impossible for 
me to enumerate and to explain please allow me today to resign as 
president of democratic kampuchea cambodia sihanouk said in a 
statement issued by his office here 
i have decided to go into exile in france he said thanking 
thailand and china which have given him and his family refuge 
all through the previous week sihanouk had seemed about to take 
center stage in impending peace talks on cambodia last week he 
met in bangkok with secretary of state george p shultz japanese 
foreign minister sosuke uno and other asian leaders attending a 
regional meeting 
sihanouk a former cambodian head of state had led a 
threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting vietnamese troops that 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 the mercurial prince has previously 
quit as president then changed his mind making such shifts a part 
of his traditional diplomacy 
vietnam has said it will withdraw all of its troops from 
camobodia by 1990 
shultz speaking to reporters in jakarta indonesia said he 
didnt know how to interpret reports sihanouk has resigned adding 
that in recent meetings the prince seemed to take a 
constructive approach to the cambodian problem 
he has every intention of seeing this through shultz said 
of the cambodian leader who has in the past resigned from 
various positions only to reaccept them later 
in tokyo a foreign ministry official called sihanouks 
statement a surprise and said the ministry is trying to determine 
the princes intentions 
we hope sihanouk continues in his role as a leader to the 
cambodian problem the japanese official added speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
a spokesman in sihanouks office said he wasnt sure if the 
prince would be carrying out his previous pledge to attend peace 
talks planned for july 25 in indonesia 
sihanouk was to leave bangkok for france later today the 
spokesman said 
in jakarta indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said today 
that sihanouk sent a letter to the indonesian government 
apologizing for cancelling a visit that was to begin today but 
saying without elaboration that he would go to jakarta in late july 
sihanouk also said he regretted he was cancelling visits to the 
countries of the association of southeast asian nations or asean 
and to japan 
the resistance coalition also includes the communist khmer 
rouge which brutalized cambodia before the vietnamese invasion 
and the khmer peoples national liberation front led by former 
premier son sann 
sihanouk said in his statement that his son prince norodom 
ranariddh would represent him in the coalition 
the talks were to involve the three guerrilla factions the 
vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia vietnam laos and 
asean members 
asean foreign ministers and their western allies declared during 
annual talks last week in bangkok that sihanouk should play a 
central role in the talks and a future cambodian government 
they strongly endorsed sihanouks proposals that a coalition 
government comprising all the cambodian factions be formed to 
supervise elections after a vietnamese withdrawal and an 
international peacekeeping force be set up to prevent the 
vietnamese or the khmer rouge from retaking power 
in may 1987 sihanouk began a years leave of absence as 
president of the coalition he later said he wanted to gain more 
flexibility in pursuing talks with hun sen prime minister of the 
vietnaminstalled government in cambodia 
those talks held in france in december and january failed to 
produce any breakthroughs sihanouk then canceled a scheduled third 
round of talks

have made new ties with the communist world qatar established 
diplomatic relations with china and kuwait announced a new arms 
deal with the soviet union 
kuwaiti defense minister sheik nawaf alahmed signed an 
agreement with the soviet deputy minister of foreign trade and 
economic relations gen yuri grishin that provides for 
supplying kuwait with certain military equipment an official 
announcement in kuwait on sunday 
neither kuwaiti officials nor the soviet embassy would provide 
details of the accord the kuwaiti announcement did not say when 
the accord was signed 
the qatar government announced sunday that it was establishing 
relations with china leaving saudi arabia and bahrain the only two 
arab states with which china lacks diplomatic ties 
the announcements were made by kuwaiti and qatari news agencies 
and radio monitored in bahrain 
the peoples daily newspaper in beijing said sunday that qatars 
ambassador to france abdul rahman alattiyah and his chinese 
counterpart zhou jue signed a document establishing relations 
tuesday in france 
china has a history of good relations with the frontline arab 
states egypt jordan syria and lebanon and the palestine 
liberation organization has a permanent mission in beijing china 
does not recognize israel 
however the prowestern arab states of the gulf cooperation 
council have moved slowly to recognize communist china 
china established ties in 1971 with kuwait in 1978 with oman 
and in 1984 with the united arab emirates qatar saudi arabia and 
bahrain are the three other gulf council states 
despite the absence of relations between saudi arabia which 
harbors islams holiest shrines and the communist countries the 
saudi government recently purchased chinesemade css2 
surfacetosurface missiles from beijing 
kuwait had also signed a 325 million arms deal with the soviets 
in 1985 involving surfacetoair missiles 
it purchased the sam7 projectiles after the congress blocked 
its bid to buy american stinger missiles complicating kuwaits 
plan to boost its defenses against the spillovers of the 8yearold 
iraniraq war 
the qatari and kuwaiti announcements came as kuwaiti crown 
prince sheik saad alabdullah alsabah flew to washington on an 
official visit 
sheik saad who also is prime minister is the first such 
ranking kuwaiti leader to visit the united states since 1968 
during his stay he was expected to try to conclude a 19

the rains finally came to parts of the droughtstricken south 
and midwest bringing jubilation to some and despair to others who 
had hoped for too much 
thunderstorms in north carolina and michigan on sunday brought 
damaging high winds and led to injuries including six people hit 
by lightning in michigan and a north carolina woman who was 
hospitalized after a power surge went through her electric curling 
iron 
but in wisconsin crop rejuvenation came almost overnight 
it the corn looks nice and green right now its unfolded 
its probably grown two inches since this morning wisconsin 
farmer vince garvoille said sunday while examining threequarters 
of an inch in his rain gauge he said his hay probably grew three 
inches in the 10 hours after the weekend rain 
it just popped out of the ground garvoille said its 
amazing what water can do 
in kentucky and illinois there remained mostly only promises 
georgia was still hot and dry with a half inch of rain only in one 
area 
in iowa rain in some areas reached five inches 
a cold front pushed thunderstorms into southern illinois today 
the national weather service predicted scattered thundershowers 
through tuesday but the amount of rainfall was expected to be less 
than half an inch 
illinois needs more rain than you can imagine to end the 
drought said carl williams of the chicago weather service 
office 
williams said a whizbang thunderstorm dropped only a trace 
of rain at ohare international airport sunday afternoon with a 
little more falling on downtown chicago 
it wasnt enough to settle the dust but it was better than 
nothing he said 
storms moved out of iowa on sunday night but the weather 
service said showers and thunderstorms were possible tonight 
through wednesday in parts of the state 
five inches of rain fell in parts of iowa while other areas got 
less than a halfinch from storms late friday through the weekend 
still leaving the crops in a tenuous situation said s elwynn 
taylor a climatologist at iowa state university 
the state as a whole requires four inches of precipitation to 
break the drought he said 
at logan iowa farmer ivan leonard said he got a little more 
than five inches over two days 
this is going to be a big boost to the bean crop he said 
adding that it will help salvage some of his corn crop as well 
a blanket of stagnant air scattered thunderstorms and lightning 
across north carolina and heavy rains caused some flooding 
a 20yearold transylvania county woman was injured sunday when 
lightning apparently struck her house and power surged through a 
curling iron she was using 
the woman who was not identified by transylvania county 
hospital personnel was in satisfactory condition this morning 
suffering from electrical shock they said 
the high winds felled trees knocking out power to about 2500 
customers in the county 
areas of michigan got up to an inch of rain but with it came 
high winds and lightning that injured at least six and cut power to 
31000 residents officials said 
but for most of michigan the rain brought relief 
when it started downpouring i was smiling i was whistling 
said john nink 29 who measured a half inch of rain in his 
traverse city cherry orchard 
storms dumped up to 1 inches of rain on ohio but it was far 
short of what weather officials say is needed to end the drought 
hot dry weather continued across georgia except in valdosta 
which reported more than a half inch of rain sunday 
despite the drought the georgia department of agriculture 
reported that the georgia peach harvest could be the best in four 
years because of irrigation 
a cold front that has the potential for triggering showers was 
headed for kentucky but cant be counted on for major drought 
relief 
the system is still coming down this way said marilyn 
scholz of the weather service in louisville as far as how much 
rain thats a good question it still probably wont be as much as 
we need 
weekend rainfall of up to a threequarters of an inch dropped on 
parts of kentucky 
in georgia where 2500 army national guardsmen are getting 
ready for two weeks of training officials said they will take 
special precautions at droughtparched fort stewart 
sgt 1st class jerry allen 39 of cedartown ga said the base 
is the driest its been in the 14 years hes attended summer camp 
its going to be dusty and its going to be dangerous said 
allen an m1 tank crewman all it takes is one flare or one 
spark to set the woods on fire

a minister facing trial wednesday on 
federal charges of transporting and harboring illegal aliens was 
selling salvadoran babies prosecutors allege 
but the case of the lutheran minister and a freelance 
journalist indicted with him has been embraced by the sanctuary 
movement of clergy and lay people who have been aiding refugees 
from central america since the early 1980s 
the rev glen remerthamert 44 and demetria martinez 27 were 
indicted dec 10 accused of helping two pregnant salvadoran women 
enter the united states illegally in august 1986 both women gave 
birth in the united states and one of the babies was put up for 
adoption 
us attorney william lutz who will prosecute the case charged 
in a court document filed in february that remerthamert was 
selling salvadoran babies for adoption not helping political 
refugees 
as soon as the defendant got his hands on the babies he meant 
to transport the women back to el salvador the document said 
remerthamert was indicted on nine counts including conspiracy 
transporting and harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud ms 
martinez was charged with four counts of transporting and inducing 
illegal aliens 
for us it is not something that is against the law to give 
sanctuary to someone fleeing for his or her life said patricio 
guerrerortiz a member of the new mexico sanctuary defense 
committee which was set up to help pay the defendants legal 
expenses 
remerthamert has said he is being prosecuted because of his 
outspoken criticism of the reagan administrations policies in 
central america 
ms martinez a freelance writer who covers religion for the 
albuquerque journal and the national catholic reporter says she 
acted solely as a journalist when she accompanied remerthamert and 
tried to take steps to ensure she would not so much as travel with 
the women to albuquerque 
i have researched a number of topics that pertain to religion 
including the sanctuary movement and the role of mainline 
denominations relative to that movement she said at the time of 
her indictment 
she also has said she never wrote a story about the women 
partly out of fear for their safety 
the indictment accused remerthamert of submitting false expense 
documents to rainbow house international an adoption agency and 
of receiving 2900 
remerthamert said after his indictment that he was reimbursed 
for some costs of helping the women but received no fees 
the women cecelia eliasalegria and inez camposanzora remain 
in the united states and are expected to be called as prosecution 
witnesses 
sanctuary supporters were elated last month when us district 
judge john conway ruled that a march 28 1986 proclamation by 
former gov toney anaya declaring new mexico a sanctuary state 
could be used by remerthamert and ms martinez in their defense 
conway will hear the case 
the proclamation was rescinded by gov garrey carruthers when he 
took office in january 1987 
remerthamert said last week he was dismissed from his social 
services job with the state after the indictment since then he

president corazon aquino said today 
she does not expect her talks with secretary of state george p 
shultz to solve an impasse over the presence of us military bases 
in the philippines 
shultz said meanwhile that washington has found other 
options if the united states is forced to abandon its largest 
military operation in asia 
the presence of the united states in this region is a 
significant factor its part of the strategic equation shultz 
told a news conference today 
the idea of the united states not being here is virtually 
unthinkable for people he said in jakarta indonesia today 
before leaving for manila 
the future of seven us military facilities is expected to be a 
major issue in talks with mrs aquino and other leaders street 
demonstrators and some politicians have called for their removal 
even before a bases treaty expires in 1991 
the manila stop is part of a ninenation asian and pacific tour 
for shultz 
neither the association of southeast asian nations nor most of 
its six members have publicly voiced support for continued us 
military presence in the philippines but shultz said talks with 
japan australia and most association members have shown they are 
against their removal 
our military people have had to think about how they are going 
to carry out their mission and somewhat to their surprise they 
found ways of doing it shultz said he declined to specify 
the options 
negotiations between the two countries began in april and were 
to have concluded last week but they have been stalled on the 
question of us compensation to the philippines and proposed curbs 
on us military operations at the facilies sources close to the 
talks said 
mrs aquino indicated in a brief interview with filipino 
reporters at the presidential palace today that she may not bring 
up the subject of the bases when she meets with shultz on tuesday 
reporters asked mrs aquino if she expected her talks with 
shultz to lead to an agreement on compensation to the philippines 
for continued use of clark air base subic naval base and four 
smaller facilities 
no said mrs aquino because the review is still going 
on and it will be up to the review committee to discuss that 
shultz is not part of the review panel it is us ambassador 
nicholas platt and on and on our side foreign secretary raul 
manglapus 
the united states currently gives the philippines 180 million 
in economic and military aid annually in exchange for use of the 
bases manglapus said when the talks began that 12 billion a year 
was a more realistic figure 
sources close to the talks say that the united states is 
unwilling to substantially increase current compensation levels 
without guarantees from the manila government that it will extend 
the lease on the bases when it expires in 1991 
in addition the senate also has passed a bill that seeks to ban 
nuclear weapons or passage through the country of nucleararmed and 
nuclearpowered ships the bill has not been debated by the more 
conservative house of represenatives 
shultz said last month that the united states would scuttle its 
military bases in the philippines and terminate its security 
relationship with its former colony if such a bill were enacted

a man who says he runs an agency that 
helps find abducted children and pledged to use guerrilla 
tactics to return youngsters to their parents has been charged 
with attempted abduction and sexual abuse of young boys 
david robert riggs 37 is being held in the wood county jail in 
lieu of 25000 bond he was arrested july 2 by wood county 
sheriffs deputies after a woman in nearby boaz said he tried to 
abduct her 13yearold grandson 
riggs was charged with two felony counts of attempted abduction 
and a misdemeanor count of thirddegree sexual abuse 
riggs represents himself as director of search seven new york 
which purportedly does aggressive investigations designed to 
recover criminally abducted children 
in all six boys in mason and wood counties accused riggs of 
propositioning them for photographs july 1 and july 2 he allegedly 
offered the boys 5 to pose for photographs on the spot and more 
if they would get in his car and pose in a remote area wearing 
bikini underwear he would provide 
three boys agreed to pose on the spot but none got into riggs 
car the attempted abduction charges stem from his request that 
they enter the car the thirddegree sex abuse charge was brought 
because one of the boys said riggs pulled down the boys swim 
trunks and touched his genitals 
last week police searched riggs dusty 1973 oldsmobile omega 
but police found no exposed film the one roll in a camera was 
loaded incorrectly and contained no photographs 
wood county sheriff steve greiner said he hopes to keep riggs in 
custody while investigators continue to study his past 
so far authorities here said they have no evidence riggs has 
ever been charged with sexual abuse anywhere else but greiner said 
they also have found no record that riggs ever helped locate lost 
children in the four years that he has dogged police departments a 
national missingchildren center and the parents of abducted 
children for information 
police said riggs a new yorker who recently moved to the 
central michigan town of crystal alternatively represents himself 
as a private investigator the head of a nonprofit agency and a 
university sociologist 
his queries prompted the fbi in pennsylvania and state police in 
illinois to investigate him officials said police in tennessee 
said they closed the door on riggs when he gave different stories 
of who he was 
the national center for missing and exploited children which 
does not work with private investigators turned riggs away when 
he was unable to verify who he was or why he wanted detailed 
records on every missing child in the united states 
in june 1987 the center warned parents of missing children 
that despite his claims otherwise riggs was not working with the 
agency 
no information has been released to him nor will it be 
according to the centers deputy director john rabun 
we said ok david fine what are you rabun said 
first he said he was a notforprofit agency then he said he 
was a private investigator later he said he was working for 
columbia university 
rabun said a background check turned up no new york records of a 
private investigators license for riggs or a tax number for search 
seven 
in 1984 riggs described himself to an allentown pa newspaper 
reporter as a schoolteacher turned salesman who started searching 
for missing children because he was outraged by the abductions 
i plan to use guerrilla tactics police dont usually use 
riggs was quoted as saying this is a battle this isnt 
something you can sit back in your armchair and contemplate your 
next attack

beset by a weak economy but boosted by 
utahs republican leanings gov norm bangerter hopes to salvage 
his sagging reelection campaign with an aggressive attack on his 
democratic challenger 
but some republican diehards say it may be too late 
bangerter who trails democrat ted wilson in polls says he will 
spend the dog days of summer in rural utah and other traditional 
gop strongholds trying to persuade republicans that utah has moved 
forward under his hand despite a stagnant economy and a record tax 
increase 
my biggest challenge and concern is that people are going to 
base this decision on emotion rather than facts and that would be 
the biggest mistake bangerter said in an interview 
other republicans say bangerter still can win but they caution 
that even in this predominantly republican state a victory over 
wilson will not come easily 
i believe its winnable but the governor has got to get his 
case to the people his record and what hes done its a good 
case but we may have passed the point in time where we could 
salvage the election said former republican state chairman 
charles akerlow who presided over the gops sweep of major offices 
in 1984 
bangerters popularity plummeted after he cajoled the 
legislature last year into passing a 166 million tax increase the 
largest in utah history 
his problems have been deepened by the states weak economy the 
failure of five utah thrift and loan institutions and dry weather 
that made a mockery of his decision several years ago to spend 60 
million to install pumps to remove floodwaters from the great salt 
lake the lake level has since gone down largely on its own 
recent initiatives have done little to restore public 
confidence even his announcement last month of a plan to rebate 
80 million in surplus income taxes and lower rates by 5 percent 
failed to revive his candidacy 
a deseret newsksltv poll taken in early july and released last 
tuesday found he had the support of 28 percent of the 603 residents 
surveyed compared with 51 percent for wilson the former mayor of 
salt lake city 
bangerter lost 2 percentage points of support while wilson 
climbed by the same amount since a similar poll in june but dave 
buhler bangerters campaign manager dismissed the changes as 
statistically irrelevant since the polls margin of error was 4 
percentage points 
a further complication for bangerter is the independent campaign 
of former republican merrill cook cook entered the race at the 
behest of the tax limitation coalition of utah which is sponsoring 
three taxreduction initiatives that have qualified for the 
november ballot 
the latest deseret newsksltv poll found cook had the support 
of 13 percent of those surveyed evenly divided among those who 
otherwise would vote for bangerter and wilson but wilson can 
afford the loss bangerter cannot 
bangerter contends that the states republican majority will 
vote for him once it realizes that despite the tax increase he 
has made sound decisions for instance he said he will emphasize 
that during his term the state budget has dropped 8 percent and 
unemployment has fallen to 5 percent the lowest rate of the 1980s 
if the voters want strong conservative fiscal government 
responsible government my record provides that bangerter said 
i dont think wilson provides that he provides a record of 
taxing and spending i have a record of taxing but not spending 
wilson said his task is to keep bangerter on the defensive 
i predict my lead will narrow wilson said i need to get 
my story out and im not going to let them take the agenda away 
from me lets face it the state is 21 republican 
bangerter appears to have a slight lead in fundraising buhler 
said the governor has spent about 350000 and has 50000 to 
70000 in the bank 
rob jolley wilsons campaign manager said the former mayor has 
raised about 365000 and spent 350000 the largest single 
expenditure was 170000 for a television advertising campaign that 
was designed to solidify wilsons support jolley said the ads 
apparently did more than expected 
we didnt feel it would bring us a lot of new support we were 
surprised that we gained he said

horse track announcer ed grimsley kept 
fans at scioto downs wondering as they awaited his word on a 
decision one that would have a much bigger impact than the 
outcome of a disputed race 
most of the 5121 harness racing fans in attendance friday night 
gave a big cheer when grimsley ended the suspense just before the 
11th race he said he would marry becki manning then dropped into 
his cadence of calling the race 
ms manning had used the tracks message board to propose to 
grimsley after the eighth race to ed g will you marry me 
becki m her message read 
grimsley got plenty of goodnatured advice for and against 
marriage from the crowd after the proposal was made and he took 
his time answering after the ninth race message board operator 
rob reed posted an anxious request for grimsleys response 
whats the answer ed it said 
then came a race won by a horse named never my love one of 
the judges asked me if the winner of the 10th race was my answer 
grimsley said 
but as the horses approached the start of the 11th race 
grimsley said over the public address system and the answer to 
becki m is yes 
i figured hed come back with something funny on the message 
board ms manning said i was shocked when he said yes and i 
couldnt believe he just went on with the race without missing a 
beat 
i really did it as a joke she added i told him that some 
day i was going to ask him to marry me on the message board it was 
sort of a dare 
it wasnt the first time she had asked grimsley said i 
didnt think i was the marrying type but i guess i am now 
ms manning 35 and grimsley 29 have been dating for two 
years both are from sabina in westcentral ohio

about 60 nudists took their 
seventh annual canoeing trip on the delaware river without a hitch 
and without any sunburns a spokesman says 
we certainly used a lot of sunburn lotion today said 
michael gesner the 42yearold head of two nudists groups with 
membership in new jersey and surrounding states 
gesner and members of the tristate sun club and tristate metro 
naturist inc gathered sunday for a sixhour trip with 31 canoes at 
the delaware water gap national recreational area for what they 
called canuding as part of national nude weekend 
gesner says parkgoers could not see the nudists bottom halves 
because the canoes blocked them from view 
we just had a good time gesner said its not a big deal 
any more 
he says nudists prefer to go without clothes because it makes 
more sense on days like sunday when temperatures reached into the 
90s 
its just a practical thing he said

maxwells failing fortunes in the highly competitive manhattan

the government today said carlos salinas de 
gortari had a wide lead over his opponents but that election 
results still were not final five days after voters cast ballots 
for a new president 
the partial results were released after opposition activists 
blocked highways and closed international bridges to press the 
government to release the results of the general elections 
earlier one opposition candidate had claimed victory and a 
third said he was leading 
charges of ballotbox fraud and the federal election 
commissions failure to release results clouded what was expected 
to be an easy victory for governing institutional revolutionary 
party and salinas the partys presidential candidate 
the government said salinas received 5289 percent of the votes 
counted so far the federal electoral commission said cuauhtemoc 
cardenas of the leftist national democratic front trailed with 
2910 percent of the vote the electoral commission said and 
national action party candidate manuel clouthier was third with 
1668 percent 
mexico has 38 million registered voters the government said it 
has counted about 1324 million votes but did not say how many 
ballots were cast 
protesters who blockaded two bridges across the rio grande in 
chihuahua state went home early today after the election commission 
released results that showed the national action party won three 
congressional races in the juarez area 
but uncertainty clouded the presidential race 
the institutional revolutionary party declared salinas the 
winner hours after the polls closed wednesday 
cardenas claimed late saturday that he had won 
and manuel clouthier of the national action party said his 
partys figures showed he was ahead in the presidential balloting 
the governing party leaked early returns on friday in an attempt 
to stifle speculation it had suffered a devastating loss the 
figures gave salinas 474 percent of the 45 million votes 
tabulated at that point cardenas 267 percent and clouthier 207 
percent 
the electoral commission said it would first release one by 
one the results of the 500 chamber of deputies races then 
announce winners of the 64 senate seats before issuing results of 
the presidential balloting 
interior secretary manuel bartlett who heads the electoral 
commission said on sunday the votecounting process is a 
question of patience politics is the science of patience 
he said the breakdown of a new computer system then bad 
weather prevented the commission from delivering on its pledge to 
release preliminary results on election night 
the salinas camp has privately acknowledged probable losses to 
cardenas in at least two states and mexico city firstever 
defeats for the institutional revolutionary party which has not 
lost a presidential senate or gubernatorial race since it was 
founded in 1929 
the governing party lost both senate seats in cardenas home 
state of michoacan the government news agency notimex reported 
today it did not say what party won and pri officials could not be 
reached for comment on the report 
the surprisingly poor showing has produced a rift in the party 
between salinas supporters who want to modernize the party and an 
old guard seeking to use the delay to embarrass the salinas camp or 
ensure traditional margins of victory 
bartlett was a top competitor to salinas for the governing 
partys presidential nomination 
on at least two occasions salinas aides assured foreign 
reporters the electoral count was proceeding smoothly and results 
were imminent only to be frustrated by commission announcements of 
further postponement 
aides to salinas argue that the delay only heightens 
expectations of fraud and makes it more difficult for the new team 
to embark on its agenda 
the opposition charges that the governing party is devising 
satisfactory electoral results before it releases them 
the lack of information since the very day of the election has 
created many doubts with respect to the correct management and the 
credibility of the electoral figures cardenas said in a letter 
to bartlett released sunday night 
national action party members coordinated protests on sunday 
particularly in chihuahua state 
protesters blocked the cordoba bridge the main link between 
ciudad juarez and el paso texas the smaller zaragoza bridge about 
eight miles east and a bridge at fabens texas about 20 miles 
east of el paso 
the pan american highway outside the state capital of chihuahua 
200 miles south of the us border was blocked by party members 
saturday night at the same time as the bridge takeover in ciudad 
juarez 
similar traffic stoppages took place in the chihuahua cities of 
delicias jimenez and parral 
ramon galindo campaign coordinator for the national action 
party said the federal election commission results showed that the 
party had won all three races for the juarez area lower chamber of 
the national legislature 
these numbers signify the death of the governing party in 
ciudad juarez galindo said as about 1000 people cheered and 
then began departing the cordova bridge another 200 protestors 
were also leaving the blocked zaragoza bridge

opposition supporters shut down 
three bridges spanning the us border to protest delayed election 
results then lifted the blockades today when the government 
announced that their party won local races 
the protestors adherents of the rightofcenter national action 
party held the bridges for more than 26 hours in a peaceful 
demonstration that began saturday night 
their candidates won all three juarez area races for the federal 
legislatures lower house in last wednesdays balloting 
in mexico city on sunday opposition activists held vigils 
outside centers where ballots were being counted saying they were 
guarding against vote fraud 
also supporters of presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas 
of the national democratic front demonstrated outside the interior 
ministry to demand that the government release vote tallies without 
rigging the results 
when the results were announced in this border city local 
national action party campaign coordinator ramon galindo said they 
signify the death of the governing party in ciudad juarez 
about 1000 people cheered and then began leaving the cordova 
bridge the main link between juarez and el paso texas another 
200 protesters left the smaller zaragoza bridge about eight miles 
to the east protesters had also occupied a bridge 20 miles east of 
the city 
traffic on sunday was restricted to the two other bridges that 
link juarez with el paso 
as the bridge takeover began in juarez national acton party 
party members blocked the pan american highway outside the state 
capital of chihuahua 200 miles south of the us border 
similar traffic stoppages took place in the chihuahua cities of 
delicias jimenez and parral 
party leaders were vowing to continue their campaign of civil 
resistance if they determined that the governing institutional 
revolutionary party or pri was attempting to cheat them out of 
electoral victory 
since its creation in 1929 pri has never lost a gubernatorial 
or presidential race but it has long been accused of massive vote 
fraud especially in chihuahua 
the national action party is considered a contender in much of 
mexicos north 
on the cordova bridge the protesters had set up tents and tarps 
to escape the sun and food and drink vendors plied their trade the 
air was almost festive there and at the zaragoza bridge 
after the government said it would release election results 
sunday night local national action party leaders met and decided 
to vacate the bridges as when the tallies were announced said 
party spokesman francisco barrio 
in 1986 barrio ran for chihuahua governor and was defeated by 
pri candidate hernando baeza in what the national action party 
termed massive vote fraud

the piper alpha oil and gas platform 
was still burning and smoking early today five days after 
explosions and fire on the north sea rig killed 166 men in the 
worlds worst oilfield disaster 
the semisubmersible support rig tharos found three more 
bodies by early today bringing the total recovered to 20 
texas oilfield fire and blowout specialist red adair 73 and 
his team waited on the rig to board the tilting ruined platform 
adairs team said they had planned to return to the platform today 
to continue clearing debris before trying to cap a blazing wellhead 
but a spokeswoman for the platforms operators occidental 
petroleum corp said adairs plans were put on hold by 35 mph 
winds and forecasts of possible lightning and thunderstorms 
adair said three or four of the platforms 36 wellheads were 
still burning two of them sending up flames 300 feet high other 
wells have been fractured under the sea and are blowing gas to the 
surface in huge bubbles 
the team boarded the dangerously tilting platform at dawn sunday 
from the tharos but was forced off by high winds heavy seas and a 
surge of flames from one wellhead 
the platform stricken last wednesday stands on the seabed 120 
miles northeast of the scottish coast 
the job will cost millions of dollars and it could be that 
some of the oil outlets may be closed off permanently with concrete 
plugs said john brading chairman in britain of the platforms 
operators los angelesbased occidental petroleum corp 
the noise from the well blowing out is like a jet plane and 
water has to be continually sprayed on to try to keep the heat 
down brading said 
he said adairs team would work as close as 10 feet to the 
flames protected by shields 
if red gets that close and says the job cannot be done then 
we will have to drill a second well and that could take three to 
four weeks red has been extremely successful in the past but 
every well is different brading said 
gene grogan occidentals vice president of engineering said 
adair will try to pour in sea water drilling mud or cement 
if there are dangers in doing that the other way is to drill 
a relief well by drilling down to the same bottom hole location and 
then pumping in fluid from there to the other well he said 
fourteen of the 64 survivors were still being treated in 
aberdeen royal infirmary three of them with extensive burns 
the london newspaper today said 6 million gallons of oil a day 
were belching into the north sea 
it said that despite ships working on the slick with dispersal 
chemicals dead seabirds smothered in oil were washing up along the 
coast 
the department of energy appointed lord cullen a judge of the 
court of session in edinburgh to head the public inquiry into the 
disaster 
more than 100 churches in scotland held memorial services sunday 
for the victims

the heat and drought are scorching corn 
and soybeans but a few farmers are counting the cash from a new 
crop they just harvested canola 
that probably will be the best crop ive got this year said 
don hiter who sold about 1000 bushels of the tiny black oilseed 
from his 20acre plot in dewitt county everything else is in bad 
shape 
canola is a trademark for a variety of rape a plant whose seeds 
are crushed to produce oil for cooking and food production and meal 
for livestock feed canada grows about 80 percent of the world 
supply of rape and little has been raised in the united states 
there were about 12000 acres of the crop in illinois indiana 
ohio michigan and kentucky this year according to tony jones a 
representative of canola inc an indianapolisbased seed 
distributor 
that could increase significantly in 1989 because the current 
drought threatens to reduce the us harvest of soybeans another 
oilseed crop said jones 
when we harvest canola next year we will be riding on the 
effect of this drought and well still have high prices said 
jones well generate good cash flow and know were getting the 
best price of the year without having to tie up storage space 
canola is planted in the fall and grows until cold weather 
causes it to become dormant it resumes its growth in the spring 
and is harvested in late june or early july 
it looks like sweet clover when its in full bloom covered 
with yellow flowers said hiter you can see it from miles 
around i had a lot of neighbors looking at it 
canola survived the drought because it matured and was harvested 
much earlier than the corn crop the grain got an early start in 
the spring thus avoiding the harsh effects of the drought 
the plant which is related to mustard is about four feet tall 
and grows thick enough that it smothers all the weeds said 
hiter who farms 880 acres with his son near weldon 
hiter said he was pleased with his yield of 50 bushels per acre 
the 1988 canola sold for 725 a bushel but hiter had to truck 
the seed 100 miles to a grain elevator at farina one of only two 
receiving points in illinois 
roger read who operates a farm supply and grain marketing 
business in madison county said he and some of his customers also 
raised canola this year he said they had generally good results 
but hope there will be more places to sell the crop in the future 
another advantage of canola said jones is that the us crop 
is harvested earlier than springplanted canadian rapeseed at a 
time when processors need it 
canola gives you flexibility another option in your crop 
rotation and a chance to spread out your workload read said 
with the drought canola was a bright spot this year something 
to make you smile and get excited

richard thomas says hes tired of being 
asked how much wood a woodchuck could chuck 
they have to be trying to get one up on us wellversed 
biologists said thomas a fish and wildlife technician for the 
state department of environmental conservation i felt it was 
high time we replied 
so he decided to figure it out 
first thomas consulted the dictionary for a definition of 
chuck which he found to mean to toss or discard woodchucks 
cant chuck wood but they do toss or discard dirt when they 
are digging a burrow 
then he told the rochester democrat and chronicle he 
researched woodchucks he found they weigh 5 to 10 pounds and have 
thick strong legs perfect for burrowing 
their homes consist of a main tunnel 25 to 30 feet long and six 
inches wide with three rooms one spy tunnel one for sleeping 
and one for a toilet 
the last step was figuring volume and weight 
thomas multiplied 35 square feet the typical size of a 
woodchuck burrow by 20 pounds the approximate weight of a square 
foot of soil to come up with what he believes is the answer to one 
of the great unanswered questions of western civilization 
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck 
wood 
oh about 700 pounds on a good day with the wind at his 
back said thomas i thought everybody knew that

a newspaper reported today 
that iran recovered the flight recorder from the passenger jet a 
us navy warship shot down over the persian gulf iran denied the 
report 
the khaleej times quoted unidentified salvage experts in dubai 
as saying the iranians recovered the flight recorder from the iran 
air a300 airbus in the past few days 
but irans navy commander said today that search teams have so 
far failed to find the flight recorder tehran radio reported 
commodore mohammed hussein malekzadegan said in a radio 
interview monitored in cyprus that the recorder may have been 
destroyed when the jetliner was shot down july 3 by a missile fired 
by the uss vincennes iran said all 290 people aboard were killed 
the data stored in the recorder could be crucial in determining 
whether the airbus received radio warnings from the vincennes it 
also could provide information about the aircrafts altitude and 
other flight details 
the newspaper referred to the recorder only as the black box 
and did not specify whether it was the flight data recorder or 
voice recorder 
the united states says the vincennes crew mistook the airbus 
for an f14 fighter jet and claims the jet was descending in what 
was seen a hostile flight pattern and did not respond to seven 
radio warnings 
iran says the aircraft was operating normally and climbing as it 
approached the vessel after taking off from bandar abbas iran on 
a 150mile flight to dubai 
meanwhile a british intelligence report based on radio 
communications monitored in the gulf criticizes the navy for 
shooting down the airliner the sunday times of london reported 
the report concludes that the flight left bandar abbas only 
three minutes late was on the correct flight path and was climbing 
when it was shot down the newspaper said 
the navy has said the jet was descending and took off an hour 
late 
the khaleej times quoted italys naval commander in the gulf 
rear adm angelo mariani as saying heavy traffic in the waterway 
and the mixture of civilian and military craft will complicate 
investigations into the tragedy 
the newspaper quoted mariani as saying the italian frigate 
espero heard an unidentified us warship issue warnings to an 
aircraft shortly before the airbus was shot down 
he said the message was transmitted at least once on the 
military air distress frequency 
since we only listen to military frequencies i cannot confirm 
whether the same message was repeated on the civilian international 
frequency or not but i assume it must have been mariani was 
quoted as saying 
the pentagon says warnings were sent on both military and 
civilian frequencies 
the un security council plans to hold an emergency meeting 
tuesday on the incident but irans leaders expressed doubt that 
the body will condemn the united states for the attack 
in view of the councils past performance and also due to its 
peculiar composition iran is not too optimistic on the outcome of 
the session foreign minister ali akbar velayati told reporters 
in tehran on sunday 
deputy foreign minister mohammad jawad larijani said a us veto 
of a security council resolution that would condemn the attack 
would not necessarily prompt a violent iranian reaction 
the united states as one of the five permanent members of the 
security council has veto power 
we prefer not to be hostile we prefer that this case should 
be settled diplomatically but we are not naive not to see the 
difficulties he said

the trustee for ptl says he will examine 
deposed founder jim bakkers proposal to buy back the ministry but 
he doesnt think bakkers plan is viable 
the real big problem for bakker is that i think were going 
to have some better offers than his thats what were waiting 
on to see if they develop said the courtappointed trustee 
mc benton 
bakkers plan to buy back the christian retreat and television 
ministry calls for ptls assets to be appraised at 130 million and 
all lawsuits against him to be dropped 
bakkers conditions were listed in a threepage letter to benton 
released friday by ryan hovis bakkers attorney 
benton said he is uneasy about bakkers plan to use the heritage 
usa theme park as collateral for the 100 million loan he will use 
to buy the ministry benton said bakkers lawsuits against the 
ministry were another hurdle 
in january bakker sued ptl to recover 13 million for a house 
his family had lived in that house was sold for 685000 
ptl countersued for more than 52 million saying bakker and his 
wife tammy faye owed the ministry for excess salaries and 
mismanagement 
the letter released by hovis did not shed any new light on who 
would finance bakkers 100 million loan bakker said the investor 
is foreign and is the head of a company worth 23 billion 
the ministry has been in financial straits since bakker left in 
march 1987 after relevations that he had a sexual tryst with church 
secretary jessica hahn 
benton said he continues to hold talks with businessmen 
interested in buying the theme park just south of charlotte nc 
he hopes to make a recommendation on a buyer to the bankruptcy 
court by august

the crippling drought hitting north america is 
expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food 
shortages in many poor countries the un food and agriculture 
organization reported today 
the agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 
1785 billion tons only two million tons more than last years 
level which was already below the expected production 
if the drought in the united states ended now grain production 
would fall close to the low levels of 1983 when a drought and 
farmers participation in a government crop reduction program 
decreased output the agency reported 
as a result world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 
million tons or 17 percent of the level the agency considers 
necessary to safeguard world food security the report said if 
crop conditions in the united states and canada continue to 
deteriorate the ratio could drop even further 
such a development would have serious implications for the 
food security particularly of many lowincome fooddeficit 
countries the report said 
the high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit 
poor foodimporting countries the hardest the un agency warned 
it said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed 
countries 
the most severely hit crops are coarse grains mostly maize 
barley and oats the report said 
the agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world 
in asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time and production in 
europe and the soviet is expected to be larger than last year 
grain production in south america should be slightly lower this 
year than last 
in the sahel region of subsaharan africa however locusts 
flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this years 
harvest potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million 
tons fao said

us forces on patrol in the persian gulf face 
a more difficult situation than the crew of the uss pueblo says 
the commander of the spy ship whose crew was imprisoned for 11 
months in north korea 
i dont think the persian gulf is anywhere near the situation 
we had retired navy cmdr lloyd bucher said at the 20th reunion 
of the pueblo crew this weekend those guys have it more 
difficult over there 
the gulf is an allout war bucher said 
theyre trying to deal with these harassing attacks and live 
within very constricted rules of engagement he said i dont 
see how any person in the history of the us navy has had to deal 
with the tensions these guys are dealing with i think theyre 
handling it extremely well 
the pueblo armed with only two 50caliber machine guns and 
handheld firearms was monitoring communist ship movements and 
messages in international waters near the north korean coast when 
it was attacked by torpedo boats jan 23 1968 
one crewman died and 10 others were wounded before the vessel 
was seized the 82 survivors were taken to a prison camp where 
they endured beatings and physical and psychological torture 
more than 40 pueblo crew members gathered to renew ties and 
discuss the hardships they endured 
retired chief petty officer jim kell had boarded the pueblo for 
a 30day assignment shortly before the ship became the first us 
military vessel to be captured since 1812 
i would never say i wish it had been somebody else because 
ive been through it and its something im never going to 
forget kell said i wish i hadnt been through it but i 
wouldnt wish it on anybody 
it made 82 people become very close but i know some are 
still bitter about it said kell of el cajon calif 
crewman stu russell said conversation at the weekend 
gettogether was standard reuniontype stuff about families jobs 
and what percentage disability you get from the veterans 
administration 
almost invariably the stories you hear are about funny or 
stupid things that happened during their ordeal the real 
heavyweight stuff isnt talked about much said russell of 
eureka calif 
its still been kind of intense but really good therapy 
the crew members were released on dec 23 1968 after the nited 
states apologized for grave acts committed against north korea 
in its claimed territorial waters

the government today said carlos salinas de 
gortari had a wide lead over his opponents but that election 
results still were not final five days after voters cast ballots 
for a new president 
opposition delegates to the federal electoral commission 
immediately denounced the partial results and said the information 
was misleading 
the partial results finally were released after opposition 
activists blocked highways and shut down international bridges to 
protest the delay 
charges of election fraud and the commissions delay in 
releasing results clouded what had been expected to be an easy 
victory for salinas and his party the governing institutional 
revolutionary party 
the election commission today said salinas has won 5289 percent 
of the ballots counted so far it said cuauhtemoc cardenas of the 
leftist national democratic front trailed with 2910 percent and 
national action party candidate manuel clouthier was third with 
1668 percent 
earlier cardenas had claimed victory and clouthier said he was 
leading 
both men accused the governing party which has not lost a 
presidential election since it was founded in 1929 of rampant 
election fraud 
mexico has 38 million registered voters the government said it 
has counted about 1324 million votes but did not say how many 
ballots were cast 
delegates to the commission from the opposition mexican 
socialist party and national action party said interior minister 
manuel bartlett gave the results without consulting them first 
they charged bartlett who heads the commission bypassed 
votecounting procedures and said the information gave a misleading 
impression that salinas was near victory they said bartlett 
released figures directly from districts without a check from the 
commissions technical committee 
public opinion demands information lets give information 
bartlett countered whether we want to consider it official or 
unofficial it is the information that comes from the district 
committees by telephone and from the computation carried out 
today 
the partial returns also gave 176 seats in the 500seat chamber 
of deputies to the governing party 13 to the rightofcenter 
national action party and two to parties affiliated with the 
national democratic front 
the chamber of deputies is the lower house of mexicos congress 
the election commission only released percentage results for the 
mexican senate giving the governing party 6095 percent of the 
total senate vote the national action party had 1559 percent and 
cardenas party had 731 percent the commission said 
opposition delegates demanded the commission provide 
districtbydistrict figures for the senate bartlett delayed 
action on the request 
the partial results were released early today at the end of an 
election commission session in which opposition delegates 
repeatedly accused the government of fraud and criticized the pace 
of the vote count 
bartlett on sunday defended the election process calling it a 
question of patience politics is the science of patience 
he said the breakdown of a new computer system then bad 
weather prevented the commission from delivering on its pledge to 
release preliminary results on election night it then promised it 
would release results on sunday 
the salinas camp privately has acknowledged probable losses to 
cardenas in at least two states and mexico city firstever 
defeats for the institutional revolutionary party which has never 
lost a presidential senate or gubernatorial race 
the surprisingly poor showing has produced a rift in the party 
between salinas supporters who want to modernize the party and an 
old guard seeking to use the delay to embarrass the salinas camp or 
ensure traditional margins of victory 
bartlett was a top competitor to salinas for the governing 
partys presidential nomination 
at least twice during the weekend salinas aides assured 
reporters the electoral count was proceeding smoothly and results 
were imminent only to be frustrated by commission announcements of 
further postponement 
the opposition charges that the governing party is simply 
devising satisfactory electoral results before it releases them 
the lack of information since the very day of the election has 
created many doubts with respect to the correct management and the 
credibility of the electoral figures cardenas said in a letter 
to bartlett released sunday night 
national action party members coordinated protests on sunday 
particularly in chihuahua state 
hundreds of protesters who blockaded bridges across the rio 
grande in chihuahua state on saturday went home early today after 
the election commission released results that showed the national 
action party won three congressional races in the juarez area 
protesters blocked the cordoba bridge the main link between 
ciudad juarez and el paso texas the smaller zaragoza bridge about 
eight miles east and a bridge at fabens texas about 20 miles 
east of el paso 
the pan american highway outside the state capital of chihuahua 
200 miles south of the us border also was blocked by party 
members saturday night 
similar traffic stoppages took place in the chihuahua cities of 
delicias jimenez and parral

a dynamite blast triggered the 
underground explosion that killed 51 miners in west germanys worst 
mining disaster in 25 years the prosecutor in kassel said today 
shortly after the june 1 disaster officials said they believed 
methane gas had exploded in the stolzenbach mine in borken about 
70 miles northeast of frankfurt 
but prosecutor stephan walcher said today that the fatal 
explosion was sparked when workers set off dynamite to close a 
depleted shaft 
walcher said the dynamite blast ignited coal dust in the air 
sending a powerful shock wave through the mine 
he noted that the use of dynamite is considered normal in mining 
he also said investigators ruled out that a cigarette lighter 
ignited the blast as west german media speculated after the 
disaster 
walcher said that the results of the investigation were only 
preliminary and it would probably take several more months to 
determine if the correct procedures were used in the blasting 
three days after the explosion six surviving miners were 
discovered 500 feet underground after their sounds were picked up 
by a television crews microphone which was lowered into the shaft 
carbon monoxide poisoning killed most of the 51 miners who 
perished

mikhail s gorbachev signed autographs and 
mingled with flagwaving poles today as the soviet leader began a 
sixday visit that is expected to focus on efforts to breathe life 
into both countries economies 
polish leader wojciech jaruzelski was at okecie airport as 
gorbachevs plane arrived on a mild sunny morning after a twohour 
flight from moscow gorbachev was accompanied by his wife raisa 
after the official welcoming ceremonies the gorbachevs 
approached a crowd of several hundred citizens waving polish flags 
on the tarmac gorbachev paused to sign several autographs and chat 
with people in the crowd 
on the drive into warsaw gorbachevs motorcade made an 
unannounced stop at a traffic circle where the soviet communist 
party general secretary greeted onlookers and signed copies of his 
book perestroika the polishlanguage edition is selling on 
the warsaw black market at double the official price of 550 zlotys 
125 
gorbachev and jaruzelski later conferred privately at communist 
party headquarters in warsaw a brief communique by the official 
news agency pap said the two exchanged views on economic political 
and social renewal taking place in their countries 
during the unannounced stop at the traffic circle which was 
televised nationwide gorbachev told a neighborhood official i 
have arrived on your soil only a few minutes and all over i see 
smiles and happy faces i see your friendly relationship toward 
us 
we feel the same way said the neighborhood official 
gorbachev who is personally popular in poland will be working 
during the visit to overcome a traditional antipathy among poles 
toward russians that has existed for centuries 
his visit is to be capped at weeks end by a summit meeting of 
the leaders of the warsaw pact allies 
it will be the first summit of the sovietled alliance since the 
ussoviet summit in moscow and since gorbachevs program of 
political and economic reform was soundly endorsed by the 
extraordinary communist party conference last month in moscow 
polands leaders say the visit coming so soon after the 
conference will give new impetus to their socialist renewal of 
the economy and political system 
the east blocs best organized opposition meanwhile is seeking 
assurances of less soviet interference in polish affairs 
on the eve of the visit however seven members of the outlawed 
polish socialist party were detained when they met in an apartment 
in the southwestern city of wroclaw and police searched the warsaw 
home of the leader of the illegal anticommunist confederation of 
independent poland opposition activists said 
the banned solidarity independent labor federation praised 
gorbachevs program of reform in the soviet union saying it could 
be significant if it serves for changes in the system in poland 
and creation of a new model of polishsoviet relations 
solidarity also urged gorbachev to renounce the brezhnev 
doctrine named after the late soviet leader who intervened in 
the affairs of other east bloc countries ostensibly to protect 
their communist systems 
brezhnev was in power when the government of gen wojciech 
jaruzelski quashed solidarity with a december 1981 military 
crackdown outlawing the federation a year later 
gorbachev in earlier visits to yugoslavia and czechoslovakia 
has emphasized his view that every east bloc country should be free 
to choose its own political course 
solidarity also called for clear and unambiguous words from 
gorbachev on the world war ii massacre of 4000 polish army 
officers in the katyn forest near smolensk which has been blamed 
on soviet soldiers 
during his visit gorbachev is to address the sejm or 
parliament and hold meetings with groups of young people workers 
and intellectuals and artists 
interest in the warsaw pact meeting has intensified amid signs 
the soviets may pull out some or all of their military forces from 
hungary where 65000 troops have been stationed since the soviets 
invaded in 1956 to end a rebellion 
a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said in washington last week that intelligence reports 
indicated preparations for a soviet pullout from hungary 
the warsaw pact includes the soviet union poland east germany 
czechoslovakia hungary romania and bulgaria

the factories of the midwest and the farms of 
the south have a common stake in keeping mississippi river 
bargetraffic moving even if it takes great lakes water to do the 
job sen david pryor dark said today 
if the farmers in the mississippi delta go under the 
automobile workers in detroit are going to go down also 
pryor said on the nbctv today show 
river shipping carries 60 percent of the nations grain 40 
percent of its petroleum and 80 percent of its diesel fuel pryor 
said 
but sen donald riegle dmich said during the program that 
diverting great lakes water would be wasting a resource needed in 
the drought 
that fresh water in the great lakes is 95 percent of the fresh 
surface water we have for the whole country riegle said if we 
send it down the mississippi river to lift the level to float those 
barges that fresh water goes down the river and goes into the gulf 
and becomes salt water so we lose what is a precious resource 
thirteen senators on friday asked president reagan to allow an 
emergency diversion of water from the great lakes to the 
mississippi they proposed increasing the flow from the lakes to 
the river from the 3000 cubic feet per second to 10000 cubic feet 
per second for 100 days 
supporters of diversion said the drought has depressed the 
mississippi river to its lowest level since recordkeeping began in 
1872 stranding as many as 3000 barges with losses to the barge 
and towing industry expected to run as high as 60 million 
opponents said water levels in the great lakes have dropped 3 
feet in the last two years and the water is needed for midwest 
agriculture 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said in a 
kalamazoo mich speech he would not support efforts to divert 
water from the great lakes to the mississippi river 
the pressure to do it in times of emergency is great but in 
many ways it probably would be the worst time to lower the level of 
the lakes because theyre already down in a drought year foley 
said saturday 
a 1986 law forbids new diversions of great lakes water for use 
outside the lakes basin without approval of the governors of all 
the states in the region 
diversion would be a shortsighted policy said ohio gov 
richard celeste chairman of the council of great lakes governors 
on abctvs good morning america 
i am deeply concerned about environmental and economic 
consequences for people in the great lakes states and canadian 
provinces 
each inch the lakes are lowered costs some 200 million in cargo 
carried 10 million in generating power and 3 million to 5 
million in recreation revenue he said 
but sen jim sasser dtenn said on the same program that the 
proposed diversion would lower the lakes by an inch or less while 
raising the mississippi up to 1 foot 
the diversion of lakes water to the mississippi was increased 
during a drought in the 1950s and there were no serious 
environmental effects sasser said

surrounds mount rushmore in the black hills in western south 
dakota the 73000acre park is the second largest state park in 
the nation 
the park was reopened sunday but visitors were not allowed back 
into all of it sunday because of traffic problems on the narrow 
roads as mopup crews worked said fire information officer lynn 
young 
its not because of the fire but because of all the vehicles 
and the buses and the crews moving around doing mopup young 
said 
two fire crews and two engines continued working today dousing 
lingering embers until there is no more smoke one helicopter also 
was kept on alert and a bulldozer was used to clean out fire lines 
in addition roads and campgrounds were still being cleared of 
fire debris and utility workers were restoring electricity and 
replacing utility poles that were burned in the fire said fire 
information officer richard homann 
the fire which began july fourth was contained after

quarter inch of rain young said 
lightning from the storms started nine additional fires but 
they were handled by local firefighters he said 
its enough to keep us a little nervous but we havent got a 
big one going he said 
young said the black hills were just entering the main fire 
season but the drought brought fire problems early this year 
elsewhere firefighters in the bridgerteton national forest in 
wyoming contained the last major fire burning in the forest the 
200acre pocket fire beating a storm front expected to reach 
the area later today with high wind 
however three fires in yellowstone national park covering

the prime minister met first with defense secretary frank c 
carlucci and planned to meet later in the day with deputy secretary 
of state john whitehead 
at the top of crown prince and prime minister sheik saad 
alabdullah alsabahs agenda was a move by congress last week to 
block a purchase of airtosurface missiles from the united states 
opponents of the deal were concerned the mavericks could be used 
against israel in the event of another middle east war 
the missiles were stripped from a 18 billion package of 40 
f18 jet fighter bombers the white house and the state department 
criticized the congressional action and said kuwait should be 
enabled to defend itself with us weapons 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the oilrich 
country faced a threat from iran 
the crown prince flew to washington on sunday aboard a jumbo jet 
that was hijacked in april to underscore his countrys 
denunciation of terrorism the same pilot was at the controls 
kuwait has staunchly refused to negotiate with terrorists it 
has sustained atttacks but refused to yield 17 prisoners held on 
terrorism charges 
the country is considered prowestern but has dealt with the 
soviet union over the years the kuwaiti defense ministry said 
saturday the arms deal with moscow was in accordance with a policy 
of having a diversified source of weapons 
in statements published sunday in kuwaiti newspapers sheik saad 
said the choice of the jet named aljaberiya was made to 
symbolize kuwaits firm rejection of terrorism and blackmail 
the emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah also flew 
aboard aljaberiya when he attended the emergency arab summit 
conference in algiers that concentrated on the palestinian problem 
it was in the algerian capital that a group of terrorists said 
to be proiranian moslem fundamentalists released the plane that 
they commandeered april 5 from a bangkokkuwait flight after a 
16day ordeal and the killing of two kuwaiti passengers 
another kuwait airways jetliner was hijacked in 1985 when two 
american passengers were murdered in both instances kuwait stood 
fast against the demand of the terrorists for the release of 17 
companions in kuwaiti jails convicted for the 1983 car bombing of 
the us and french embassies 
three of the 17 were sentenced to death but the sentences have 
not yet been carried out their release is also a demand of the 
islamic jihad group in beirut in return for release of the american 
hostages that it holds 
sheik saad was interviewed by editors of the kuwaiti newspapers 
alwatan and kuwait times while aboard aljaberiya which is named 
after the emir 
he said his meeting on tuesday with president reagan and with 
other us officials throughout the week would center on 
bilateral relations the iraqiran war the middle east problem

michael dukakis was back in his home base of boston today ready 
for a final round of deliberations on who will join him on the 
democratic ticket jesse jackson says he expects to speak privately 
with dukakis in the coming week about the vice presidency 
as the running drama over a running mate for dukakis plays on 
democrats were preparing for the opening of their convention a week 
from today in atlanta 
republican george bush meanwhile was returning to washington 
today after a weekend at his seaside retreat in kennebunkport 
maine aides speaking on condition of anonymity said the vice 
president the certain republican nominee was preparing to propose 
a strict new conflictofinterest code for public officials 
dukakis has frequently attacked bush over the ethics of reagan 
administration officials including attorney general edwin meese 
iii who last week announced plans to step down 
meese who was under investigation for a year declared himself 
vindicated after an independent counsel decided not to seek an 
indictment of him 
with meese on the way out campaign sources said the vice 
president hopes to take the offensive on the ethics issue they 
said he would spell out his proposals later this month 
bush himself was the target of accusations last week from 
democratic party chief paul kirk who accused him of using public 
funds to pay for campaign appearances bush aides denied the 
allegations 
the vice presidents only public appearance over the weekend was 
at a lithuanian festival on sunday near his vacation home he said 
reforms in the soviet union signal a time of hope but warned 
against complacency or weakness in dealing with moscow 
bush and jackson were speaking to the same agricultural group 
this afternoon in washington and all three contenders had 
appearances set at the naacps convention in washington bush and 
jackson on tuesday and dukakis on wednesday 
dukakis who is struggling to resolve a budget crunch in his 
home state was turning his attention to gubernatorial business 
today after a fourday western trip 
in a string of appearances during his last preconvention 
campaign swing dukakis took bush to task on a variety of issues 
from the pentagon procurement scandal to the vice presidents 
notaxhike pledge 
dukakis says bushs support for higher fees for some government 
services amounts to backing higher taxes bush disputes that 
even as he sought to turn up the heat on bush dukakis responded 
coolly to talk of possible convention disputes with jackson 
i think jesse jackson can do anything he wants to do 
dukakis told reporters in estes park colo on sunday im going 
to the convention and im going to win it 
although dukakis has the delegates to win the nomination on the 
first ballot jackson said over the weekend that my name will be 
in nomination 
let no one mislead you this is not the time for the campaign 
to wind down jackson told his texas delegates in forth worth on 
sunday night 
he suggested that some disagreements with the dukakis camp would 
be aired at the convention 
when you have unresolved matters you have created tension 
he told the delegates 
however he denied reports his forces might stage a walkout at 
the convention over platform disputes 
it would not be to our advantage to walk out jackson said 
saturday in los angeles the threat is not that were going to 
walk out the threat is that were going to stay and expand and 
build and grow and make a difference 
although jackson has met several times with dukakis in recent 
weeks he says the two have yet to discuss in depth the possibility 
of jackson being on the ticket jackson said he expects to have 
such a private talk before the start of the convention on july 18 
the leading contenders for the vice presidential nomination are 
believed to be sens john glenn of ohio bob graham of florida 
lloyd bentsen of texas and albert gore jr of tennessee along with 
reps richard gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton of indiana 
the republicans for their part intend to fight for a share of 
the spotlight during the democratic convention bush intends to 
campaign next week during the gathering but spokeswoman sheila 
tate says details of his schedule have not yet been set

terrorists of mass murder and sentenced them to life in prison for 
the 1980 bombing of the bologna train station which killed 85 
people 
investigators said the aug 2 1980 attack on the stations 
waiting room was the work of neofascists possibly with the help 
from elements of italys secret services seeking to destabilize the 
country and establish a rightwing dictatorship 
sentenced to life were valerio fioravanti 43yearold 
massimiliano fachini 40yearold sergio picciafuoco and francesca 
mambro ages were not given for fioravanti and ms mambro 
also today two defendants were acquitted of mass murder charges 
stemming from the bombing and 11 others were acquitted of 
subversive association charges 
eight of the defendants were convicted and three acquitted on 
charges of belonging to an armed band a blanket charge in 
terrorist cases sentences ranged from six to 16 years 
the jury verdicts were read by presiding judge mario antonnaci 
in bologna criminal court 
among those acquitted on charges of subversive association were 
licio gelli two other reputed leading rightwing terrorists 
francesco pazienza and stefano delle chiaie and two former 
officials of italys secret service police force sismi gen 
pietro musumeci and col giuseppe belmonte 
prosecutor libero mancuso said gelli and pazienza were convicted 
of crimes against the democratic order that is covering up the

convicted on charges of aggravated slander in connection with 
attempts to mislead investigators in the case gelli was sentenced 
to five years on the charge while the three others were each given 
threeyear terms

to critics ferrets are illtempered little 
cousins of the weasel sharpfanged beasts that threaten to spread 
rabies and look like stretchedout rats when their owners parade 
them around on leashes 
george harmon head of the international ferret association 
offers a contrasting view ferrets are love with four legs 
jennifer au would surely agree the 19yearold manassas woman 
went to jail for refusing to produce a ferret authorities believe 
may have bitten a 5yearold boy 
ms au faces a contempt of court hearing thursday after 
arranging to have her ferret whisked away to a location she claims 
not to know meanwhile the boy has had to undergo rabies shots 
with potentially dangerous side effects 
ms au spent five days in jail on a contemptofcourt charge to 
protect her ferret from being killed to perform a rabies test 
displaying a loyalty harmon said is not uncommon among the 
tightknit society of ferret lovers 
im really surprised somebody hasnt gotten killed over a 
ferret said harmon a longtime fancier of the animal whose 
international network has its headquarters in a small office above 
the better business bureau 
if somebody comes into your house to impound your ferret 
wouldnt you fight to protect it he said particularly if it 
was innocent 
harmons group which claims more than 100000 members in 19 
countries registers about 1500 ferrets per month sort of what 
the american kennel club does for dogs but not all its tasks are 
so mundane 
some ferret lovers rescue the animals from authorities in 
california where owning the animals is banned while others hide 
them in new england states where they are outlawed 
the international ferret association is also preparing to wage a 
battle to prevent ferrets from being used as laboratory animals at 
the university of oregon 
the group is raising money to try to keep ms au out of jail so 
far it has collected more than 300 harmon acknowledges that her 
fight to save her ferret is the worst case weve ever had 
authorities must remove the heads of ferrets to test them for 
rabies a viral disease of the central nervous system ms au 
maintains they have already decapitated the ferret that actually 
bit the child as well as a third ferret that was at the scene the 
authorities found no rabies 
the lack of reliable rabies tests that can be performed on 
living ferrets is cited by officials who try to keep the furry 
animals outlawed 
doctors also have documented cases of ferrets attacking babies 
mutilating ears and noses some officials worry that ferrets will 
establish colonies in the wild and disrupt the environment 
harmon said at least six states california new hampshire 
massachusetts rhode island georgia and hawaii have passed laws 
that force ferret owners underground federal statistics show 
ferrets are far less likely to spread rabies than dogs and cats he 
said 
harmon said he has been bitten thousands of times in the 32 
years he has owned ferrets which have been used for centuries to 
catch rats mice and rabbits he has never contracted rabies and 
said few cases of the disease have been attributed to the animals 
which he said number up to 8 million in the united states 
theyve got a mouth anything with a mouth will bite 
harmon said they have teeth like cats yeah theyll draw blood 
but theyll hold on they dont bite and let loose and bite again 
like dogs

sammy ray has been bootlegging research 
funds to study oysters for 40 years but the money has been a 
pittance against the diseases that have ravaged oyster populations 
in bays from maryland to texas 
and now this summers drought from the eastern shore of 
maryland to the nations midsection promises to destroy more 
oyster beds from the chesapeake bay to the gulf of mexico 
were facing one of the most severe crises weve ever had in 
the gulf says ray oyster researcher and coordinator of graduate 
and special programs at texas aampm university 
the situation appears just as dire along the once oysterrich 
shores of the chesapeake bay where rep roy dyson worries that a 
way of life since colonial days may become nothing more than fodder 
for national geographic specials on vacant shucking houses and 
packing sheds 
were on a crash course with disaster if something doesnt 
happen larry simns president of the maryland watermens 
association testified before a house committee last month 
dyson watermen and researchers are making their case for the 
federal governments first concerted study of the oyster which 
dyson calls the worlds most commercially valuable shellfish 
researchers say they know little about the diseases dermo and 
msx that have wiped out oysters in the delaware bay reduced 
harvests by up to 90 percent in some parts of the chesapeake bay 
and wallop the gulf from year to year 
but they do know dermo and msx are onecelled parasites that 
flourish when temperatures soar and salinity rises because of low 
freshwater runoff ray said 
we have been helping ourselves to the oyster these many 
centuries weve been in maryland and now weve got to lend a hand 
to help the oyster says dyson dmd 
without intervention he says watermen of the chesapeake bay 
will become watermen of the past a whole way of life will change 
on the chesapeake bay and its not for the better 
dyson has introduced legislation that would set aside 68 
million over 10 years to support oyster research projects through a 
national oyster disease program to be administered by the chief 
scientist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
according to the staff of the house committee on merchant marine 
and fisheries the domestic oyster harvest has declined since the 
early 1900s landings fell from 90 million pounds in meat weight in 
1929 to an average of 54 million pounds in the 1970s the dropped 
further to 46 million pounds in 1986 the dollar value of the 1986 
harvest was about 78 million 
both dermo and msx are at record levels in the chesapeake and 30 
percent to 50 percent of the oysters harvested in 19861987 died 
from the diseases from a level of 27 million pounds harvested in 
196364 ray said the bays harvest dropped to 8 million pounds by 
the mid1980s 
the gulf of mexico harvest varies annually according to climatic 
conditions ranging in recent years from lows of 13 million to 15 
million pounds a season to highs of 25 million pounds ray said 
a recent study found dermo widely distributed in the most 
productive areas of the gulf with up to 50 percent of the oysters 
dying of the disease in some of the primary production areas of 
texas and florida 
the pacific oyster business reported major mortalities in the 
late 1960s and 1970s and scientists have been unable to identify a 
specific disease the staff said 
although the gulf coast has not shown a downward trend like the 
chesapeake ray worries that may happen particularly if we dont 
get a break in the drought a 50 percent drop in production is 
possible 
nevertheless its very difficult for us to get funding for 
sustained research 
although the dry weather has emperiled many oyster beds health 
officials in louisiana earlier this month opened thousands of acres 
of beds closed for 20 years because the droughtlowered mississippi 
river is carrying less sewage and industrial waste into the gulf 
with the river flow lowered less pollution is being spewed into 
coastal areas where oysters grow 
while some may dismiss the oyster as nothing more than a 
delicacy ray who has a doctorate in biology says oyster beds are 
significant in an estuarys ecosystem 
some of the best fishing areas are oyster reefs a lot of 
organisms are attracted to oysters and they attract fish

us officials expressed optimism for 
prospects of peace in angola as south africa angola cuba and the 
united states opened talks today aimed at ending the longrunning 
conflict 
the officials met at the us coast guard base on governors 
island in new york harbor for talks that are expected to end late 
tuesday or early wednesday said anne stoddard a spokeswoman for 
the us mission to the united nations 
us officials in washington said there were some hopeful signs 
on a timetable for a cuban troop withdrawal from angola as part of 
a peace settlement a peace settlement may also be linked to black 
majority rule in namibia 
one indication is that the soviet union which has provided 
angolas marxist government with billions of dollars in military 
equipment since 1975 has shown interest in ending the conflict 
there through a negotiated settlement said the officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
they also say angola for the first time has accepted the 
principle of a total cuban troop withdrawal 
but cuba has steadily increased its troop commitment to angola 
in the past six months close to 50000 cubans are believed to be 
stationed there compared with 35000 to 37000 last fall the 
officials said 
according to the us officials cuba probably has increased its 
troop deployment to strengthen its bargaining position for the 
negotiations 
the us goal is to achieve a timetable for a full cuban troop 
withdrawal that would take place simultaneously with implementation 
of a united nations security council resolution calling for 
independence in neighboring namibia which has been administered by 
south africa for 70 years 
angola and cuba thus far have said the cuban withdrawal should 
take place over four years while the namibian independence process 
should be consistent with the oneyear timetable specified in the 
un resolution 
but the reagan administration sees the fouryear proposal for 
the cuban withdrawal as an opening bargaining position that is 
subject to change as peace talks proceed disagreement over a 
timetable for a cuban pullback is probably the most difficult 
unresolved issue 
the four parties first met in london in early may and then 
reconvened late last month in cairo egypt in cairo the parties 
agreed that a statement of principles governing future negotiations 
would be useful 
the us delegation will be led by assistant secretary of state 
chester crocker who heads the african affairs bureau and has been 
working on a southern africa peace settlement since he joined the 
administration in 1981 
the angola civil war and the struggle for independence in 
namibia are among the oldest armed conflicts in the world 
the united states is a party to the angolan conflict because it 
has been supporting an anticommunist guerrilla movement since 
1985 but the administration does not regard this involvement as an 
appropriate item for the ongoing negotiations because it believes 
the talks should focus on the withdrawal of foreign forces from 
that country 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border into 
angola in support of the usbacked rebel forces there angolas 
government wants the permanent withdrawal of all south african 
forces from angola 
shortly after the cairo talks ended in late june south african 
troops clashed with cuban and angolan forces in southwest angola 
near the namibian border

president reagan has approved us 
compensation for the families of the 290 people who died aboard the 
iranian airliner shot down by a us warship the white house 
announced today 
spokesman marlin fitzwarter said reagan was acting to ease the 
hardship of the families and said no money would go to the 
iranian government 
fitzwater said that the amount of compensation had not yet been 
decided upon and that the payments could be subject to 
congressional approval 
fitzwater said the payments would be made through an 
intermediary party whom he did not name 
he said that reagan while believing that the actions of the 
uss vincennes were justified defensive actions was also 
saddened at the tragic deaths of the innocent victims of this 
accident 
the spokesman stressed that the payments would be ex gratia 
or voluntary and would be subject to normal us legal 
requirements including if necessary action by congress 
consequently he said details concerning time amount and 
other matters remain to be worked out 
fitzwater also reiterated the us position that iran bears a 
heavy burden for allowing the iran air jetliner to fly over an 
area where a firefight was raging between the vincennes and iranian 
gunboats 
minutes before fitzwater met with reporters reagan as much as 
confirmed that compensation would be paid 
posing for photographers with salvadoran president jose napoleon 
duarte and asked about the matter reagan commented well i have 
said from the start that we are a compassionate people 
reagan has said that he regretted the shooting down of the iran 
air airbus on july 3 by the uss vincennes a navy cruiser whose 
captain had thought the ship was under attack by an f14 iranian 
fighter jet 
the pentagon says the vincennes sophisticated aegis radar and 
tracking system had picked up a radio identification from the 
airbus broadcast on a frequency used only by military aircraft 
leading capt will c rogers iii to conclude that his ship faced 
attack from an f14 
but the president also told reporters last week that he didnt 
want to move too quickly on the question of compensation saying at 
one point that i will await the result of the investigation by 
a naval investigative team sent to the persian gulf 
but when asked during the oval office picturetaking session 
today whether he had decided that compensation should be granted 
the president said we are a compassionate people and i think we 
all have compassion for the families of those unfortunate people 
when he said that a statement would be coming a reporter 
responded i assume its going to be in the affirmative 
reagan nodded his agreement 
asked about public opinion polls showing that a majority of 
americans surveyed had said they opposed paying such compensation 
the president said i think that they have tied that to our 
feelings about the government and what it did with regard to our 
people in the embassy there in tehran when the ayatollah 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini came in 
in saying there would be no payments to khomeinis government 
reagan said 
we dont feel that any such thing is called for as ive said 
we all can have compassion for the innocent people who are the 
victims 
asked whether sending such compensation might send a bad signal 
he said i dont ever find compassion a bad precedent 
asked if he could say how much money would be involved reagan 
replied dont know 
he did say there are some details about that that are still 
being considered and worked out 
administration officials had hinted over the weekend that a 
decision to award compensation was near 
we want to do the right thing michael armacost the 
undersecretary of state said sunday 
armacost said that as compensation for relatives of innocent 
victims of an air tragedy we are considering a humanitarian 
payment to the victims families and that includes a lot of third 
country national families 
the payments would be ex gratia he said using a legal term 
that translates from latin as out of grace and means that the 
party making compensation does not acknowledge culpability 
administration officials have argued that iran should have 
ensured that the airliner did not fly over a firefight that they 
say was started by iranian forces they also say the airplane 
ignored 12 warnings from us warships and did not adequately 
identify itself as a commercial flight 
we would not contemplate payments to the iranian government 
i think one possibility would be through the red cross or 
through the red crescent humanitarian organizations who would deal 
ith the individuals armacost said during an appearance on the 
cbstv program face the nation 
the us ambassador to the united nations vernon walters said 
that when iran takes its case before an emergency meeting of the 
security council on tuesday he will defend the circumstances 
under which this occurred 
and above all im going to urge that the way to stop these 
incidents in the future is to stop the war in accordance with the 
resolution of the united nations of which iran is a member 
walters said on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
we have always maintained that the way to stop these incidents 
is to stop the war walters said nearly a year ago the 
security council passed a mandatory obligatory resolution 598 
calling on all belligerents to stop the hostilities to withdraw to 
internationally recognized boundaries to exchange prisoners of 
war to set up an impartial group to consider the origins of the 
war and the cost of reconstruction 
armacost disputed an accusation by the iranian ambassador to the 
united nations mohammad jaafar mahallati that the united states 
is siding with iraq in the war 
because iraq has accepted the resolution and iran has not 
armacost said we have felt it was appropriate to generate 
pressure to encourage iran to comply by protecting oil tankers in 
the gulf from iranian attack 
the united states has increased the number of warships it 
maintains in the persian gulf since it agreed last year to put 
american flags on 11 kuwaiti oil tankers and escort them through 
the waterway last september the administration directed us 
commanders to assist other tankers that came under attack even if 
they did not carry the stars and stripes 
we remain neutral in the war armacost said objectively 
in some ways there may be the appearance of a tilt but its a 
tilt toward peace not toward iraq the fact of the matter is that 
there is a resolution in the un that calls for a comprehensive 
ceasefire 
our view is that neither country can win the war the 
question is whether they will muster the will to end it 
armacost and walters said they did not take at face value 
declarations by some iranian leaders that they would not seek 
revenge for the deaths of the 290 passengers 
we cant afford to let our guard down and we have upped our 
security alert in the areas armacost said 
walters said the iranian government is composed of extremely 
unpredictable people and its very difficult to say they will or 
will not do anything

the states method of electing state 
district judges was challenged today in a federal lawsuit that 
charges the atlarge system makes it more difficult for 
mexicanamericans and blacks to be elected 
the suit filed in us district court in midland by three 
groups on behalf of the league of united latin american citizens 
and local citizens focuses on approximately 20 counties said 
rolando l rios an attorney 
if judges are to be elected then all members of the 
electorate should have a fair and equal chance to elect judges of 
their choice said domingo garcia chairman of the texas rural 
legal foundation 
the foundation was joined by the southwest voter registration 
education project and texas rural legal aid in filing the suit 
counties named as examples in the lawsuit included harris 
dallas ector mcclennan tarrant midland travis jefferson 
galveston lubbock fort bend smith brazos brazoria taylor 
wichita angelina gregg and bell 
according to the suit those counties contain 190 state judicial 
districts and a combined minority population of nearly 30 percent 
but only 10 of the judges 53 percent are minorities 
the number of minority judges sitting in those counties is 
minuscule said william l garrent a dallas lawyer 
in the atlarge system all the judges in a county are elected 
by the voters of the whole county if a county is mostly white 
that makes it more difficult for a minority candidate to win 
if the county is divided into districts its more likely that 
minorities will make up a majority in at least one of the districts 
the lawyers said many texas counties have only a single state 
district judge and so were not named 
rios said that if the lawsuit is successful and singlemember 
districts are created the number of minority judges in the 
counties could increase from fewer than 20 to more than 110

photographs from antiquity of a roman 
empress hadrians lover antinous and various slaves and private 
citizens go on exhibit thursday on their first trip outside italy 
the 19 marble portrait sculptures from imperial rome are from 
the vast collection of the roman national museum which agreed to 
loan them for an exhibit by the emory university museum of art and 
archaeology 
emory financed the packing shipping and publication of a 
catalog cowritten by maxwell anderson director of the emory 
museum and leila nista inspector of archaeology for the roman 
museum following an international symposium next january on 
private portraiture in the roman world the busts return to italy 
for their first exhibit at the roman national museum 
the current exhibit of roman portraiture will remain at emory 
until jan 3 its here for the longest period of time allowed by 
italian law to the day six months said anderson who was a 
visiting professor at the university of rome last year 
the wealth of information about the original location function 
and method of display for most of the busts furnish invaluable 
evidence about the uses of portraiture in antiquity anderson 
said 
romans from most economic classes could afford lifesized 
sculptured heads of themselves and it was customary for slaves to 
commission their portraits when they were freed he said after 
subjects died their sculptures usually were buried along with 
their remains or were placed on display in a gallery in the home of 
their descendants 
among the marble busts are an elegant woman and an older 
melancholy man fashioned around the time of nero in the first 
century ad 
these were slaves of the first imperial family of rome said 
anderson 
they found in an underground tomb just outside the city walls in 
1847 but have never been displayed until now anderson said 
also on exhibit is a bust of the empress faustina minor found in 
the late 1800s in the roman forums house of the vestal virgins 
this mother of 13 children by emperor marcus aurelius apparently 
was honored with a portrait display for lending her support to a 
renovation of the temple anderson said 
the bust of antinous was found in 1869 in the sanctuary of the 
earth mother goddess magna mater at ostia a seaport colony for 
which hadrian served as benefactor according to the exhibit 
catalog

scrap a policy that forbids the nations high schools to teach 
william shakespeares plays the kenya times reported monday 
the plays were dropped from school courses in 1981 in what an 
official report said was a move to get rid of the colonial 
hangover in independent kenya which gained independence from 
britain in 1963 
moi on sunday urged the education ministry to change its policy 
saying he regarded the british writer as an international 
figure 
the ministry of education dropped shakespeare thinking it is 
colonial but i do not see why it should not be part of our

theres no point in deciding whether special 
stamp cancellations during pope john paul iis visit violated the 
separation of church and state a federal appeals court ruled 
monday 
because the popes 1987 visit is history and no other visits 
are planned the appellants can escape mootness only by showing 
that the postal services action is capable of repetition yet 
evading review the 5th us circuit court of appeals said 
the ruling upheld a decision in texas against a suit filed by 
ralph b shirley and the society of separationists inc against the 
san antonio postmaster 
the lawsuit was filed aug 25 1987 about a month after the 
us postal service announced plans for special hand cancellations 
of stamps at stations in each of the nine cities the pope was to 
visit in september 
it claimed the cancellations marked a religious event thereby 
supporting roman catholicism in violation of the first amendment to 
the constitution 
the district court denied the request for an injunction saying 
that only about 10000 stamps onetenth of one percent of the 
mail processed that day were likely to get the papal cancellation 
on sept 13 in san antonio 
in january the court ruled the question moot so hypothetical 
that it was meaningless to rule on 
shirley and the separationists appealed the postal service had 
honored the pope with stamp cancellations in 1979 1981 twice in 
1984 and in 1987 and was likely to do so again because the pope 
was likely to visit this country again they said 
the court disagreed

colleges are growing increasingly 
sophisticated in their fundraising among alumni turning to 
computers and in some cases using researchers to comb tax forms 
landholding records and divorce decrees to separate the haves from 
the havenots 
the university of michigan added nearly 24628 names to its list 
of potential major donors by asking a quartermillion alumni to 
fill out a detailed census 
michigan which raised 62 million last year and garnered 173 
million in a multiyear campaign for michigan consulted with a 
sociologist and behavioral psychologist in framing its fourpage 
questionnaire in 1986 
the michigan grads were asked not only their job and 
biographical data but their personal and household income how 
they felt about their alma mater and whether they were sending 
their children to ann arbor 
we didnt say it was or it wasnt going to be used to gauge 
their capacity to give said margaret fisher a michigan 
development office worker nearly 115000 alumni responded and 86 
percent gave their income 
the university ranked the potential major donors in 24 
categories and also identified what another michigan development 
officer calls persistent nondonors who may be dropped from 
future solicitations 
fundraising is big business for colleges and universities some 
employ specialists by the score whose fulltime job is to convince 
people to unleash their charitable instinct 
sixtyfive campuses have embarked on drives to raise more than 
100 million apiece washington university in st louis recently 
wrapped up a campaign with a record 607 million in hand and 
stanford university has passed the halfway mark in a 11 billion 
drive launched last year 
the stock market collapse last october made the going tougher 
but it has not derailed any of the major drives 
stanford which took in 198 million last year alone is a 
little bit behind in gifts this year 14 or 15 percent compared 
to last year but so is everybody else said david fulton 
director of communications for the universitys development office 
not all the information on wealthy prospects comes from alumni 
themselves 
many campus development offices as the fundraising operations 
are called have researchers combing public records for clues on 
whom to approach some hire commercial firms to do their 
prospecting 
once confined to consulting dusty alumni files research on 
donors today can include checks of land holdings court records of 
estate and divorce proceedings stock proxies tax forms and 
memberships in clubs and on corporate boards the chronicle of 
higher education noted in its june 22 issue 
in fact college researchers who study donors are so much like 
detectives that they even refer to potential contributors as 
suspects the chronicle reported 
sometimes it added they step on a few toes as when one 
landowner was outraged to learn from a county clerk that a college 
researcher was probing into the size of his holdings 
kathleen foley who checks prospects for carleton college told 
the chronicle that to remain unobtrusive some researchers send 
requests for information on plain white stationery and have the 
responses sent to their home addresses 
according to gerlinda s melchiori the university of michigans 
deputy director of administrative services for development and 
communications alumni surveys can yield what every fundraiser 
dreams of an inhouse prospect ranking system 
writing in the julyaugust issue of currents a magazine 
published by the council for advancement and support of education 
melchiori said michigan used profiles of 2800 known major donors 
to prepare the list of 24628 new prospects more than members 
of our major gift staff have time to pursue melchiori noted 
the rankings she said help us determine who deserves 
additional prospect research and who warrants immediate followup 
the same computer techniques can be used to figure out who isnt 
likely to respond to the pitch 
were now analyzing our socalled persistent nondonors we 
can identify alumni who share their characteristics and thus must 
likely would not be responsive to mail solicitation we will then 
be able to drop people in those groups from our annual mailings 
melchiori wrote 
fisher emphasized were not releasing any information on 
individuals to anyone outside the university

breakdancing thats old if you want to be cool 
in beijing this summer pool is the game 
pool tables have appeared on sidewalks all over the city in a 
craze that participants attribute to television coverage of a 
recent international pool tournament in beijing 
never mind that many of the tables tilt or rock slightly because 
of uneven sidewalks or that the players miss shots more often than 
not 
its fun and there isnt much else to do said a young man 
watching a game on a recent sunday evening 
twelve tables were set up along one city block alone most 
surrounded by young workers drinking soda and according to one 
youth placing bets although no money changed hands openly 
thats why some of them like to play the youth said they 
dont bet much just one or two yuan 27 to 54 cents 
in a city where most residents flee their tiny hot apartments 
on summer evenings and mahjong and card games are the only 
diversions pool is a welcome discovery the tables are set up 
outdoors because few people have the space inside 
shen li a driver who works for a textile factory near beijing 
owns one of the tables he keeps it disassembled in his oneroom 
apartment most of the time and sets it up on bricks on the sidewalk 
at night and on weekends 
some friends and i got together and bought it to amuse 
ourselves said shen a burly man whose pot belly spills out of 
his open cotton shirt and over his belt if other people want to 
play they pay 1 yuan 27 cents per game my friends dont pay 
he said 
game after game was played without anyone paying theyre all 
my friends shen said waving his arm at the crowd of several 
dozen onlookers 
he hasnt yet recouped his 108 investment in the table but he 
isnt worried its just for fun he said 
down the street a man who identified himself as li was less 
generous 
the table cost me 350 yuan 95 said li a skinny man in 
his 20s with dirty feet in plastic sandals i get about 20 yuan 
about 5 a day its not enough 
change your money he asked revealing the real source of 
his earnings changing currency on the black market 
pool is still too new a sport for professional sharks to 
have emerged competition is friendly and lowkey 
everyone lives in the neighborhood and we all know each 
other said one bystander whos the best player there are a 
few not me 
most of the players seemed vague when asked about the rules of 
the game there arent really any rules said shen 
its just like you play in the united states said his 
friend zhang chunsheng whose spreadeagle shooting style won him 
two games li said he and his friends learned from watching 
television 
breakdancing translated in chinese as thunderbolt dancing 
also became a fad in beijing this spring after the american movie 
of that name was shown in theaters 
one pool fan said he thought private circulation of the american 
film the color of money with paul newman as an aging pool 
shark helped boost the games popularity 
its a great movie the youth said 
but police are not keen on the new sport in some neighborhoods 
they periodically interrupt play and order the tables off the 
sidewalks saying they block traffic 
that hasnt happened here shen said this is a small 
street not much activity they dont interfere with us

attorney general edwin meese iii complained 
monday that its not only illegal its unfair that someone 
leaked portions of an independent counsels report on his 
activities 
the new york times published a story saturday that said portions 
of the report by independent counsel james mckay show meese gave 
differing accounts of his knowledge about a possible bribery scheme 
involving a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project 
meese in st louis for an fbi gathering denied he gave 
differing accounts 
asked monday if he knew the details in 1985 of plans to pay the 
israeli labor party money from the pipeline project meese replied 
no i have no recollection of knowing anything about that 
meese said he did not read closely a memo from his longtime 
friend e robert wallach in september 1985 mentioning the planned 
payments to the political party 
the first time i focused on that as i made clear to the 
independent counsel when they showed me the memorandum during the 
course of depositions was in november of 1987 meese said 
mckay submitted his report july 5 under seal to a federal 
appeals court panel in washington the report is to be released 
publicly in a few weeks after people named in it have had an 
opportunity to file responses 
meese said the leaked portions of the report showed only one 
side of the picture 
under the law theres also supposed to be a response filed by 
my lawyers or anyone else who might be mentioned in the report 
he said so its not only illegal its unfair to only have half 
the picture out the publics entitled to the whole picture all 
sides which should be made public when the report is released 
lawfully by the court 
meese who spoke briefly to reporters after giving an address 
that was closed to the media was asked about his belief that he 
had been vindicated 
i have only been talking about the fact that that vindication 
comes from one decision that the independent counsel is required to 
make meese said hes only required to find out if theres 
been any justification to going forward and the decision he makes 
is whether he should proceed with criminal action 
and in this case he has indicated that after a thorough and 
exhaustive investigation he has determined not to take criminal 
action and thats the vindication ive talked about 
meese said he did not believe his actions in the case were open 
to any questions of ethics adding that if any issues are raised 
im prepared to answer them because ive been totally ethical and 
proper as well as lawful in my conduct at all times

leaders of 
15000 native indians in canadas northwest territories have 
rejected a land claim offer from the federal government 
all but four of the 300 delegates to a special joint assembly 
voted sunday to reject the offer of 500 million 415 million 
us in cash and the use of 72000 square miles of land in the 
mackenzie river region 
leaders of the dene indians and the northern metis who are 
halfdescended from french fur traders called for more 
negotiations with prime minister brian mulroney setting a twoyear 
deadline for agreement 
about 1000 indians gathered for a week at hay river indian 
reservation for the heated debate over whether to accept a 
tentative agreement reached in may after protracted negotiations 
some bands wanted to sign the agreement because of the toll 
taken by poverty alcoholism and other chronic problems on indian 
settlements 
but other groups demanded a broader agreement including 
provisions for selfgovernment and clear title to their ancestral 
land in the end there were only three dissenting votes and one 
abstention 
georges erasmus president of the assembly of first nations 
which represents all canadian indians urged dene leaders not to 
nail themselves to the cross of the federal offer anyone too 
tired to continue fighting for their rights should step down he 
said 
the assembly called for a meeting with mulroney and indian 
affairs minister bill mcknight to renegotiate areas such as 
selfgovernment aboriginal title taxation and water rights 
in a letter to the dene and metis last week mcknight termed the 
deal the governments last offer and demanded a decision by july 
15 he warned that ottawa may not be willing to reopen negotiations 
the snare lakes indian band leader alexis arrowmaker said he 
is willing to take that chance we are powerful were strong 
enough to talk to any government 
the dene live below the timber line in a wintry region rich in 
fish game and mineral resources many follow a traditional way of 
life by trapping for furs and hunting caribou 
the original dene and meti negotiators of the land claim said 
ownership of 72000 square miles an area larger than north dakota 
would have made their people the largest private landholders in 
north america 
the government would have retained oil and mineral rights 
underneath most of it but the indians were offered subsurface 
rights for 3200 square miles

an exhibit of soviet paintings many hidden 
for years by order of communist party leaders will go on display 
in washington on tuesday in a new show of soviet openness 
the show called russian and soviet paintings 19001930 
will be at the hirshhorn museum and is considered the first one of 
significance devoted to works from just before and just after the 
1917 russian revolution 
the exhibit of works on loan from moscow and leningrad will 
continue until sept 25 unlike many major art exhibits it will 
not be shown in any other us city 
included are works by marc chagall and vasilii kandinsky who 
are among the bestknown artists of the 20th century both were 
born in russia and died in exile 
chagall was appointed commissar of art for the vitebsk region in 
1918 but became disillusioned with the young soviet state in 1922 
and moved moved to paris he returned to moscow only for a visit 
shortly before his death in 1985 
kandinsky helped reorganize russian museums after the 
revolution he taught in germany from 1923 to 1933 and moved to 
paris when the nazis came to power in germany he died in paris in 
1944 
both chagall and kandinsky were part of the avantgarde or 
vanguard movement in russia which aroused universal interest in 
the early part of the century soviet leaders favored or tolerated 
it at first but later suppressed it in favor of socialist 
realism which supported their political aims 
many avantgarde artists feverishly welcomed the revolution 
equating such revolutionary change with unfettered creativity and 
free experimentation in form the exhibitions catalog says 
artists in the movement fell into the shadows in the early 
1930s stanislav ivanitsky director of soviet painting at the 
state tretyakov gallery in moscow said at a news conference in 
washington on monday it was about 10 or 15 years ago that they 
started coming out 
under leader mikhail s gorbachev the soviets have been 
increasingly open in their political and artistic expression 
next march the soviets will see their first show devoted to the 
work of kandinsky talks about it are now in progress with the 
guggenheim museum in new york ivanitsky said 
also under discussion is an exhibit of american painting to be 
shown in the soviet union in exchange for the present one in 
washington

the united states will not limit its plans for 
spacebased defense as a condition for a strategic nuclear arms 
treaty washingtons chief negotiator said monday on the eve of new 
ussoviet arms talks 
max kampelmen also dismissed soviet calls for a new formal 
commitment by both sides to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
which restricts each country to a missile defense around one site 
he said negotiators have yet to agree on a text pledging both sides 
to observe the pact for a certain period 
negotiatons on a treaty to reduce strategic or longrange 
nuclear arms began in march 1985 and enter their 10th round with a 
plenary meeting tuesday they recessed before the may 29june 2 
summit in moscow between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
neither side has announced an ending date for this round at 
which kampelman said negotiators will try to complete a draft 
treaty cutting strategic arsenals in half 
he said in a statement to reporters that the draft treaty 
includes many key provisions that are completely agreed but 
much that is important still remains to be resolved 
kampelman and soviet chief delegate alexei obukhov had lunch 
together monday and discussed issues of substance kampelman 
said but would not elaborate in response to questions from 
journalists he said they should not expect rapid progress 
negotiators probably will work carefully and not be 
watching the calendar he said adding dont look for drama 
were at a stage now where hard work is required rather than 
drama 
the chief us delegate said he hopes this round will at least 
significantly narrow the differences and expressed the belief 
a treaty can be completed before reagan leaves office in january 
the superpowers signed a treaty in december to destroy their 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
obukhov said when he arrived sunday that the talks should not be 
allowed to lose momentum 
both sides agree the treaty should reduce their longrange 
arsenals over seven years to an overall limit of 6000 warheads and 
1600 launchers such as intercontinental missiles and heavy 
bombers 
a principal argument is over limiting nucleartipped cruise 
missiles on warships on saturday obukhov linked progress at the 
talks to resolving that issue 
the united states rejected a soviet proposal for inspectors to 
be allowed aboard ships and says no other satisfactory 
verification methods have been found the sides have agreed not to 
include the shiplaunched missiles in the 6000warhead ceiling 
a longstanding problem in negotiations on reducing strategic 
arms is the soviet demand that they be linked to limits on the us 
effort to develop a spacebased defense system the strategic 
defense initiative commonly called star wars 
we reject soviet attempts to use these negotiations to have us 
end our strategic defense initiative kampleman said 
kampelman mentioned these other major areas of disagreement 
the us desire for limits on each kind of intercontinental 
ballistic missiles within the overall limit of 6000 
how to count airlaunched cruise missiles and keep track of 
mobile missiles 
scores of questions on verification 
related understandings reached at the moscow summit included 
counting all existing longrange airlaunched cruise missiles and 
distinguishing between bombers that carry them and those that do 
not 
on mobile missiles the sides agreed to restrict them to 
designated territories as a means of making the count simpler the 
size of the areas was not determined

a helicopter plucked two convicted 
murderers and a thief from a state prison yard under fire from 
guards today but the chopper was forced down and those aboard were 
captured after an 80mile aerial chase officials said 
the helicopter flew into the penitentiary of new mexico about 
950 am and picked up the three inmates said don caviness a 
spokesman for the new mexico corrections department 
it flew to midvalley airport in los lunas about 80 miles south 
of here where it was met by three state police officers caviness 
said 
two of the inmates got out of the helicopter and one of them 
was wounded and captured in a gun battle according to ronni crago 
spokeswoman for the bernalillo county sheriffs department the 
helicopter took off again and the other inmate fled into on foot 
and was being hunted crago said 
the chopper was then chased across the albuquerque area by a 
us customs service helicopter and other aircraft and forced down 
at albuquerque international airport two people were taken into 
custody at the airport authorities said 
caviness said about 100 inmates were in the prison recreation 
yard at the time of the escape he said guards opened fire from two 
towers but he didnt know if the helicopter was hit 
the penitentiary was immediately locked down and a head count 
was taken to determine who escaped caviness said 
caviness when asked whether todays type of escape ever was 
envisioned said this is beyond what we had planned for 
the inmates were identified as daniel mahoney 30 serving life 
plus 60 years for seconddegree murder and armed robbery in 
florida francis preston mitchell 26 serving life for 
firstdegree murder in utah and randy mack lackey 19 of curry 
county nm serving a nine year sentence for larceny 
mahoney and mitchell were being held under an interstate compact 
that provides for exchange of prisoners caviness said lackey was a 
helicopter pilot and was wounded in the gun battle at los lunas 
in a previous helicopter escape in november 1986 a woman 
serving time for bank robbery was snatched from the yard of a 
federal prison at dublin calif by her lover the couple were 
caught 10 days later in a shopping mall while picking up a set of 
wedding rings 
the escape prompted federal prison officials around the country 
to build chopper stoppers massive wire grids covering prison 
yards and other open areas about 20 of 47 federal prisons had such 
barriers in place or under construction by the end of 1986 the 
federal bureau of prisons said 
in december 1987 two prisoners fled a maximumsecurity in 
britains first helicopter escape the helicopter had been 
chartered to fly over a golf course then the pilot was forced at 
gunpoint to land at the prison 
in july 1987 a man awaiting trial for bank robbery escaped from 
prison in nice france by grabbing onto a rope dangling from a 
helicopter he and an accomplice were captured because some 
children thought they were seeing a movie being filmed and followed 
the men to their hideout 
the new mexico prison suffered one of the most deadly riots in 
us prison history when 33 inmates were killed by fellow prisoners 
on feb 23 1980 
the prison suffered a mass escape on july 4 1987 when seven 
prisoners broke out all were eventually recaptured

the soviet unions military chief of staff 
announced monday an agreement designed to ease superpower friction 
through creation of a militarytomilitary working group but 
said the red army plans no unilateral withdrawal from central 
europe 
ending a weeklong tour of the united states marshal sergei 
akhromeyev met with president reagan at the white house before 
unveiling the agreement at the pentagon with the chairman of the 
us joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe 
along with creation of the joint working group designed to head 
off brushfire incidents between the two sides the two officials 
also announced future tour exchanges among top commanders and 
several other steps designed to enhance mutual understanding 
including port visits by warships 
akhromeyev and crowe flanked by their national flags were in a 
jovial mood and gingerly handled questions that each might have 
exploited to stress their disagreements 
we do have some differences acknowledged crowe 
obviously we did not try to paper those over 
but i also think that we clarified our perspectives we 
probably cleared up some misunderstandings and i think we formed 
the basis for further exploration said the american admiral 
akhromeyev generously thanked crowe for taking him on the us 
tour unprecedented for such a highranking official of the soviet 
defense ministry where he is no 2 man next to defense minister 
dmitri yazov the visit included a cruise aboard an aircraft 
carrier at sea a peek inside a b1 bomber a visit to a missile 
training facility a rodeo a barbeque the gift of an indian 
headdress and a trip to crowes alma mater the university of 
oklahoma 
at the news conference the two announced agreement to form a 
joint military to military working group to explore the issue 
of dangerous military activity in greater detail and make 
recommendations 
examples of the sort of friction the group will attempt to 
resolve in the future include the fatal shooting by soviet soldiers 
of us maj arthur nicholson in east germany in 1985 and the 
bumping incident involving us and soviet ships in the black sea 
last feb 12 
to stimulate longrange contact crowe and akhromeyev also laid 
out a twoyear exchange program beginning this fall with a meeting 
between senior us and soviet commanders in central europe 
also on the agenda are a return visit to the soviet union by 
crowe in the summer of 1989 port visits by warships and tour 
exchanges of doctors historians the commanders of the services 
and a marksmanship competition 
despite the comraderie akhromeyev apparently made little 
progress convincing crowe the heavily publicized soviet doctrine 
of defensive sufficiency has reduced the threat posed by warsaw 
pact forces akhromeyev said in the past soviet military doctrine 
allowed for both offensive and defensive military operations now 
we are introducing some changes in order to make the military 
doctrine purely defensive in character 
of course we realized that our methods of troop training were 
a matter of concern especially in european countries he said 
speaking in russian 
in accordance with the new defensive doctrine we are 
beginning to introduce some changes in the organizational structure 
of the soviet armed forces in order to impart a defensive nature 
to the armed forces but this will demand some time he said 
the complete realization of the changes bears on bilateral 
steps therefore we must sit at the negotiating table and address 
the outstanding issues between us he said meaning that the 
kremlin expects the west to make simultaneous cuts 
akhromeyev brushed aside us intelligence reports that some red 
army units might be pulled out of hungary repeating an earlier 
declaration there would be no unilateral withdrawals from eastern 
europe 
crowe carefully avoided repeating his past skepticism of the new 
soviet doctine saying only that in his conversations with 
akhromeyev i expressed some of our concerns and reservations and 
the marshal told me to keep watching and to watch very closely and 
i intend to do that 
akhromeyev told him to watch exercises deployments 
structuring of units crowe said 
the most significant aspect of marshal akhromeyevs visit 
is the opportunity he has had in the last days to take the measure 
of the people who operate that equipment young men and women who 
love their country and their way of life crowe 
akhromeyev thanked crowe for taking his time to educate me in 
many ways he was telling me how the american nation was 
developed 
he told me how the american mind became how it is and i have 
never read anything like that in any books the soviet marshal 
said drawing laughter from the military officers and reporters in 
the room 
the soviet marshal said he had been especially impressed with 
the roads which crisscross the american great plains at one mile 
intervals and said that his nation was trying to improve its rural 
transportion system to make sure that more food gets from the field 
to the table

hundreds of residents of this coastal town 
showed up to help search a beach where a missing teenagers 
bicycle was found hidden in the brush 
within days state police concluded that 15yearold dorene 
raterman had been killed at del ray beach just a halfmile from 
her home and then two men were arrested in connection with her 
death 
but dorenes body has not been found and that leaves the case 
resting largely on the testimony of one of the men under arrest 
described as slightly retarded who says the other one admitted 
killing the girl the second man denies it 
and as frustration and anger grow theres been talk in town of 
vigilantism 
my son works in a plywood mill and he says thats all they 
talk about said jon g blissett operator of the gearhart 
chevron station for 26 years theres a lot of people who would 
like to get these two guys out of jail theyd get them to talk 
for judy and jack raterman parents of five boys waiting for 
final word on their only daughter is a nightmare 
its the most helpless thing in the world mrs raterman 
said in an interview theres nothing anybody can do its like 
being stabbed with a knife every day 
dorene left a note to her parents on june 15 saying she would 
return home soon from a bike ride to del ray beach 
the beach is something we all frequent mrs raterman said 
its just a very quiet peaceful place normally it doesnt get a 
lot of traffic like some of the other beaches do 
police got their first major break in the case when a man 
reported seeing a girl on a bicycle and two men in a gold mgb 
sports car near the beach the evening of june 15 
the description of the car led them to tiac k eastman 25 of 
astoria son of a former county sheriff eastman admitted he and 
anthony p mullins both dishwashers at a hotel in nearby seaside 
had driven to the beach that night in eastmans car to drink beer 
and talk according to a court affidavit 
eastman told police he and mullins saw the girl and mullins 
went to talk to her he said he later heard a scream and that when 
mullins returned he told eastman he had strangled the girl with a 
small chain he carried to secure his wallet the affidavit said 
although eastman indicated several areas where the body might be 
found searches yielded nothing he was indicted on a charge of 
hindering prosecution for allegedly driving mullins from the scene 
the affidavit also said police seized bloodstained clothing and 
a set of radio earphones from the apartment of mullins father in 
seaside mullins 20 stayed there until he left for san francisco 
where he was arrested june 29 
the blood was the same type as dorenes and the ratermans told 
police they believed dorene had her portable radio when she went to 
the beach the affidavit says 
mullins has said hes innocent and an automatic innocent plea 
was entered at his arraignment monday he was held without bail on 
kidnapping and murder charges 
police wont speculate publicly on a motive 
it wasnt a premeditated act it was just a crime of 
opportunity said ed hauer jr coordinator of the clatsop county 
search and rescue team 
district attorney steve gerttula wont speculate whether he has 
enough evidence to convict mullins 
without the body the case appears to rest heavily on the 
testimony of eastman if his testmony is thrown out of court 
mullins could be set free gerttula said 
that could put mullins in greater trouble in the community 
when mullins was taken to court for arraignment last week he 
wore a bulletproof vest when eastman was arraigned the hearing 
was held in secret because the judge feared for eastmans safety

the interior ministry today closed 
down the roman catholic churchs radio station accusing it of 
inciting to violence disorder and lack of respect for 
constitutional government 
monsignor bismarck carballo director of radio catolica told 
the associated press the order was unjust and arbitrary 
on sunday police used tear gas and beat protesters to break up 
an antigovernment demonstration by about 10000 people president 
daniel ortega said the rally was part of a us plan to destabilize 
the leftist sandinista government 
an official in the interior ministrys press office who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said the radio station was ordered shut 
down because of its broadcasts about the demonstration 
carballo said however all stations in the country reported 
yesterday about those events 
what most concerns us that in our programming yesterday we 
repeated a pastoral letter from the bishops issued june 29 and a 
homily by cardinal miguel obando in which the right of the people 
to civic protest is defended the monsignor said 
obando y bravo who has been a leading critic of the sandinistas 
in their nine years of rule delivered his homily sunday 
radio catolica was closed by the government on jan 10 1986 it 
was allowed to reopen last september under the central american 
peace agreement signed by ortega and the regions four other 
presidents in august 
its news programs were closed for brief periods on june 2 and 
june 10 
meanwhile miriam arguello leader of the opposition 
conservative party was detained by police during the night the 
interior ministry official said she was accused of being the 
principal instigator of yesterdays events in nandaime 
sundays antigovernment rally one of the largest ever in 
nicaragua was held in nandaime a small city 40 miles south of 
managua 
ten police officers were injured and at least 38 people arrested 
in the confrontation the official voice of nicaragua said it did 
not say how many protesters were hurt 
the opposition said three of its leaders were arrested 
this is to show the people want democracy protester myriam 
arguello secretarygeneral of the antigovernment conservative 
party said just minutes before the demonstration turned into a 
melee 
ortega told reporters afterward that his leftist government 
would act with total firmness against protesters 
we cannot continue being tolerant with those who want to take 
advantage of the political space he said referring to recent 
freedoms accorded antigovernment groups in nicaragua 
he said the demonstration was part of a us plan to destabilize 
the government 
ortega made the comments after visiting the family of a 
sandinista youth organization member authorities said was killed 
saturday when the car he was riding in was ambushed by usbacked 
contra rebels 
the violence began after protesters some carrying signs that 
read democracy yes communism no marched several blocks along 
nandaimes mudcovered streets to gather in an open field for 
speeches 
scores of police with gas masks and ak47 rifles stood guard 
nearby 
were here to make sure that order is kept an officer said 
witnesses said people began screaming and running for cover when 
police began lobbing teargas canisters into the crowd 
groups of protesters hurled stones and sticks back at the 
officers and one man yelled you murderous dogs 
police beat several people with their fists feet and rifle 
butts one man stood stunned blood dripping down his face his 
arms cut 
witnesses said police threw one of the rally organizers carlos 
huembes to the ground then punched and kicked him 
plainclothes security agents confiscated film from several 
photographers including one from the associated press 
police used the tear gas after protesters began hurling rocks a 
state security officer told the ap 
the demonstration was organized by the democratic coordinate an 
umbrella group for antigovernment political parties and trade 
organizations it was authorized by the government which staged 
its own prosandinista rally in the town over the weekend 
roger guevara secretary of the coordinate said in a statement 
that huembes and two other coordinate members arrested at the rally 
were being detained sunday night the statement identified them as 
agustin jarquin anaya and adan fletes of the social christian party 
public discontent with the sandinistas has increased this year 
as nicaraguas economy worsens and the governments war against the 
contras remains unsettled 
the government claims the reagan administration its last 
request for renewed military aid to the contras killed by congress 
in february has been attempting to stir up discontent in nicaragua 
the sandinista government was established in july 1979 after a 
civil war toppled the rightist government of anastasio somoza 
the usbacked rebels have been fighting the government for 
nearly seven years but they signed a preliminary peace accord on 
march 23 and have since held several rounds of talks aimed at 
forging a lasting peace 
a tenuous ceasefire remains in effect as the two sides 
negotiate conditions for future talks

a man convicted of faking a plane crash 
during a blizzard was sentenced monday to a year in prison and 
ordered to have a psychiatric evaluation 
the radio report of a downed jet with three dead passengers and 
a badly injured pilot sparked a search that cost 50000 and 
involved as many as 100 people 20 aircraft and six police agencies 
mark blair 29 was convicted may 4 of making a false report to 
the government which carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a 10000 fine 
blair said he was not surprised by the sentence but insists he 
is innocent and plans to appeal i feel that the jury didnt 
listen blair said 
us circuit court judge hugh bownes standing in for ailing 
us district judge shane devine said at the sentencing that blair 
must have known the report would set off a massive ground and air 
search 
it seems obvious to me that there is some kind of mental 
aberration involved for a normal person to set this kind of event 
in action said bownes who recommended that blair be sent to a 
federal prison in butner nc that has psychiatric facilities 
he also ordered blair to seek counseling during two years 
probation after he serves his sentence 
at blairs trial david webster a navy reservist and delta 
airlines pilot said he and his navy crew tracked the voice of a 
man who talked sporadically saying he was loosing blood was 
chilled and weak and that at least one person in his plane was 
dead 
they were on a flight from florida to maine on jan 8 when they 
were asked to assist in the search webster testified the crew was 
overcome by emotion when the man said he heard the navy plane 
overhead 
people in my plane were screaming and yelling i got tears 
in my eyes thinking were going to get this guy out webster 
said 
blair testified he couldnt have committed the hoax because he 
was asleep 
but one of his neighbors in laconia about 20 miles north of 
concord said he heard the sound of a twoway radio through blairs 
window and a voice crying out for help 
bownes denied a request that blair be released while he appeals

outcome of the booster rocket test in utah is a requirement for the 
launching to take place 
nasa spokesman david garrett said the test motor will have to be 
disassembled as far as the center field joint for evaluation and 
possible repairs and then be reassembled 
that he said will reuire rescheduling of the test from july 25 
to at least midaugust but he added we do not expect it 
will affect the sts 26 launch schedule 
sts26 is the official designation for the first flight of a 
space shuttle since a 1968 explosion destroyed challenger and 
killed seven crew members 
edward s campion a national aeronautics and space 
administration spokesman said a morton thiokol worker damaged the 
test rocket over the weekend while attempting to install a gauge 
that was to be used during a test firing 
it the gauge was installed with an incorrect setting which 
caused the hardware to be damaged said campion 
ed medal a spokesman for nasas marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala said the rockets center field joint was 
inadvertantly overpressurized during leak checks 
he said one section of the joint was subjected to pressure of 
1000 pounds per square inch another section he said was to have 
been checked at 100 psi but was mistakenly subjected to the higher 
pressure 
the rocket engine was to be test fired in utah on july 25 
campion said nasa officials have said that that test must be 
successfully completed before the space shuttle can fly again 
space shuttle discovery is now on a launch pad at the kennedy space 
center in florida and is scheduled to be launched early in 
september 
campion said officials are trying to determine how long the test 
firing in utah will be delayed by the needed repairs and if this 
delay will affect the space shuttle launch 
the test rocket in utah incorporates a new booster design 
created after the january 1986 challenger accident which killed 
seven astronauts space shuttle challenger exploded after its 
launch from the kennedy space center the explosion was blamed on a 
flawed rocket booster design the space shuttle fleet has been 
grounded while the booster had been redesigned and tested 
nasa officials said the july 25 test was crucial for clearing 
the shuttle for the resumption of space flights

a court on monday sentenced four 
rightwing terrorists to life in prison after convicting them of 
mass murder for a 1980 bombing that killed 85 people at bolognas 
train station 
the attack was described by prosecutors as a neofascist plot to 
undermine italys democracy 
the court also convicted two defendants of slander francesco 
pazienza the exfinancier linked to several criminal cases in 
italy and licio gelli the exgrandmaster of the secret propaganda 
due p2 masonic lodge 
the lodge allegedly backed rightwing terrorism and its members 
included politicians military men and leading industrialists 
but the court citing insufficient evidence acquitted gelli and 
pazienza of a more serious charge of subversive association 
the verdicts came after a 1year trial in which 200 witnesses 
testified 
the aug 2 1980 attack in this northern italian city injured 
200 people and demolished the waiting room filled with holiday 
travelers at the station 
prosecutors said the terrorists hoped the massacre would help 
throw italy into confusion paving the way for an eventual rightist 
dictatorship they said some of the defendants who were members of 
italys secret services at the time of the attack aided the 
terrorists 
the jury led by judge mario antonacci said the four defendants 
who received life sentences italys stiffest penalty were 
convicted of mass murder for by carrying out the bombing they are 
valerio fioravanti his wife francesca mambro massimiliano 
fachini and sergio picciafuoco 
acquitted of the massacre charge for lack of evidence were paolo 
signorelli and roberto rinani prosecutor libero mancusa had 
accused signorelli a professor of masterminding the bombing 
but signorelli was convicted of belonging to an armed band a 
blanket terrorism charge used by italian prosecutors and 
sentenced to 12 years in prison and rinani got a sixyear sentence 
for conviction on the same charge 
in all eight defendants were convicted and three acquitted on 
charges of belonging to an armed band sentences ranged from six to 
16 years 
in addition 11 defendants were acquitted of subversive 
association 
among those acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence of charges 
of subversive association were stefano delle chiaie a reputed 
leading rightwing terrorist and two former officials of italys 
secret service police force sismi gen pietro musumeci and col 
giuseppe belmonte 
after convicting gelli pazienza and the two former secret 
service officials of aggravated slander the court sentenced gelli 
to five years in prison and the other three to three years each 
gelli wont have to serve his sentence however under terms of 
his extradition last year from switzerland he can only be tried in 
italy on charges connected to the 1982 collapse of the milanbased 
banco ambrosiano italys largest postwar banking scandal he was 
already being tried in absentia when the extradition agreement with 
switzerland was made 
pazienza was arrested in new york in 1985 and extradited on 
charges of fraud in the banco ambrosiano case 
the slander charge was based on a 1981 incident in which 
explosives similar to the kind used in the 1980 bombing were found 
on a train at bolognas station the prosecutor contended gelli 
pazienza musumeci and belmonte misled investigators into 
concluding the explosives found in 1981 were linked to other 
rightists terrorists in italy and west germany

a 40by8foot wall denouncing apartheid 
in south africa will remain under police protection at its 
prominent yale university site until school officials decide its 
fate this fall 
yale secretary sheila wellington said sunday the school will 
review its policies on freedom of expression when students and 
faculty return and it did not seem to be the mature thing to do 
to destroy the wall before the review 
university officials originally told antiapartheid activists 
the plywood wall which replaced symbolic shanties destroyed by 
arson june 5 could stay for four days however the school later 
decided it could be erected periodically if it were dismantled and 
put in storage for the summer 
obviously to react in haste while the university is not in 
session and while we cannot have the benefit of the ideas and 
opinions of faculty and staff and students seems to us to raise 
problems accordingly wellington said 
yales coalition against apartheid which built the wall 
declared the decision a victory 
the coalition had said it would not dismantle the structure 
until yale sold all its stock holdings in companies that do 
business in south africa 
wellington said it was not a victory for the coalition but a 
decision by yale president benno c schmidt and herself to 
carefully review the schools position 
yale has provided 24hour police protection for the structure 
which wellington said has been the subject of several arson threats 
the wall was built june 16 to replace a shantytown that had 
stood in the same location for more than two years

the us army corps of engineers is still 
weeks away from deciding whether more great lakes water should be 
diverted to the droughtdepleted mississippi river officials said 
monday 
the white house which last month ordered the corps to examine 
the issue has set no deadline despite mounting regional reguests 
for more river water 
there are a lot of traps to watch out for environmental 
engineering international concerns treaties that would be 
involved said white house spokesman bj cooper it is not a 
simple decision 
corps spokesman mike keuss said the study would be completed 
hopefully by the end of july 
thirteen senators on friday urged president reagan to authorize 
diversion of an additional 7000 cubic feetpersecond of great 
lakes water into the mississippi where low levels have stalled as 
many as 3000 barges the request similar to one made in late june 
by illinois gov james thompson proposed increasing the diversion 
rate to 10000 cubic feetpersecond for 100 days 
the proposals set off an interregional squabble between 
officials of states bordering the great lakes and those depending 
upon the mississippi 
we are a union and when one of our states and several of our 
states find themselves in trouble we try to come to each others 
help said sen david pryor dark in an appearance on nbcs 
today show were not asking for anything that would damage 
the lake michigan area 
sen donald riegle dmich on the same program said he 
foresaw the likelihood of immediate lawsuits if reagan were to 
authorize the diversion 
we need to preserve this water it is very important to 
the future of the country if were ever going to use it we ought 
to use it to drink and not to float ships down the mississippi 
riegle said 
under a 1986 law any increase in the diversion rate requires 
the approval of the governor of each of the eight great lakes 
states 
only thompson of illinois has said he favors increased diversion 
the governors of michigan ohio wisconsin and minnesota have 
said they oppose diverting more water 
indiana and new york were awaiting completion of the corps study 
before deciding whether to support or oppose greater diversion 
we have an open mind on this question said indiana lt gov 
john mutz chairman of the states drought advisory commission 
the state would not approve diversion for purposes other than 
navigation he said i would not want them sticking their hoses 
into this river and irrigating out of there at a time when we are 
actually rationing our water for farmers in indiana he said 
pennsylvania has not stated a position 
supporters of diversion said the drought has depressed the 
mississippi river to its lowest level since recordkeeping began in 
1872 stranding as many as 3000 barges with losses to the barge 
and towing industry expected to run as high as 60 million 
opponents said water levels in the great lakes have dropped 3 
feet in the last two years and the water is needed for midwest 
agriculture 
the lower lake levels have not hindered the st lawrence 
seaways ability to carry goods said james emery administrator of 
the us st lawrence seaway development corp 
he suggested the seaway which connects the great lakes and the 
atlantic ocean would be a viable economic alternative for 
moving cargo stranded by low water on the mississippi

iran is still searching for 
the black box recorder that may hold important information 
about the flight of a jetliner shot down by a us warship the 
iranian navy commander said monday 
commodore mohammed hussein malekzadegan spoke after the 
englishlanguage dubai newspaper khaleej times quoting salvage 
experts it did not identify said iranian frogmen recovered the 
flight recorder in the persian gulf a couple of days ago 
malekzadegan said in an interview on tehran radio the black box 
may have been destroyed when missiles fired by the cruiser uss 
vincennes hit the iran air airbus on july 3 killing all 290 people 
aboard 
its also possible that we may find it he said in any 
case the search is continuing 
data in the recorder could help determine whether the airbus 
a300 received radio warnings from the vincennes the pentagon says 
the jetliner did not respond to warnings and the cruisers radar 
operators mistook the plane for an f14 fighter because it seemed 
to be emitting militarytype responses 
american officials have backed away from earlier claims that the 
plane was descending or was outside civilian flight lanes 
the khaleej times said the salvage experts it quoted had worked 
with iran in the past and expressed surprise that recovery of the 
black box had not been announced 
it also quoted itays commander in the gulf rear adm angelo 
mariani as saying the heavy air and sea traffic could complicate 
investigations of the tragedy 
there are so many boats small and big ships airliners 
military jets of various kinds he said 
mariani said the italian frigate espero heard a us warship 
not identified radio at least one warning to an aircraft shortly 
before the airbus was shot down the khaleej times said 
since we only listen to military frequencies i cannot confirm 
whether the same message was repeated on the civilian international 
frequency or not but i assume it must have been he was quoted 
as saying 
pentagon spokesmen said repeated warnings were sent on military 
and civilian channels 
in london the sunday times said a british intelligence report 
based on monitored radio communications is severely critical of 
the us navy for shooting the airliner down 
according to the times the report says iran air flight 655 left 
bandar abbas for dubai only three minutes late was on the correct 
flight path and was climbing when the missiles struck 
it said the report suggested a skirmish with armed iranian 
speedboats in which the shooting started july 3 may have been 
provoked by us helicopters entering iranian air space the 
vincennes and the uss elmer montgomery destroyed two boats and 
damaged one before the cruiser shot the plane down 
the us navy was escorting the years 46th convoy of 
usflagged kuwaiti tankers monday moving up the gulf to the 
sheikdom the 294739ton products carrier townsend was accompanied 
by the frigate robert g bradley said a spokesman at us central 
command headquarters in tampa fla 
eleven kuwaitowned tankers have been given us registraton so 
the navy can protect them convoys began in july 1987 
a navy investigation of the airbus disaster was in its sixth day 
monday and the vincennes was anchored off bahrain with two barges 
alongside its crew has been restricted to the ship for security 
reasons with sailors allowed ashore only in small groups to make

two crew members of a jordanian airliner 
hijacked in 1985 have entered us protective custody in order to 
testify against a suspected lebanese terrorist charged in the case 
a prosecutor said monday 
the disclosure that the two unidentified members of the royal 
jordanian airliner had entered the federal witness protection 
program was made at a pretrial hearing in the case of fawaz 
younis charged with leading the june 11 1985 hijacking 
the former airline employees left their homes in the middle east 
and were placed under us protection following their decision to 
testify in the trial assistant us attorney ramsey johnson told 
us district judge barrington d parker 
a middle eastern man who identified younis at a courtordered 
lineup is also being sought as a witness johnson said 
the fbi is trying to locate the man who was a passenger on 
board the hijacked airliner because we believe he is an 
excellent witness he added 
a former member of lebanons shiite amal militia younis was 
arrested last september after he was lured aboard an fbichartered 
yacht in the mediterranean by the prospect according to fbi 
agents of completing a drug deal 
jamal hamdan a former resident of cyprus who cooperated with 
the fbis efforts to entice his former friend onto the yacht is 
also in protective custody 
the federal witness protection program gives people new 
identities and helps them set up life in a new location to protect 
them from reprisals for testifying against criminal defendants 
younis is awaiting trial on charges that he led a group of five 
armed men who stormed the boeing 727 at beirut international 
airport and forced it to fly to several locations around the 
mediterranean before it returned to beirut 
the planes 74 passengers and crew members including several 
jordanian sky marshals were let off the plane before it was blown 
up on the runway 
parker indicated that he had found a classified document that 
contradicts an earlier prosecution statement that the fbi never 
considered placing a defense lawyer on the navy ship where younis 
was interrogated four days after his arrest 
the secret document was forwarded to the us court of appeals 
here which is considering whether younis confession to fbi agents 
should be admitted as evidence 
parker ruled in february that the confession was illegally 
obtained because younis suffering seasickness and pain from two 
broken wrists was in no condition to exercise his constitutional 
right to remain silent 
younis suffered the two wrist fractures when fbi agents slammed 
him to the deck of the yacht 
in his opinion which prosecutors have appealed parker said he 
couldnt understand why the fbi during its lengthy planning of the 
arrest operation had not considered putting an attorney aboard the 
navy vessel to advise younis during the interrogation 
at mondays hearing the judge noted that johnson had previously 
told him the idea just didnt come up 
parker indicating the secret document he had examined 
contradicted that answer told johnson you are charged with the 
knowledge of the information contained in the secret documents 
turned over to the court 
on june 30 the appeals court ordered parker to conduct a 
hearing on admitting the document into evidence under the 
classified information procedures act 
the appeals court said the document raises questions that go 
directly to younis claim he was denied a right to counsel during 
his interrogation 
parker gave johnson 48 hours to contact government agencies 
about declassifying the document and scheduled a hearing for july 
18

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev offered 
monday to withdraw an unspecified number of air forces from eastern 
europe if nato drops plans to deploy 72 usbuilt f16 
fighterbombers in italy 
gorbachev also said that east and west european leaders should 
informally explore ways to break the impasse in negotiations aimed 
at reducing conventional forces in europe 
the communist party chief made the proposals in an address to 
the polish parliament the sejm at the start of a sixday visit to 
poland 
verbally everyone is for the necessity of reducing 
conventional arms and in practice they are still expanding military 
reserves said gorbachev 
the soviets want to break that pattern he added 
for instance we are ready to withdraw our analogous air 
forces from the extended bases in eastern europe if nato agrees not 
to deploy its 72 f16 fighterbombers 
gorbachev also reiterated a soviet plan for resuming 
conventional arms talks with an exchange of troop data and an 
initial withdrawal of 500000 troops from both nato and warsaw pact 
forces in europe 
the soviet leader offered to explore informally with the western 
powers ways to break the deadlock that has long blocked progress 
toward a conventional arms reduction agreement 
the sides have never agreed on how to count their respective 
armies and have found no starting point for force reductions 
if nato shows such readiness we can discuss the problem of 
the lack of balance before the start of official talks about the 
data concerning troops he said western observers claim warsaw 
pact forces far outnumber nato units facing them in europe 
nato secretary general manfred woerner expressed skepticism 
about the new soviet offer 
we are committed to establishing a stable and secure balance 
of conventional forces at lower levels in europe woerner said in 
a statement issued in brussels belgium 
a focus on aircraft does not meet this central requirement 
he added we need asymmetrical reductions notably in tanks and 
artillery in order to eliminate the most worrying disparities 
referring indirectly to a sore point in the relations between 
the soviet union and poland gorbachev pledged to pursue the search 
for facts explaining the blank spots in soviet history 
but gorbachev did not mention the massacre of 4500 polish 
military officers in the katyn forest shortly after the outbreak of 
world war ii 
a joint study commission already has been established to 
investigate what happened during soviet dictator josef stalins 
rule and there had been speculation before gorbachevs arrival 
that he would acknowledge soviet responsibility for the slaughter 
one cannot change history the soviet leader said but one 
can and should draw conclusions from it 
we condemn stalinist repressions gorbachev said as it is 
known they also covered many polish communists who disappeared 
after being summoned to moscow by stalin 
several youths staged a demonstration in central warsaw before 
gorbachevs speech waving banners saying we demand the truth 
about katyn reparation for deportations 
the polish communist party chief wojciech jaruzelski greeted 
gorbachev and his wife raisa when their aeroflot jet arrived at 
warsaws okecie airport 
the gorbachevs then approached a crowd of several hundred 
flagwaving citizens and gorbachev paused to sign several 
autographs and chat with people in the crowd 
gorbachevs motorcade made an unannounced stop at a traffic 
circle in warsaw where the soviet leader got out to greet 
onlookers and sign copies of his book perestroika 
gorbachev and jaruzelski then conferred privately for two hours 
at communist party headquarters the official news agency pap said 
the two exchanged views on economic political and social renewal 
taking place in their countries 
the visit to poland to be capped at weeks end with a summit 
meeting of the warsaw pact countries marks gorbachevs first major 
public appearance since the july 1 close of the soviet communist 
party conference in moscow 
government and opposition leaders in poland expressed hope the 
soviet leader would reinvigorate the movement for polish economic 
reforms 
the leading opposition group the outlawed labor union 
solidarity issued a statement welcoming gorbachev and lauding his 
effort to increase open debate 
solidarity said it hoped the visit would lead to significant 
changes in poland and in sovietpolish relations 
but gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
told reporters asking about solidarity i think it would be 
better if these forces join the process of socialist renewal and 
not inhibit it as sometimes happens today

the international brotherhood of teamsters 
top official in new england william j mccarthy is emerging as a 
possible consensus challenger to jackie pressers choice for the 
unions presidency sources close to the teamsters said monday 
presser who died saturday night in a suburban cleveland 
hospital after an 18month battle against lung and brain cancer 
had turned over temporary control of the governmentbesieged union 
in may to secretarytreasurer weldon mathis naming him interim 
president for 120 days 
mathis 62 is still considered the oddsonfavorite to succeed 
presser but not without a challenge from some of the 16 regional 
vice presidents and board members unhappy with with the way he has 
run the union while presser was incapacitated most of the past year 
one teamster insider said the big question is whether enough 
of those 16 vice presidents many of whom would like the top job 
can unite behind one challenger to mathis 
sources said that mccarthy of boston a teamster vice president 
since 1969 has support from at least five other vice presidents 
for mounting a challenge 
under the teamsters constitution mathis and the 16 vice 
presidents are required to meet within 15 days of pressers death 
to elect a successor 
the jockeying is intensifying just two weeks after the 
government claiming all of the teamsters top leaders are 
influenced by racketeers filed suit to place the entire union 
under the control of a courtappointed trustee 
the government contends in the suit that crime bosses in new 
york and chicago engineered the elevation of presser and his 
predecessor roy williams to the unions presidency in 1983 and 
1981 respectively 
teamster officials have vehemently denied the allegations and a 
federal criminal court jury in new york two months ago found that 
the government had insuffient evidence to back them up 
meanwhile spokesmen for the union are mum about pressers 
successor 
nobodys talking about it except the press duke zeller the 
teamsters director of information said monday nothing is going 
to happen until after the funeral tuesday 
zeller said no executive board meeting has been scheduled yet 
adding that the democratic national convention in atlanta and a 
conference meeting of michigan teamsters both next week may be 
complicating factors 
until pressers death mathis had intended to host a reception 
next week in atlanta his home town and base of power in the union 
symbolizing an end to the teamsters 32year enchantment with 
republican presidential candidates 
presser picked mathis to be his number two official in 1985 a 
year later presser initiated a rewriting of the teamsters 
constitution so that mathis rather the joseph trerotola of new 
york the unions ranking vice president would assume interim 
control if he were disabled 
mathis according to teamster insiders angered many of the 
old guard vice presidents in the way the reins were passed to 
him two months ago eight of them boycotted the first board meeting 
that he convened afterwards 
in addition mathis strength has been weakened by majority 
rankandfile no votes on the unions two biggest contracts 
this year the national master freight agreement covering most of 
the unionized interstate trucking industry and a threeyear accord 
with united parcel service 
because it takes a twothirds membership vote to disapprove a 
contract they were declared ratified 
but in a rare departure from the teamsters tradition to keep 
dissent at the top within the family mccarthy challenged the terms 
of the freight accord openly in conversations with reporters and 
addresses before local union halls 
whats amazing is that all this infighting has sloshed out in 
the open said ken paff an organizer for a 10000member 
dissident faction called teamsters for a democratic union 
other names that have surfaced as possible challengers to mathis 
for succeeding presser include vice presidents arnie weinmeister of 
seattle joseph morgan of hallandale fla and walter shea of 
washington 
sources said weinmeister and shea have pulled themselves out of 
the running although both along with trerotola are considered to 
have the ability to sway other votes on the board

the police official said the seats of the car were found in a 
horizontal position and that police discovered a pair of womens 
sandals in the vehicle 
he said it was possible a woman may have been in the car with 
joseph but that no other body had been located 
we are now examining the blood to see whether there was 
another victim he said 
radio metropole an independent station said joseph was last 
seen alive by his wife raymonde whom he dropped off at their home 
sunday night mrs joseph director of the haitian womens 
committee against torture was the first to identify her husbands 
body 
joseph a lawyer founded the center of education for human 
rights in 1986 and was a cofounder of the league of human rights 
in november 1980 under dictator jeanclaude duvalier he was 
arrested jailed and tortured for his outspoken criticism of the 
government joseph was then ordered to leave haiti but refused to 
do so 
before the national elections scheduled for november 29 which 
were suspended because of civil violence joseph was a candidate 
for a senate seat on the leftist national front ticket 
at the time of his death the activist was director of the 
elliot pierre high school 
latortue said the killing was connected with an incident last 
week in which four men in black uniforms with uzi machine guns 
burst into the home of sociologist laennec hurbon while he was 
away ransacked the premises and stole 1300 
joseph and laennec were both prominent members of the national 
congress of democratic movements a political group working to 
organize haitians and uphold the constitution 
its an attempt to kill one by one those who argue for 
democratic development said latortue whose brother gerard was 
foreign minister in the government of president leslie manigat who 
was ousted in june 
we have entered a different phase in haiti now where political 
killings in the street are going to take place they dont arrest 
you they kill you in the streets and make it appear that it is the 
work of bandits 
haitians now live within a system which gives the lives and 
property of its citizens no protection anything can happen and no 
one can prevent any determined gang of killers from doing as it 
sees fit bajeux said 
namphy who took power in a coup june 19 suspended the 
constitution haitians approved in a march 1987 referendum

the senate approved on a voice vote monday 
legislation which authorizes catholic universities in the city to 
deny equal treatment to homosexual student organizations 
the measure was sponsored by sen william armstrong rcolo 
and passed as an amendment to the district of columbias 32 
billion budget bill armstrong argued that church institutions as 
a matter of religious liberty have the right to exclude gay groups 
from student organizations accorded campus resources 
sen lowell weicker rconn argued the amendment would codify 
discrimination the subject matter before us is outrageous 
weicker charged it is just good oldfashioned straightforward 
bigotry this thing should go back down the sewer from which it 
came 
armstrong denied that his proposal was antihomosexual and said 
it was designed to correct a problem which arose for georgetown 
university when a dc appellate court ruled that the school had 
violated the citys human rights code by denying equal treatment to 
gay organizations 
in the wake of that ruling georgetown agreed in march to 
provide meeting space a mailbox and the right to apply for 
student government funding to two gay student groups but the 
school was not required under the settlement to officially 
recognize the student groups university leaders said official 
recognition would violate church teachings 
georgetown did not encourage armstrong to propose his amendment 
and has no intention of reversing the march agreement or denying 
similar access to gay groups in the future according to betsy 
whittleder a school spokeswoman 
the city budget bill was approved by the senate on a 6429 vote 
but now must go to a housesenate conference committee to work out 
differences between the two chambers

the family of a 56yearold comatose woman 
can order doctors to remove the feeding tube keeping her alive and 
grant what relatives say would have been her wish to die a judge 
ruled monday 
carol mcconnell a registered nurse who suffered permanent brain 
damage in a car accident three years ago remains in a coma at a 
danbury nursing home she can breathe but is fed by a tube 
connected to her stomach doctors said she will die if the tube is 
removed 
in a ruling released monday superior court judge anne c 
dranginis gave the defendants including the state attorney 
generals office 20 days to appeal 
this is a wonderful decision in favor of the family but much 
more in favor of the publics right to have its wishes carried out 
when a person becomes permanently vegetative and expresses clearly 
that they didnt want to be kept alive by artificial means said 
stephen wise lawyer for mcconnells family 
during a trial in june lawyers for the state argued that a 1985 
statute regarding the removal of lifesupport systems prohibits 
withholding nutrition and hydration 
wise said mrs mcconnells three children believe their mother 
was a totally informed person who knew about lifesupport systems 
and clearly expressed her wishes that they not be administered 
mrs mcconnells husband john mcconnell tearfully told 
dranginis last month that his wife wouldnt have wanted to be kept 
alive through extraordinary means 
mrs mcconnell was head nurse in the danbury hospital emergency 
room at the time of her car accident 
the society for the right to die said connecticut is one of six 
states with laws excluding feeding tubes from the lifesustaining 
procedures that can be withheld with a relatives permission or 
because the patient has so instructed previously in writing in a 
socalled living will 
seven states permit removal of feeding tubes while the 
legislation is ambiguous in 12 states and the remainder dont have 
laws dealing with the subject the society said

the pentagon contracting investigation is a 
direct result of president reagans defense buildup and the 
spending surge also will soon cause many big cost overruns on 
weapons the head of the congressional general accounting office 
said monday 
history shows that when too much money is pumped into the 
acquisition system over a relatively short period of time we will 
have problems comptroller general charles bowsher told the 
senate armed services committee 
we had procurement scandals during world war ii the korean 
war and in the past few years all during periods of rapid growth 
in defense spending the watchdog agency chief said 
the current criminal investigation involves allegations that 
defense contractors and consultants many of them former military 
men bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could 
be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars no charges 
have yet been filed 
criminal investigations arent the only problems bowsher said 
in addition to these scandals i think the other shoe will 
probably fall soon namely many big cost overruns he told the 
committee 
i suspect the stealth airplane program the navy shipbuilding 
programs and the other programs which have to be stretched because 
of budget constraints will all result in very large cost increases 
that the congress will have to finance he said 
bowsher was referring to a common defense department response to 
congressionally ordered budget reductions in which the same number 
of weapons are bought over a longer period of time that commonly 
drives up the price of individual weapons 
defense secretary frank c carlucci during his eight months in 
office has thus far generally opposed program stretchouts 
instead he has ordered that some weapons be eliminated for 
example he has told the navy to mothball 16 aging frigates and has 
ordered air force reductions to meet reduced defense budgets 
bowsher comparing the current investigation with past 
procurement scandals said one thing that distinguishes that is 
its fairly high up the thing that discourages me the most is 
that some very senior people might be involved 
past cases generally involved relatively lowlevel personnel 
trading information bowsher explained 
he noted reports that former assistant navy secretary melvyn 
paisley is a target of the justice department probe 
bowsher said im surprised that that an assistant secretary 
had that much control over procurement 
one of the reforms instituted by former navy secretary john 
lehman who brought paisley into the pentagon job was elimination 
of the navy materiel command an agency that had been involved in 
purchasing lehmans move was aimed at streamlining procurement 
but now said bowsher it appears that move along with some 
other procurement changes may have eliminated some of the key 
controls that had kept a check on spending 
still he said i would suggest not rushing into that area 
and passing a lot of new laws or ordering a halt in what carlucci 
has called tainted contracts carlucci earlier this month 
ordered the suspension of nine contracts worth an estimated 1 
billion 
it might be better to let the investigative process work 
said bowsher later if there are indictments those contracts 
could be suspended and if there are convictions the contractors 
could eventually be debarred from doing business with the pentagon 
he noted 
however the defense department announced monday that it has 
debarred two companies and three individuals from doing business 
and was moving to suspend a fourth person from his pentagon job at 
the same time it said payments were being resumed on most of the 
contracts that carluci suspended july 1 
elsewhere in his testimony bowsher said we need to be 
realistic in projecting the quality cost and schedule of our 
systems in relation to the state of technology involved we still 
are unable to get contractors to build things right the first time 
as is clearly obvious in the case of the b1b bomber program 
that program resurrected by reagan seven years ago after being 
scrapped by former president carter has been plagued by 
difficulties most recently the air force acknowledged that the 
b1b is having electronics problems that will be costly to fix if 
they can be repaired 
it is clear to me that some of what went wrong on the b1b 
included concurrency testing and producing at the same time 
inadequate testing a push to deliver on time and at cost no 
matter what while stretching the state of technology bowsher 
said 
until we do this better we will continue to buy into programs 
which will not achieve their advertised performance capabilities 
and will continue to exacerbate the affordability issues he said

peddlers of hot dogs and sushi frozen yogurt 
and hot soup have for five years ignored a law that would keep them 
off the sidewalks where business is best on monday the vendors 
fell victim to politics 
in an effort to rid some of the citys busiest corners of 
congestion police armed with forklifts were sent for take out not 
food but the pushcarts that sell quick and affordable lunches and 
snacks the vendors were there with their familiar orangeandblue 
umbrellas but the pushcarts werent 
were trying to spoil the policemens party said hot dog 
vendor thomas michaelides theyll get no blood from me today 
the vendors called their gathering a protest a spokesman for 
mayor edward i koch called it capitulation to the law that imposes 
fines up to 1000 and storage costs for impounded pushcarts of 65 
a day 
by 5 pm only three carts had been confiscated police said 
they were faced with confiscation and fines and we warned them 
of those consequences and as a result we dont have any carts in 
those banned areas said koch spokesman cliff chanin 
so we choose to see it as compliance of the law 
koch admitted the crackdown was political armtwisting to get 
the city council to pass a new law which would allow six vendors 
chosen by lottery to work each prime street block three on one 
side and three on the other 
vendors and council members balked at that prompting the 
crackdown 
as angry vendors congregated along sixth avenue handing out 
leaflets the m parpis food distribution co which owns 50 
vending carts went to court to fight the ban parpis lawyers 
argued in state supreme court that the law is an unreasonable use 
of regulatory power justice irving kirschenbaum disagreed 
john p goros 38 who owns m parpis said he would appeal 
the 1983 law bans vendors from manhattan corners between 34th 
and 59th streets and between third and eighth avenues an area 
that includes busy times square and rockefeller center in the 
wall street area along first avenue near the united nations and 
in fulton market in brooklyn 
there are 3300 vendors with permanent licenses and an 
additional 1000 allowed to sell food only in summer according to 
the health department 
as koch was at city hall telling reporters im not an enemy 
of peddlers im the friend of peddlers the police unit hit the 
streets 
what did the police action mean to michaelides whos been 
hawking hot dogs for 25 years and whose father did it for years 
before him 
it means ive got two kids and im out of work now said 
michaelides whose spot on west 57th street and broadway is on the 
city hit list 
ahmed abelhady said he could not say what he would like to tell 
the mayor but it would not be nice 
abelhady who doles out chicken and beef sandwiches said he 
doesnt like the lottery system because it would force him to 
change locations every year 
i know my customers by name i know what they like he said 
theyre like friends to me

a federal judge monday struck down a georgia law 
requiring minors to tell their parents before getting an abortion 
the second time in as many years the law has failed to pass 
constitutional muster 
us district judge robert hall granted a preliminary injunction 
sought by planned parenthood to stop implementation of the parental 
notification act 
the law which requires girls under 18 to notify their parents 
before getting an abortion was to have taken effect july 1 hall 
had blocked its implementation pending his ruling 
hall voided a similar but more stringent statute last year after 
the atlanta and augusta chapters of planned parenthood challenged 
it saying it placed too great a burden on teenage girls 
the law was rewritten to ease some requirements during the 1988 
general assembly but the two planned parenthood chapters and 
atlanta physician orrin moore who performs abortions again 
challenged it on virtually the same grounds their suit was filed 
on behalf of more than 4000 teenage girls who received abortions 
in 1985 
under the rewritten law teenage girls in some cases would have 
had to wait 24 hours after notifying their parents for the abortion 
to be performed the lawsuit challenged that section and also said 
the act failed to guarantee anonymity to some girls 
the suit also challenged a provision of the law that allows a 
girl to go to juvenile court to obtain a waiver if she does not 
wish to notify her parents the suit said the time involved in 
getting such a waiver sometimes three weeks or more is too long

the reagan administration said monday that 
us participation in a centuryold international accord could help 
trim americas 2 billion annual loss to film and recording pirates 
assistant secretary of state eugene mcallister appeared before 
the senate foreign relations committee to argue for us membership 
in the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic 
works created in 1886 
today we are experiencing a technolgical revolution involving 
such innovations as computers communications satellites optical 
discs and many more mcallister noted many international 
copyright experts here and abroad believe that the berne convention 
is a comprehensive and dynamic instrument which meets the 
challenges brought on by the new technologioes 
mcallister said the berne convention could protect us 
copyrights in 79 countries 24 of which do not belong to the 
universal copyright convention the united states is already a 
member of that accord 
copyright official ralph oman testified that us 
representatives recently visited turkey and egypt with complaints 
of pirating but were told that since the united states did not 
belong to the berne convention us rights were not legally 
protected in those countries 
other countries on the list of 24 are mainly african including 
south africa romania thailand and uruguay are also among them 
oman said the list covers minor markets but major pirates 
he did not further identify any of the pirating countries 
he noted the spread of us popular culture all over the world

with few comparable parallels to go by the 
reagan administration began work monday on the huge job of 
assembling the data necessary for compensating the families who 
lost relatives aboard an iranian airliner downed by a us missile 
last week 
a state department official said the task will be highly 
discretionary because of the unique nature of the incident in 
which a us navy warship fired on the passenger plane after 
mistaking it for an f14 fighter 
it is not clear yet the official said whether a flat amount 
will be paid for each victim or whether the age number of 
dependents and earnings of the victims will be taken into account 
in assessing compensation 
also to be determined is what role congress will be required to 
play in providing the funding said the official who briefed 
reporters on the condition that he not be identified 
we have a huge job ahead of us he said we have a lot of 
facts to investigate 
the official said it is common practice in such incidents for 
the government to seek a statement from the families of each victim 
releasing the us government from further liability for the 
accident 
he added that the outcome of a navy investigation will not 
affect the governments decisions on compensation 
the decision to compensate was based on humanitarian concern 
the official said adding that such issues as negligence or 
culpability by either iran or the united states will not influence 
the process 
the law does not specify a maximum amount the us government 
may pay in such cases 
besides iran citizens from six other countries werre aboard the 
plane when it was shot down on july 3 the official said 
compensation wont be based on the nationality of each citizen 
complicating the task for the administration is the absence of 
diplomatic relations between the united states and iran the 
official said the red crescent an arm of the red cross that 
operates in the middle east would be an acceptable organization 
for making the payments 
at least two of the precedents that could have a bearing on 
amounts of compensation to be paid involve israel 
in 1980 israel agreed to pay the us government 6 million in 
compensation for an attack by israeli forces on an american naval 
vessel at the outbreak of 1967 middle east war the attack on the 
uss liberty in the eastern mediterranean left 34 american sailors 
dead and 75 wounded 
like the iran plane incident israel decided on an ex gratia 
payment meaning it was made out of sympathy but without an 
admssion of fault or liability 
there also was the case of the israeli downing of a libyan 
passenger plane that strayed over israeli territory in the early 
1970s israel paid families of the victims 30000 per person 
in addition the united states has compensated individuals for 
damage done by troops on maneuvers in central america and is 
paying owners of a fishing boat shot up by mistake in the persian 
gulf 
iraq has agreed to pay compensation to the united states for an 
incident in which an iraqi jet in another case of mistaken 
identity fired on the uss stark in may 1987 leaving 37 sailors 
dead negotiations are continuing 
but the united states denied liability for damages to neutral 
embassies in tripoli libya in a 1986 bombing raid and similar 
requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struck during 
the bombing of haiphong harbor during the vietnam war

the blue and white banners hanging above the 
passageways of the media village at the democratic national 
convention are street signs bearing the names of the famous and 
notsofamous 
thomas jefferson avenue woodrow wilson boulevard and other 
signs designate each major thoroughfare in the village that was 
still being assembled monday in the georgia world congress center 
the socalled streets run between trailers of electronic 
equipment and bluecurtained makeshift newsrooms there are no 
traffic lights and pedestrians take their chances stepping over 
cables dodging carts and scooters ladders and lifts 
we had a huge space said neel lattimore press gallery 
supervisor for the dnc so we had to come up with something 
that would enable convention staffers and media personnel to find 
their work areas in about 339000 square feet of exhibit halls 
the village will accomodate approximately 13500 reporters and 
editors from about 125 news organizations during next weeks 
convention 
jim thompson manager of the general contracting firm for the 
world congress center suggested the passageways be named after 
democratic presidents lattimore said 
that worked fine through franklin d roosevelt harry s truman 
john f kennedy lyndon b johnson jimmy carter and even grover 
cleveland but then the media arrangements staff ran into a problem 
we ran out of democratic presidents lattimore said with a 
grin 
so the side streets are myers lane podrazik lane and lattimore 
lane named after himself and codirectors of media arrangements 
cindy myers and wally podrazik 
we take it very seriously trying to make sure everybody gets 
what they need but this is kind of fun lattimore said 
the street sign is the closest lattimore who works for a public 
relations company in washington dc will come to fame during the 
convention he hopes 
next monday if somebody knows my name theres a problem

planning longrange expenditures for medicare 
and other health programs is similar to budgeting defense spending 
in that it can be difficult to know what programs will work in the 
future a democratic senator said monday 
its sort of like new missiles in a pipeline said sen jay 
rockefeller of west virginia will they work or will they not 
youre talking about what does and doesnt work in health care 
and we dont necessarily know 
anticipating an avalanche of dollars for the future as both 
public and private health care costs continue to rise rockefeller 
proclaimed the matter of setting priorities a very scary 
business 
his comments came after former health and welfare secretary 
joseph califano told a senate panel that a growing body of research 
is bearing out assertions of many analysts that at least 25 
percent of the money we spend on health care is wasted 
that figure said califano translates to 125 billion a year 
and is likely to grow as the united states moves toward allocating 
15 percent of its total gross national product to health spending 
by the end of the next decade 
as difficult and dangerous as it is to channel spending toward 
medical practices with proven effectiveness califano said the 
greater danger of hurting people is if we dont embark upon a 
program like this 
the exchange came as the senate finance health subcommittee 
opened what is expected to be a protracted series of hearings on 
ways to measure the quality of health care 
dr william roper head of the federal agency that runs medicare 
and medicaid complimented sen george mitchell dmaine for 
holding the hearings 
roper noted that congress has approved his request for the 
health care financing administration to use 10 million in medicare 
trust funds to devise better methods of relating quality medical 
outcomes to costs but he said that evolving field of research is 
too big for the government to undertake alone and urged the 
academic community to play a larger role 
califano who headed what is now the health and human services 
department under president carter said government health cost 
containment measures to date have basically played musical 
chairs moving health delivery from this setting to that setting 
were pretty much near the end of the road in that kind of 
approach said califano who is a private consultant to the 
chrysler corp and other major companies on health insurance 
the next hurdle said califano is to get a realistic handle on 
which medical procedures are worth performing and which are not for 
a particular patient 
its really doctors that have to make that determination he 
said 
califano ticked off several instances of drastic differences in 
medical costs that apparently have no relationship to quality care 
three studies released in conjunction with the hearing concluded 
that hospital mortality statistics released on the nations 6000 
hospitals last december were not an accurate measure of the quality 
of care given at those institutions 
they particularly noted that the hcfa statistics did not account 
for differences in the severity of illness among patients at the 
various hospitals 
however roper acknowledged at the time that the major 
shortcoming on the data was lack of a severity of illness 
adjustment he said hcfa officials were studying a number of 
alternative methods of injecting such a measure into subsequent 
annual releases of the billing data supplied by hospitals 
the main usefulness of this information is for doctors and 
hospitals to look carefully at what theyre doing and improve what 
theyre doing for medicare beneficiaries said roper 
it is also useful to consumers as a screening tool so that 
they can pose useful questions thoughtful questions for their 
doctor or their hospital administrator consumers shouldnt use 
this information on its own as a guide to picking a hospital

in disputed senate testimony a convicted drug 
racketeer said monday that panamas military strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega told him he planned to control the flow of drugs 
through central america and bragged of his ties to the cia and vice 
president george bush 
the witness john mccann serving a sentence of life plus 110 
years told senate foreign relations committee narcotics 
investigators that noriega told him in a private 1983 meeting 
im very friendly with the cia they let me do what i want 
mccann who said noriega conversed with him for nearly an hour 
in halting english added he mentioned he was a very good friend 
of the vice president that he was the man responsible for holding 
central america together and keeping the communists out and as 
long as he did that he could do anything 
but some senators questioned mccanns account of a private 
detailed conversation in english with noriega 
sen mitch mcconnell rky quoted both us and former 
panamanian officials as saying noriega always used interpreters 
because his english is poor and not capable of sustaining a 
lengthy substantive conversation 
mcconnell quoted michael kozak the state department official 
who conducted lengthy negotiations with noriega after he was 
indicted on us narcotics charges as saying noriega was not 
proficient enough in english to conduct an intelligible 
conversation 
mccann insisted that he had such conversations with noriega on 
four occasions between 1982 and 1984 and that while noriega spoke 
in pigin english his meaning was plain 
sen john kerry dmass who had led mccann through a detailed 
description of narcotics dealings in colombia bolivia panama and 
elsewhere asserted that mccann has no reason to lie and would be 
subject to further punishment if he were convicted of perjury 
i dont think id ever get out of jail for the rest of my 
life said mccann who is serving his long prison sentence at the 
federal correctional facility at petersburg va 
responding to questions mccann said noriega may have overblown 
any relationship he may have had with bush 
he told me he was friendly with vice president bush and im 
sure he just said that to impress the point that he had friends in 
high places the witness testified 
mccann said he had successfully sought help from noriega in 
assuring that shipments of cocaine through panama were not 
intercepted 
he said he once offered the panamanian general 250000 in a 
closed briefcase but that noriega refused it offering no 
explanation 
mccann testified that noriega later told him to cut his ties 
with drug rings in bolivia colombia and other countries and to 
deal exclusively with him 
he said i could buy any of the things i wanted right in 
panama heroin cocaine marajuana antything mccann said 
the testimony came in the latest round of hearings led by kerry 
to explore the international narcotics racket and the effectiveness 
of us efforts to deal with it

air safety authorities on monday urged that 
the federal requirements for brake wear on large jetliners be 
tightened to avoid future accidents such as one involving an 
american airlines dc10 last may at the dallasfort worth airport 
the national transportation safety board said that eight of the 
10 brakes on the american dc10 failed when the pilot aborted his 
takeoff after getting indications that the planes flaps or slats 
might not have been in the proper position 
the jetliner with 240 passengers aboard skidded 1000 feet 
beyond the end of the runway injuring the three cockpit crew 
members and five passengers and extensively damaging the aircraft 
the federal aviation administration responding to the ntsb 
findings said it agreed with the boards conclusions and is in the 
process of developing new minimum requirements for brake wear for 
all jetliners and possibly special directives for the dc10 
we have been following the matter of revised minimum brake 
standards for jetliners closely since the accident at dallasfort 
worth said an faa statement faa spokesman fred farrar said the 
review is still in the early stages and no time frame for 
implementing new requirements has been established 
the pilot of the american dc10 chose to abort his takeoff from 
dallasfort worth on may 21 after an instrument indicated that the 
planes flaps or slats which help the jet gain lift were not in 
proper position 
a later examination showed they were in a position for takeoff 
but that the warning signal was activated because of a slight 
outof tolerance condition involving one of the slats the ntsb 
urged that the warning system be redesigned 
when the takeoff was aborted the plane slowed as it should have 
from 204 mph to 149 mph during the first six seconds but the 
safety board said at that point the deceleration decayed 
rapidly the jetliner left the runway traveling 117 mph lost its 
nose gear and plowed through the dirt for 1000 feet before coming 
to a halt 
eight of the planes 10 wheel brakes were near the maximum 
wear limits before the aborted takeoff and failed within 8 or 9 
seconds after being applied the investigators said

the government on monday published a proposed 
regulation that would prevent thousands of foreign sugarcane 
harvesters from qualifying for permanent us residence status 
under a program for seasonal farm workers 
the agriculture department published the proposed regulation to 
comply with an order issued last month by a judge who found the 
agency had procrastinated in revising rules he had previously 
struck down 
last spring us district judge thomas f hogan ruled that the 
usda had arbitrarily excluded sugarcane workers from the seasonal 
agricultural worker program 
under the 1986 immigration reform and control act seasonal 
workers who enter this country to harvest perishable farm 
commodities have until nov 1 to apply for permanent us residency 
hogan in ordering the usda to redraft its regulations said 
that the department had not justified excluding sugar cane from its 
list of perishable commodities and held the agencys definition of 
vegetable was arbitrary and capricious 
in the response published in mondays federal register the usda 
stood by its previous position but produced a more extensive 
definition of vegetable 
it defined vegetables as the human edible herbaceous leaves 
stems roots or tubers of plants which are eaten either cooked 
or raw chiefly as the principal part of a meal rather than as a 
dessert 
the proposed regulation noted that sugar cane is not eaten 
cooked or raw during the main course of a meal either as a 
principal dish or as a side dish 
while the juice of the sugar cane is digestible the cane 
itself is not digestible by humans the usda said usda is 
unaware of the use of sugar cane as a vegetable as that term is 
defined in horticultural science and in this proposed regulation 
the department also noted that sugar cane did not meet the 
definition of other perishable commodities because the production 
of sugar cane does not involve critical and unpredictable labor 
demands 
opponents of the proposed regulation have until july 26 to file 
comments with the usda according to the terms of hogans order 
steven routh an attorney representing two organizations that 
help sugarcane workers said he was disappointed that the agency 
has continued in its past pattern of taking action thats really 
designed to keep sugar cane workers out of the program 
they start with the premise that they are going to keep 
sugarcane workers out and reason to that conclusion routh said 
there has been a consistent clear reluctance on their part not 
to include sugar cane workers 
routh vowed to return to court next month if the usda does not 
change its position

duartes doctors have said he has between six and 18 months to live 
duartes fiveyear term ends june 1 1989 
the president was leaner than when he left and his face was

us investigators probing the iranian 
airliner tragedy want to know if an iranian air force plane tried 
to tell the jet it was being warned off by an american warship 
us military sources said monday 
they said another question is whether the civilian air traffic 
controller on duty at bandar abbas which the iran air airbus had 
just left heard the us ships radio messages but did not relay 
them to the pilot 
us officials say the jetliner was shot down july 3 killing 
all 290 people aboard after it did not respond to messages sent by 
the uss vincennes on military and civilian radio channels the 
missile cruiser fired in the belief that the aircraft was an f14 
fighter threatening to attack they said 
the questions about the patrol plane a usbuilt p3 orion and 
the air controller emerged on the sixth day of the inquiry by a 
team of six us officers 
a us source who like the others spoke on condtiion of 
anonymity said the inquiry is trying to look at everything if 
any attempts were made to alert the airbus they would of course 
want to know that it would be up to iran to provide that kind of 
information 
no indication has emerged whether the us investigators would 
have an opportunity to interview iranian officials a senior us 
officer here said last week it appeared highly doubtful 
it also was not known whether iran would let us investigators 
review data from the jetiliners black box flight recorder if 
it is recovered 
on monday they awaited the analysis of computer tapes from the 
vincennes and a second us warship that was in the strait of hormuz 
at the time the tapes were sent to the united states last week for 
scrutiny at a navy laboratory 
the us sources said the p3 apparently was airborne in the 
hormuz area about the time the shootdown occurred but said they 
did not know how close it was or if it monitored the radio traffic 
leading up to the airbus destruction 
the p3 a military version of the lockheed electra turboprop 
aircraft is used by the us navy for longrange antisubmarine 
surveillance 
iran acquired six p3s in the mid1970s and at least one is 
still flying us officials say it is a familiar sight on almost 
daily patrol missions over the strait of hormuz and southern 
persian gulf 
a british newspaper quoted the air traffic controller on duty at 
bandar abbas the day the airbus was shot down as saying iranian 
controllers hear us warships issuing warnings on the radio 
every day but we never reply to them 
the times of london identified the controller as hossein pirouzi 
and quoted him as saying the americans have no right to be in 
the gulf challenging our legitimate right to fly our air routes 
so why should we reply to them 
the vincennes remained at anchor of bahrain as the investigation 
continued its crew has been restricted to the ship for security 
reasons with sailors allowed ashore only in small groups to make 
telephone calls home 
rear adm william m fogarty leads the investigating team which 
has a 15day deadline us officials said could be extended 
the six officers operating in secrecy include a military 
lawyer and technical experts most of the work is being done aboard 
the vincennes and the navys gulf flagship the coronado 
one team member capt john j kieley iii commanded the us 
missile frigate reuben james in the gulf earlier this year and now 
has a navy staff assignment in the pentagon 
navy sources said computer tapes from the vincennes and the 
frigate elmer montgomery which was nearby were vital to resolving 
such questions as the altitude of the iranian airbus when it was 
hit by two surfacetoair missiles

president reagan has chosen former 
pennsylvania gov dick thornburgh to replace edwin meese iii as 
attorney general during the remaining six months of the reagan 
presidency a knowledgeable administration source said monday 
the source who declined to be identified by name said that 
thornburgh a moderate republican who once headed the justice 
departments criminal division had accepted the offer 
elsie hillman head of george bushs presidential campaign in 
pennsylvania and a republican national committeewoman said in 
harrisburg pa that she was told by bush campaign officials that 
thornburgh had been asked to take the job thornburgh served two 
fouryear terms in the pennsylvania state capital harrisburg 
thornburgh who will turn 56 on saturday has been mentioned as 
a possible running mate for bush on the 1988 republican 
presidential ticket his acceptance of the justice department post 
would appear to rule out that prospect 
reagan told reporters earlier monday that there would soon be an 
announcement of a successor for meese 
the attorney general under fire ever since his arrival in 
washington with reagan his longtime associate announced his 
decision to leave the justice department on the day last week that 
independent counsel james mckay wound up a 14month investigation 
into meeses ethical behavior in office 
mckays 830page report has not been made public but reportedly 
he decided not to seek an indictment of meese that prompted the 
attorney general to declare he had been vindicated 
reagan said the same thing saturday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to confirm or 
deny that reagan has settled on thornburgh fitzwater said its 
probably likely that he reagan has decided but he has not made 
an offer 
cable news network reported that thornburgh had been interviewed 
by white house general counsel ab culvahouse 
the first reaction on capitol hill was favorable 
sen john heinz rpa one of those who recommended thornburgh 
said dick thornburgh is an excellent choice he is an 
outstanding administrator and a tough prosecutor his integrity is 
unquestioned the senate would be more than happy to strongly 
support the governor 
sen alan k simpson rwyo a member of the senate judiciary 
committee called thornburgh a highly competent individual 
we first worked together in the wake of the three mile island 
nuclear accident simpson said i saw him handle that with 
maturity and skill he dealt honestly with the issue without 
emotion or hysteria he has a fine grasp of government 
another member of the committee sen dennis deconcini dariz 
said thornburgh has a fine reputation because of his leadership 
in pennsylvania however unless i have worked closely with 
nominees in the past and know their capabilities it is my practice 
to reserve judgment until i have carefully reviewed their record 
sen patrick leahy dvt said he did not know whether 
thornburgh had been chosen but in a chat with reporters at the 
white house after a meeting with reagan on the drought leahy said 
he did not think that democrats would seek to block confirmation of 
thornburgh by the senate 
i dont think there will be anybody who will delay him based 
on any partisan reason said leahy also a member of the senate 
judiciary committee 
theres only a half a year left in the presidents term if 
hes named somebody new we should move as quickly as we can on the 
hearings he said there will be no partisan games played with 
mr thornburgh 
a democratic source on the senate committee speaking on 
condition that he not be named said there was enough time for the 
senate to confirm thornburgh its reasonable to think its 
doable this summer he said 
i would strongly urge that the background material on mr 
thornburgh get up to the senate as quickly as possible leahy 
said i think it is essential for the department of justice if 
theyre going to have a new attorney general to have one as soon 
as possible and i think its only fair to the people of the 
department of justice to have a new leader confirmed as quickly as 
possible 
white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein on monday asked 
heinz for his view of a thornburgh nomination according to heinz 
spokesman richard bryers 
fitzwater said you know that names pop up people weigh in 
and they have to go through background checks so we just have to 
avoid these confirmations the spokesman did confirm that reagan 
aides spent much of the weekend discussing whom to nominate as 
meeses successor 
thornburgh is no stranger to the department of justice he was 
the us attorney in pittsburgh from 1969 to 1975 then moved to 
washington as assistant attorney general and head of the criminal 
division from 1975 to 1977 he served as governor from 1979 until 
1987 and now directs the institute of politics at harvard 
universitys kennedy school of government 
thornburgh was born in pittsburgh and has an engineering degree 
from yale and a law degree with high honors from the university 
of pittsburgh he and his wife virginia have four sons 
fitzwater had said earlier that the administration wanted to 
announce the nominee before congress adjourns thursday for the 
democratic national convention the convention begins monday in 
atlanta 
meese meanwhile complained in st louis on monday that a leak 
from the independent counsels report on his activity is not only 
illegal its unfair 
mckay had been investigating meeses assistance to wedtech a 
bronx defense contractor under investigation for payoffs to win 
government contracts his actions in connection with a proposed 1 
billion iraqi oil pipeline project whether he took actions 
favorable to regional bell telephone companies at a time he held 
14000 in telephone stock and a 40000ayear job his wife took 
from a foundation supported by a washington real estate family that 
leased office space to the justice department 
on saturday the new york times published a story that said 
mckays report show that meese gave differing accounts of his 
knowledge about a possible bribery scheme involving the pipeline 
project 
meese who was in st louis monday for an fbi gathering denied 
that asked if he knew the details in 1985 of plans to pay the 
israeli labor party money from the pipeline project meese replied 
no i have no recollection of knowing anything about that 
meese said he did not read closely a memo from his longtime 
friend e robert wallach in september 1985 mentioning the planned 
payments to the political party

prince norodom sihanouk announced his 
resignation as president of the cambodian guerrilla alliance 
monday two weeks before the coalition is to open peace talks with 
the vietnamese and cambodian governments 
sihanouk has made the same gesture previously then returned to 
head the fractious alliance of his followers the radical communist 
khmer rouge and former premier son sanns anticommunist forces 
on monday sihanouk also said he was not abandoning efforts to 
end more than a decade of war in cambodia 
no i will continue my efforts to help my country and my 
people he said at the bangkok airport as he left for paris he 
said his son prince nodorom ranariddh would replace him at the 
talks beginning july 25 in indonesia 
roland eng sihanouks spokesman said the princes decision to 
resign as head of the coalition came so suddenly that everyone had 
their bags packed for the trip to indonesia sihanouk did not say 
why he resigned 
eng said one reason was that the prince was upset by an article 
sunday in the newspaper the nation detailing his relations in 
cambodia in the 1960s and 1970s with the khmer rouge and son sann 
sihanouk was deposed as head of state in march 1970 and the 
monarchy abolished the khmer rouge defeated the usbacked 
government of lon nol in april 1975 and independent observers say 
more than 1 million cambodians were killed under its regime 
vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the 
khmer rouge and installed another communist administration the 
khmer rouge then began guerrilla warfare against the vietnames and 
were joined by forces loyal to sihanouk and son sann 
the indonesia talks will be the first among the warring parties 
sihanouk was the central figure at the meeting last week of the 
foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian nations 
asean and their western partners they said he should have a 
major role in creating a new camdobidan government 
among those at the meeting were prime minister prem tinsulanonda 
of thailand secretary of state george p shultz and sosuke uno 
the japanese foreign minister 
in a letter published in the nation on monday sihanouk objected 
to allegations in an article that said his government forced 
peasants to sell rice to the state at low prices in 1967 he said 
the khmer rouge fomented the peasantrelated violence of that year 
the 65yearold prince was asked at the airport if he would 
change his mind again about resigning and said no i will not 
his resignation was announced in a statement issued from his 
bangkok office it said for serious reasons that are for the 
moment impossible for me to enumerate and to explain please allow 
me today to resign as president of democratic kampuchea 
cambodia 
shultz in indonesia said monday he did not know how to 
interpret sihanouks action he said sihanouk seemed in their 
recent meetings to take a constructive approach to the 
cambodian problem 
the foreign ministers of vietnam laos and cambodia at a 
conference monday in phnom penh cambodia declared they were 
commited a political solution to the cambodian conflict 
in a joint communique they repeated that all vietnamese troops 
will leave cambodia by 1990 or sooner if a political solution is 
reached but the settlement must guarantee the khmer rouge will not 
return to power vietnam has an estimated 140000 military 
personnel in cambodia

gov edward d diprete said monday he 
would call a special session of the general assembly if necessary 
to restore a fourterm congresswoman and a twotime gubernatorial 
candidate to the ballot 
after meeting with legislative leaders for more than an hour 
diprete said republican rep claudine c schneider and democratic 
gubernatorial candidate bruce g sundlun should try to win their 
ballot slots from the state board of elections before the 
legislature would take action 
but if the board rules against the candidates or lawyers advise 
that the board is likely to do so the republican governor said he 
would call on the legislature to step in 
i personally feel that both bruce sundlun and claudine 
schneider should have their names on the ballot diprete said 
in the final analysis if i have to call a special session i 
will 
referring to sundlun diprete said even if he is my opponent 
i think he should be on the ballot 
schneider and sundlun face disqualification from the november 
election because the signatures and addresses on their candidacy 
declarations are not identical to those on their voter registration 
cards 
the narragansett board of canvassers which must certify a 
candidacy on july 1 discovered that schneiders declaration 
included her middle initial and listed her address as 56 central 
ave her registration omits the initial and lists her address 
correctly as 56 central st the canvassing board referred the 
matter to the state board of elections 
sundlun signed his declaration with his initials and listed his 
providence address as 79 prospect st his registration spells out 
his first name and omits the word street 
the providence board of canvassers certified sundluns candidacy 
despite the discrepancies however a political opponent checked 
sundluns paperwork after the schneider case became publicized and 
complained to the election board 
the state board of elections meets july 25 to determine if 
schneider and sundlun may remain on the ballot if the board rules 
against them they could launch writein campaigns 
chairman joseph r distefano wont say what the board might do 
but said candidates have been disqualified time and time again 
for such mistakes 
the law requiring signatures and addresses to match exactly has 
been in effect since 1950 and has survived a state court challenge 
house minority leader bradford gorham who headed a commission 
that extensively revised rhode islands election laws last year 
said no one absolutely no one called for change in this 
particular provision 
schneider has served in congress since 1980 sundlun lost to 
diprete in 1986

negotiations began monday toward ending 
south africas 73year rule over neighboring southwest africa and 
fixing a timetable for withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from 
angola 
officials from south africa angola cuba and the united states 
met privately at the us coast guard base on governors island in 
new york harbor on a way to send home all foreign troops in 
southern africa 
south africa has said it would accept a un security council 
resolution calling for the independence of southwest africa also 
known as namibia when cuban troops leave marxistruled angola the 
cubans are fighting rebels supported by the united states and south 
africa 
this round of talks is expected to end late tuesday or early 
wednesday said anne stoddard a spokeswoman for the us mission 
to the united nations disagreement over a timetable for cuban 
withdrawal appears to be the most difficult unresolved issue 
the us goal is a complete pullout in one year the same period 
the un resolution on namibian independence allows south africa to 
give up control of that territory 
angola and cuba have insisted the cuban withdrawal be spread 
over four years but us officials believe that is only a 
bargaining position 
namibia lies between angola and south africa south africa 
captured it from germany in world war i and governed it under a 
league of nations mandate abrogated by the united nations more than 
20 years ago 
in 1971 the world court declared south africas continued rule 
over namibia illegal but the court a branch of the united nations 
has no enforcement power 
the united states is a party to these talks because of the 
support it has given angolan guerrillas since 1985 civil war has 
plagued angola since it became independent of portugal in 1975 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from 
namibia into angola to help the guerrillas and pursue guerrillas 
from southwest africa and in recent weeks have fought cuban and 
angolan forces in southwest angola 
cuba has increased its troop strength there from about 37000 
soldiers last fall to an estimated 50000 us officials in 
washington say but add they believe the buildup is an attempt to 
strengthen its bargaining position 
the us officials say privately they are angolas recent 
acceptance of the principle of a total cuban troop withdrawal 
they also say the soviet union which has provided angola 
billions of dollars worth of military equipment since 1975 has 
shown interest in ending the conflict through a negotiated 
settlement 
the four parties first met in london in early may then 
reconvened late last month in cairo egypt south african and 
angolan officials held a separate meeting in may in brazzaville

texas oil troubleshooter red adair 
inspected the burning piper alpha platform on monday from a basket 
suspended above the flames and smoke but rough weather in the 
north sea halted his plans to clear debris 
chairman armand hammer and other officials of occidental 
petroleum corp the platforms operators rejected allegations 
that warnings of gas leaks went unheeded in the days before 
wednesday nights disaster which killed 166 of the 230 men on 
board 
occidental executives have said they believe a gas leak caused 
the explosions that rocked the structure 120 miles east of 
scotland but have maintained the rig complied with all safety 
standards 
police meanwhile released the names of two americans involved in 
the disaster they said carl busse 28 of navasota texas was 
among those listed as missing and believed dead joseph wells 33 
from santa barbara calif survived the blaze without injury they 
said 
hammer said the explosion was so powerful it overwhelmed the 
structures sophisticated safety system 
our oil rig had every safety device on it that we could 
possibly have hammer said during a visit to tel aviv on monday 
where he anounced plans for an offshore drilling project in israel 
about claims by former employees and families of survivors that 
gas leaks discovered earlier were linked to the explosion hammer 
said 
our people say that whatever leaks there were were corrected 
and they also were not in the place where we believe the explosion 
took place 
he said the blast destroyed sensors and alarms before the 
automated safety system could shut the platform down 
we had sensors which would have detected ordinary leaks and 
would have given us warning but this explosion was so tremendous 
that no sensors would operate there hammer told the news 
conference 
david martin president of occidental oil and gas corp the 
subsidiary which operates the rig said in aberdeen he had no 
confirmation of any leaks prior to wednesdays explosion but was 
aware of reports that some workers had smelled gas 
adair 73 and two assistants had to postpone plans to board the 
platform when winds of 35 mph buffeted the site said an occidental 
spokeswoman who would not give her name adair has worked on the 
site since friday and must clear the platform of debris to gain 
access to the wellheads and seal them 
about 30 percent of the debris has been cleared 
the spokeswoman said the houston disaster specialist and his 
team returned to their base on the semisubmersible service vessel 
tharos 
it was the second time in two days that adairs efforts to work 
on the platform were frustrated he was forced to cancel a visit at 
dawn sunday because of heavy seas high winds and flames shooting 
into the air from one of the three wellheads still burning 
in red deer alberta a canadian who was a former platform 
superintendent on the rig was quoted on monday as saying the piper 
alpha rig was a bomb waiting to explode 
i was glad to get off that thing ralph miller of red deer 
was quoted as saying by the canadian press news agency 
miller who worked on the rig from 198082 said the problem 
stemmed from the rigs productivity according to the news agency 
the piper alpha rig was one of the best producers at 120000 
barrels of oil a day and one of the most profitable in the british 
section of the north sea 
miller was quoted as saying that pressure to keep the oil 
flowing led to lax maintenance with valves sometimes not turning 
and an inch or more of grease on some of the working decks 
basically it went down to neglect they had safety meetings 
but how much did it help miller was quoted as saying

angry vietnamese demanded stern 
measures against officials after revelations that a food shortage 
has made 10 million people hungry and caused 21 to die of 
starvation a vietnamese newspaper said 
in an exchange unusual even for communist vietnams current 
spate of selfcriticism a group of voters in ho chi minh city also 
questioned the national assemblys choice of a premier the report 
said 
about 300 people attended a briefing july 2 by a delegation of 
assembly deputies it said on june 22 the assembly chose 
conservative do muoi to be premier instead of vo van kiet a 
pioneer of of westernstyle economic reforms 
a text of the article in the july 5 edition of the newspaper 
young age in ho chi minh city formerly saigon was obtained monday 
from a western embassy in bangkok 
it said ly chanh trung head of a delegation of assembly members 
that met with the voters criticized a newspaper report that thanh 
hoa province near hanoi enjoyed a bumper harvest and the food 
shortage in the north had ended 
this is not true trung was quoted as saying according to 
statistics released by the council of ministers about 10 million 
people faced hunger 4 million people faced serious hunger and 21 
people died of starvation in various northern provinces 
the council of ministers is the cabinet the premier heads 
according to the article many voter representatives were 
shocked and became angry upon learning of this fact they then took 
turns to bombard the delegation with questions 
a man named doan ngoc tu said stern measures must be taken 
against leading cadres in charge of those localities because they 
have failed to cope with the situation 
nguyen ba nghe of a liaison committee for the industrialists 
and traders association said the government should let foreigners 
invest directly instead of only through state agencies 
most of the voters questions were about the election of the 
chairman of the council of ministers the article said 
some voters expressed their opinion as follows we need time 
to judge the correctness of the national assemblys decision 
nevertheless now that the national assembly has made a choice we 
must join hands in seeking solutions to our current very 
difficult economic political and social problems 
previous official reports from vietnam said the northern 
provinces suffered food shortages and nearfamine because 
drought cold weather storms and insects devastated last years 
rice crop 
kiet a deputy prime minister told the national assembly 
session in june the food crisis became worse because the council of 
ministers did not anticipate it and officials did not take urgent 
relief measures 
reports in the official media say better harvests early this 
year have provided more food for vietnams 63 million people most 
of whom live in the impoverished countryside 
the un world food program said june 24 it was sending 91 
million in food aid to help 15 million drought victims in vietnam 
it said un officials confirmed a serious deterioration of food 
supplies for 12 northern provinces 
vietnam appealed for more emergency aid but got little because 
the policy of most noncommunist countries is to isolate the 
vietnamese until they end their occupation of cambodia which began 
with an invasion in december 1978

fisheries officers in the area were issued with pistols and 
submachine guns last year and prier said he doubted whether 
sheaffer would have been apprehended without guns 
a year ago its likely the vessel would be heading into 
boston not into halifax he said 
canadian willingness to use armed force against the mary 
elizabeth should send a signal to other americans tempted to fish 
in canadian waters prier said they know we have the capability 
now of arresting their vessels 
at least five american captains were convicted last year of 
illegally entering or fishing in canadian waters mostly on georges 
bank an area of shallow water and lucrative lobster and scallop 
beds 
sheaffers three crewmembers all from the new bedford area 
were not charged and remained aboard their boat at a federal wharf 
according to officials 
they said the vessels catch of 1700 pounds of lobster and 
3960 pounds of flounder was seized and sold to a local fish 
market the profit will be returned to sheaffer if he is acquitted 
or used toward fines and port charges if he is convicted 
a conviction under the coastal fisheries protection act could 
result in a fine of up to 750000 622500 us plus forfeiture 
of the catch

jesse jackson told a farm group monday that 
all americans will pay a price for the double disaster 
afflicting agriculture the drought and reagan administration 
policies that have hurt family farmers 
jackson who followed vice president george bush to the podium 
at a meeting of farm broadcasters editors and educators said that 
in the seven years of the reagan administration weve lost 
600000plus family farmers the most efficient farmers in the 
history of the world 
something has gone awry when this many farmers are driven from 
the land while we import food from abroad subsidized by the us 
government jackson told 450 people at the us agricultural 
communicators congress 
he said the drought was not simply a farmers problem but a 
national crisis its a national security issue 
all of us must bear the burdenof the double disaster the 
reaganbush family farm policies and this lack of rain 
he charged the commodity markets were in a profiteering 
frenzy and said there is good reason to be concerned about 
profiteering pentagonstyle on the part of mammoth agribusinesses 
that could jump in and take over distressed farms 
the audience included earl butz the colorful and controversial 
secretary of agriculture for five years under president richard 
nixon who told jackson you and i came from family farms were 
part of the exoduswhy do we want to stop it now 
jackson a south carolina sharecroppers son said we left 
the family farm coming to get a jobnow the job is not there 
either 
while we leave farms fewer insensitive corporationsown 
more and control us more that comes as a threat to me said 
jackson who called for an international conference to address 
the implications of food distribution prices and stability around 
the world 
jackson said farming subject to drought floods bugs and other 
calamities cannot operate under classic freemarket rules 
even pharaoh in ancient egypt knew that when the drought came 
the rest of his system was in trouble he said a new system 
was in order a new vision was in order new leadership was in 
order 
butz who has an office at purdue university and lectures across 
the country said afterwards that the farm population is shrinking 
less now than it was in the 1960s and 1970s under both democratic 
and republican administrations he said he once heard soviet leader 
leonid brezhnev lament that 40 percent of his population was on the 
farm 
butz said that when he was born 40 percent of the american 
population was involved in agriculture wed be a nation of 
peasants clear across the board today if someone had had that 
philosophy then butz said 
after addressing the farm group jackson met with paul brountas 
a top aide to michael dukakis who is coordinating the expected 
nominees search for a running mate 
jackson emerged from the meeting and told reporters that he 
would accept the no 2 spot on the ticket if it were offered 
it was the first time he said publicly he would accept a vice 
presidential offer he has frequently pressed his demand for an 
offer but refused until monday to say whether he would accept it 
if it was offered to me i would accept it he said

prime minister margaret thatcher held a live radio 
phonein with soviet citizens monday on topics ranging from 
glasnost to household chores and invited a leningrad schoolgirl 
to visit her 
mrs thatcher fielded 15 calls during the 55minute program 
broadcast live to the soviet union on the british broadcasting 
corps russian service the bbc said more than 200 soviets called 
in 
speaking in english translated simultaneously into russian the 
prime minister was lavish in her praise for soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev and said she hoped the clock will not be turned back on 
his policies of glasnost or openness and economic reform 
i think that some things are irreversible but i dont think 
that they would go forward with anything like the same momentum if 
mr gorbachev were not there she said 
moscow dissident valery senderov called to solicit her views on 
the reforms gorbachev has already implemented 
i think its remarkable that after 70 years of what i might 
call the oldfashioned kind of communism mrs thatcher said 
that mr gorbachev should have been able to see that it was not 
producing either the standard of living that people wanted or the 
standard of social services 
to moscow resident karin saakiyan a hare krishna recently 
released from a psychiatric hospital mrs thatcher expressed 
optimism about religious freedom in the soviet union 
reporter alexander volkov of radio moscows international 
department asked mrs thatcher whether she still believed the us 
navy was justified in shooting down an iran air jetliner on july 3 
killing 290 people 
the sunday times of london reported a british intelligence 
agency monitored radio communications in the persian gulf before 
the incident and determined the plane was on course and climbing 
not descending toward the american warship vincennes 
mrs thatcher said that while you will know many many things 
now that were not known to that captain warships cannot be asked 
to defend commercial ships unless they have the right to defend 
themselves when they believe they are under attack 
but she added 
yes there will be times when they make a mistake and this 
tragic accident underlines the need for an early end to the 
iraniraq conflict conflict including an end to all attacks on 
shipping by both sides 
on a lighter note mrs thatcher told one curious inquirer from 
leningrad that she has no livein help at the apartment she and her 
husband denis share at no 10 downing st she told the man that 
she does most of the cooking when they are not attending banquets 
or official lunches 
schoolgirl masha kuznetsova called to invite young britons to 
visit her family in leningrad and was instead invited to meet the 
british prime minister in london 
oh dear if you come over and your school comes over i will 
ask our ambassador to let me know because i would like to see 
you mrs thatcher said perhaps youll come to no 10 downing 
st where i live well look forward to a visit 
edited highlights of the program were broadcast later monday on 
the bbcs englishlanguage world services 
a bbc spokesman said that until january 1987 the soviet union 
discouraged its citizens from listening to the bbc russian service 
by widespread electronic jamming 
an estimated 18 million people in the soviet union listen to the 
bbc company officials have said

the senate on the verge of passing a bill to 
raise the veterans administration to cabinet level voted monday to 
let veterans appeal to the courts when their claims for benefits 
are denied by the va 
the claims bill passed on an 8611 vote also would repeal a 
civil warera law that limits to 10 the amount a lawyer may charge 
for pressing a veterans claim 
for several hours senators debated a bill to create a 
department of veterans affairs as the 14th cabinet department but 
they put off a final vote until tuesday passage of the popular 
bill is virtually certain 
veterans ask only that their voice be heard at the cabinet 
table said sen frank murkowski of alaska senior republican on 
the senate veterans affairs committee 
the senate governmental affairs committee headed by sen john 
glenn dohio concluded that elevation of va to the cabinet 
would best serve americas veterans the american public and 
ultimately the president of the united states through 
strengthening of the cabinet as a policymaking mechanism 
the senate defeated an amendment that would have permitted 
president reagan to name the first secretary of veterans affairs 
immediately thus the first appointment will be left to the next 
president 
the house already has voted to raise the va to cabinet level but 
has refused four times in recent years to pass any bill allowing 
court review of va benefit decisions 
nevertheless sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the 
senate veterans affairs committee said i think this time we 
have enough momentum to get this review measure approved by the 
full congress 
the senate rejected by a 6136 margin an amendment by murkowski 
that would have allowed review only of va regulations not of the 
agencys factual findings about a veterans claim 
the senatepassed bill would permit a court to overturn an 
adverse finding by the vas board of veterans appeals only when 
the court finds the decision so utterly lacking in a rational 
basis in the evidence that a manifest and grievous injustice would 
result if such finding were not set aside 
allowing court review would raise veterans to full firstclass 
citizenship in the nation they fought so courageously to preserve 
and defend cranston said 
why is it that food stamp recipients ssi welfare 
recipients prisoners and those threatened by deportation can go 
to court and veterans cannot asked sen tom daschle dsd 
does anyone anywhere have evidence that the system is so 
broken that without federal court intervention in thousands of 
individual claims our veterans are going to be deprived of a fair 
shake asked murkowski he cited statistics that the board of 
veterans appeals reverses up to 25 percent of claim denials and 
said the bill would add about 4500 cases a year to the nations 
backlogged courts 
cranston said the old law limiting attorney fees in va benefit 
cases actually works against veterans 
whatever behavior characterized the legal profession at the 
time the original limitation was enacted following the civil war 
it is no longer credible to insist that attorneys would prey on 
innocent veterans cranston said 
voting against the courtreview bill were sens christopher

president reagan calling americans a 
compassionate people said monday the government will compensate 
the families of those who perished in an iranian airliner shot down 
by a us navy cruiser 
without admitting legal liability for the loss of 290 lives when 
iran air flight 655 was downed july 3 reagan said the payments 
should be made on behalf of the innocent people who were the 
victims 
there was no immediate indication how much money would be 
involved and a a state department official said we have a lot of 
facts to investigate before any payments are made 
in congress whose approval apparently would be required house 
speaker jim wright said lawmakers are likely to be sympathetic to 
reagans request but some members called the request premature 
because of stillunanswered questions about the incident some said 
compensation should be paid only after americans being held hostage 
in lebanon are freed 
in its announcement the white house said there would be no 
lowering of the us military profile in the persian gulf and 
reagan stressed that theres certainly going to be no 
compensation for the iranian government 
on the eve of a scheduled united nations security council debate 
on the incident the administration said ultimate responsibility 
rests with those who refuse to end the iraniraq war 
especially iran which has refused for almost a year to accept and 
implement security council resolution 598 while it continues 
unprovoked attacks on innocent neutral shipping and crews in the 
international waters of the gulf 
we will not countenance any impression that this is a payment 
to the government or an admission of liability or is in response to 
any other external pressure or external international political 
condition between our two countries white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
irans ambassador to the united nations mohammad jaafar 
mahallati said the us offer was unsatisfactory 
i have already stated that the proper term is reparation 
mahallati said but reparation is not sufficient definitely 
because the root cause of this tragedy and similar tragedies should 
be removed from the persian gulf 
and it cannot be anything less than withdrawal of us forces 
from the persian gulf 
democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson called reagans 
offer the correct humanitarian expression 
it gives us the opportunity now if iran responds to get iran 
and iraq back to the table to try to resolve and sign un 
resolution 598 to reduce the tensions in the area to allow us to 
gracefully reduce our military presence in the area and to maybe 
have more un presence in the area he said 
amid conflicting reports about whether iran recovered the flight 
recorder from the downed a300 airbus the white house said anew 
that capt will c rogers iii commander of the uss vincennes took 
justifiable defensive actions to protect himself against feared 
attack by an iranian f14 warplane 
fitzwater also said he wasnt sure whether the administration 
would have to ask congress to appropriate the compensation payments 
but that it would not hesitate to do so 
a state department official who briefed reporters on condition 
of anonymity said it was not yet clear whether a flat amount will 
be paid for each victim or whether the age number of dependents 
and earnings of the victims will be taken into account in assessing 
compensation 
we have a huge job ahead of us he said we have a lot of 
facts to investigate 
reagan asked whether giving compensation might send a bad 
signal said i dont ever find compassion a bad precedent 
on capitol hill wright dtexas said if the president is 
satisfied that payments are warranted i would imagine the 
congress would be satisfied 
but house democratic whip tony coelho of california the partys 
chief votecounter said he believed the request would have some 
problems and said he was personally opposed to it 
sen john mccain rariz a former prisoner of war in vietnam 
said that as long as americans remain hostage in lebanon by 
proiranian elements there will be resentment to any payment to 
any iranian under any circumstances 
fitzwater made clear that the money would be channeled through 
some thirdparty organization or intermediary such as the red 
crescent an arm of the red cross and not the iranian government 
he acknowledged that the us government had not yet addressed 
the question of how and with whom to verify the identities of the 
dead or survivors who will likely make claims for compensation 
all but 38 of the iran air passengers were from iran the others 
were from india italy pakistan turkey yugoslavia and the united 
arab emirates 
during a picturetaking session with salvadoran president jose 
napoleon duarte who is recuperating from cancer surgery here 
reagan told reporters i from the first have said were a 
compassionate people and i think that we all have compassion for 
the families of those unfortunate people who were on that plane 
the president said he understood a recent public opinion poll 
showing a majority of americans opposed the granting of 
compensation but said i think that they have tied that to our 
feelings about the government and what it did with regard to our 
people in the embassy there in tehran in 1979 when the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini came in to power 
the administration left several questions unanswered fitzwater 
said he had no idea of the amount of money to be offered 
as the administration moved on the question of compensation 
there were these other developments 
the khaleej times in dubai quoted unidentified salvage experts 
in dubai as saying the iranians recovered the flight recorder from 
the downed airliner in the past few days but irans navy commander 
said search teams had so far failed to find the flight recorder 
tehran radio reported 
with the security council convening tuesday to debate the 
incident the united states britain and france were expected to 
use their veto power as permanent council members to kill any 
attempt to censure the united states 
fitzwater said he would not try to compare payments in iran 
airliner case with compensation the united states is seeking from 
iraq for its may 1987 attack on the uss stark thirtyseven 
american crewmen were killed 
there have been reports that the united states is seeking 1 
million for the families of each of those victims

a congressman expressed concern monday about 
defense secretary frank carluccis receipt of deferred compensation 
year from a weapons contractor on whose board he once served and 
which now is under investigation in the pentagon contracting probe 
rep jim florio dnj said carlucci received the money in 
march from the detroitbased unisys corp on whose board of 
directors carlucci served from 1984 through 1986 carlucci after 
his appointment last year disqualified himself from any decisions 
involving unisys 
florio in a letter to carlucci wrote while i understand 
that this payment was deferred compensation i am concerned that 
such a payment to a secretary of defense who is in charge of 
investigating the same defense contractor creates a serious 
appearance of a conflict of interest 
the payment is explained on a financial disclosure form filed by 
carlucci in may as a deferred compensation plan for directors of 
unisys cashed out 
an earlier disclosure filed in november listed the value as 
82482 the payment is dated in march about four months after 
carlucci was reassigned by president reagan from national security 
advisor to secretary of defense 
carlucci also transferred into an insurance annuity an annual 
pension of 14300 due from unisys according to the disclosure 
forms 
carlucci left the private sector in january 1987 to rejoin the 
administration in the national security post 
florio said he questions if the payments originally planned 
for after carlucci left federal service are appropriate given 
carluccis post and the ongoing probe 
i am concerned about the credibility of a secretary of defense 
investigating a defense contractor who recently provided him with 
compensation florio said 
according to pentagon officials carlucci himself is not 
directly involved in the investigation of contract fraud

the first trial stemming from a reported 
abduction and gang rape of a 19yearold woman was postponed 
monday after the prosecutor said he needed more time find 
impartial jurors in this closeknit town 
many potential jurors in this southern texas town of about 5000 
are related to the victim or defendants or have been exposed to 
extensive media coverage of the woman who told authorities she was 
kidnapped raped and sodomized by as many as 20 men march 26 
assistant district attorney rodolfo gutierrez the prosecutor 
said unrelated trials scheduled in the court would have forced the 
case to be rushed had it been tried this week 
wed be under pressure to finish this case this week and we 
just felt it was a little unrealistic at this point because we 
dont know how long its going to take to select a jury 
gutierrez said 
orlando garza and corando perez jr both 23 were to stand 
trial on sexual assault charges monday but 229th judicial district 
judge ricardo garcia and defense attorneys agreed to gutierrezs 
request the date was moved to sept 12 
the woman told police the assaults took place over a fourhour 
period and began at a rural area north of town where a latenight 
cockfight was taking place those at the cockfight she said 
either ignored her pleas for help or joined in the attacks in the 
back seat and on the hood of a car 
ten men were indicted april 11 on charges ranging from 
kidnapping and aggravated kidnapping to sexual assault the 
prosecutor said some of the rape cases may be combined

congress is likely to be receptive to 
president reagans request for compensation to families of those 
killed in the us shootdown of an iranian airliner house speaker 
jim wright said monday 
but some lawmakers called the request premature because 
unanswered questions remain about the incident and others 
continued to call for release of us hostages in lebanon as a 
requirement for any aid wrights chief democratic votecounter 
said approval of the aid was far from a sure thing 
offering payments to the bereaved survivors of the 290 victims 
would be a voluntary act committed by a nation that is both 
generous and genuinely regretful of the incident wright 
dtexas told reporters he said he expected quick action once 
reagan formally makes a request of congress 
if the president is satisfied that payments are warranted i 
would imagine the congress would be satisfied wright said 
leading members of the congressional foreign policy and defense 
committees have spoken out in favor of making such payments 
but it was unclear whether approval could be taken for granted 
house democratic whip tony coelho of california the partys chief 
votecounter said he believed the request would have some 
problems and said he was personally opposed to it 
sen john mccain rariz said as long as americans remain as 
hostages in lebanon there will be resentment to any payment to 
any iranian under any circumstances he said he believed reagan 
had made the offer as an emotional response to the downing of the 
jetliner 
the bipartisan leadership of congress was scheduled to meet with 
reagan on tuesday and the compensation issue was expected to be 
high on the agenda 
wright said it is important that the gesture not be seen as an 
acknowledgement of guilt and that it not be routed through the 
iranian government either of which would make it tougher for 
congress to swallow 
the administration has emphasized that the compensation would be 
distributed through nongovernmental channels in iran 
a national washington postabc news poll last week found that 61 
percent of those surveyed opposed the idea of paying compensation 
and an even greater majority 71 percent believed the captain of 
the uss vincennes was justified in firing the missiles that downed 
the commercial a300 airbus 
but wright said he believed that was a misleading reading based 
on early impressions that payment of compensation would somehow be 
an apology to the iranian government or an admission of us 
liability 
it is a different proposition the way in which i think the 
president stated it he said 
several members of congress have said the payments ought to be 
linked to the release of american hostages being held in lebanon by 
radical factions said to be under iranian control 
mccain said letting the hostages go would show the iranians 
are interested in peace and concerned about the lives of innocent 
human beings he said the payments will be perceived as a 
payoff to iran whether we like it or not 
but wright said there should be no attempt to link the two 
issues that would appear to be a form of ransoming our hostages 
which we have refrained from doing he said because the payments 
would be made directly to bereaved families no 
governmenttogovernment conditions could be attached he added 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sen sam 
nunn dga said his reaction to the presidents announcement was 
generally positive but that payment should hinge on whether 
the persian gulf becomes a safer place 
the actual payment should be made in connection with the end 
of the iraniraq war or at least the end of attacks by iran and 
iraq on innocent shipping in the gulf he said 
coelho was skeptical about the presidents request im not 
inclined to provide payments to iranians he said i want to 
know who is at fault and everything about it maybe we have 
another secret irancontra deal working i dont understand why 
theyre trying to move it along 
it remained unclear precisely what legal authority would be used 
to make the payments or how they could be negotiated and arranged 
since the united states has no diplomatic relations with iran 
but sen arlen specter rpa noted that if you are 
interested in paying money its not hard to find a way he said 
he supported reagans proposal to show the iranian people that 
the people of the united states are a just society and that the 
propaganda they get from their government about the united states 
is false 
the payments would be what lawyers call ex gratia made 
voluntarily without admitting guilt or liability under 
international law nations have no legal liability for damages 
caused as a result of war or hostilities 
but some administration advisers have been concerned that the 
united states not be likened to the soviet union which refused to 
make compensation after shooting down a korean air lines passenger 
plane over the sea of japan in 1983 according to congressional 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity

the pentagon acting monday on an earlier 
announcement by defense secretary frank carlucci banned two 
companies and three individuals from doing business with it as a 
result of the military procurement investigation 
at the same time the defense department lifted the suspension 
of contract payments on six military projects involving nine 
companies that carlucci on july 1 ordered frozen based on evidence 
from affidavits in the case unsealed by a federal court in dallas 
contracts on the nine programs were valued in excess of 1 
billion although work on some of the contracts had already been 
completed 
in a related action the pentagon said the navy initiated 
action to suspend without pay george stone a contracting 
employee who allegedly passed along information that may have 
helped several companies submit winning bids on military programs 
carlucci had already announced that step 
and abc news reported monday night that a woman who worked in 
the office of former assistant navy secretary melvyn paisley says 
she was ordered to make copies of classified documents by a senior 
military aide to the former pentagon official paisley has been a 
target of the procurement probe 
i said this is wrong were not supposed to be doing this 
were not supposed to duplicate classified material the 
unidentified former staffer told the network 
she said she copied the documents on the directions of paisleys 
executive aide capt robert toll 
absolutely false said toll who is now retired in denying 
any copying of classified documents 
abc also said that william galvin a defense consultant whose 
name has also surfaced in the investigation often visited paisley 
at his pentagon office but staff members did not note the visit on 
the official logs 
announcement of the banning actions came the day before carlucci 
was scheduled to appear before the senate armed services committee 
to explain what actions he was taking on the basis of his july 1 
announcement 
carluccis comments surprised some navy officials some members 
of congress and contractors who have sought to determine exactly 
which payments and contractors were involved some of the affected 
programs involve dozens of subcontractors and the legal 
implications of carluccis action was unclear 
the two companies that were suspended were varian continental of 
dallas and acquisition control of alexandria va the announcement 
said the three individuals were mark saunders thomas e muldoon 
and joe bradley 
the department resumed payment to unisys in a 712 million 
antisubmarine warfare program to litton industries in a 150 
million program to develop a handheld digital radio transmitter 
trw on the antisubmarine warfare program itt on a 51 million 
fiber optics program continental electronics on a 63 million 
very low frequency transmitter loral terracom and canadian 
commercial on a 49 million radio program and hughes aircraft and 
raytheon corp on a 38 million carrier combat direction system 
earlier monday charles bowsher head of the congressional 
general accounting office told the senate armed services committee 
that carlucci should hold off on suspending contracts or debarring 
contractors while the probe is under way 
it might be better to let the investigative process work 
bowsher said later if there are indictments those contracts 
could be suspended and if there are convictions the contractors 
could eventually be debarred he noted 
when he suspended the payments carlucci was under political 
pressure to demonstrate that he was working to clean up the 
military procurement system widely criticized as a result of the 
investigation 
carlucci in his announcement on july 1 said he had initiated 
suspension procedures against stone saunders bradley and the 
continental electronics division of varian associates inc 
according to the affadivits released a day earlier fbi agents 
eavesdropped as stone read to saunders a consultant the secret 
bids from 10 companies competing for a 120 million advanced 
tactical air command and control system payment on that project 
was resumed monday 
saunders is a former navy procurement officer convicted of and 
fired for stock trading on insider navy information in 1982 the 
fbi said saunders was receiving inside contract data from stone 
his navy successor and it believes that saunders is paying stone 
for this information 
stone was one of six pentagon officials transferred to other 
duties after their offices were searched 
bradley was placed on administrative leave from his job as vice 
president for marketing of varian continental of palo alto 
calif according to a company spokesman 
muldoon a former employee of the unisys plant in great neck 
ny later set up his own consulting firm in washington with 
clients including litton hazeltine and emhart according the 
affadavit unsealed in dallas muldoon paid saunders 4000 out of 
an 8000 monthly retainer from litton in exchange for contract 
information

the conflict

officials and with soviet military commanders in kabul the capital

kentuckys governor blasted the federal government monday for 
being too slow in dealing with the drought and iowas governor 
warned that farmers there still face potential disaster despite up 
to 5 inches of rain over the weekend 
crews began installing pumps on barges monday to haul fresh 
water to southern louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in 
the lower mississippi river which has been so weakened by the 
drought that salty seawater is forcing its way inland 
a cold front brought showers and lower temperatures to parts of 
the midwest and plains but a heat wave lingered in the east new 
york city hit a record 98 degrees its fifth day in six of highs of 
90 or better and downtown baltimore reached a record 102 
connecticuts department of environmental protection said air 
quality was unhealthful to very unhealthful 
meanwhile the hot dry weather has brought bigcity smog to the 
countryside from maine to georgia during the past two weeks a 
pennsylvania state university professor said monday 
accumulated city pollutants mostly from car exhaust have 
spread across the region at times pushing ozone levels beyond 
federal air quality standards said john m skelly a professor of 
plant pathology who researches the effects of air pollition and 
acid rain on forests 
much of an area from maine to georgia and as far west as chicago 
recorded ozone levels higher than 120 part per billion for 10 
straight days ending friday he said 
a reading of of more than 120 for one hour on two consecutive 
days violates us environmental protection agency air quality 
standards levels of 100 or higher can cause shortness of breath 
raspy throats sore eyes and irritated mucous membranes 
in washington house speaker jim wright said he hopes a drought 
relief package with disaster payments of up to 100000 per farmer 
will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in 
congress this week he said the bill being drawn up would make 
farmers in more than 1880 counties in 37 states that have been 
called disaster areas eligible for payments 
officials said the us army corps of engineers is still weeks 
away from deciding whether more great lakes water should be 
diverted to the mississippi for barge traffic that is opposed by 
most great lakes governors and the government of canada 
the drought could even force dozens of kentuckys small 
thoroughbred horse operations out of business because it is forcing 
up the price of oats and hay an industry official says 
in addition dusty dry fields cause more respiratory problems 
for horses resulting in higher medical bills says nick nicholson 
executive vice president of the kentucky thoroughbred association 
kentucky has about 4000 horse farms and in 1986 public auctions of 
horses generated 520 million 
some parts of iowa got up to 5 inches of rain over the weekend 
but totals of about onehalf inch were more common 
were certainly not out of the emergency situation iowa 
gov terry branstad said some of the corn crop has already been 
severely damaged theyre going to have to have additional moisture 
in the very near future the next 10 days or so 
branstad said farmers who have private crop insurance should be 
eligible for public aid programs even though theyll receive 
partial payment for their losses from that coverage to encourage 
more people to get such protection 
widespread rain has alleviated the drought across louisiana but 
means only a partial recovery agriculture commissioner bob odom 
told the louisiana farm bureau federation convention monday 
of about 700000 acres of cotton planted across louisiana he 
said an estimated 100000 acres will be abandoned or plowed under 
and replanted in soybeans that could mean a loss of 35 million to 
40 million he said 
hundreds of kentuckys city and county officials met monday to 
hear predictions that the drought could get worse 
because so much ground moisture already has been lost in 
kentucky a return to normal rainfall wont break the drought 
said state climatologist glen conner severe or extreme 
conditions likely will persist through september 
kentucky gov wallace wilkinson scored agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng and the us department of agriculture for saying 
it was too early to determine how much crop yield had been lost 
i dont think washington has acted strongly or swiftly 
enough wilkinson told reporters anybody who couldnt 
determine that yields have been damaged before now shouldnt be in 
agriculture 
parts of ohio got scattered light rain monday the first to fall 
this month mercer county extension agent earl j beiler told of 
two farmers within five miles of each other near rockford who 
reported widely varying amounts 
one had twotenths of an inch and the other had 
seventenths beiler said as dry as it is the seventenths 
will probably get down and do some good but the twotenths is 
hardly enough to wash the dust off 
not everyone suffers from too little water 
three to 6 inches of rain fell on parts of texas flooding some 
lowlying roads verde creek reportedly rose 7 feet and the weather 
service said the llano rivers north fork near roosevelt swelled 22 
feet

asked a federal magistrate monday to stop the demolition of a 
historic warehouse district where a food company wants to build a 
50 million corporate headquarters and research complex 
the trust a group calling itself people for responsible omaha 
urban development and others want an injunction preventing conagra 
inc from leveling the jobbers canyon warehouse district 
the hearing before magistrate richard kopf was expected to last 
a week 
the 20acre district near downtown and the missouri river 
consists of turnofthecentury warehouses and is on the national 
register of historic places several buildings in the district 
already have been razed 
steve achelpohl who represents the trust argued that plans for 
the riverfront development project should be subject to approval of 
the interstate commerce commission the national park service and 
the us army corps of engineers 
he said the federal agencies must approve various aspects of the 
project including railroad track abandonment and changes in flood 
control procedures 
but assistant us attorney paul madgett who represents the 
federal agencies moved for dismissal of the case saying the 
agencies werent involved in the project and there was no 
indication any federal money would be involved

two black families moved into apartments in a 
formerly allwhite housing project without incident monday as 
authorities kept bystanders and the media at a distance 
boston police watched as movers carried furniture and belongings 
into the threestory brick buildings at the south boston project 
which has been without black tenants for more than 10 years 
south boston a predominantly white neighborhood was the scene 
of racial violence when public schools were integrated under a 
federal court order more than a decade ago 
the families were granted threebedroom apartments as part of an 
emergency boston housing authority program 
the move however was unconnected to an integration plan 
affecting 31 of bostons 69 projects the plan by boston mayor 
raymond l flynn and the us department of housing and urban 
development seeks to provide subsidized housing for an estimated 
500 black families passed over for placement in south boston and 
the citys charlestown section since 1983 
city officials hope successful implementation of the plan will 
stall a lawsuit by minority groups 
boston police spokesman james jordan said authorities have a 
public safety plan for the south boston project adding 
should anything happen the police response would be virtually 
immediate its an intensive plan but with a low visibilty as far 
as uniforms are concerned 
im no pioneer said one of the new black residents bessie 
payne on the eve of the move im just almost a homeless person 
and i dont like that feeling at all im looking forward to 
making a new home and getting my life straightened out again 
many residents watching the families move in said the black 
families would not encounter problems from neighbors 
i really think the press has blown it out of proportion 
said 18yearold kelly manion watching movers carry furniture 
through a doorway decorated with shamrocks well get along 
together in fact it just might be good for the people living 
here 
another neighbor who refused to give her name said its 
just like any family moving in they wont be treated any different 
than anyone else new to the project 
but julie jellow was less optimistic about tranquility in the 
project jellow 29 said she has received threats and abuse 
because of her two children fathered by a black man

a general services administration appeals 
board on monday reiterated its contention that it has jurisdiction 
over a postal service contract with texas billionaire h ross perot 
and ruled that it will hear complaints about the contract 
the postal service maintains the gsa does not have authority 
over the contract but on friday suspended its contract with perot 
because the gsas board of contract appeals had ordered the pact 
suspended 
the postal service continues to believe that the contract 
appeals board does not have jurisdiction said jim van loozen a 
spokesman for the postal service 
but we would hope that they would now bring those matters to 
some conclusion and rule promptly on those protests van 
loozen added 
at least two competitors of perot had complained to the 
contracts board about the pact under which perot agreed to study 
ways to improve the agencys efficiency 
van loozen said the contract dispute concerns whether the postal 
service complied with the brooks act a law outlining contracting 
procedures for most federal entities 
we have already agreed that we did not comply with the act 
the postal reorganization act of 1970 that set up the postal 
service as an independent agency gives us specific authority to 
contract for ourselves said van loozen 
the agency last week asked the federal appeals court to rule on 
whether the gsa contracts board has jurisdiction over its 
activities no date has been set for that hearing

united nations the security council convenes tuesday to debate

the united states britain and france are expected to use their

resolution or demand that the us fleet leave the persian gulf 
requesting the debate is a turnabout for iran which has 
boycotted council sessions for years because it says the 
15nation body bows to pressure from washington and is biased 
against iran in the 8yearold war with iraq 
it was not clear monday whether a resolution would be presented 
for a vote iranian officials have said they seek condemnation of

breakdancing thats old if you want to be cool 
in beijing this summer pool is the game 
pool tables have appeared on sidewalks all over the city in a 
craze that participants attribute to television coverage of a 
recent international pool tournament in beijing 
never mind that many of the tables tilt or rock slightly because 
of uneven sidewalks or that the players miss shots more often than 
not 
in a city where most residents flee their tiny hot apartments 
on summer evenings and mahjong and card games are the only 
diversions pool is a welcome discovery the tables are set up 
outdoors because few people have the space inside

as china rushes into economic and social change 
its university students are coming under increasing stress and 
pressure to achieve officials have begun to offer them 
psychological counseling 
competition of course brings more stress to students said 
chen chongkeng director of the clinical psychology section of 
beijing universitys psychology department 
at one time under the chinese communist system students were 
assured of a plum job after graduation but todays students are 
told to start looking for employment on their own and many find 
the competition tough 
a college education also used to be free with the state picking 
up the tuition and giving students a monthly subsidy but students 
soon will have to start paying at least part of the cost 
some school authorities are beginning to realize the effect 
these changes can have on students and are providing counseling 
services 
the centers are also part of chinas changing attitude toward 
psychology and mental health 
during the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution all 
psychological work ceased and psychologists were told their field 
was unscientific 
now psychology has returned to most major universities and 
hospitals selfhelp mental health books are best sellers 
in 1986 an allchina youth mental health conference was 
convened and teachers and delegates agreed that psychological 
problems among college students was an area of concern chen said 
in this capital four schools including the prestigious beijing 
university have set up counseling centers at least 30 colleges 
and universities nationwide are providing similar services 
the counseling center at the beijing post and telecommunications 
college started in 1985 has treated 1224 students according to 
the englishlanguage newspaper china daily 
college students have many psychological problems which affect 
their studies said wang yan a specialist in childrens 
emotional disorders at beijing university china is just 
beginning to work on mental health and college students seem to 
have the greatest psychological problems 
one beijing university senior told a chinese newspaper that he 
feels just like a small boat sailing into the tempestuous sea 
with little psychological preparation 
some of the problems are not unusual or serious 
chen who heads the counseling center at beijing university 
said they rarely see serious cases of mental disorders in the 
students who come to the center inability of new students to 
adjust and relationship and romantic problems are most common 
however some extreme cases have been reported 
an 18yearold freshman at qinghua university chinas most 
prestigious technical school committed suicide last summer after 
failing an english exam 
liu yong a senior at beijing aviation college killed himself 
last summer after murdering a female classmate newspaper reports 
said he became emotionally unstable after reading the philosophies 
of jean paul sartre and nietzsche and the writing of french 
novelist emile zola 
the counseling centers provide a muchneeded service chen said 
but he was critical of their use of what he called common sense 
psychology 
many of the centers are staffed with wellmeaning teachers or 
other school personnel who have little training in psychology he 
said 
by contrast the clinic at beijing university is made up of four 
people from the psychology department 
a session with one of the psychologists costs 2 yuan 54 cents 
when the center opened two years ago treatment was free and four 
to five students came every day however financial concerns forced 
the professors to begin charging for their services this year 
chen calls their treatment method collective meaning that 
they use all methods and schools of psychology including freudian 
psychotherapy 
we use whatever is suitable for the patient he said

room 890 in the intensive care unit of the 
banacha street hospital is spacious and clean its neurological 
unit has four new heartmonitors and stateoftheart respirators 
but it has not had a patient in the last two years 
we have equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars but we 
dont have the zlotys to pay the nurses so the equipment goes 
unused said dr andrzej friedman a neurologist at the hospital 
around the corner other rooms in the hospital are so crowded 
that critically ill stroke patients are kept on beds in the 
corridor a sight typical in many polish hospitals 
forty years after the communist government promised its citizens 
free and adequate health care the system itself is in critical 
condition 
poles must pay at every stage for decent care 
shortages of supplies requires for example the 
resterilization and reuse of disposable needles intravenous 
plasma units and catheters 
at the same time poles in general arent careful about their 
own personal health they are among the worlds heaviest smokers 
and drinkers and their diet is high in animal fat 
the staterun health service however puts a low priority on 
preventive medicine 
the main difficulty now is the organization of the system and 
the enormous bureaucracy we are short of everything but we could 
do better with what we have if the system were better organized 
said dr zofia kuratowska a health adviser to the banned 
solidarity trade union 
the problems start with hospital buildings threefourths are 
more than 50 years old according to a 1987 world bank study which 
concluded that half of the oldest hospitals should be replaced 
because they cannot be modernized 
one government solution has been to invest in such huge modern 
showcases as the health center for the polish mother in lodz a 
polluted industrial city in central poland whose residents are 
among the countrys least healthy 
the centers attractive working conditions have drained doctors 
and nurses from other facilities 
they the government are making these monument buildings that 
are a real idiocy because they will serve only a few people said 
friedman 
diagnosis appears to be one of the weak links of the health 
system catscans to assess brain damage can take two weeks to 
process and xray film is often faulty 
in our hospitals the machines only work a few hours a day 
said kuratowski the solidarity adviser people wait weeks for 
simple procedures blocking beds in the hospital and sometimes 
its very dangerous 
she heads the social foundation for workers solidarity 
established by the union to help administer a 1 million grant it 
received last year from the us congress the foundation hopes to 
establish three diagnostic clinics in warsaw gdansk and krakow 
but plans have been delayed because the government has yet to 
officially register the foundation 
being a doctor or nurse is not financially rewarding at 
midcareer a doctor earns about 30000 zlotys 69 a month and 
nurses 18000 zlotys 41 less than the national average of 
42000 97 
because of the salary a lot of doctors are trying to emigrate 
or thinking about it said kuratowska a young doctor does not 
make enough money to create a stable life for his family 
as a result some take money on the side she added 
people in hospitals must pay for just about everything and 
very often unfortunately the doctors take money as a bribe 
the cost to patients often runs high 
admission to some warsaw maternity wards is 100000 zlotys 
232 complicated cancer or heart operations can cost 500000 
zlotys 1162 
and once a doctor has made a diagnosis the patient must try to 
find medicine which though inexpensive by western standards is in 
chronic short supply 
the government allows private or cooperative clinics to take 
some of the pressures off on the state system but treatment is 
expensive a tooth extraction in a private clinic can cost 15000 
zlotys 34 more than onethird of the monthly wage 
although the government plans to reform the health system it 
appears reluctant to endorse reforms that ideologically would 
threaten the concept of socialized free medicine 
kuratowska believes poles should be allowed medical insurance so 
they can recover some of their costs 
that she said would make things more equitable in a 
freehealth system where people must pay anyway

the social security fund is developing a surplus 
and like any big bundle of public money it is also creating a 
political controversy 
should the funds be used to finance new spending programs 
should the social security tax be reduced should the fund be left 
alone to build assets for financing retirements in the next century 
with the surplus projected at 37 billion in the current fiscal 
year rising to nearly 500 billion by 2015 some analysts view it 
as the savior of a nation wracked by budget deficits 
like a spendthrift who thinks money is wasted if it isnt spent 
some politicians are busily devising plans for new governmental 
programs that may or may not have merit and that otherwise 
wouldnt have funds either 
and some such as peter ferrara of the heritage foundation warn 
that the growing surplus is but a temporary thing a consequence of 
young workers paying in big amounts that inevitably will be 
needed when their retirements come 
the disappointing truth is social security surpluses will 
become large deficits in about 25 years says ferrara a fellow 
in political economy at the heritage foundation a conservative 
washingtonbased think tank 
as with others ferrara expresses almost no faith in the 
judgment of politicians presented with large sums of money to wit 
if policymakers assume that such surpluses will eliminate 
federal budget deficits and pay off the national debt they are 
likely to abandon attempts to balance the budget spend billions of 
dollars of anticipated revenue that they will never receive and 
plunge the nation into financial catastrophe 
not everyone sees it that way and some have credentials 
ab laffer and associates a california consulting firm states 
that under current law projected annual social security surpluses 
will produce budget surpluses for 20 years or more by 1994 sen 
daniel patrick moynihan dny has spoken glowingly of the 
surplus and its possibilities 
ferrara disagrees an analysis such as lafflers he says fails 
to add any adjustment for inflation or other variables or for the 
effect of economic growth over time this he says leaves a 
badly distorted impression 
for at least the next two decades however the funds surpluses 
should grow simply because the youth bulge baby boomers if you 
choose will be working its way through the economy paying in 
more than it takes out 
but when they begin to retire says ferrara they will create a 
demographic wind shear by his estimates all the social security 
trust funds together will begin adding to the federal deficit in 
the year 2013 
an analysis by jp morgan amp co expresses similar fears rather 
than spending it suggests productive investment of the surplus can 
promote domestic savings and investment and help control the trade 
and budget deficits 
ferrara would repeal the social security payrolltax increase 
made in january and the boost due in january 1990 
he argues that not only are the increases not needed at this 
time but that eliminating them would tend to add jobs to the 
economy that would actually increase social security revenues and 
finance benefits to be paid in the 2000s 
he suggests also policymakers should allow participants the 
choice of substituting private savings and insurance accounts for 
future social security benefits 
to do so he contends could reduce reliance on social 
security in the future sufficiently to avoid the need for any tax 
increases and even possibly create sufficient room for further 
payroll tax relief 
morgan recommends partial privatization of the surplus that is 
allowing contributors to the social security system to divert a 
portion of their payroll tax to individual retirement accounts 
iras so as to maximize the return 
this public debate is only beginning it has at least a decade 
or more to go and it probably will heat up each year as the 
surplus grows

psst tucked away on the sixth floor of a 
downtown washington office building is a bookstore for spies where 
you can learn how to change your identity determine if your 
telephone is bugged look inside the kgb or get some selfhelp 
guidance on becoming an agent 
but you almost have to engage in espionage to find the national 
intelligence book center which specializes in books magazines 
computer software and tapes on spies cryptography surveillance 
the cia the kgb and spooks of all kinds 
it is one of washingtons secrets this whispery oneroom shop 
once you find it there are plenty of clues that this is not your 
runofthemill bookstore 
access is controlled by a hightech security door callers on 
hold are treated to taperecorded readings from famous spy tales 
the store is open to the public only three days a week and visitors 
must check packages in lockers before entering 
there is no telling who youll bump into among the clientele 
elizabeth bancroft the stores founder and director refuses to 
name her customers they prefer to remain covert but patrons 
include famous authors literary editors doctors lawyers and of 
course government officials from the united states and abroad 
one customer of ms bancrofts mailorder service was said to be 
the late william j casey former director of the cia and author of 
the secret war against hitler posthumously published memoirs 
of his service in the cias world war ii forerunner the office of 
strategic services norman mailer and jacqueline onassis reportedly 
have contacted the store 
its a crossroads for people in the intelligence community 
says writer jim hougan i consider myself knowledgeable in this 
area but some of the stuff in her store is really astonishing 
joseph goulden another writer hooked on true spy tales limits 
himself to about one visit a month if i went too often id be 
broke i could easily spend 2000 in there 
browsers there are about 30 or 40 a day often spend several 
hours at the center ms bancroft said she finally had to remove 
chairs from the room to prevent patrons from parking themselves all 
day 
ms bancroft a crisp blackhaired woman who turned her 
fascination with the netherworld of spying into her lifes work 
prides herself on the range of books she has compiled 
most of the 1400 titles are nonfiction but the center stocks 
a smattering of spy fiction such as the works of john le carre and 
ian flemings james bond stories 
the store carries everything from the sovietinspired devil 
and his dart how the cia is plotting in the third world to 
the whole spy catalogue an espionage lovers guide and david 
kahns seminal volume on cryptography the code breakers

silencers 
the most popular books ms bancroft says are from obscure 
publishers how to disappear completely and never be found and 
how to create a new identity the latter written by 
anonymous outlines stepbystep ways to get a new drivers 
license credit cards birth certificate and other documents 
among the duds anything to do with the irancontra affair 
i had to give some ollie north books away because no one was 
buying them ms bancroft says north a former marine lieutenant 
colonel has been indicted for his role in selling weapons to iran 
and diverting the profits to the nicaraguan contras 
bancroft a harvardeducated new yorker who had worked as a 
professional fundraiser before she plunged into the book business 
started the center as a mailorder operation in her home about two 
years ago she specialized in finding obscure books on intelligence 
gathering 
so successful was the operation people routinely showed up at 
her doorstep that she sold her house moved into an apartment and 
stocked a rented office with books she expanded into new quarters 
in the same building a few months ago 
until just recently ms bancroft didnt advertise the shop 
depended on whisperofmouth for customers to learn of its 
existence 
although she has received strong moral support from wellknown 
excia officials ms bancroft says financing for the store comes 
from private investors and loans 
we have had people invest who are interested in the subject 
matter but no one i know of is being funded by an intelligence 
group she says 
with only one assistant ms bancroft often works 18hour days 
answering questions from customers ordering books and wrapping 
packages at the store which started to turn a profit recently 
bancroft has no plans to expand to a regular streetlevel 
operation 
people like the idea that we are hidden away she says 
besides she adds i am not big on dealing with the public

the hot evening air was laden with 
yellow dust from the kara kum desert when darkeyed murad khydyrov 
was born in a mapleshaded hospital and swaddled in a long white 
cloth

born each year in the arid oilrich soviet republic of turkmenia 
tilted his nations demographic balance a bit more away from the 
slavic north and toward the moslem south 
sprawling over an area half the size of the continental united 
states and peopled by more than 47 million inhabitants drawn from a 
rich multihued palette of ethnic groups soviet central asia is 
now riding a demographic boom that is making it the countrys new 
heartland 
soviet tadzhikistan alone has more than 30000 bemedaled hero 
mothers with 10 or more children each in turkmenia children 14 
and younger are 40 percent of the total population and a majority 
in some areas uzbekistans overtaxed schools work double shifts 
exactly when central asians will outnumber their european 
countrymen is in dispute but an asian majority that is largely 
moslem in customs and rural in lifestyle is forming as it does it 
presents difficult problems for the kremlin leadership which for 
seven decades has been dominated by slavs and other urbanized 
europeans 
despite its demographic dynamism central asia wields little 
political clout on the national scene none of its natives sits on 
the politburo the communist partys ruling body nor do central 
asians wield heavy responsibility in the moscowbased central 
government 
at the same time the region from the blondtinted deserts of 
turkmenia to the roof of the soviet union the glacierlaced 
peaks of the pamirs in tadzhikistan is wrestling with the 
demands of mikhail s gorbachevs drive for economic and social 
change 
statistics show perestroika the kremlins campaign for 
national economic renewal is making slow headway in the five 
republics of soviet central asia turkmenia tadzhikistan 
kazakhstan kirgizia and uzbekistan 
before the revolution the beys and emirs ruled here says 
khodzhimakhmud umarov an official of the state economic institute 
of tadzhikistan after the revolution the people kept on 
receiving orders most are villagers and their psychology is 
attuned to the command economy 
gorbachev is pushing for tougher educational standards but 
central asia has always lagged behind the rest of the country in 
schooling and continues to do so 
the kremlin wants to mobilize all labor resources but there are 
more idle hands in the new soviet heartland than anywhere else and 
they show little inclination to move where the jobs are the frigid 
russian north and siberia 
central asia faces burgeoning underemployment due to te rapid 
population rise and a cautious program launched last year to 
promote family planning as a means of slowing population growth 
has run into opposition from many traditionally minded women 
in turkemenia implantation of intrauterine contraceptive 
devices is free the technology exists says the health 
minister kurban b chagilov what we have to do is spread the 
knowledge and overcome the repugnance 
abortion and contraceptives are regarded here as 
childkilling says dr yakub t tadzhiev a prominent tadzhik 
public health specialist its almost unheard of for rural women 
to use contraceptives 
clashes between old and new are common in central asia marxism 
coexists here with islam and sufi mysticism rampant corruption 
and criminal clans not only survive but flourish 
rockets bearing cosmonauts shoot skyward from the baikonur 
cosmodrome on the desolate steppes of kazakhstan making central 
asia the soviet gate to space but a lack of water mains in many 
areas forces families to draw their drinking water from 
microbeinfested irrigation ditches 
colossal stateoftheart dams in mountainous tadzhikistan 
generate 15 billion kilowatthours of electricity to drive 
sprawling industrial complexes but in the lush emerald hills a 
bride can still be bought for up to 16000

even government officials and members of the communist party 
pander to obsolete views and take part in moslem rituals 
gorbachev noted while on a 1986 tour of uzbekistan he ordered such 
people held strictly to account 
almost one third of the people in our republic remain under 
the control of islam murod n khudoyev deputy propaganda chief 
for tadzhikistans communist party remarked with obvious 
disapproval half of those with a middleschool education see no 
difference between the words tadzhik and moslem 
still gorbachevs rise to power has tightened the kremlins 
hold on the area in the three years since he became general 
secretary party bosses in all five republics have been replaced 
and many of their underlings sent into political obilivion 
one highlevel ouster showed how the regions ethnic differences 
and latent hostility toward the politically dominant russians can

thousands of young kazakhs rioted in the republics capital

large european populations that began flowing southward with the

russians in the countryside where twothirds of the republics 
48 million people live laborers in the fields do not understand 
simple questions in russian 
nevertheless russian is the language of power and prestige and 
of local elites 
in tashkent the regions most populous city with 21 million 
inhabitants there is only one russian child among the 829 pupils 
of middle school no 9 where instruction is in uzbek 
but russian language courses are mandatory

babies die before their first birthday giving the swath of desert 
north of afghanistan and iran the soviet unions highest infant 
death rate a figure more than twice the national average of 25 per

local officials proudly note that although not a single 
university existed in central asia before the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution kazakhstan alone now has 275000 students in its 
institutions of higher learning 
but an army general has complained publicly that uzbek school 
graduates learn so little in school that they have to be taught in 
the army to scrub their teeth and that they dont understand the

michael chickillo has lost weight and 
developed high blood pressure as his wifes alzheimers disease has 
progressed to the point where she often forgets what she had for 
lunch by midafternoon 
i told the doctor id give my right arm to make it stop 
chickillo said recently choking back tears 
to give himself time for chores around his home in this 
northeastern pennsylvania city chickillo has joined a growing 
number of americans choosing day care for an elderly family member 
health care officials say day care is less expensive than a 
nursing home and keeps the elderly at home longer they said it 
also provides a respite for people like chickillo who must keep a 
constant watch on his wife lena when she is home 
there are 1700 adult day care centers nationally serving more 
than 50000 people nearly three times the number of centers open 
in 1980 and up from 1200 in 1985 authorities say 
adult day care centers now operate in all 50 states and the 
district of columbia says dorothy howe program coordinator for 
the national institute on adult daycare 
its across the country but its still quite small ms 
howe says 
cherry hospital in goldsboro nc was a pioneer in adult day 
care in the united states in 1969 when it recruited an english 
doctor to tart a gerontology program 
dr lionel z cosin who taught at oxford universitys medical 
school began a day care center for patients in the hospital which 
is 50 miles east of raleigh says lulu jolliff an administrator 
who worked with cosin cosin had opened a number of the centers in 
england before coming to the united states 
about 22 million people care for a spouse or relative who has a 
problem with at least one activity of daily living such as 
bathing dressing or eating says lynn osterkamp editor of parent 
care a national newsletter 
about 58 million of the 292 million americans 65 or older are 
in nursing homes she says 
elderly care officials point to the graying of america as one 
reason why adult day care will continue to grow 
by 2030 65 million americans will be 65 or older according to 
an estimate by the american association of retired persons 
three days a week chickillo drives his 75yearold wife to 
community day services in scranton where she joins about 30 other 
elderly people unable to care for themselves 
there they watch television sing songs play games and get 
physical speech and occupational therapy under the supervision of 
a staff that includes two fulltime nurses 
we try to make it as much like a senior center as possible 
says janet ann melnick in charge of the fouryearold center 
on a recent afternoon kathy herne a volunteer strummed tunes 
such as harvest moon and singing in the rain on a guitar 
while half a dozen elderly men and women sat in front of her 
clapping singing along or just listening at one point two women 
danced together on the tile floor 
helga hartman who suffers from diabetes and walks with 
difficulty sat at a table toward the back of the room and worked 
on a puzzle others sat silently at different tables 
ms howe and day care administrators said the number of centers 
would increase even though they have been hurt financially because 
adult day care is not covered by medicare 
there are a number that have to get out of the business simply 
because of funding ms howe says 
separate bills pending before the us house and senate would 
provide medicare funding for adult day care 
financially needy people are eligible for medicaid funding for 
adult day care in 25 states but not in pennsylvania howe says

the state has budgeted 52 million through county agencies for 
financial assistance for day care costs at the states 118 centers 
says john holloway who is in charge of adult day care for the 
state department of aging 
adult day care costs an average of about 28 a day less than 
half the cost of a nursing home authorities say 
it gives people options where before we had the centers they 
didnt have those options says mary ann outwater executive 
director of windsor house adult day care in cambridge mass 
corporations are beginning to pay attention to the growing need 
for adult day care 
hallmark cards inc based in kansas city mo in 1986 began 
offering employees a free referral service for day care or other 
health needs for their children elderly parents or disabled family 
members 
meg townsend a company spokesman says twocareer families will 
increase the need for adult day care for elderly family members 
theres just not as much time to address family concerns but 
theyre as important as ever she says 
stride rite corp of cambridge mass is considering expanding 
its subsidized child day centers at two boston area plants to 
include the elderly 
a survey at the company showed 25 percent of employees care for 
an elderly relative and 13 percent more expect to in the next five 
years says amy derbedrosian a spokeswoman for the company 
nursing homes have adapted by starting adult day care centers of 
their own 
a 1985 survey of 847 adult day care centers nationwide showed 22 
percent were in nursing homes ms howe says churches ran 18 
percent of the centers senior centers 12 percent community 
centers 7 percent and hospitals 5 percent the survey showed 
ms howe says 40 states and the district of columbia have 
developed standards for funding licensing or certification 
elderly people suffering from alzheimers disease or other forms 
of cognitive impairment make up the majority of adult day care 
clients authorities say 
a 1987 survey by the pennsylvania adult day care association 
found twothirds of the elderly attending day care centers in the 
state fit into this catagory says barbara k visconti president 
of the organization 
in pittsburgh council care adult day care has designed one of 
its three centers specifically for people with alzheimers an 
irreversible neurological disorder that affects 25 million 
americans 
ruth kaplan executive director for the centers says staff 
members at council care ii play games with the elderly to help them 
remember the events of the day and talk about memories of their 
youths 
they are being stimulated if they sat at home and were not 
stimulated it is our feeling they would lose their skills more 
rapidly ms kaplan says 
in scranton chickillo washes the dishes does the laundry and 
cleans the twostory centuryold house in an ethnic working class 
neighborhood when his wife goes to the day care center 
she likes it there and i tell her shes going to the club 
says chickillo 71 
even with the day care center chickillo a retired quality 
control engineer has had to give up playing in the local bowling 
league where he had a 200 average 
its a burden my friends they think im dead chickillo 
says 
in the three years his wifes memory has faded and her 
disorientation has increased chickillo says he has lost more than 
20 pounds and started taking medication for high blood pressure 
chickillo says the day care center has lessened the stress of 
caring for his wife of 38 years 
this is heaven sent for me because im a 24hour nurse at 
home he says

editors note trudy wodinsky has a good voice shes 
attractive and she wants to become a professional opera singer 
once a divorced mother drawing welfare today she works as a 
secretary while pursuing the career that so far has eluded her a 
new yorker throughandthrough she has discovered there are too 
many trudys out there 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when aspiring opera singer trudy wodinsky found 
herself divorced and living on welfare with an autistic son to 
support her interest in music was put on hold 
it was an untoward happenstance for trudy an attractive 
5foot1 brunette with dark eyes and long hair and the kind of 
figure that only recently got her into trouble when she wore 
stretch pants and high heels to the office 
here she was unable to support herself a talented girl from a 
comfortable middleclass family on long island that was able to 
enroll her in violin lessons at age 9 her father worked as an 
accountant five days a week and did gigs as a jazz saxophonist on 
weekends playing weddings and bar mitzvahs her mother was a high 
school math teacher and later taught at queensborough community 
college 
trudy won a scholarship to manhattan school of music majoring 
in violin her passion for opera would come later she was working 
in the college cafeteria when she met her husbandtobe a student 
from peru a symphony conductor who eventually worked with singer 
al martino and others 
married at age 18 trudy had a son at 19 but the marriage fell 
apart after about eight years 
i was on welfare for several years because my sons father 
wasnt supporting us says trudy who now works as a secretary 
while actively pursuing an operatic career she works mainly with 
some of new yorks prestigious small opera companies putting in 
long nights after long days at the office 
at that time i couldnt do anything i went from my parents 
home to school to marriage i was totally unprepared 
the road out of her welfare morass began with a parttime job in 
a photography studio in the apartment building on manhattans west 
side where she still lives next she worked in a health food 
store then for a wholesale gourmet food concern during the 
christmas rush her first fulltime secretarial job was for an 
insurance agency 
that got to be uncomfortable in certain ways because it was 
only a twoperson office and the other person was a man she 
recalls 
next came work at gimbels first in the customer service 
department and then in the credit office about three years ago 
trudy got her present job as a secretary at corporate property 
investors a manhattan firm that among other things owns and 
manages shopping malls around the country 
as her son grew older and more active trudy was no longer able 
to control him he now lives with his father in queens 
while she still plays the violin professionally on occasion she 
now spends her extra money for weekly sessions with voice teachers 
and coaches two different things serious singers will tell you 
in the past few years she has had roles as a soprano with such 
amateur groups as the amato opera bel canto opera new york opera 
theater and manhattan opera 
the most she has ever been paid for singing with these companies 
is a 100 honorarium she does get paid however as a soloist with 
a choir that performs in the catskills during the jewish holidays 
thats something thats very unfortunate in this country that 
young singers often dont get paid and they do what i do which is 
to support themselves in other ways she says 
her days are long these days 9 to 5 in the office most nights 
in rehearsal no time for social life a recent romance fizzled 
blame her busy schedule 
right now im involved with the bel canto opera which is a 
small opera company she says im doing the part of a satyr 
which is half human male half goat its my second male part in a 
year i dont know what theyre trying to tell me they told me 
its definitely not typecasting 
bill zakariasen music critic of the new york daily news said 
in a review of the amato opera companys performance of salvator 
rosa that soprano trudy wodinsky was very appealing in the 
trouser role of rosas youthful assistant gennariello 
but nobody would mistake trudy wodinsky for a guy in her street 
clothes 
recently an executive in her company relayed word that she 
should dress more appropriately in her office forgo the stretch 
pants that she was wont to wear 
they were formfitting she says laughing this day i was 
dressed for the theater i thought i looked rather nice i had on a 
nice black top and black highheel shoes a day or two later i was 
told i have to learn to project a corporate image 
trudy says re koster an elderly but wellknown voice teacher in 
the netherlands has invited her to visit amsterdam for some 
lessons 
she came to new york and worked with several people she 
says she like me a lot and invited me to go so im going to go 
and work very intensely for two weeks 
in november she will make her new york city recital debut at the 
merkin concert hall under the auspices of the hans and rosy l 
epstein committee for the enhancement of creativity among children 
what kind of voice does trudy wodinsky have 
if i had to categorize myself id call myself a lyric 
coloratura soprano says trudy who counts dame joan sutherland 
and beverly sills among the singers she most admires coloratura 
is the very highest of the voices and a lyric is lower and fuller 
im kind of in between 
trudy is realistic about her chances of finding a career in 
opera 
there are too many trudys out there too many sopranos out 
there too many people im competing with she says how many 
people i dont know hundreds of thousands 
i was pretty naive in the beginning i thought well im 
talented i have a pretty voice im cute so everything will work 
out for me i had no idea how difficult it is

the head of a fund that carries on 
primate researcher dian fosseys work after her murder in africa 
expects a movie about fosseys life to pique public interest in the 
plight of the endangered mountain gorilla 
claude ramsey head of the digit fund which continues fosseys 
work today through the englewoodbased morris animal foundation 
hopes the film this fall will keep pressure on gorilla poachers and 
heighten awareness of one of the closest primate relatives of man 
fewer than 400 of the huge gentle apes remain in the world 
today none of them in captivity most live in rwandas parc 
national des volcans in central africas virunga mountains where 
fossey conducted her studies 
the gorillas come across as very friendly in the movie its 
going to make the world a lot more conscious of the gorillas and 
the problem of poaching ramsey said since dian fosseys 
death poaching has diminished theres a lull 
gorillas in the mist also the title of the book fossey 
wrote about her research will feature actress sigourney weaver as 
the american researcher fossey went to rwanda in early 1967 at the 
urging of anthropologist dr louis leakey and stayed on until her 
murder when she was 53 at karisoke research center on mount viske 
the morris animal foundation hopes the movie will spur public 
donations to the digit fund ramsey said that karisoke research 
center needs 65000 in maintenance funds and 100000 worth of 
capital improvements 
fossey founded the digit fund in 1978 naming it after a male 
gorilla she had befriended and studied closely for 10 years before 
it was killed by poachers on 12000foot mount visoke his head and 
hands were cut off to be sold as souvenirs 
i am anxious to establish a digit fund to attempt to raise 
money to maintain students to train rwandans in the patrol of the 
park and for additional census work on the rwandan side of the 
virungasso that stronger efforts may be made to protect them and 
to actively secure their survival fossey wrote in 1978 here 
at camp we wake up each morning wondering who will be next 
ramsey who has headed the morris animal foundation for 20 of 
its 40 years says fossey talked to him in 1985 about the the 
possibility of the foundation and the digit fund working together 
about a year after fosseys murder stacey coil a friend of 
fosseys who had become president of the digit fund suggested that 
the morris animal foundation administer the fund 
ramseys foundation now oversees the fund and the two entities 
will officially merge next year the digit fund has about 2000 
donors he says 
the purpose of the whole fund is to continue fosseys work at 
karisoke research center ramsey says 
three researchers and the center director carry on both fosseys 
studies of the mountain gorilla at karisoke and her conservation 
efforts 
the digit fund also opened a veterinary laboratory at mount 
visoke in january to provide the gorillas with medical care and to 
investigate their health problems david kenny of the denver zoo 
ran the lab for two months and was succeeded by barkley hastings of 
the london zoo ramsey says veterinarians will be rotated every few 
months 
its a plum job says ramsey providing veterinarians with a 
unique opportunity to observe and care for gorillas in their native 
habitat 
the digit fund also plans to build a dian fossey museum at the 
foot of the virunga mountains some day 
the movie to be released this fall will deal with fosseys 
skirmishes with poachers legendary in rwanda where she was known 
as the lone woman of the forest 
fossey began regular patrols of mount visokes slopes to protect 
the gorillas and was known to fire shots to frighten intruders in 
at least one case fossey who had emphysema helped chase and 
capture a poacher thought to be involved in digits death 
poachers initially were suspected of killing fossey but rwanda 
government officials and others have ruled out that theory because 
of the way she was killed 
fossey was found dead on dec 28 1985 on the floor of her 
karisoke cabin her skull split by a large knife that she owned 
beside her on the floor were a pistol and a clip of ammunition 
the rwandan government charged wayne mcguire a student 
researcher at karisoke with fosseys murder but no credible 
motive ever was established mcguire fled to the united states 
which has no extradition agreement with rwanda a native tracker 
fired months earlier by fossey also was charged he died in a 
rwandan jail 
some observers think fosseys vigorous conservation efforts may 
have led parties who wanted economic development of rwandas 
volcanic region to plot her death 
fossey advocated minimal human contact with the gorillas which 
put her at odds with those who wanted to use the gorillas to lure 
tourists to the virunga mountains fossey was concerned that the 
gorillas would contract human diseases against which they have no 
immunity she linked some gorilla deaths on mount visoke to human 
contact 
i suspect he the killer was hired or suborned by 
influential people who increasingly viewed dian as a dangerous 
impediment to the exploitation of the parc national des volcans 
and especially to the exploitation of the gorillas farley mowat 
wrote in his biography of fossey woman in the mists 
ramsey says fosseys message has been taken to heart by natives 
of mount visoke during dedication ceremonies for the veterinary 
laboratory this year the natives sang and performed skits 
promoting the preservation of the mountain gorilla 
i had always suspected that they were not too concerned about 
the poaching ramsey says but now i saw these villagers had 
made up their own songs and skits and that poaching truly had 
become unpopular there two years ago im not really sure it was

it was a broken romance that first brought 
new york stage actress alley mills to los angeles for a career in 
television 
mills who stars as the mother on abcs the wonder years 
had grown up in a household devoted to the creative arts she 
attended private school bennington college and yale university 
where she graduated magna cum laude in 1973 she got her masters 
degree at the london academy of music and dramatic arts 
she was on the patti page show at 8 and while still at 
bennington had a role in the feature film diary of a mad 
housewifrst boyfriend at age 15 was christopher reeve who grew 
up to become superme 
her fian but it was a rift with another boyfriend 
at the williamstown theater festival in massachusetts where she 
made her professional stage debut that caused her to flee to los 
angeles 
id never been to california and i heard they were doing 
voices a play by a playwright i loved she says i was 
traveling in a volkswagen beetle and i walked in to audition in 
blue jeans and barefoot they said i needed an agent i wrote a 
note saying i was outraged that trtant on stage otherwise the techniques 
are 
the same you just have to be a little bigger and a little louder 
on stage 
audiences expecting to see another offthewall belker on stage 
in frankie and johnny are in for a jolt johnny is a bit of a 
romantic a man who quotes and misquotes shakespeare and whos 
not afraid to make a permanent commitment unlike the skittish 
belker 
frankie and johnny in the clair de lune is a verbal tennis 
match 
mentally its difficult weitz says there is no place to 
rest carol and i get to the theater a little early each day and 
talk about the changes were still working on it theres a lot of 
material there to sort out 
i think that i drive the play and she has all the good laugh 
lines which is fair 
his journey back to new york and offbroadway from los angeles 
and television was not part of any grand design weitz born and 
raised in norwalk conn says none of his career was planned 
i just knew that when i graduated from college i wanted to 
work in a regional theater for a little while he says that 
was all the rest just happened 
a little while turned into nearly nine years but they were 
years where he honed his craft doing shakespeare shaw and many 
other playwrights in between his first job after graduating from 
carnegie tech now carnegie mellon in pittsburgh was at the long 
wharf theater in connecticut he spent a year there then several 
more at the guthrie theater in minneapolis and finally four years 
at arena stage in washington 
those jobs came from people seeing me work weitz says 
he eventually moved to new york and landed roles in several 
broadway plays including norman is that you and the basic 
training of pavlo hummel 
the quest for betterpaying jobs took weitz to los angeles and 
eventually to hill street blues 
my preference was the stage but i wasnt making enough money 
even though i was working constantly in new york he says 
the character of belker stood out in the large repertorysize 
cast on hill street blues whether that was good or bad weitz 
isnt sure 
if people remember me at all theyll remember me from hill 
street blues he says i have no control over that so i dont 
even think about it 
for now he is content with frankie and johnny in the clair de 
lune finding variety in this lowerclass cook 
the role is changing constantly he says im always 
discovering nuances to make it better 
would he go back to television 
sure i would be more than happy to do another character 
similar to belker if it were as well written as belker was 
written weitz says but im still looking

doa touchstone vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
what began life as a firstrate lowbudget thriller starring 
edmond obrien in 1949 was remade recently into a perfectly 
dreadful mishmash starring dennis quaid 
the original had a novel premise the hero is fed a slowacting 
fatal poison at the outset and spends the rest of the movie 
tracking down his murderer it also had thanks to rudolph mates 
direction and ernest laszlos photography a classically mournful 
film noir quality obrien was at his best as the slightly 
seedy smalltown businessman who goes to san francisco for a good 
time and meets his doom 
the folks at touchstone studios who snapped up the property 
decided for some reason to transport the story to a college campus 
where quaid is cast unconvincingly as a literature professor 
who wrote some brilliant novels and then developed a severe case of 
writers block 
his entanglements with his exwife a nubile student a 
publishorperish colleague and a wealthy alumna are all equally 
improbable and ultimately boring despite inappropriate stabs at 
humor and philosophical seriousness the movie is mostly an excuse 
for a lot of violence nearly every major character ends up dead 
before its mercifully over 
they should have let doa rip

played by barbra streisand is fighting desperately for the right 
to go on trial and avoid a mental institution for killing a 
customer her harrowing competency hearing is the focus of martin 
ritts 1987 film 
streisand who also is the producer is by turns funny 
frightening and touching her character is rarely offscreen 
forcefully arguing her sanity based on her rules not the courts 
not societys 
i know what you expect me to do she says at one point 
but im not just a picture in your head 
she is joined by a wonderful cast in the courtroom drama that 
shows off the talents of maureen stapleton and karl malden as 
claudias mother and stepfather eli wallach as a psychiatrist 
james whitmore as the judge robert webber as the prosecutor and 
richard dreyfuss as her reluctant courtappointed lawyer 
the performances are striking and as claudias future is 
determined the tension among the characters is painful and 
gripping 
but it turns unfortunately to edginess it is too drawn out 
as claudia with immeasurable help from dreyfuss aaron levinsky 
resolves a lifes worth of troubles before the worldly judge

summer moviegoers may be surprised to find 
the patrician beauty dina merrill among such comics as jackie 
mason dan aykroyd and chevy chase in caddyshack ii 
miss merrill herself is cool about it after all i worked with 
jerry lewis not to mention ill take sweden with bob hope 
when she was approached by warner bros she admits my 
initial reaction was that theyd found the wrong person my agent 
assured me that there was indeed a part that was just right for me 
so i went and ended up with the job 
i play bob stacks wife and he is the president of the 
country club jackie masons daughter and our daughter are best 
friends and jackies daughter wants her father to join the country 
club hes a farout character who wants to develop all the land 
around the country club needless to say terrible things happen 
when he tries to join 
mason is the veteran comic whose career zoomed with his oneman 
broadway show he was a lastminute replacement for rodney 
dangerfield who starred in the original caddyshack miss 
merrill found mason a puzzlement 
i never could figure out when jackie was putting me on and 
when he wasnt she said hes very straight he looks at you 
and talks with this serious face he doesnt even twitch 
first you think hes putting you on then he looks so serious 
you decide no he isnt thats when hes gotcha all of a sudden 
you see the twitch and you say ive been had 
hes a lot of fun but he was kind of bored with the film he 
kept saying you really like this i said yeah and he said 
boring he couldnt understand why he had to do it over and over 
and he missed that feedback from an audience 
nothing seems to perturb dina merrill she maintains her cool 
serenity in all situations and laughter comes easily to her her 
career has been amazingly varied considering the fact that she has 
never had to support herself 
she was born with a platinum spoon the daughter of edward f 
hutton and marjorie merriweather post of the cereal fortune though 
she obviously wanted for nothing she was determined to make her 
own name in life born nedinia hutton her parents expected a boy 
to be called ned she chose the acting name of dina merrill 
i guess the work ethic comes from my parents she observed 
my father was a very hardworking guy and my mother in her own 
way was too it was always just drilled into me 
her parents were unprepared for their only child to be an 
actress there would be total disbelief when i came home and 
said i got the best job this kept going on then i got married 
and retired and they said whew thats over now she can do what 
she should do be a wife and mother and i did but then i figured 
out i could do both 
dina was married first to socialite stanley rumbough with whom 
she had a son stanley jr and a daughter nina and then to actor 
cliff robertson with whom she had a daughter heather they have 
been separated and a divorce is expected in the fall 
her career has encompassed films operation petticoat 
butterfield 8 theater angel street any wednesday 
and television roots ii hot pursuit two years ago she 
made her debut in musical comedy playing broadway and touring with 
on your toes she is now a partner in a film company greenroom 
enterprises and has appeared in its first film twisted with 
more in the works 
from her new york base she devotes her energies to such causes 
as the juvenile diabetes foundation and the kennedy center for the 
performing arts she also is the only woman on the board of 
directors of the shearson lehman hutton brokerage firm 
reflecting on her heritage she said i was very fortunate 
that i did have everything i wanted handed to me on a silver 
platter so to speak but i also had good training from both 
parents about the work ethic about the fact that i was lucky as 
they were and that a lot of that had to be put back into the 
world to help other people get a start and to be fortunate too 
in their way

works spans a career that made the germanborn holbein the first 
portrait painter to achieve international fame 
it ranges from a study for a doubleportrait of a basel mayor 
and his wife when he was 19 to a drawing of an english nobleman 
done shortly before the artist fell victim at the age of 46 to a 
plague sweeping london in 1543 
holbein a friend of the dutch scholar and humanist erasmus 
came to england in 1526 in search of lucrative orders because the 
arts were freezing in basel as erasmus put it 
erasmus sent him to sir thomas more the later chancellor who 
became holbeins first patron mores warning that holbein may 
not find england such fruitful and fertile land as he had hoped 
as he wrote erasmus was soon disproved 
portraits of henry guildford newlynamed treasurer of the crown 
by henry viii and his wife were among the key works holbein did 
during a first twoyear stay in england another was a more family 
portrait which has vanished 
returning to basel holbein took with him the studies for mores 
family portrait a gift for erasmus and for the portrait of lady 
mary the painting he did of her is now in missouri at the st 
louis art museum 
by that time holbein was wealthy enough to buy two houses in 
basel and received well paid commissions but iconoclastic riots by 
fanatic protestants boded ill for the future of an ambitious artist 
one of the victims was his altarpiece of the last supper which 
was chopped to pieces most of the fragments were salvaged 
however later joined together in an irregular way and even painted 
over at the exhibition the piece returns to public view after more 
than two decades of painstaking restoration 
in 1532 holbein made england his permanent home leaving behind 
his family and most of his oeuvre to become known according to an 
ancient english biographical note as the greatest master truly 
in the arts after the liffe that ever was 
the 50 drawings on loan through sept 4 from windsor castle 
make evident that this last period marked the culmination of his 
career as a portrait painter 
they impress visitors by the unerring way in which holbein 
captured the features of his subjects his sure sense of pattern 
and the proficiency with which the lefthanded artist worked with 
generous strokes of black and colored chalks 
a few show that even holbein had his offdays as jane roberts 
curator of the print room at windsor castle commented at the 
opening 
drawing an annual salary of 120 pounds sterling from the court 
he portrayed merchants scholars statesmen and mostly members of 
the court and nobility 
many of them were protagonists in a stormy period of english 
history that somewhat surprisingly seemed to leave holbein 
unperturbed the windsor collection includes drawings of anne 
boleyn the second wife of henry viii who was beheaded in 1536 of 
jane seymour the third wife as well of baron rich whose 
testimony led to the execution of thomas more 
no preparatory drawing of henry viii survived and what is rated 
as holbeins most masterful portrait of the monarch is in london 
on loan it is part of the lugano collection of baron heinrich von 
thyssenbornemisza which britain like other countries is bidding 
to be the permanent host

fans of the gogos will recognize the catchy 
pop music on jane wiedlins new album fur they may be 
surprised however to hear what she has to say 
this is not any easy life its hard to hang on to hope 
wiedlin sings on inside a dream the first single theres so 
many things need to change well i wonder how we cope 
the worlds a really crummy place but we cant give up 
because we know that wiedlin said we have to keep fighting to 
improve things 
wiedlin was the rhythm guitarist for the gogos an allfemale 
band whose debut album beauty and the beat went no 1 in 
1982 their videos presented an image of five cheerful carefree 
young women 
the gogos were always perceived as being upbeat but there 
was a lot of suffering as well wiedlin said 
fur is wiedlins second solo record anyone familiar with 
gogos songs such as our lips are sealed and head over 
heels may not be prepared for the more serious mood of inside a 
dream but wiedlin is not concerned 
ive learned a lesson because of the gogos and thats not 
to worry about how people see me she said in an interview 
wiedlin has become more politically active since leaving the 
gogos in 1984 on her first solo lp she included postcards to be 
sent to president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
urging them to dismantle nuclear arms she became a vegetarian five 
years ago and has campaigned actively for animal rights 
the gogoss were a combination its just me and my 
personality now and my ideas wiedlin said ive been more 
outspoken on world events and animal rights and so forth 
the title song on fur is a direct plea not to wear aninal 
furs 
i wore a fur coat in the band and it really never occurred to 
me the violence behind it wiedlin recalled when i see people 
wearing fur they overlook the violence i want people to connect 
fur coats with animals 
i just feel that people should take more responsibility for 
their actions 
fur was wiedlins favorite song on the album 
im most proud of fur because its real difficult to write a 
song about social issues without sounding preachy or 
holierthanthou she said ive been trying to do that for 
years 
wiedlin cowrote all the songs on fur at the suggestion of 
her record label emimanhattan she used several different 
partners including regina cole who wrote baby love for 
regina and peter rafelson and garder cole who have worked with 
madonna 
i went with this idea wiedlin said i dont like writing 
by myself anymore working with someone you can talk about 
things 
wiedlin has tried to simplify her songwriting style over the 
years 
ive become more interested in the way words sound rather 
than their meaning the idea behind the words is whats most 
important 
the album was produced by stephen hague who had worked on the 
hits west end girls and what have i done to deserve this 
for the pet shop boys wiedlin said hague was her one and only 
choice for fur 
id heard a demo that had four or five different bands on it 
and every band sounded great she said i had never heard a 
producer whose work sounded so consistently good 
he brought this feeling of coherence to the album he gave it 
such a strong sound it was almost like a concept album 
while the recording of fur went smoothly taking only 28 
days wiedlin disagreed with her record label over the order of 
songs the company wanted to put all the potential singles on one 
side and end the record with the end of love which she 
considered too depressing she wanted to end with the more 
optomistic whatever it takes which the label wanted to release 
as a single 
wiedlin won out but admitted we duked it out on that one 
although her first solo record sold poorly shes confident 
shell attract a following 
i think that its slowly building im not very worried about 
that wiedlin said the basis of my following are people that 
loved the gogos thats a hardcore group of people 
wiedlin wants to tour before the end of the year and hopes her 
music will get people more involved in social causes 
it has the ability to change things i get letters from fans 
that say theyre really proud of me she said im trying to 
help the animals getting even just one fan to help is enough 
i like to encourage people to be active in social change and 
trying to improve the world ive been able to become more active 
and more outspoken about my beliefs

editors note american writer alexandra ripley has the 
unenviable job of doing the sequel to margaret mitchells gone 
with the wind for advice she might turn to john gardner the 
british thriller writer who took on the task to continue the james 
bond sagas after ian flemmings death 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
john gardner is not just a thriller 
writer but a master of a very special art the posthumous sequel 
at his home in this english village west of london the 
61yearold author writes james bond novels having picked up where 
007s creator ian fleming left off when he died in 1964 
while american writer alexandra ripley is just beginning a 
sequel to margaret mitchells gone with the wind gardner has 
already turned out seven bond novels each a best seller in the 
united states the most recent scorpius is in its sixth 
consecutive week on the new york times bestseller list 
it was a challenge a little honor gardner recalled of his 
decision to accept a publishers offer in 1979 to write a bond 
sequel 
he had already made a name with his books about the adventurer 
boysie oakes and with such cloakanddagger yarns as the dancing 
dodo and the nostradamus traitor he had also written two 
novels featuring sherlock holmes nemesis professor moriarty 
so when glidrose publications bonds literary copyright owners 
offered him a shot at old 007 himself he thought why not if i 
dont do it somebody else will 
gardner was then living in ireland as a tax exile and already 
one bond sequel colonel sun had been published in 1968 by 
kingsley amis author of such acclaimed novels as lucky jim and 
one fat englishman amis wrote it under the pseudonym robert 
markham 
gardner first encountered bond while in bed with the flu in the 
early 1960s when his wife margaret brought casino royale and 
dr no from the library 
i was absolutely enchanted he recalled 
fantasy formula fun are the three fs of bond writing he 
said in an interview 
the exploits of the suave selfpossessed hero a man both 
dressed and licensed to kill demand a lot from a writer gardner 
said 
the trick he says is to make the bond novels look as if 
theyve been thrown off in one afternoon you cant let readers 
see the joints anywhere 
i sit down to do bond and within about four days im cutting 
lines out and making it run very fast he said every chapter i 
write i have to go back and say no you can take two lines out 
there and you can say that in three words 
it has to be that tight he said these are books to be 
read in an airplane or on a beach 
his contract calls for two more bond novels under a separate 
agreement he is writing the book of the forthcoming license 
revoked the first bond movie not drawn directly from a fleming 
book 
movies gardner said pose the greatest obstacle to 
sequelwriting 
people remember the movies far better than the books he 
said theres a universal myth that bond drove an aston martin 
he didnt except for a very short time in goldfinger he drove a 
very old bentley 
gardner said he had tried to bring his champagnedrinking hero 
up to date with aids and glasnost 
you can make him a man of the 80s make him adapt to the 
womens movement the strictures under which we live all that 
he said but ive had to get round the business of him 
transporting arms on normal flights and of course the technology 
has changed so greatly 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome posed specific problems for 
the libidinous bond he tried to work in a joke about condoms but 
his publishers rejected it 
nor is he allowed to give bond depth i cant in any way 
relate to him as a character like i can to my own bond is 
onedimensional that is one of his successes his novels are kiss 
kiss bang bang adventures 
he is reticent about his earnings from the bond books saying 
i get a percentage of a percentage of a percentage it puts a 
tiny bit of jam on top of the money i earn through my other 
writing 
gardners immediate future looks relatively bondfree secret 
families the last in a trilogy about espionage from 1910 to the 
present day will appear next may 
after license revoked he plans a modern blockbusting novel 
a la jeffrey archer focusing on the life of a symphony conductor 
meanwhile his only advice to such sequelwriters as alexandra 
ripley is to be faithful to the original but not unduly so try 
and make it your own

under the sunlit arch of a plastic 
greenhouse an artificial swamp of cattails and elephant grass 
sprouts from hydroponic troughs soaking sustenance from a citys 
sewage 
this could be the waste treatment plant of the future 
picture it a natural system that uses microbes and marsh plants 
to transform raw sewage into sparkling clean water unlike 
conventional sewage facilities which cost a fortune to run this 
one makes money it leaves no nasty sludge it creates energy its 
so pretty it can be used as a park 
it sounds too good to be true 
but its already becoming a reality simple plantbased sewage 
treatment systems are being used on a small scale in parts of the 
south and researchers are developing more refined and efficient 
systems they say could replace aging and inefficient conventional 
plants on a large scale within the next decade 
were looking at a whole new generation of waste treatment 
thats cheaper and much more efficient than anything thats 
available now and produces useful resources said william 
jewell a cornell university agricultural engineer 
our goal is to eliminate pollution at a profit jewell said 
beside ithacas new 40 million conventional treatment plant 
which settles aerates and chemically treats about 5 million 
gallons a day he has set up a pilot model of his system with the 
capacity to purify 10000 gallons of sewage a day about what 100 
people would produce 
the demonstration is funded by the state energy office and the 
gas research institute a utilitysponsored group trying to find 
new sources of natural gas 
its leaps and bounds ahead of anything thats been done 
before both in terms of energy used and quality of water 
discharged said ron isaacson manager of renewable resources for 
the chicagobased institute 
in jewells twostep system raw sewage is partially cleaned in 
a tankful of bacteria then piped into long low troughs in a 
greenhouse where it provides a nutrient film on which plants 
thrive 
the plants are grown hydroponically with no soil their roots 
form a dense mat as they soak up the pollutants 
its really a solarpowered filter jewell said on a recent 
tour 
in the first 4footwide tank of cattails the water is murky 
and smelly by the time it reaches the end of the 250footlong 
series of tanks in a few hours its clear as a brook and teeming 
with tiny snails and other creatures 
these are copepods said jewell scooping up a few flitting 
fleasize crustaceans whenever you see them you have 
tremendously clean water like in a stream 
to make the water safe to drink however would take further 
treatment that could be done with a more extensive outdoor 
hydroponic system which he plans to build this fall or with a 
conventional filtration and chlorination plant 
a bonus to plantbased sewage treatment is that methane sold as 
natural gas is produced by the firststage bacterial process more 
can be made by harvesting the plants and processing them using the 
same bacteria 
jewell figures a plant with the capacity to handle the sewage of 
10000 people about a third the population of ithaca could 
generate 400000 worth of methane a year the system could also be 
used to grow flowers and tree seedlings for city parks or 
commercial nurseries 
but even without those products jewell said his system would 
cost far less to build and operate than the plants now in use he 
estimates that for a community of 10000 his system would cost 
less than 1 million to build compared to at least 5 million for 
a conventional plant 
and the quality of water produced by our system far exceeds 
that achieved by conventional facilities said jewell 
the national aeronautics and space administration has sponsored 
pioneering plantbased waste treatment projects in towns in 
california louisiana mississippi and alabama 
these are the wastewater treatment system of the future for 
small towns especially since the federal grant money for sewage 
treatment has dried up in the last few years said bc 
wolverton at nasas national space technology laboratory in bay 
st louis miss 
wolvertons artificial marshes which use floating plants like 
water hyacinths or rooted ones like bulrushes have treated all the 
chemical waste and sewage from the nasa lab for more than 12 years 
weve saved many millions of dollars by using these systems 
some towns are using wolvertons sewage marshes as parks he 
said the settling tanks are underground and theyre growing 
canna lilies and calla lilies in the channels 
most of the systems that wolverton has designed are for towns of 
fewer than 3000 people but an experimental system in operation in 
san diego using water hyacinths to make potable water from sewage 
is expected to eventually handle a million gallons a day he said 
theres a desperate need to come up with a new source of water 
in the southwest said wolverton this could be an answer 
jewells system in central new york differs in several ways from 
wolvertons for one thing it uses greenhouses and hardy plants 
making it feasible for use in northern climes 
a main drawback to plantbased systems has been the climate 
limitation said jim basilico chief of the water and pesticide 
research division of the environmental protection agency which 
funded early stages of jewells project but if it works in 
ithaca it can work anywhere 
another advantage of jewells system is that because of the type 
of bacteria it uses it doesnt produce sludge like other hydroponic 
systems and conventional plants do in most systems organic 
pollutants are broken down by aerobic bacteria which need oxygen 
it costs the nation half a billion dollars a year in electricity to 
fill that oxygen need by aerating sewage said jewell 
we spend 200 million in new york state alone just to blow 
bubbles through settling tanks he said the anaerobic 
alternative doesnt use any energy at all instead it produces 
energy 
because they are far more efficient at digesting waste matter 
turning 90 percent of it into methane anaerobes dont produce 
sludge like the fastgrowing and inefficient aerobic bacteria do 
ive begun to look at methane production as almost a magic 
process said jewell who is also developing digesters to make 
methane from garbage agricultural wastes and crops like sorghum 
other researchers also are looking into systems that use 
anaerobic bacteria to turn pollutants into profitable products 
peter benson who developed the gas research institutes 
methanefrombiomass program has started a venture called 
renewable energy systems inc in palos park ill he plans to 
sell a system that uses anaerobic bacteria to digest municipal 
garbage as an alternative to incinerators or landfills 
the toughest nut to crack is inertia isaacson said it 
will just take a few successful demonstrations in a realworld 
situation to prove it works and make people comfortable with it

frank sciremammano gets seasick and has 
more stories about getting stuck in airports than getting stuck at 
sea 
so it may seem surprising that nasa has given him more than 
100000 in grants the past two years to study the antarctic ocean 
sciremammano a professor at rochester institute of technology 
has only actually seen the antarctic twice but he believes he 
knows as much about it as anyone thanks to satellites and 
computers 
satellite oceanography is still in its infancy but more and 
more people are getting interested he said when i got started 
in 1984 there were really only two or three groups involved 
now there are textbooks on the subject and seminars held to 
discuss new developments in the field that involves sophisticated 
radar measurements taken by satellite to study a wide range of 
information about the oceans behavior 
sciremammano says satellites can revolutionize some aspects of 
oceanography because scientists will no longer be limited to bits 
and pieces of data 
the satellites provide a global picture that traditional 
methods cant he said you can put instruments in the water 
and get a lot of wonderful information but only about that 
particular point 
thats especially important in a place like the antarctic ocean 
where a dearth of shipping activity makes dropping off measuring 
devices expensive and timeconsuming studying the antarctic the 
traditional way convinced sciremammano that satellites were the way 
to go 
we spent millions of dollars over years a lot of time and 
effort on the part of a lot of people and we really got one 
data point he said one good picture but in a very limited 
geographic area 
so now sciremammano pores over charts and tables constantly 
checks his electronic mailbox and keeps stacks of computer disks in 
his office hes using onetenth of all of rits computer memory to 
store the data he gets from space 
he said his research which focuses on the nature of the 
circumpolar current which swirls around the continent of antartica 
could someday provide some definitions for the el nino an 
unexplained weather phenomenon that causes severe droughts and 
flooding on both sides of the pacific ocean and for the 
muchtalked about greenhouse effect 
were trying to get a whole budget for the earths heat 
balance he said everybody understands that heat comes in at 
the equator and goes out more or less at the poles but the exact 
mechanisms for that transfer are not understood 
sciremammano admits that his work he teaches mechanical 
engineering and his landlocked location make him somewhat of an 
oddball oceanographer 
that has its advantages people leave me alone i dont have 
colleagues coming down to tell me about their latest adventure 
he said but i do feel a little isolated sometimes

tiny crustaceans that dont behave like your 
average desert dwellers may help identify potentially fertile 
farmland in arid regions 
on the barren waste near moshe shakahs office at sde boker in 
the negev desert pine carob and pistachio trees grow without 
irrigation in an area that averages only 3 inches of rain a year 
the reason shahak says is a grayish segmented armorplated 
relative of the wood louse known as an isopod 
the species shahak is studying helilepistus realuluri has a 
name longer than its 7inchlong body 
the isopod has two qualities youd never expect to find in the 
desert says shahak a ben gurion university desert ecology 
specialist who has studied the isopods since 1972 its rate of 
water loss is very high and it has an inflexible life routine 
to survive isopod families stick together and work 
cooperatively shahak says they formed the first kibbutzim in 
the negev 
in order to survive the summer when temperatures soar over 104 
degrees the isopods must find soil with a moisture content of 6 
percent to 10 percent the family an adult male and female and up 
to 90 offspring digs a tunnel up to 27 inches deep knowing 
intuitively where the moisture content of the soil will be high 
enough to sustain them shahak says 
as they burrow the isopods leave a telltale mound of chewedup 
soil above ground indicating their presence and thus the presence 
of lifesustaining soil under the hard desert surface he says 
shahak took soil readings to determine the relative density of 
isopod habitation and found a direct correlation between the number 
of isopods and the presence of moisture in the soil 
aharon yair a hebrew university geomorphologist did hydrolic 
examinations of the soil that verified shahaks research and 
contradicted current belief on where to find moisture in the desert 
desert specialists had believed that the soil with the highest 
water content was found at the bottom of desert valley beds yairs 
readings showed that isopods dig their holes halfway down the 
slopes of the desert hills at the point where the rock ends and 
the soil begins shahak says 
five years ago he planted five species of trees based on those 
readings so far they are flourishing he said 
dr eliyahu ravitz an expert on desert research at hebrew 
universitys faculty of agriculture says that while the findings 
are interesting moisture was not the only element that contributed 
to soils fertility and that most trees need soil with at least 20 
percent water content far more than the 6 percent to 10 percent 
needed by the isopods 
shahak said there appeared to be enough nitrogen phosphorus and 
other elements necessary to sustain the growth of trees in addition 
to water he said he increased the moisture in the areas pinpointed 
by the isopods by digging holes to trap rainwater not normally 
absorbed by the baked earth 
shahak believes his findings could help solve the severe food 
shortages caused by extended periods of drought in ethiopia and 
other african nations 
if it works here it will work in africa too he said

children with hay fever should be watched for 
complications that can lead to hearing loss and headaches the 
american lung association warns 
a child who complains of fullness in the ears and popping 
sounds or who has earaches may have serous otitis media the 
association says such a child may also have a mild hearing loss 
that may make him talk louder or fail to pay attention to teachers 
or television 
serous otitis media is a chronic inflammation of the ear 
passages that blocks normal drainage of secretions providing a 
breeding ground for bacteria if the disease goes untreated 
increased hearing loss may hinder learning and speech development 
another hay fever complication chronic sinusitis produces 
headaches foulsmelling breath yearround nasal congestion and a 
thick mucousy discharge from the nose the inflammation of the 
sinus cavities can lead to infection 
both complications can be treated with medication the 
association says 
while the risk of serous otitis media declines in adolescence 
the chance of chronic sinusitis from hay fever continues into 
adulthood said association spokesman robert lemanske jr of the 
university of wisconsin hospitals in madison

the air force is 
studying the use of enormous oildrilling platforms as offshore 
launch pads 
one plan would be to tow the worlds largest type of drilling 
platform known in the oil industry as a gorilla into vandenberg 
harbor load a rocket aboard and tow it several miles offshore at 
the launching spot the floating platforms legs would be lowered 
until it was standing on the ocean floor the rocket could then be 
fueled and launched by remote control from vandenberg 
samto is interested in pursuing the offshore concept and this 
is one method said capt david blehm of the air forces space 
and missile test organization which is working with the national 
aeronautics and space administration to develop a new advanced 
launch system 
other offshore ideas include launching rockets from a remote 
pacific isle a ship a manmade island or one of the channel 
islands 
there is a certain giggle factor associated with it said 
john pike associate director for space policy at the federation of 
american scientists in washington dc on the other hand why 
not 
cutting costs and conserving land at vandenberg are two 
motivations for the offshore plan the neverused space shuttle 
launch pad cost 33 billion a rig offshore supposedly could be 
built for 100 million and be connected by cable to existing launch 
control facilities 
spurring the studies are plans for up to 50 launches a year 
beginning in 1996 pike said the strategic defense initiative and 
planned space station would be potential major users of the 
advanced launch system rockets 
the california coastal commission would investigate the impact 
on sea life and water quality of offshore launch schemes

pessimism may be bad for your health a study 
suggests 
the study of 99 men found that those with a pessimistic outlook 
about unfortunate experiences around age 25 tended to have poorer 
physical health 20 to 35 years later 
the men had filled out questionnaires in 1946 that asked about 
difficult wartime experiences independent judges studied the 
causes they offered for bad events ranking them for stability 
such as its never going to go away rather than it was a 
onetime thing globality its going to ruin everything i 
do vs it has no bearing on my life and internality its 
me instead of its the heat in this place 
a pessimistic explanatory style ranks high on those three 
factors the researchers from the university of michigan dartmouth 
medical school and the university of pennsylvania said in 
describing study results in the july issue of the journal of 
personality and social psychology 
records from physical examinations showed that a pessimistic 
explanatory style best predicted poor health at age 45 with less 
reliable predictions at ages 50 55 and 60 
among the possible explanations are that people with a 
pessimistic style may fail to seek or follow medical advice or 
maybe they neglect basic health care in the first place 
researchers said 
the men were academically successful independent and healthy 
so results of the study may not apply to people in general they 
said

a lie detector that measures brain waves would be 
more accurate than polygraphs which measure bodily functions says 
its developer 
it would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people and 
it would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people says 
j peter rosenfeld a northwestern university professor of 
psychology and of neurobiology and physiology i think thats 
better than existing units 
the american medical association and the congressional office of 
technology assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to 
50 percent of the time 
rosenfelds lie detector picks up brainwave activity through 
electrodes attached to the scalp amplifying the signals and 
feeding them into a computer which coordinates the information and 
displays it on a video screen 
if sensory information has a special meaning for you then 
your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the p3 
wave he said 
in tests at northwestern subjects have been asked to look at a 
series of words most with no special meaning occasionally 
theyll see a word that is meaningful like some antisocial act 
theyre involved in cheating on tests or using drugs which is 
sometimes the case here rosenfeld said 
when they see terms like that their brain waves break into p3 
waves 
polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions pulse 
sweating blood pressure and breathing he said 
advertising researchers have measured p3 waves to better gauge 
what consumers want instead of what they say they want and 
psychiatrists can detect certain disorders such as attention 
deficits by measuring them he said 
rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and 
says it could be widely used within three more he published a 
study last year and will publish another this summer in the 
international journal of neuroscience 
its a perfectly valid way of detecting lies said sidney 
weinstein a professor of neurology at new york university college 
of medicine in new york city and editor of the danbury connbased 
neuroscience journal 
however a brainwave lie detector would probably cost 10 times 
as much as the 500 to 600 for a polygraph and the operator would 
need a great deal more training weinstein said

a record number of american corporations changed 
their names during the first six months of 1988 with financial 
institutions and manufacturing companies heading the list 
according to a corporate identity survey 
of the 931 name changes 53 percent were because of mergers and 
acquisitions the survey by anspach grossman portugal inc found 
another 21 percent stemmed from divestitures spinoffs leveraged 
buyouts and sales of assets the survey showed 
but some companies created new names hoping for a new corporate 
image said the report released today 
last year 1753 corporations changed their names 919 in the 
first half 
special circumstances apply to every name change situation 
said joel portugal a principal of anspach grossman portugal 
its difficult to generalize to say real names are better than 
created names or vice versa 
eighteen of the newly named companies are listed on the new york 
stock exchange including three whose names became initials during 
the first half of 1988 allegis corp returned to ual corporation

analysts say there should be no shortage 
of seed corn for next years crop even if this years drought 
decimates 1988 yields but seed corn producers arent taking any 
chances 
with midwest fields withering american seed corn companies are 
looking south for crops this winter to replenish their stockpiles 
we are looking in texas argentina and chile said joan 
olson a spokeswoman for northrup king co one of the top five 
seed corn producers for the us market 
the nations largest seed corn producer pioneer hibred 
international of des moines is negotiating for more corn 
production in chile and argentina if the us drought results in 
crop widespread crop failure said owen newlin a senior vice 
president at the company 
he said pioneer already grows seed for the local market in south 
america and has processing plants that can shell and dry corn 
there 
we will be increasing their capacity considerably newlin 
said 
he added that after pollination of the us seed corn crop in 
about two weeks the company will decide how much production it will 
need from south america as well as from florida and texas 
we havent got all of our plans firmed up newlin said we 
dont really know how bad things are going to be here 
dekalb corp the secondlargest seed corn producer in the 
united states still expects to get a crop in the us large 
enough to meet its needs said spokesman bob pritchard 
but he noted that the company has a processing plant in chile 
and obviously were considering all the options 
despite the drought there are no predictions of shortages of 
seed corn for next spring 
about a fourth of hybrid seed corn is grown under irrigation 
and enough leftover seed sits in company warehouses to plant up to 
half of this years corn acreage again observers say 
but a short harvest this year will likely result in expanded 
planting next year many seed corn companies expect 1989 corn 
acreage to increase 10 percent to 15 percent 
i think there will be ample seed corn to plant but a good bit 
of it will be lower quality simply because its carryover said

jackie presser vowed five years ago to clean 
up the teamsters union he didnt succeed according to government 
prosecutors but presser breathed new life into the nations 
largest union returned it to the mainstream of the american labor 
movement and just maybe helped put it on a path towards reform 
presser 61 died saturday night at a suburban cleveland 
hospital after a battle with cancer two months after giving up the 
reins of the 16millionmember union to weldon mathis the no 2 
official and pressers apparent choice as his successor 
while presser himself had been the subject of 14 criminal 
investigations and was under indictment when he died his moves to 
put mathis in control were consistent with a careerlong effort to 
repair the teamsters image 
mathis 62 has never been linked with any organized crime 
figures and except for nepotism that is common to many unions he 
is free of scandal 
presser had initiated a change in the unions constitution in 
1986 so that mathis rather than first vice president joseph 
trerotola of new york would become interim president 
trerotola 70 has never been indicted but many of the hundreds 
of local teamster officials that prosecutors have pursued over the 
past dozen years have been under his jurisdiction as head of the 
unions eastern conference in new york and new jersey 
mathis was empowered as the teamsters acting president for 120 
days or until early september starting out as a business agent for 
a teamster local in atlanta he climbed his way through the unions 
hierarchy over 38 years 
when presser passed the reins to mathis on an interim basis 
trerotola led a boycott by half of the 16 executive board members 
at the first meeting convened afterwards setting up a possible 
challenge to him 
no permanent successor to presser will be chosen until after his 
funeral tuesday labor officials said but labor insiders doubt a 
successful challenge to mathis can be mounted 
jackie may have decided it when he yielded the power for four 
months one source said speaking on the condition of anonymity 
walter shea the teamsters chief policy operative in washington 
with the softspoken demeanor of a state department diplomat is 
said by union insiders to have the most support for challenging 
mathis 
several other of the 16 union vice presidents also would like 
the job although the only ones with sufficient support for 
mounting a challenge are joseph morgan of hallandale fla and 
arnie weinmeister of seattle according to sources in the union 
based on who attended the may meeting that mathis convened in 
arizona he is still believed to have the necessary ninevote 
majority including his own for winning the top job 
the only way he could be denied the union presidency would be if 
all his potential rivals united behind a single challenger 
thats the big question said one teamster insider 
presser died just two weeks after the government in a 
firstever suit of its kind moved to place control of the entire 
union under a courtappointed trustee 
among the governments claims were that presser mathis and the 
teamsters 16 board members were controlled by organized crime or 
at best unwilling or incapable of removing the cosa nostras 
domination over the unions affairs the past three decades 
presser denied ever being under mob control but it was a fine 
line that he walked remembering the disappearance of former 
teamsters chief jimmy hoffa after his release from jail and bid to 
reassume control of the union 
if youre totally honest and try to clean up the union and you 
try to do it fast enough and without making accommodations so the 
government wont get you the other guys the hoods will get 
you he said of the teamsters presidency in a 1977 interview 
its a death chair either way 
despite pressers death the government will pursue its takeover 
suit us attorney rudolph giuliani of new york said sunday 
presser himself was under indictment for allegedly participating 
in a ghost employee payrollpadding in which some 700000 from a 
cleveland teamsters local that he also headed was funneled to 
organized crime figures 
armed with reams of government documents showing presser to have 
been an informant for both the fbi and the internal revenue 
service his attorneys had prepared an elaborate defense on the 
premise that any wrongdoing was done under the auspices of the 
government 
altogether during his 40year union career presser was the 
subject of at least 14 criminal probes but unlike past teamster 
chiefs given the same scrutiny presser believed in using public 
relations to counter the unions image as corrupt 
as an ohio teamster leader during the early 1970s presser was 
widely credited with reducing the power of organized crime figures 
through his own aggressiveness in contract bargaining and in 1977 
he persuaded thenteamster president frank fitzsimmons to establish 
a large public relations apparatus and put him in charge of it 
taking over as president in 1983 presser immediately began to 
polish the international unions image he was the first teamster 
president in modern times to testify voluntarily before a 
congressional committee 
presser promised senators he would try to cleanse the union of 
corrupt influences but cautioned theres no way i can be a 
policeman 
earlier this month sen orrin hatch of utah the ranking 
republican on the senate labor committee credited presser with 
bringing honorable people into the unions hierarchy and 
helping clean up the central states pension plan 
mr presser regardless of what anybody else may think of him 
has lived up to every promise he made to me hatch said there 
is no one person who can straighten it all out 
last year while convalescing from cancer treatments presser 
guided the teamsters back into the aflcio after 30 years of bitter 
rivalry between the two groups 
he turned the teamsters political action fund into the biggest 
campaign chest of any group in the country and the computer 
network he purchased to keep financial tabs on every company with a 
teamsters contract is the most sophisticated in the labor movement 
presser also replaced much of the unions headquarters staff 
that had grown moribund under hoffas successors fitzsimmons and 
roy williams 
fitzsimmons was on the golf course all the time and williams 
stayed in kansas city one veteran teamster official recalled 
jackie came in and started taking names he wanted to know 
everything that was going on all of a sudden the teamsters were a 
union again

weekend rains in some key growing areas of the droughtstricken 
midwest 
prices of some contracts for future delivery of corn oats and 
soybeans dropped their limits for daily trading immediately after

plantedacreage totals and revised supplydemand projections

grain and soybean futures dropped to their lowest 
levels in about a month monday as weekend rains in the thirsty 
midwest prompted a third straight day of plummeting prices on the 
chicago board of trade 
most contracts traded down their daily limits within minutes of 
the opening bell the contracts for july delivery on which the 
limits have been removed pending their july 20 expiration 
continued to trade generally lower 
july soybeans fell 66 cents a bushel to 858 the lowest price 
for that contract since june 3 corn for july delivery dropped 20 
cents to 289 a bushel the lowest level since june 15 
weekend showers that brought widespread relief to midwestern 
croplands eased fears of drastic yield reductions analysts said 
some private forecasters expected scattered showers to continue 
in the corn belt for the next couple of days which should keep the 
pressure on grain futures prices said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
but he cautioned if the weather goes back to hot and dry 
and that persists for a week or 10 days we will go back up again 
one rain does not make a crop 
at the close wheat was 16 cents to the limit 20 cents lower 
with july at 368 a bushel corn was 12 cents to 20 cents lower 
with july at 289 a bushel oats were 14 cents to 27 cents lower

the drought may force the government to ease 
crop acreage controls next year to help the united states rebuild 
its grain inventories agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
monday 
but the united states will continue to be a major player in 
world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back 
from this years drought losses he said 
lyngs remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm 
magazine extension advertising coop and broadcast editors 
a larger portion of the united states suffered from some degree 
of drought stress in may and june than at any point since records 
began in 1895 he said 
moreover on july 2 about 35 percent of the contiguous united 
states was in the severe to extreme drought category he said 
in 1934 more than 60 percent was so rated and in august 1954 more 
than 50 percent was in that category 
because of the large early season area now experiencing 
drought in the us 1988 appears to have the potential to approach 
or exceed the droughtaffected areas of the 1930s and 1950s lyng 
said 
even with the severe drought there will be an adequate supply 
of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the united states 
will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export 
demand he said 
lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be 
somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much 
higher 
but it is important to note that we will have no shortages 
that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas 
buyers he said

shoppers traded in 284 billion worth of 
coupons in buying food pharmaceuticals and other consumer goods 
last year a 6 percent increase from 1986 a marketing firm 
reported monday 
but of the 2152 billion coupons distributed by companies to 
promote their products more than 208 billion went unused 
according to a study by manufacturers coupon control center which 
is a subsidiary of dun amp bradstreet corp 
slightly more than 3 percent of the total or 715 billion were 
redeemed which was a fraction ahead of 1986 the report said 
the lack of strong growth this year reflects a maturing 
industry the study said after several years of innovative 
marketing techniques including using coupons to introduce new 
products couponing has achieved a level of penetration that makes 
significant growth in the immediate future unlikely 
while the number of coupons redeemed leveled off their average 
value increased 14 percent to 397 cents from 376 cents the 
report said 
since 1983 coupon distribution has grown 51 percent and last 
year more than 2000 companies used coupons to promote their 
products and boost sales the report said during the same period 
the number of coupons redeemed grew by 29 percent 
newspaper inserts continued to be the most popular form of 
coupon distribution in 1987 while all other media forms except 
direct mail declined the report said 
grocery coupons inside and outside product packaging tended to 
be the most popular with consumers with a 14 percent and 13 
percent redemption rate respectively compared with other methods 
of distribution 
grocery coupons contained in sunday newspaper inserts were 
redeemed at a 36 percent rate and those printed inside newspapers 
averaged 2 percent the study found

its almost like a minicatalog a magazine 
advertisement offers designer clothing and accessories that readers 
can order immediately from some of the nations top retailers by 
using the american express card 
the main thrust of the sevenpage ad which appears in the 
august issue of elle magazine is that you can use american express 
for retail purchases but it also gives consumers a chance to do 
some onetime shopping at three upscale stores that are getting 
some big national exposure 
one section of the ad shows wool separates by crisca that can be 
ordered by phone from burdines another displays watches by 
raymond weil and cosmetics by stendhal that can be bought from 
macys while a third offers bruno magli shoes and a shoulder bag 
available at neiman marcus 
each of the models in the ad holds an american express card and 
each page reminds consumers the merchandise can be paid for with 
the card the macys and burdines sections additionally note 
tollfree telephone numbers readers can call to place their orders 
the ad is an extension of traditional cooperative advertising 
in which a product is prominently displayed while a retailers name 
is noted in comparatively small print often at the bottom of a 
page 
elle an upscale womens magazine carries traditional coop ads 
in its july issue for example two ads for yves saint laurent note 
that the french designer label is available at neiman marcus saks 
fifth avenue or i magnin 
whats different about this newest ad is the prominent display 
of the retailers and the charge card along with the merchandise it 
looks like a catalog it gives the consumer a chance to buy an 
advertised item immediately and it tells the shopper how to do it 
the ad accomplishes several objectives for retailers 
it offers them a chance to further their upscale image by 
associating themselves with designer merchandise and with american 
express which is perceived as a prestige card said joseph 
ronning a retail industry analyst with the investment firm brown 
brothers harriman inc 
the ad also gives the retailers a chance to pick up some 
business from customers outside their immediate areas and generate 
future sales ronning said 
burdines for example has 27 stores in florida and it is 
likely that readers in faroff states would after seeing the ad 
shop in one of its stores during a vacation he said 
the ad is also a way for consumers to find that if they have an 
american express card they can still shop at a store even if they 
dont have the retailers own credit card 
for all of them its important to tell the customer you can 
use your amex card here ronning said 
but the one with the most to gain from the ad is american 
express which is wants to establish itself as a retail charge 
card and not just a travel and entertainment card 
in recent months american express has tried to move in on the 
retail turf traditionally held by visa and mastercard the company

central bankers from leading 
industrial countries agreed monday on common standards for the 
minimum capital reserves that banks must hold 
the accord will help to strengthen the soundness and stability 
of the international banking system and will remove an important 
source of competitive inequality for banks arising from differences 
in national supervisory requirements said karl otto poehl 
president of west germanys central bank 
it represents a significant step forward in international 
supervisory cooperation he said after the meeting at the 
headquarters of the bank for international settlements 
the new standards detail a framework for measuring capital 
adequacy and set a minimum reserve standard for each countrys 
authorities to put into force 
a bis committee chaired by bank of england associate director 
peter cooke completed the draft proposals last december 
swiss and british banks which already have high capital 
requirements are expected to benefit particularly from the new 
rules banks in france and japan generally will have to boost their 
reserves because their countries have relatively lenient 
requirements 
central bankers endorsed a target capital ratio of 8 percent of 
a banks assets to be achieved in each country by the end of 1992 
at least half of a banks capital base counted toward the standard 
must consist of equity capital and published reserves from 
aftertax retained earnings 
central bankers from the group of 10 major industrial countries 
and switzerland attended mondays meeting 
the group of 10 includes belgium west germany france britain 
italy japan canada the netherlands sweden and the united states

london trader said in explaining the dollars apparent strength in 
the face of intervention 
if the federal reserve pushes up interest rates to keep the 
economy from overheating dollar securities would become more

the number of banks involved 
traders in new york said the market was buffeted throughout the 
session by mixed messages regarding the level of the us currency 
there were rumors to the effect that the bundesbank is not 
looking for an appreciation of the mark that the bank of japan and 
the fed are happy with the level of the dollar said john 
mccarthy a vice president and trader at irving trust co 
but on the bearish side mccarthy cited former white house 
economic adviser martin feldsteins prediction that the dollar 
would trade at 100 japanese yen within three years 
when you get these arbitrary statements people get positioned 
badly and they bail out of the market mccarthy said it was a 
yoyo day where people were caught both ways

savings institution depositors withdrew more 
money from their accounts than they deposited in may for the first 
time in seven months while losses continued to erode the ailing 
industrys capital the government said monday 
the federal home loan bank board said net withdrawals at the 
nations 3102 federally insured sampls totaled 941 million in may 
but the decline came after seven consecutive months of net deposit 
gains totaling 28 billion 
through the first nine months of last year thrift institutions 
were troubled by what industry analysts called a slowmotion 
run as uncertain depositors withdrew their money 
however after the october stock market crash investors pulled 
their money out of risky stock investments and put it into insured 
sampl and bank acounts 
james barth chief economist at the bank board said there was 
no obvious explanation for the may deposit drain but he noted that 
commercial banks and money market mutual funds experienced a 
similar decline 
bert ely an alexandria va industry analyst said sampls appear 
to be trying to resist the rise in interest rates and thus are 
attracting fewer deposits 
meanwhile thrift institutions capital the difference between 
what they owe in liabilities and own in assets shrank by 303 
million in may after falling 392 million in april 
capital numbers are closely watched because they can provide a 
good indication of industry losses which totaled a postdepression 
record 76 billion last year and 38 billion for the first three 
months of this year 
the may capital shrinkage was smaller than declines in all but 
one of the previous 12 months but ely noted that capital tends to 
shrink the most in the third month of every quarter when many 
institutions credit interest earnings to depositors 
were not going to get a read on the second quarter until we 
see how june turns out he said 
savings institutions closed 211 billion in mortgage loans in 
may up from 191 billion in april but down sharply from 246 
billion a year ago barth attributed the decline to a drop in 
refinancing activity

it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash 
for the business

from a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders to which it owes 
103 million

eastern airlines on monday reported a 157 decline 
in june passenger traffic in what the company called a reflection 
of the continued downsizing of the financially pressed carrier 
revenue passenger miles the amount of miles flown by paying 
passengers were down 186 percent for the first six months of 
1988 compared to the first half of 1987 
spokeswoman paula musto noted that available seat miles in june 
dropped 141 percent while capacity from january through june was 
off 135 percent over last year 
theres no question its part of a trend eastern has been 
downsized she said of course you would like to have the 
airline grow 
the company which wants to cut labor costs by some 30 percent 
blames union intransigence as a major reason for cutting back on 
its flights 
the june figures were 253 billion revenue passenger miles 
compared with 300 billion a year ago on capacity of 398 billion 
available seat miles this year and 463 billion in june 1987 
sixmonth traffic this year was 1564 billion revenue passenger 
miles down from 1920 billion the year before while capacity was 
2544 billion available seat miles against 2940 billion 
eastern lost 241 million last year and reportedly is losing 1 
million a day 
meanwhile the company took out fullpage newspaper ads monday 
in miami new york washington boston atlanta and philadelphia 
calling attention to last weeks managementlabor agreements to 
improve communications and discussion of safety concerns 
the ad carried the heading hope for a breakthrough 
given the stiff financial challenges facing the company its 
clear that a successful future depends on the quick resolution of 
our labor contract negotiations over economic issues and anything 
that improves the environment between management and labor can only 
help in these ongoing efforts said the ad the latest in a 
series of fullpage advertisements taken out by both sides

a new jersey insurance company has drawn the 
ire of droughtsuffering farmers and state regulators who say the 
insurer appears to be backing off an offer to provide drought 
insurance 
insurance officials in at least three states minnesota 
indiana and ohio are looking into the policies offered during a 
sixweek period in may and june by federal insurance co a 
subsidiary of chubb group insurance cos of warren nj 
people are in a panic out here keith kendall an 
administrative officer for the indiana insurance department said 
monday they were lined up around the block to buy this stuff 
the company is offering to return premiums to farmers saying 
sales of the policies exceeded its coverage capacity but officials 
in minnesota and indiana warned that chubb could possibly lose its 
license to do business in those states if it did not provide the 
coverage 
essentially the policy offers coverage for crop damage due to 
belowaverage rainfall depending on the policy the less rain that 
falls the more money is paid 
chubb said the policy is a variation on the type of coverage 
offered to outdoorevent promoters insuring against a rainout 
chubb said monday that only about 40 policies actually had been 
issued out of thousands of applications filed may 1 to june 17 the 
company said federals insurance agent good weather international 
which developed the policy was authorized to provide only up to 
225 million in coverage in the farm belt states 
shortly before the enrollment period expired news stories about 
the drought and good weathers marketing brought on a flood of 
applications chubb spokeswoman mary lu korkuch said about 8000 
to 9000 applications had come in since june 17 she said 
we are still seeking to determine the magnitude of coverage 
requested above the capacity limit which we are committed to and 
we are working to develop a proposal to state insurance 
commissioners about how to best manage the situation she said 
state regulators said chubb promised to underwrite hundreds of 
millions of dollars in policies the company would not comment on a 
figure but kendall said chubb had 50 million in indiana policies 
alone 
chubb sent out letters over the weekend to insurance agents 
offering refunds to farmers who sent in premiums in exchange for 
canceling the contracts ms korkuch said 
kendall criticized the companys stance that it had no 
obligation to provide insurance to applicants he noted that the 
period covered by the policies was limited to june july and august 
and said that to offer refunds five weeks after the beginning of 
the period was unfair 
were going to get federal to stand behind all applications 
solicited in the state of indiana he said 
the states insurance commissioner harry eakin said over the 
weekend that about 1700 indiana farmers had signed contracts for 
the coverage paying 15 million to 20 million in premiums for 
coverage he set a hearing for july 26 to determine whether good 
weather or federal acted unfairly or deceptively 
in minnesota officials said chubb should issue drought policies 
to about 1000 farmers there 
a 1987 state law says that if a farmers premium check is 
cashed as has happened in most minnesota cases the policy cannot 
be canceled by the company or farmer officials said 
state and company representatives in minnesota plan to meet to 
discuss the issue 
in ohio peg ising an assistant director to the state insurance 
division said were looking at the situation in ohio at the 
present time 
most crop insurance is backed by the us agriculture 
departments federal crop insurance corp which has an april 15 
application deadline and covers a range of natural afflictions at 
once 
few companies provide coverage for specific problems such as 
drought ms korkuch said chubb had been doing so for three or four 
years 
chubb apparently had been having trouble finding a company to 
offer reinsurance said eric edgington a spokesman for federal 
crop insurance corp 
in years like this only uncle sam has pockets deep enough 
he said

soybean futures prices tumbled to their lowest levels in more 
than five weeks monday as weekend rains in the parched midwest 
prompted a third straight day of plummeting grain prices on the 
chicago board of trade 
trading on other commodities exchanges also featured extreme 
price movements cattle futures soared while most pork futures were 
sharply lower sugar took a hard hit platinum plunged its daily 
limit leading other precious metals down energy futures sank and 
stockindex futures advanced 
in chicago prices on most corn oat and soybean contracts fell 
their daily limits within minutes of the opening bell but the 
contracts for july delivery on which the limits have been removed 
pending their july 20 expiration continued to trade generally 
lower 
july soybeans dropped 66 cents a bushel to 858 the lowest 
settlement price for that contract since june 3 corn for july 
delivery dropped 21 cents to 288 a bushel the lowest level 
since june 15 
weekend showers brought fairly widespread relief to midwestern 
croplands easing fears of drastic yield reductions and spurring 
profittaking in the trading pits analysts said forecasts for 
more rain in the corn belt later this week forced further 
reductions in the markets estimate of prospective grain values 
oat futures prices reached a record 394 a bushel on june 28 
corn for nearmonth delivery hit 359 a bushel on july 5 
but experts say soybeans which have fallen about 22 percent 
since reaching a 15year high of 1099 on june 23 still could 
rally beyond that point 
soybeans generally go through the major podsetting stage from 
the end of july through august said cathy leow an analyst with 
thomson mckinnons securities in new york we did not get enough 
rain to bring the crop back and basically were still in a weather 
market 
it all depends on the weather agreed victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc unless the weather goes 
back to its previous very hot and dry pattern over a wide area 
were not going to go back up 
but if the weather goes back to hot and dry and that persists 
for a week or 10 days we will go back up again he said one 
rain does not make a crop 
in a 6to10day outlook issued after the close the national 
weather service predicted temperatures and rainfall closer to 
normal in the midwest for the first half of next week 
cautious trading was expected tuesday ahead of an agriculture 
department report on plantedacreage totals and revised 
supplydemand projections 
wheat settled 16 cents to 19 cents lower with july at 368 a 
bushel corn was 13 cents to 21 cents lower with july at 288 a

bushel soybeans were 44 cents to 66 cents lower with july at 858 
a bushel 
cattle for nearmonth delivery surged the 150centsa pound 
limit on the chicago mercantile exchange in reaction to lower grain 
prices and strong packer demand said charlie richardson an 
analyst in denver with lindwaldock amp co 
nearmonth cattle futures had fallen in recent weeks as grain 
prices rose reflecting widespread producer selling of cattle due 
to high feed prices but richardson said many traders believe 
cattle futures have bottomed out 
pork futures were down sharply to limitdown due to concerns 
about the nations large hog herd he said 
live cattle were 30 cent to 150 cents higher with august at 
6652 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent to 150 cents 
higher with august at 7602 cents a pound hogs were 150 cents

coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange where the october contract settled 
54 cent lower at 1339 cents a pound 
platinum sank its 25 limit on the new york mercantile exchange

on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 450 to 460

67 cents lower with july at 6937 a troy ounce 
nearmonth crude oil prices tumbled 68 cents a barrel on the 
nymex to the lowest close since late 1986 hurt by a selloff that 
traders blamed on too much supply and renewed skepticism about 
opecs ability to restrain production 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 67 cents to 73 cents

financial economist for merrill lynch capital markets this 
market was a big yawner 
the only development of note he said was that bond values were 
boosted slightly by steep falls in the prices of oil and farm 
commodities which quelled inflationary fears inflation is a key 
enemy of bond prices since it tends to erode the value of 
fixedincome securities 
crude oil prices tumbled 68 cents a barrel to the lowest close 
since late 1986 while grain and soybean futures dropped to their

cpc international inc said its 
profit jumped 45 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier 
boosted in part by growth in its consumer food and corn refining 
operations 
the food conglomerate said its secondquarter profit rose to 72 
million or 91 cents a share from 498 million or 61 cents a 
share in the second quarter of 1987 
the earnings gain occurred despite a decline in secondquarter 
revenue to 123 billion from 132 billion a year earlier 
in the first six months of the year cpc earned 130 million or 
164 a share up from 925 million or 113 a share in the same 
period last year revenue for the sixmonth period fell to 231 
billion from 252 billion in 1987 
the figures do not reflect a special gain of 126 million from a 
restructuring last year that included the sale of european 
operations and interests in asian companies 
the strength of european currencies against the dollar a lower 
debt burden and lower us tax rate contributed to the 
secondquarter earnings performance said chairman james r eiszner 
for the year 1988 we now expect that cpcs earnings per share 
will show an increase of 30 percent or more excluding the special 
gain in 1987 eiszner said 
the drought gripping the nations farm belt probably will not 
have a significant impact on earnings because more than half of 
cpcs revenue comes from operations in 47 foreign countries he 
said 
the companys brands include hellmanns mayonnaise mazola corn 
oil and margarine skippy peanut butter thomas english muffins 
arnold breads muellers pasta products karo and golden griddle 
syrups and knorr soups and sauces

house speaker jim wright said monday he hopes 
that a relief package with disaster payments of up to 100000 for 
droughtstricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready 
for floor action in congress this week 
the relief shall be targeted to those who need aid the most 
primarily family farmers wright dtexas told reporters 
he also said that there should be no windfalls for major 
corporations and wealthy individuals in the package being 
fashioned by the house and senate agriculture committees he said 
disaster payments should be capped at 100000 for each individual 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva called for 
expedited action but added that he remains uncertain about just 
what features should be included or what snags might exist if we 
can agree on a bipartisan drought package i would like to see us 
do that this week byrd said 
but sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee told reporters following a white house 
meeting with president reagan that congress should not rush 
legislation through recklessly 
i dont think anybody should put artificial deadlines on it 
he said the important thing is that you tell people that are 
about to go bankrupt that there is hope that there will be 
planting and raising herds next year i think were all agreed 
that thats going to be the goal its going to be a bipartisan 
piece of legislation and one that the president can sign 
we would like to have this bill ready for house consideration 
bfore this week expires wright said if this should prove 
impossible we shall plan to vote during the week of july 26 
the drought of 1988 is one of the hottest and driest spells of 
continuous weather on record wright said it affects almost 
all agricultural regions of the country particularly the northern 
plains states the corn belt and the mississippi delta 
he said the relief bill being drawn up would make farmers in 
more than 1880 counties in 37 states that have been called 
disaster areas eligible for payments from the government 
as outlined by wright governmentheld hay and feed grains would 
be made available to livestock producers up to a value of 50000 
per individual the drought has wiped out a substantial amount of 
hay in the farm belt and as a result feed is now at a premium 
under the bill wright said droughtstricken farmers would not 
be required to refund to the government socalled deficiency 
payments they have received in advance 
deficiency payments are income supports provided to farmers by 
the government they represent the difference between market prices 
and congressionally set target prices which are adjusted annually 
by the secretary of agriculture 
as estimates of this years harvest have grown smaller crop 
prices have increased accordingly as a result the gap between 
market prices and target prices has diminished and the size of 
deficiency payments for many farmers also has shrunk 
forty percent of these payments however have already been made 
in advance as things stand some of these farmers would be obliged 
to refund to the government a portion of their advance deficiency 
payment at a time when the drought has robbed them of a crop to 
take to market 
wright said the legislation would encourage the farmers home 
administration to restructure loans and delay collection from 
drought victims 
wright cautioned that consumers should be protected under the 
legislation and livestock producers should be provided with 
immediate relief 
the bill cannot be a budget buster wright said to the 
extent possible it should be paid for out of the savings the 
government is anticipating from lower deficiency payments 
tentative provisions sketched in by congressional sources said 
the measure would cancel the 50cent cut in dairy price supports 
scheduled for next year 
payments for wheat feed grains cotton and rice farmers would 
equal 65 percent of expected earnings for any losses greater than 
35 percent of yields 
for example corn growers would be paid at a rate of 65 percent 
of the target price of 293 a bushel or 190 a bushel payments 
would start once a farmer suffered a loss of more than 35 percent 
of the historical yield that he has established with the 
agriculture department 
a corn grower with 100 acres and a historical yield of 100 
bushels would receive a payment of 12350 as a disaster payment if 
his crop were wiped out 
it remains unclear however just how much might be saved in 
deficiency payments as a result of the drought and the savings 
will not merely be from smaller deficiency payments heightened 
demand is emptying government grain bins thus lowering substantial 
storage costs borne by taxpayers 
sen david durenberger rminn said friday that budget savings 
due to the drought would be at least 53 billion through fiscal 
1990 and could top 10 billion lawmakers have been talking about 
recycling some or all of these savings to distribute to 
droughtstricken farmers as disaster payments 
the extent of the drought damage remains uncertain lawmakers 
farmers and policymakers are awaiting tuesdays official crop 
production estimates from the department of agriculture they 
should offer the best available guide to the magnitude of the 
destruction caused by fierce heat and lack of rainfall in the 
midcontinent

studios from mgmua communications inc may not be financier kirk 
kerkorians last shuffle involving the two big hollywood names 
mgmuas president indicated monday 
were still considering further transactions said stephen 
silbert president and chief operating officer of mgmua which 
announced monday it would spin off its mgm unit 
kerkorian who controls 82 percent of mgmua will end up with 
at least 57 percent of the new mgm and 25 percent will go to a 
company controlled by investor burt sugarman and two movie 
producers the companies said the rest will be offered for sale to 
public holders of mgmua stock with kerkorian buying anything left 
over 
mgmua maker of the oscarwinning movie moonstruck and 
popular tv series thirtysomething has had several losing 
quarters and kerkorian acknowledged in april he was considering 
selling all or part of the company 
silbert declined to say what the next move might be but said 
the mgm sale was a separate freestanding transaction and 
wasnt part of some larger deal 
analysts suggested the deals primary value was to raise money 
to pay off mgmuas debt and the companys stock closed at 15 a 
share monday down 75 cents from fridays close 
the transaction recreates mgm known for its roaring lion logo 
as a separate publicly held producer of movies and television 
shows the company will be run by producers jon peters and peter 
guber major shareholders in sugarmans barris industries inc and 
makers of the color purple and witches of eastwick 
mgm will get a 50 percent interest in the present mgmua 
distribution network barris and kerkorians investment vehicle 
tracinda corp will each appoint half the mgm board 
mgmua to be renamed united artists corp will also make 
movies and tv shows and has a library of 1000 movies including 
the rocky and pink panther series 
the transaction expected to close in the fall calls for 
issuing approximately 50 million shares of new stock in mgm to be 
sold for 8 a share 
barris industries will buy 25 percent of the new stock for 100 
million 
present holders of mgmua will get rights to buy the rest and 
kerkorian has agreed to exercise all his rights giving him at 
least 57 percent of the new mgm kerkorian also will buy any shares 
that arent bought by mgmua public shareholders the companies 
said 
under the arrangement mgmua will sell 50 million shares of new 
stock in mgm for 8 a share

million will be used in part to pay off its 230 million bank debt 
silbert said he added that up to 9 million new shares will be 
issued for sale to barris in employee stock option plans

3000film library including such classics as gone with the 
wind and the wizard of oz was sold to turner broadcasting 
systems inc for 13 billion and the mgm studio lot was sold to 
lorimartelepictures corp 
mgm will own moonstruck and other movies produced under the 
mgmua label since 1986 
analysts said the deal allows kerkorian to pump cash into united 
artists while retaining an interest in the wellknown mgm name 
every company would probably jump at the opportunity to 
recapitalize and get rid of their debt said jeffrey logsdon of 
the crowell weedon amp co investment firm in los angeles 
guber and peters joined forces with sugarman last year by 
merging their private production firm with his barris industries 
inc maker of tvs the newlywed game and the dating game

have in the works including batman starring jack nicholson and 
rainman with dustin hoffman and tom cruise 
to have the opportunity to be part of that terrific tradition 
and to be able to bring it to another level is a once in a lifetime 
opportunity for us guber said

apollo computer inc announced monday 
two new low to midrange workstations designed to enhance efforts 
to recapture its position in the business computer marketplace 
the two systems the series 4500 and series 3500 workstations 
give apollo a new product line with an upgraded computer chip that 
could seriously challenge industry leader sun microsystems corp of 
sunnyvale calif several analysts said 
apollo has been losing its market share for two years to sun and 
other manufacuturers of workstations powerful computers for single 
users 
the 3500 will be only the second workstation to offer a powerful 
computer chip developed by motorola of austin texas but analysts 
note the price for the 3500 is about half of the 15000 
workstation by hewlettpackard inc using the motorola chip 
the 19000 series 4500 which is nearly twice as powerful as 
the apollo series 4000 workstation introduced last year is so far 
the only system offering an extrafast motorola presently being 
tested according to apollo 
both the 3500 and 4500 systems are scheduled to be available in 
december the company announced monday 
in overthecounter trading apollo fell 12 cents a share to 
1075 on volume of 16 million shares 
this is the last piece of the puzzle said apollo 
spokeswoman donna ruane with the new low and midrange systems 
it sets us up for a period of new growth 
on march 1 apollo announced the 70000 domain series 10000 a 
highpowered workstation targeted for specialized technical 
customers ruane said sales have so far been slow on the 10000 
which is scheduled to be shipped later this year 
jennifer johnson an analyst at international data corp in 
framingham said apollos introduction of the motorola chip should 
make significant gains in its competition with sun 
yet johnson warned apollo may be too confident of increased 
sales 
the most significant aspect of the announcement is that they 
leapfroged sun with the motorola chip its a very good product 
line and apollo is being aggressive but they are keeping the price 
down planning to get high sales volume they might be getting a 
bit too over aggressive she said 
robert herwick of hambrecht amp quist in new york said the new 
products give apollo the strongest overall line since 1986 but it 
may take time to convince customers 
this is more than just another feeble attempt to catch up to 
sun said herwick weve probably seen the worst of the pain 
apollo will go through because of a lesscompetitive product line 
theres likely to be some recovery now
