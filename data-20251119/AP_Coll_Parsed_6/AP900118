the royal shakespeare company has announced 21 
productions for 1990 blaming a cash shortage for its most modest 
year since the 1970s 
i regret the reduction in the work but it will give all our 
actors a chance to do their work well artistic director terry 
hands told a news conference wednesday 
he introduced fourtheater repertoire as streamlined as we can 
make it 
hands 49 is resigning later this year to go freelance he said 
his successor is expected to be named next month and be in place by 
april 1 
hands attributed the reduced output to a cumulative deficit of 
41 million dollars despite the 165 million annually that the 
company receives from its internationally successful musical les 
miserables the company staged 27 productions last year 32 in 
1988 and a record 47 in 1987 
he said the decision had nothing to do with critics complaints 
that the company has been overextending itself typically staging 
more productions per year than are seen on broadway all season 
i believe quantity is in the rscs very nature hands 
said it works at its best when going flat out fizzing on all 
cylinders 
the companys season opens march 28 with the transfer from 
stratforduponavon of barry kyles staging of shakespeares 
alls well that ends well 
the production was poorly received in its stratford opening last 
fall since then hands said its being refurbished and 
retreaded people are still working the show to try and improve 
it 
then come more transfers from stratford as you like it 
starring sophie thompson as rosalind coriolanus with charles 
dance in the title role singer peter flannerys controversial 
new play staring anthony sher and john websters the duchess of 
malfi with harriet walter 
two musicals are planned a revival of lionel barts 1961 
blitz directed by barry kyle and children of eden an 
original show with music and lyrics by american composer stephen 
schwartz the bakers wife godspell john caird who 
codirected les miserables will direct 
the stratford season starting april 10 will include six 
shakespeare plays beginning with much ado about nothing it 
will also feature christopher marlowes edward ii and a new 
play two shakespearean actors by american dramatist richard 
nelson his some americans abroad was a london hit for the 
company last summer and opens offbroadway next month 
eagerly awaited is a new king lear starring john wood as 
lear and directed by nicholas hytner the admired young director of 
the musical miss saigon it opens july 11 
hytner and wood collaborated together last year on an acclaimed 
staging of the tempest 
except for john wood the new season is noticeably lacking in 
stars fewer of whom can be enticed to work for relatively low pay 
over a long period 
instead the company is promoting rising young actors like ralph 
fiennes who will play troilus in troilus and cressida and the 
bastard edmund in king lear among others and simon russell 
beale the king of navarre in loves labours lost and thersites 
in troilus and cressida 
with an 11 percent increase in government funding over last 
year hands said the level of state subsidy should be 40 percent to 
45 percent 
taking into account inflation at 77 percent hands said the 
increase gives the company 295000 in new and extra money about 
the cost of one major production on a major stage

the battle to keep floridas 
environment off the terminal list gets a boost this week as 
president bush plans a visit to the everglades and leading 
conservationists meet to set their agenda 
heavily populated south florida is under mandatory water 
restrictions because of its worst drought in three decades and 
state environmentalists say time is running out for ambitious 
expensive efforts to reverse damage caused by runaway growth 
the everglades is on the critical list it is the most 
threatened ecosystem in the united states said brien culhane a 
wilderness society official and chairman of the everglades 
coalition the 1990s will be the decade of decision the 
decisions we make and our success in carrying them out will 
determine whether the everglades will be saved 
the everglades coalition an umbrella group of 25 organizations 
that includes the national audubon society sierra club and 
wilderness society begins its fifth annual meeting thursday after 
sessions with floridas top politicians seminars and field trips 
the conservationists will announce their agenda for the year 
meanwhile bush plans a tour and briefing friday at everglades 
national park the main purpose of bushs sixhour florida visit is 
to keynote a fundraising dinner in miami for republican gov bob 
martinezs november reelection effort but martinez likely will 
lobby bush for federal money to help florida environmental projects 
the governor is expected here thursday to endorse an 
unprecedented 276 million backfilling plan to restore the 
kissimmee river to its original meandering boundaries 
the army corps of engineers because of state calls for flood 
control built a 52mile 30feetdeep channel to straighten the 
winding 98milelong river but after the channelization was 
completed in 1971 pollution of lake okeechobee the major 
reservoir of south floridas freshwater increased and tens of 
thousands of pollutionfiltering wetlands were lost along with 
substantial numbers of fish and wildlife 
estus whitfield the governors chief environmental adviser 
said the state will ask for 80 percent federal funding of the 
restoration 
bush last month authorized expansion of the everglades national 
park by 107600 acres but state officials want him to push 
immediately for funding florida will donate 35000 acres to the 
federal park and has agreed to pay 20 percent of the estimated 40 
million cost to acquire the other lands 
when youre talking about getting sizable amounts of federal 
funds for any activity thats tough these days said us sen 
bob graham dfla 
graham and other florida leaders say the states projects are 
more than environmental idealism 
adding wetlands and reversing development not only would protect 
the 13 endangered species and dozens of threatened species but 
also could prevent the booming gold coast from palm beach to 
miami from becoming a concrete desert 
about half of south floridas 4000 square miles of wetlands 
were taken over by urban areas and agriculture after massive 
dredging and draining began around the turn of the century 
floridas population exploded after world war ii more than 
quadrupling to nearly 13 million people canals and channels were 
built for flood control but changes in natural water flow have 
spurred pollution destroyed wildlife habitats and disrupted 
evaporationandrainfall cycles 
south florida has had its lowest rainfall since 1962 in the past 
year and the water level in lake okeechobee which serves as a 
giant reservoir for south florida is three feet below normal and 
at its lowest on record 
the dry conditions spur wildfires that push black smoke and ash 
over the southeast coast choking smoke last spring forced 
respiratory alerts and repeated closings of major highways and the 
low water levels can allow ocean saltwater intrusion to underground 
aquifers

the former mayor of this western 
pennsylvania town wonders whether he lost his reelection bid 
because voters didnt read the fine print 
richard haddoxs name on the november ballot appeared in a 
smaller type size than challenger paul spickermans 
haddox lost by two votes 
haddox wrote to the beaver county board of elections pointing 
out the type size difference he decided not to challenge the 
outcome but he suggested the board investigate the matter and 
release its findings 
the variation in print size is suspicious and tends to 
raise questions about the integrity of the election and the process 
of printing the ballots haddox said 
elections board chairman chester szurley said the company that 
printed the ballots admitted the varied type size was its decision 
because of space constraints 
szurley said each candidate must review a sample ballot prior to 
an election he said haddox apparently did not notice the type size 
difference then

charles r pilottes curiosity was 
piqued when he discovered a cache of preprohibition era liquor 
stashed behind a wall in his cellar 
he had to know how the whiskey would go down 
its smooth but the aftertaste when it hit it knocked me up 
against a wall he said 
pilotte found 19 bottles of liquor including haig amp haig 
scotch gordons gin old crow bourbon chevalier brandy and mount 
vernon whiskey as he tore down a basement wall jan 7 in his 
80yearold home 
in the wall between a coal bin and a coal storage room he 
found a wooden fire break about 18 inches from the floor he found 
the liquor bottles wrapped in copies of the boston sunday herald 
and the boston evening tribune all dated from 1919 the year 
before prohibition took effect 
pilotte believes the bottles were left there by either selby 
kidder or william b hunter who lived in the house at that time 
pilotte is now trying to determine the value and age of his 
discovery he believes the haig amp haig might date back to the 1800s 
pilotte sampled the mount vernon whiskey because five bottles of 
that brand were in the wall and one of the bottles appeared to 
have leaked 
the leak pilotte said didnt effect the taste

hector higueras paid 9000 to come 
to the united states but he ended up in panama and now he cant 
leave 
higueras is one of thousands of cubans who arrived in panama the 
last four years as part of an underground human trafficking 
ring allegedly involving gen manuel antonio noriega and members 
of fidel castros government 
just as everyone knows theres drug trafficking in colombia 
everybody here knows noriega was trafficking cubans said 
higueras 26 a computer programmer 
noriega profited financially and castro benefited by 
provoking illegal migration to the united states and getting rid 
of malcontents he said 
since the us invasion dec 20 noriegas henchmen have either 
been captured or are hiding and the cubans who arrived here 
illegally are stuck 
the refugees are asking for visas to the united states but dont 
qualify under us immediate family quotas which means they 
have to have parents or siblings living in the united states 
many of the cubans are young in their 20s and have not known 
anything but a communist system by cuban standards they are a 
privileged lot many having worked in the government bureaucracy as 
secretaries accountants and engineers 
we are not marielitos higueres said referring to the 1980 
cuban boatlift off the miami coast we are not prisoners theres 
a lot of professionals 
he said the cubans left their homeland because of the economic 
situation there and events in the soviet union and eastern europe 
if you live in a cave but see a ray of light far away you 
know theres something else there said higueras but you dont 
know how dark its been until you get to the light 
higueras who helped form the new cuban refugees commission 
says the smuggling ring shipped about 40000 cubans to panama 
although the exact number of cubans in panama now is not known it 
is much lower than 40000 he says 
the us invasion brought the issue to light because cuban 
refugees say they did not feel free to speak up under noriegas 
military regime 
the cubans describe an intricate network that spanned south 
america including colombia ecuador peru brazil and the mexican 
border 
a lawyer familiar with the cases said relatives of the cubans 
would have to give us dollars in cash to an attorney in panama 
the panamanian attorney would then contact officers in the 
panamanian defense forces to get permission for the cuban to enter 
the country sometimes noriega himself would have to give his 
approval 
then the panamanians would bribe contacts in the cuban 
government who would authorize an exit permit the total cost 
could go as high as 20000 in a difficult case said the attorney 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
everybody got a cut said the attorney 
the final cost varied depending on the passport papers and 
route provided by the palanganas or wash basins as the people 
who traffic cubans are called in panama 
the cuban ambassador in panama said he didnt know anything 
about the smuggling ring 
if it happened it didnt have anything to do with the embassy 
or the consulate ambassador lazaro mora said wednesday 
as the cubans arrived in panama city they were led through a 
tunnel at the airport where immigration officials would take 
their passports for 20 they would get an identication card 
specifying cant work 
i wanted to be a free person but right away you felt like a 
slave said jorge reyes barcelo 23 whose family in miami paid 
3500 for him to leave cuba 
he said a palangana told him when arrived in panama he had 
to come up with another 3500 to get to the united states 
i saw very quickly what price you had to pay for freedom 
said reyes i saw we were being moved like animals for a lot of 
money i thought until then everything was legal because i didnt 
know what my family had paid 
from the airport the cubans were driven to safe houses in 
apartments and houses where up to 20 other cubans were staying 
they said they were charged about 200 a month rent 
reyes said he was offered a trip to the mexican border city of 
ciudad juarez where he would swim across to the united states 
instead he left the safe house and joined other disillusioned 
cubans in panama city 
higueras said he had received word he would be leaving for the 
united states on dec 20 the day of the invasion 
i didnt know how i would be leaving but i was told to be 
ready i never heard from the man again i lost all that money 
said higueras but i felt happy i knew it was a historic moment 
that was ending something bad 
the new government of president guillermo endara is conducting a 
census and is filing charges against belgica del castillo the 
director of immigration under noriega for allegedly running the 
smuggling operation 
ms del castillo sought asylum with noriega at the vatican 
embassy after the invasion she surrendered last week 
in miami on tuesday a deputy us attorney told a magistrate 
the government has evidence of a noriegaled ring that smuggled 
illegal aliens into the united states that raised the possibility 
he could face charges in the united states in addition to the drug 
trafficking charges 
we believe we deserve refuge in the united states because of 
the conditions weve had to live with and because panama is 
devastated and cannot absorb us said higueras

about 300 people waving armenian flags and 
chanting gorbachev must stop the killing gathered near a 
soviet embassy wednesday to protest that countrys failure to end 
fighting between armenians and their azerbaijani neighbors 
we want the united states to put pressure on soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev to end this war said arby coharian a 
spokeswoman for the armenian national committee which organized the 
rally 
this could be a thousand times worse than the earthquake 
she said referring to the 1988 disaster that killed thousands of 
armenians this could lead to the death of the nation 
the crowd across the street from the soviet mission to the 
united nations kept up a continuous roar of chants like no more 
genocide and stop the killing in azerbaijan 
some held american flags others waved the blue red and orange 
armenian flag about 15000 people of armenian heritage live in new 
york city 
coharian said her organization was raising money to provide arms 
so that armenians can defend themselves if no other country will 
do it we will do it she said 
in moscow the kremlin told the thousands of soldiers it sent to 
the caucasus to shoot if need be to halt the fighting in the hills 
around the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
thousands of armenian refugees poured from the southern republic 
of azerbaijan many beaten or chased from their homes by angry 
mobs some blamed the attacks on azerbaijanis who earlier fled 
ethnic violence in armenia 
the death toll rose to 58 mostly armenians and the number of 
injured to 169 in five days of civil warfare said interior 
ministry spokesman dmitri seleznyov 
a predominantly armenian enclave ruled by azerbaijan since 1923 
nagornokarabakh demanded in february 1988 to be annexed by 
armenia renewing a decadesold feud between the two ethnic groups 
we have had massacres a lot this time we are protesting 
before it happens said demonstrator lena sarkissian how much 
can we wait and see until we are gone and finished 
mrs sarkissian was born in 1918 three years after more than a 
million armenians were killed in a wave of persecution in turkey 
she said what is happening in the soviet union reminds her of 
stories her parents told her about the 1915 massacres its very 
sad she said breaking into tears

the united states should dare not ignore 
signals that gas emissions may be heating up the earth but its 
too early to set limits on carbon dioxide exhaust the nations 
environmental chief said 
environmental protection agency administrator william k reilly 
said wednesday that although six of the 10 warmest years on record 
occurred in the last decade more study was needed on global 
warming 
reilly said it would be three to five years before scientific 
research gets anything conclusive or definitive on greenhouse 
gases or climatic change that should not however suggest it 
should paralyze policy 
environmentalists and some senate democrats have sharply 
criticized the united states for refusing to commit to stabilizing 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by the year 2000 
in november at an international conference on ways to slow or 
halt dangerous climatic changes many europeans called for specific 
curbs on greenhouse gases by the centurys end 
the united states agreed to a compromise declaration at the 
conference that says globalwarming pollutants should be stabilized 
as soon as possible 
reilly criticized the countries calling for limits on gas 
emissions 
most dont have a clue how they will achieve those cuts he 
said in a speech which was part of an environmental lecture series 
sponsored by the new york botanical garden 
he said many countries havent figured out the economic impact 
of improving the fuel efficiency of cars and industrial plants to 
meet a freeze in emissions he said it would cost billions of 
dollars 
reilly said however it was time to step up research on the 
issue 
something important may be happening he said we dare not 
ignore it 
he strongly supported the unsponsored intergovernmental panel 
on climate change which is to meet in washington next month 
scientists say the greenhouse effect could eventually turn 
subtropical areas into deserts and coastal nations could face 
massive flooding 
researchers have theorized that certain gases are trapping heat 
within the atmosphere causing temperatures to rise they say that 
carbon dioxide emissions along with chlorofluorocarbons methane 
and nitrous oxides may be the major causes 
in his speech reilly encouraged conservation groups to make 
more debtfornature swaps deals in which developing countries 
preserve ecologically sensitive areas for debt payments 
he also said environmentalists now have a major opportunity to 
protect nature because of heightened awareness of the worlds 
fragile environment 
we need to seize the moment he said we need to do 
everything we can personally do to preserve our earth while there 
is still time 
reilly told a story in which mark twain was walking with a 
friend in a hard rain 
the friend asked think it will stop 
twain looked up and said always has 
he said nature broadly defined is a good deal tougher and 
resilient than we give it credit for nature i have no doubt 
will make it its human beings im worried about whether we can 
make it

a former university of south florida student 
has been convicted of stealing two notebooks of his research data 
from a laboratory at the school 
circuit judge richard lazzara ordered petr taborsky to return 
the books no later than sentencing feb 9 after a jury found him 
guilty tuesday of seconddegree grand theft and theft of trade 
secrets 
taborsky 27 also was ordered to turn over to prosecutors any 
copies made of the notebooks he could face up to five years in 
prison but state guidelines indicate he might get probation 
taborsky was hired to work in usfs engineering laboratory on 
research sponsored by florida progress corp in st petersburg the 
company parent of florida power corp paid the school 68000 for 
the research it said taborsky stole 
defense attorney terrance bostic argued that taborsky was signed 
to work on a biological project that failed then continued the 
work on his own he said taborsky maintains he owns the ideas 
its the story of a young inquisitive student who returns to 
the lab and begins to think back on what went wrong with the 
biological portion and asks what if 
he shared his invention with his professor bostic argued only 
to have the corporation steal it 
but assistant state attorney judy hoyer read from a series of 
monthly florida progress reports that showed the company was 
working all along on the experiments taborsky said he conceived on 
his own she said if taborsky were not convicted sponsored research 
would cease to exist at universities 
frank lucarelli director of sponsored research usf said it 
would be a catastrophe if taborsky was not found guilty because 
it would destroy the trust that private corporations which 
sponsored 55 million of research last year place in the school

housing secretary jack kemp is killing a 
mortgage insurance program that was part of the reagan 
administrations effort to trim the bureaucracy but is now blamed 
for costing taxpayers nearly 1 billion 
kemp said wednesday the department of housing and urban 
development will phase out the coinsurance program and all private 
lenders will have to get hud approval before making new loans in 
the meantime 
kemp in a statement said another hud insurance program will 
provide an alternative financing option he said he would 
restructure it by years end to allow private lenders to process 
and service those loans while making sure only hud can approve the 
necessary mortgage insurance 
the decision to kill the coinsurance program among the 
programs investigated during last years allegations of favoritism 
and mismanagement at hud in the 1980s came four months after hud 
officials said it would be reformed and revived 
democrats in congress have warned kemp not to use agency 
problems as excuses to drop programs but a congressional aide said 
he expected no battle over killing coinsurance 
it was a seriously flawed program said donald campbell 
staff director of the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
subcommittee on housing democrats however likely would question 
whether hud has enough qualified staffers to oversee the program 
kemp promoted as an alternative campbell said 
the coinsurance program created in 1983 allowed private 
lenders to issue mortgages for multifamily housing developments and 
commit hud to insuring roughly 80 percent of the loans audits by 
huds inspector general have criticized coinsurance lenders for 
approving bloated mortgages 
those high mortgages led to excessive rents which in turn were 
blamed for high vacancy rates that led to defaults leaving hud 
holding most of the bill 
the general accounting office estimates that defaults and other 
related hud program losses have cost taxpayers at least 960 
million 
the most notorious case which kemp cited in announcing the 
decision was the hudbacked loan for colonial house apartments in 
houston 
the development was coinsured for 472 million hud was forced 
to take over colonial house after default and recovered just 89 
million when it auctioned the property 
in his statement wednesday kemp said extensive reviews by hud 
staff and outside auditors convinced him to kill the program 
our review of coinsurance and its mounting losses has shown 
that it cannot be managed or overseen in a way that will serve the 
interests of the public at large or the needs of families for 
affordable housing kemp said 
it is clear that coinsurance has been a bad deal for the 
american taxpayer he said 
kemp said huds full insurance program under which the 
government itself issues the mortgage insurance and is 100 percent 
liable in the event of default would help pick up the slack for 
homebuyers underwriting the mortgage insurance directly would give 
hud greater oversight of loans 
but campbell the senate aide said the problem here is that 
they are going back to full insurance and there is no evidence that 
they have the staff to handle the demand he said coinsurance 
was created because of hud staff reductions and the bush 
administration resisted attempts by democrats to boost staffing 
levels this year 
documents released by hud and testimony at congressional 
hearings showed that one company drg funding corp had nearly 
600 million of the loans of the 960 million in hud losses 
drg was placed on probation during the reagan administration by 
thenhousing secretary samuel r pierce jr and required to submit

angry state department officials say us 
diplomats overseas could be the target of reprisals following a 
series of incidents between us forces in panama and foreign 
envoys there 
we cannot conduct diplomacy on the basis of 25watt 
thinking said one administration official accusing the us 
military of failing to take into account the potential diplomatic 
consequences of its actions 
the incidents put in jeopardy american diplomatic missions all 
over the world said perry shankle a former president of the 
american foreign service association the union of career 
diplomats he was the only one of several officials interviewed who 
was willing to be quoted by name 
fearful of the diplomatic fallout as a result of incidents at 
the embassies in panama of the vatican cuba peru and nicaragua 
the association has expressed its concern in a private letter to 
defense secretary dick cheney 
the united states is considered particularly vulnerable to 
reprisals against its diplomats because it often pursues unpopular 
policies internationally and also has more envoys stationed 
overseas than any other country 
the state department insists the united states subscribes fully 
to rules governing treatment of diplomats spelled out in the vienna 
convention on the other hand it acknowledges that an unusual 
situation has prevailed in panama 
a us official worried about the precedent set in panama 
said we diplomats have to rely on good faith of foreign 
governments to live up to their commitments to protect us 
one foreign service officer expressed particular outrage over 
the statement by president bush following the dec 29 penetration 
of the nicaraguan embassy in panama by us forces searching for 
weapons 
bush acknowledged that a mistake had been made because the us 
troops thought the envoy lived elsewhere but the president sharply 
criticized the diplomat for having automatic weapons up to his 
eyeballs in his house 
the us official said nicaragua is not alone in having weapons 
caches stored at its diplomatic sites 
if a hostile group entered us facilities in some foreign 
countries dont you think they would find rpgs 
rocketpropelled grenades the official asked you dont 
think we have tow antitank missiles in some compounds 
use of loud music outside the vatican embassy where gen manuel 
antonio noriega sought refuge on dec 24 drew angry complaints of 
amateurism from some state department officials and expressions 
of irritation from the vatican 
a few days after the invasion cuban officials charged the us 
forces were preventing diplomats from entering or leaving their 
embassy as part of the effort to bar noriega from seeking refuge 
there us officials denied the cuban allegations 
in an effort to track down panamanians who served noriega 
american troops have been checking cars entering and leaving the 
cuban mission even though some experts contend such vehicles 
apparently are exempt from such activity under international law 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler has said the 
cuban ambassadors car has very dark tinted windows which 
require troops guarding the mission to open the doors to identify 
the passengers 
but a state department official said the action by the troops 
exposes every american ambassador to the possibility of an armed 
blockade he would have to agree to be searched this is appalling 
this is the most appalling thing ive ever seen 
the official listed about seven adversary countries which he 
said may use the panama precedents as an excuse to harass us 
diplomats as a means of punishing the united states 
at a time of embittered antiamerican feelings in 1979 there 
were attacks on three us embassies in the middle east in less 
than a month and each is believed to have had official 
encouragement or acquiescence the attack on the us embassy in 
tehran produced the iran hostage crisis which dragged on for 444 
days 
some panamanians being sought by us forces are wanted in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges ms tutwiler said she 
added that the police functions being carried out by the us 
troops at various embassies in panama are being transferred quickly 
to panamanian security forces

the food and drug administration is approving 
far fewer generic drugs for sale to consumers as a result of the 
fraud and bribery scandal that enveloped the agency last year 
the troubles at the fdas generic drug division never shut off 
the pipeline entirely but the agency said it approved fewer than 
half the generic drugs in 1989 than it had the year before 
the slowdown said jay molishever of the generic pharmaceutical 
industry association has caused a clogging of the pipeline 
that is hurting consumers and generic drug companies alike 
it hurts the consumer because the drugs arent getting to 
them and it hurts the innocent generic firms because the 
opportunity to market these drugs is delayed by the necessary 
diversion of manpower to correct the problem created by a few 
molishever said in an interview wednesday 
the fda said it approved 265 generic drugs in 1989 compared 
with 684 the previous year 
hemant k shah of hks amp co a pharmaceutical analyst based in 
warren nj said there has been little impact from the approval 
slowdown because no patents for widely prescribed drugs expired 
last year and none will for the next six months 
only when a patent expires on a brandname drug can a generic 
alternative be approved such approvals are sometimes granted 
within days of a patent expiration 
even if we had more generic approvals in 1989 there wouldnt 
have been an impact in terms of more generic use or less generic 
use because almost every important product that is off patent is 
facing generic competition shah said 
in hindsight this investigation came at the right time for 
the generic drug industry because it came at a time when more 
approvals wouldnt have meant anything to the industry he said 
molishever said the low point has been reached in the 
approval process and the pipeline is starting to work again 
but couldnt foresee when the regulatory process would be back to 
normal speed 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the system wont be back to full 
steam until a permanent director and other top officials are chosen 
and the office is in place and running 
though he didnt know when that would be he predicted generic 
drug approvals for this year will be off only slightly from 1988 
figures 
the scandal that became public last spring led to the bribery 
convictions of three generic drug company executives and 
bribetaking convictions of three fda employees including charles 
chang former branch chief in the generic drug division 
the investigation also uncovered evidence that some drug 
companies cheated on fda safety tests and prompted recalls of 
dozens of generic drugs including the lowerpriced clones of some 
popular drugs 
one of the most widely prescribed drugs affected was dyazide a 
high blood pressure medication made by smithkline beecham 
last summer vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield 
gardens ny withdrew its version of dyazide from the market 
after admitting company employees substituted samples of the 
brandname drug for vitarines product in tests required for fda 
approval 
the only other generic version of the drug on the market is made 
by bolar pharmaceutical co inc of copiague ny the fda is 
trying to remove it because of allegations bolar misrepresented 
data to the agency

the company must have permission from the panamanian consulate 
to remove him from the ship mynatt said 
we dont really know why he got on board he said he said 
he was just trying to get out of panama 
the united states invaded panama ousting dictator manuel 
noriega and installing a new government 
mandel said the stowaways were economic refugees looking for a 
good place to live and work

researchers have prevented the rejection of 
transplanted organs by altering the immune system so that the 
organs dont appear to be foreign according to a new study 
the technique has been used only in laboratory animals so far 
but it promises to be a vast improvement over current methods of 
preventing organ rejection in humans says one of the studys 
participants dr c garrison fathman of stanford university in 
california 
the success of heart kidney and liver transplants is limited by 
the ability of researchers to suppress the bodys defenses so 
they dont reject the organ while leaving enough of those 
defenses intact to prevent infections and cancer 
its trading one disease for another fathman said wednesday 
at the american heart associations annual science writers forum 
a heart transplant for example cures heart disease but the 
immune system suppression leads to infections that often require 
hospitalization fathman said sometimes the organ is rejected 
despite efforts to suppress the immune system 
in the new technique treatment is given before the transplant 
rather than after 
a specially developed antibody is used to wipe out the white 
blood cells called helper t cells these are the master control 
cells of the immune system they are also the cells attacked by 
the aids virus 
the organ transplant surgery is then performed in the ensuing 
weeks and months the helper t cells return but in the course of 
their return they are educated not to destroy any of the bodys 
own tissue 
in the course of that education the cells learn to 
recognize the newly transplanted organ as the bodys own tissue 
not as foreign tissue 
otherwise the immune system is perfectly normal and can protect 
against infections as well as it could before the transplant the 
immune system is not suppressed 
one of the techniques peculiar advantages is that even though 
the new cells are changed to recognize the transplanted organ as 
the bodys own they retain the ability to protect against 
infections that they have already fought off 
the technique would not for example destroy the lifelong 
immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or chicken pox 
fathman said 
he and his stanford colleagues have done heart transplants on 25 
rats and only two have rejected the transplants he said 
research is under way to find human versions of the antibodies 
so that trials of the technique can begin in humans fathman said 
so far none of the antibodies tested has shown the same effects 
on human cells but the researchers are confident that effective 
human antibodies will be found he said

the agriculture department is being roasted by 
iowa members of congress over its handling of a 37 million 
program that is supposed to curb outbreaks of pseudorabies in swine 
also called prv ajueskys disease and mad itch the virus can 
be deadly to swine especially newborn pigs and can be 
transmitted to most other warmblooded animals except humans and 
horses 
sen tom harkin diowa said wednesday that too much of the 
money meant for eradicating pseudorabies appears lost in a black 
hole of administrative costs 
its my intention to work with the inspector general and the 
gao general accounting office to get some accounting breakouts 
harkin said at a hearing on where money for the 2yearold program 
are going 
wheres the black hole he asked 
more than 20 percent of iowa swine herds are infected with 
pseudorabies and nearly 47 percent of the nations infected herds 
are located in iowa said harkin 
rep tom tauke riowa who says he represents the leading 
porkproducing district in the nation also has blasted usda for 
spending so much on paperwork instead of testing vaccination and 
other efforts directly related to getting rid of the virus 
this vital federal program dedicated to eradicating deadly 
swine disease has been rendered virtually useless by bureaucratic 
red tape said tauke in a press release monday 
two usda officials admitted at the hearing that a greater 
percentage of the appropriated funds was going to administration 
than congress intended 
but they defended the use as necessary and said there still was 
enough money to make progress in the eradication program 
the 10year federal effort to rid the nations swine population 
of pseudorabies began last january with 31 million for 1989 the 
amount was increased for fiscal 1990 the program also calls for 
state and pork industry contributions 
harkin and tauke are miffed because iowa is getting only 6000 
more this year despite the 600000 overall increase in federal 
funds some states are actually being cut back 
lonnie king deputy administrator at usdas animal and plant 
health inspection service said that in 1989 other agency programs 
helped support the administrative costs of running the pseudorabies 
program 
because pseudorabies will pay its fair share of expenses and 
because of the consolidation of purchases to save money some state 
allocations will be reduced said king we are confident that 
the funds allocated to the states are adequate to further the 
progress of the national eradication program 
but harkin wasnt satisfied 
this confirms everyones worst fears about government he 
said 
pseudorabies develops from a herpes virus that is completely 
different from rabies however its name was derived because of the 
mouth frothing teeth grinding and other signs that also are 
characteristic of rabies 
even when swine recover from the disease they continue to be 
carriers of the virus according to usda animal health authorities

ton or about 51 cents per bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies

us sen alan cranston condemned his 
chief accuser in the lincoln savings amp loan scandal as a 
hitlerian liar wednesday and declared he would seek and win 
reelection to the us senate in 1992 
the democratic whip facing the worst political crisis of his 21 
years in the us senate refused again in a statewide series of 
news conferences to take any more than the most limited amount of 
responsibility for the billions lost by taxpayers and savers in the 
lincoln collapse 
he added that he is still not certain it was wise for the 
government to seize lincoln and refused to criticize charles 
keating the phoenix millionaire who was chief executive officer of 
lincoln savings saying the courts will pass judgment on whether 
keating did anything wrong 
but cranston lashed out angrily at edwin gray the former 
chairman of the federal home loan bank board and cranstons 
principal accuser 
cranston used the words lie or lies 20 times in prepared 
remarks to describe grays charges and accused gray of being a 
selfincriminating liar and practicioner of the hitlerian 
technique of the big lie 
gray was vacationing in europe and could not be reached for 
comment 
cranston said he was not aware that gray would be unavailable to 
respond to his charges when he scheduled his series of news 
conferences in los angeles san francisco and sacramento to attack 
him 
i come before you bloodied but unbowed cranston told a 
crowd of reporters i assure you ive only now begun to fight 
he added scoffing over ghouls he said want to succeed him in 
1992 
i have news for mr gray and his rightwing friends i shall 
run for reelection in 1992 and i will win the democrat said in 
the concluding line of a sixpage statement attacking gray 
in his threecity media blitz cranston denied repeatedly that 
he did anything improper in the lincoln scandal which could end up 
costing 2 billion in a taxfunded bailout plus losses of 200 
million for 23000 lincoln investors 
cranston acknowledged that by taking 850000 in contributions 
from keating then intervening with regulators on keatings behalf 
that he created the appearance of impropriety and did myself 
political damage but i repeat there was no impropriety 
three separate polls in recent weeks have reported cranstons 
popularity falling to its lowest level in his long senate tenure 
the senator accused gray of being the key source of 
accusations that cranston and other senators met with gray in april 
1987 to delay action against lincoln 
questioned by reporters cranston said it wasnt unusual that 
he fellow senators dennis deconcini of arizona john mccain of 
arizona and john glenn of ohio met with gray a second meeting a 
few days later with san francisco bank examiners included sen don 
riegle of michigan 
the meetings are the subject of a senate ethics committee 
inquiry 
each senator had his own reason for going to that meeting i 
went solely to get a speedier decision on the audit one way or the 
other i have said i made a political mistake i do not 
think it was a moral or ethical mistake

mistletoe and holly no longer deck the halls 
and everyone has stopped singing carols but the interest in 
christmas trees here is almost as high as it was a month ago 
the trees are being hauled into the marshes and swamps in a 
battle to slow erosion of the regions wetlands which are 
disappearing at the rate of about 50 square miles a year 
everybody wants to take part its great instead of just 
throwing out your christmas tree you can send it to save a 
marsh said bob thomas of the louisiana nature and science center 
environmentalists hope the trees will collect sediment and form 
barriers to waves protecting the shoreline the project in its 
third year also has a side benefit it saves space in dumps 
the program was started by john day of the coastal ecology 
institute of louisiana state university 
day and some graduate students built a line of fences across an 
eroded marsh and filled it with tree limbs and native bamboo the 
project which had to be done by hand was impractical thomas said 
it was not something that was going to catch on it had to be 
done in january and february when the vegetation had died down it 
was cold and youd sink into the water and ooze up to your waist 
he said 
day believed christmas trees would do the job but he didnt 
think he could get enough of them the nature and science center 
put out the word however and the trees came pouring in 
there was so much interest the project was expanded this year 
instead of making people haul their shedding trees to the nature 
center curbside pickups were organized 
we get more than we can use thomas said we only have 
funding to put in 12000 trees and a lot of people are disappointed 
when their tree just gets left for the trash 
contractors sank posts into the marsh and the trees some still 
twinkling with strands of tinsel are laid between the posts a 
fence is placed on top of the trees said gretchen binet the st 
charles parish official who oversees the swamp work 
it will affect 6000 acres of marsh when its done we can see 
results already binet said its damping the wave action 
protecting the shoreline you can see the sediment around the 
fences already instead of washing away its growing there 
the state spent 35800 to stack the trees into the fences that 
were set up last year other costs are minimal said william 
conner an assistant at the coastal ecology institute 
landfill owners have helped collect the trees and duck hunters 
help place the trees in the swamps conner said 
preliminary studies are being compiled he said so far they 
think the trees help but theyre still unsure how much 
you can see the sediment around the fences mud flats are 
being created it looks very hopeful you can see the buildup but 
we dont know how fast it will work conner said 
he hopes that sediment will cover the trees completely before 
they decompose making a longterm barrier 
the areas were working in were once marsh but are now open 
water conner said we hope to see grass take root and a marsh 
established again it could be one of the best presents ever left 
by a christmas tree if it works

regulators are raising another 5 billion for 
president bushs sampl bailout and putting another 43 institutions up 
for sale 
the resolution funding corp refcorp said wednesday it will 
raise the 5 billion next tuesday by selling 40year bonds a 
maturity 10 years longer than any current government issue 
meanwhile the resolution trust corp rtc said the sampls for 
sale are located in 16 states and have assets totaling 52 billion 
some securities analysts have been skeptical about whether 
refcorp bonds will appeal to investors the treasury last sold 
40year bonds in 1955 
but the treasury department official in charge of debt sales 
said the government believes it can save money on the interest rate 
paid on the bonds compared with 30year debt thats because of 
the lack of competition from comparable bond issues 
experts in the market are telling us we can sell 40year paper 
cheaper than we can sell 30year said michael basham deputy 
assistant secretary for federal finance obviously well find out 
pretty soon 
the longer maturity also benefits the industryowned federal 
home loan bank system which through a complex mechanism is 
providing the money to pay off the principal of the bonds 
the bank system must put up roughly 230 million to 
collateralize 5 billion borrowed for 40 years versus 500 million 
to back that amount for 30 years 
however the bank system could end up paying a greater share of 
interest costs because the money is being borrowed for 10 years 
longer early on the interest on the refcorp bonds is being paid 
primarily by the treasury but later the industry will assume a 
greater share 
all told after the latest bond sale the government will have 
borrowed 295 billion for sampl rescues with 205 billion left to 
borrow through sept 30 1991 bringing the total to 50 billion 
regulators in a letter to the house ways and means committee 
also said they need to borrow another 40 billion to 100 billion 
in short term working capital which will be repaid by selling 
assets from failed sampls 
the letter released wednesday said regulators hoped to come up 
with a plan for the additional borrowing by midfebruary the 
administration and democrats in congress have been struggling over 
whether the additional borrowing should be counted toward the 
budget deficit 
the letter outlined three ways of raising the money one 
onbudget and two outside the budget rep charles schumer dny 
a member of the banking and budget committees said the two 
offbudget plans were unrealistic he warned the onbudget plan 
could be structured to actually make it easier to meet grammrudman 
deficit reduction targets 
it is designed to manipulate the crisis in the thrift industry 
to mask the size of the deficit and cover up a glaring inability to 
achieve real reduction schumer said in a statement 
meanwhile the rtc said the latest batch of sampls offered for 
sale brings the total available to 70 institutions out of 293 in 
its portfolio each of the 43 has assets of less than 300 million 
the rtc has already sold or closed 40 institutions 
institutions in the latest offering are located in florida 
connecticut virginia mississippi georgia tennessee alabama 
arkansas kansas illinois michigan nebraska texas new mexico 
california and colorado 
in another development the office of thrift supervision said 
southmark corp the parent company of san jacinto savings 
association bellaire texas agreed to inject 210 million in 
capital into the sampl 
san jacinto is among a number of sampls including lincoln savings 
and loan association of irvine calif and silverado banking 
savings and loan association of denver that are under 
investigation for disguising losses by trading junk bonds to each 
other at inflated prices

a federal judge says the war on drugs seems 
to have gone too far with random searches of young people riding 
interstate buses 
us district judge stanley sporkin ruled wednesday that the 
searches a key part of the district of columbia police battle to 
stop drugs from coming into the city violate basic constitutional 
rights to privacy 
sporkin threw out as evidence 20 grams of cocaine and 50 packets 
of heroin police said they seized from a suspect dennis s lewis 
who was arrested in washington last october on a bus from new york 
the random indiscriminate stopping and questioning of 
individuals on interstate buses seems to have gone too far 
sporkin wrote in this anything goes war on drugs random 
knocks on doors of our citizens seeking consent to search for 
illegal drugs cannot be far away this is not america 
sporkin said he was deeply troubled by ruling so that the 
case against lewis might allow him to escape prosecution 
but he wrote we cannot become so obsessed with this drug 
scourge to permit it to dismember the constitution 
lewis was on a bus at washingtons union station when he 
consented to a patdown search by a plainclothes detective who 
found a packet of cocaine stuffed in one of lewis socks marijuana 
was found in lewis jacket pocket and heroin was found in a bag on 
the floor at lewis seat on the bus 
the detective testified at a hearing that he had no particular 
reason for questioning lewis and that sometimes ill just walk up 
to anyone who may be on the bus and ask to talk to them 
the judge said in his ruling even in our druginfested 
society it is clear that our legal system demands the existence of 
some cause before a police officer will approach a citizen to 
determine whether that individual may be engaged in some illicit 
activity

convicted killer gerald smith was executed by 
lethal injection early thursday becoming the the 121st nationwide 
since the us supreme court allowed states to restore the death 
penalty in 1976 
smith 31 of st louis who had asked that his death sentence 
be carried out was pronounced dead at 1209 by a physician said 
dick moore director of the state department of corrections 
smith had no last words and refused an opportunity to write a 
last statement prison spokesman dale riley said 
among the witnesses in the death chamber smiths wife lynn 
his courtappointed attorney c john pleban and an unidentified 
female acquaintance 
smith was given separate lethal doses of sodium pentathol 
pavulon and potassium chloride the process took about five 
minutes and smith was unconscious within minutes riley said 
after the injection smith looked at his wife who mouthed i 
love you he appeared to respond but then he closed his eyes 
smith had asked for a sedative about 830 pm and fell asleep 
about 1030 pm riley said prison officials awakened smith at 11 
pm to begin procedures for the execution 
deathpenalty opponents made a lastditch effort to save smiths 
life by filing a motion wednesday afternoon with the us supreme 
court but the court voted 72 to reject the appeal by the missouri 
capital punishment resource center in kansas city 
another group asked gov john ashcroft for a reprieve to block 
the execution but ashcroft declined his spokesman said 
it was missouris second execution since 1965 
smith met wednesday evening with his courtappointed attorney 
c john pleban said prison spokesman dale riley 
whether he had known that this appeal was going to be made i 
dont know riley said of pleban who was unavailable for 
comment smith was told the appeal had been rejected 
smith said as he ate breakfast in an isolation cell wednesday 
that he was ready for the execution riley said 
earlier pleban conceded that few if any legal angles remained 
to spare his client who has wavered in the past on his claim that 
he wanted to die 
smiths wife lynn and an unidentified woman spent several 
hours visiting him in his cell riley said 
smith was sentenced to be executed for the beating death of 
karen roberts in st louis another death sentence was imposed for 
the slaying in 1985 of a fellow deathrow inmate

ashcroft to grant smith a reprieve but the governors spokesman 
bob ferguson said his boss will not interfere with the judicial 
process

stay from associate justice harry blackmun until the us supreme 
court could review more arguments 
the nations highest court lifted the stay by a 63 vote tuesday 
and the missouri supreme court moved quickly to set the new 
execution date

miss roberts because she gave him a venereal disease 
i wanted her to feel some pain so i beat her little lousy head 
in if she were living now i would do it all over to her again 
he signed the letter gerald smith the cold blooded killer

crime wave five other people died in three other apparently

the officials said little about the killings which occurred at 
the base for the navys west coast fleet of trident submarines 
the shooting at the bremerton pawnshop about 10 miles from the

san diego and scott anthony seely 18 of north ridgeville ohio 
west of cleveland 
parker was a radioman and seely a fireman on the submarine uss 
michigan 
romano had earlier said the navy killings were not connected to 
the pawnshop shooting in which clerk julie michaels 32 was killed

handgun said bremerton police capt dennis plumb who said police 
have few leads and no suspects

hoyer 34 and steven m dorobis about 36 were killed sometime 
sunday

as protests gathered strength last fall east 
germanys longtime orthodox leader erich honecker lost touch with 
reality according to the man who succeeded him as communist 
leader only to be ousted later 
egon krenz the successor and former politburo member guenter 
schabowski on wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality 
that engulfed the hardliners toward the end 
there was the notion in the former party leadership that 
everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by 
the communist youth group was an action organized by enemy 
forces krenz told an investigating commission in east berlin 
the testimony was broadcast on east german television 
schabowski said honecker had personally ordered police attacks 
against demonstrators in early october working closely with his 
thensecret police chief erich mielke 
honecker took things into his own hands schabowski said 
all decisions and orders that led to the police actions against 
demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through 
honecker and mielke 
like krenz schabowski denied any personal responsibility for 
the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital 
the attempts at suppression were engineered by honecker and 
mielke bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling politburo 
krenz insisted 
thengeneral secretary erich honecker and the internal 
security chief erich mielke immediately after each session of the 
politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of 
the german democratic republic krenz said 
honecker and mielke are now targeted for an indictment for high 
treason 
the east berlin city government commission is probing possible 
criminal charges stemming from police brutality during the october 
attacks in the capital 
clubswinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on oct 7 
and 8 when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was in town to 
commemorate the countrys 40th anniversary the uprising was a 
turning point that speeded honeckers downfall 10 days later 
krenz who had responsibility for many internal security 
functions before honeckers ouster criticized the use of force 
during his testimony wednesday 
the excessive action of law enforcement authorities was 
neither politically nor morally justifiable he told the panel 
speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit 
krenz who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding honecker on 
oct 18 insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot 
demonstrators numerous news media accounts have said honecker 
either planned or issued such orders 
krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudging 
dissident citizens and dissident groups for years 
from todays viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was 
no general politburo discussion about the negative developments 
then taking place in society said krenz an influential 
politburo member even before honeckers fall 
krenz added that he and other thenmembers of the politburo 
failed to realize that the roman catholic and lutheran churches 
were not working against but rather for the german democratic 
republic 
honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic 
perspectives krenz said of his onetime patron who for years 
treated him like a son 
honecker has been in ill health following gallbladder surgery 
last summer he was recently operated on for a malignant kidney 
tumor 
krenzs current occupation has not been publicized following 
his fall as party chief on dec 3

the ballyhooed powers of oat bran are challenged 
by a study today concluding this faddish food fails to lower 
cholesterol after all 
the idea that oat bran lowers the level of dangerous cholesterol 
in the blood has been widely accepted in recent years some health 
experts have recommended starting the day with a bowl of oatmeal 
and oat bran has become a common ingredient in muffins cookies 
bagels even doughnuts and potato chips 
the new study found that peoples cholesterol levels indeed go 
down when they eat lots of oat bran but its only because they 
also eat less saturated fat and cholesterol than usual 
there really isnt any cholesterollowering property in oat 
bran said dr frank m sacks a coauthor of the study 
some researchers were skeptical of the findings 
there is a clear cholesterollowering effect when you use 
oatmeal or oat bran said fred shinnick a research scientist at 
quaker oats co which stresses oat brans benefits in its cereal 
ads we dont think one small study disproves the weight of the 
evidence that has been published over the past 25 years 
oat bran is promoted as a health food largely because it is rich 
in soluble fiber several studies have suggested that this kind of 
fiber somehow removes cholesterol from the body 
high amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet can 
raise blood cholesterol levels leading to heart disease but when 
people eat lots of grain products theyre too full to eat their 
usual amounts of fatty food according to the new study 
in the latest study volunteers cholesterol levels fell 
significantly both while eating lots of oat bran and while eating 
equivalent amounts of lowfiber white flour and cream of wheat but 
they also cut their intake of saturated fat and cholesterol 
they were meeting their caloric requirements and they didnt 
feel hungry said sacks if they were eating cream of wheat in 
the morning they didnt have any room for bacon and eggs if they 
had highfiber dinners they werent out eating pepperoni pizzas 
thats probably what happens in real life 
the study conducted on 20 volunteers most of them hospital 
dietitians was directed by dietitian janis f swain at brigham and 
womens hospital in boston it was published in todays new england 
journal of medicine 
the volunteers ate seemingly identical muffins meatloaf and 
casseroles for two sixweek periods during one period the foods 
contained 100 grams or 3 ounces of oat bran while during the 
other it contained that much white flour or cream of wheat 
the volunteers could eat whatever else they wanted 
on both the oat and nonoat regimens their cholesterol levels 
were about 7 percent lower than before they went on the diets 
before the diets they were eating 12 percent of their daily 
calories in the form of saturated fat this fell to 10 percent 
while on the highfiber diet and 9 percent on the lowfiber diet 
consumption of cholesterol dropped by onethird 
among the reports most widely cited in favor of oat bran was a 
study conducted by dietitian linda van horn at northwestern 
university it found that substituting oat bran for other 
carbohydrates in the diet lowered blood cholesterol levels by 3 
percent 
her study attempted to keep fat consumption constant and she 
said the latest work does not shake her conviction that oat bran 
and other forms of soluble fiber can lower cholesterol 
with their small sample size and without the dietary control 
necessary to monitor the situation i dont know what this means 
she said of the latest study 
bonny lieberman director of nutrition at the washingtonbased 
center for science in the public interest said it may take five 
more years of research to be certain if sacks assertion is true 
in the meantime she said its clear that oat bran is not the 
magic bullet that the food industry has led us to believe

nagasaki mayor hitoshi motoshima who has received 
death threats since he said the late emperor hirohito bore some 
responsibility for world war ii was shot thursday outside city 
hall a nagasaki official said 
city spokesman megumi nobeta said by telephone that the 
67yearold mayor was taken to nagasaki public hospital immediately 
after being shot at the entrance to city hall as he was about to 
get into a car 
nagasaki prefectural state police spokesman hiroharu naoe said 
a single gunman shot motoshima hitting the mayor in the left side 
of his chest then fled in a white sedan police were searching for 
him naoe said 
the japan broadcasting corp nhk said the mayor was conscious 
after being shot and it quoted ambulance and fire department 
officials as saying the bullet had not hit vital organs 
the mayor was rushed into surgery within 45 minutes after he was 
shot nhk said doctors had stopped the bleeding and had not found 
any bullets indicating the bullet had passed through his body 
motoshima has been receiving threats from ultranationalists and 
others since december 1988 when he said at a city assembly session 
that he believed hirohito then on his deathbed shares 
responsibility for the war as well as all of us who lived in that 
period 
motoshima also said hirohito could have ended world war ii 
sooner and perhaps spared nagasaki from the atomic bomb nagasaki 
was hit by an atomic bomb on aug 9 1945 three days after 
hiroshima became the first city to be hit by a nuclear weapon 
the mayors comments enraged fringe groups that reject any 
criticism of the imperial family and motoshima continued to 
receive threats even after hirohitos death one year ago 
in december a rightwing doctor 62yearold shigeru kajiyama 
was sentenced to two years in prison for threatening to kill the 
mayor testimony at his trial said he had sent three anonymous 
letters containing live bullets to the mayor 
in january 1989 a rightist was arrested after breaking into 
city hall with a knife intending to force motoshima into retracting 
his statement 
early last year rightists mobilized about 100 sound trucks to 
circle city hall and blare slogans denouncing the mayor police at 
one time had about 1200 officers deployed to prevent trouble in 
the city 
though the rightists made a great deal of noise supporters of 
the mayors position sent him a petition with some 286000 
signatures in april calling for more freedom to express opinions 
even on taboo sugjects like the late emperors war responsiblity

an international group of lawyers is planning a 
court challenge to the government screening process that determines 
which vietnamese boat people are to be forcibly repatriated a 
spokesman said today 
we think that there are cases of persons who are genuine 
refugees who have fallen through the cracks in the process and 
were mistakenly classified as illegal immigrants said david clark 
senior lecturer in political science at hong kong university 
this british colony once considered all vietnamese who arrived 
by boat to seek asylum as refugees eligible for resettlement 
overseas 
but the government facing a mounting influx of vietnamese 
decided in june 1988 to classify arriving boat people as illegal 
immigrants subject to repatriation unless they could prove they 
fled persecution in their communist homeland 
about 85 percent of the approximately 44000 boat people who 
have arrived under the new policy are expected to face forced 
repatriation the current screening process involves an interview 
with an immigration officer and gives the opportunity for one 
appeal 
so far 51 boat people have been forcibly repatriated and about 
1000 have gone back voluntarily 
the londonbased human rights organization amnesty international 
earlier this week criticized the program saying immigration 
officers often have scant knowledge of the situation in vietnam and 
that translating services need improvement 
the group of lawyers which includes members from the united 
states and britain has selected nine boat people who were screened 
out by immigration officials and had their appeals denied 
we have evidence in those cases that there were various 
defects in the process said clark he added that the vietnamese 
chosen for the case appear to have a good claim to being classified 
as refugees 
the lawyers plan to go to the colonys high court with their 
complaints in a few weeks to seek the overturn of the screening 
results said clark who has taught administrative law in hong kong 
for 11 years 
it will be a tough case to win he said the government 
will fight it tooth and nail 
if the high court rules against the challenge the lawyers 
group can take the case to the court of appeal in hong kong and 
then the privy council in london 
if that fails the group may take action against the screening 
process through the european commission of human rights 
the impetus for the legal challenge came largely from americans 
arthur helton of the lawyers committee for human rights janelle 
diller of the indochina resource action center and briton david 
burgess

a judge prepared to unseal verdicts today on 
52 counts in a molestation case at a once prestigious nursery 
school after jurors said they were deadlocked on the remaining 13 
charges 
unless jurors indicate further deliberations might break their 
deadlock superior court judge william pounders was planning to 
unseal the 52 verdicts that have already been returned by the panel 
in the nations longest and costliest criminal trial 
most likely well take the verdicts jim gilpin the bailiff 
in pounders court said wednesday after jurors sent the judge a 
note at days end announcing the deadlock 
pounders called a hearing for today to discuss the deadlock and 
possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts 
no alternate jurors remain in the case and the judge has worried 
that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial 
jurors have spent nine weeks deliberating on the molestation and 
conspiracy charges against raymond buckey 31 and his mother 
peggy mcmartin buckey 63 they are accused of molesting 11 
children during a fiveyear period at their familyowned mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach 
the trial has run nearly three years at a cost of 15 million 
if the impasse cannot be broken the judge would declare a 
mistrial on undecided counts and the prosecution would have the 
option to refile those charges at a later time 
buckey and his mother were required to stand trial after an 
18month preliminary hearing 
five female teachers who worked at the mcmartin preschool had 
charges against them dismissed among those were buckeys sister 
peggy ann and his grandmother virginia mcmartin who founded the 
now defunct nursery school 
deliberations had been bogged down since tuesday when one juror 
became ill on wednesday the talks did not begin until 1 pm 
because another jurors child was ill 
the judge who will be the first to see the jurys verdict 
forms said hes been rehearsing maintaining a deadpan expression 
by biting his tongue if necessary when he first sees the verdicts 
you will try to read the verdicts on my face he told 
lawyers but i will wind up with a bloody tongue before i show 
you what the verdicts are if theres any reaction on my face it 
will be thank god its over and weve got all the verdicts then 
you will see me beaming

a major human rights group says somalias 
government has in the past 19 months killed 50000 to 60000 
civilians many shot in their homes whom it suspected of 
supporting or sympathizing with insurgents 
somalia also has driven about a halfmillion others into exile 
said africa watch a new yorkbased group 
the group said wednesday that most of the victims were members 
of the isaak clan the army suspects the clan of supporting or 
sympathizing with the somali national movement a northern 
insurgent organization 
the movement which draws its membership mostly from the isaak 
clan is the largest in northern somalia it was formed in 1981 but 
did not begin waging allout war against the government until may 
1988 when it attacked two main cities burao and hargeisa 
there was no immediate reaction to the allegations from the 
socialist government of president mohamed siad barre alleged 
rights abuses have prompted western donors to severely cut aid to 
the horn of africa nation 
following the rebel attacks on the two provincial capitals 
africa watch said the army turned its firepower including its 
air force and artillery against the civilian population causing 
predictably high casualties 
on the claim of looking for snm fighters and weapons 
systematic housetohouse searches were carried out and thousands 
were shot in their homes africa watch said residential areas 
were targets of artillery shelling 
africa watch said it estimated the casualty toll on the basis of 
extensive interiews with refugees in neighboring djibouti and the 
united kingdom where a large somali community lives in cardiff 
wales 
robert gersony a us state department consultant conducted a 
similar study last year and conservatively estimated that at 
least 5000 unarmed civilian isaaks were purposefully murdered by 
the somali armed forces between may 1988 and march 1989 
the government has consistently denied that civilians have been 
killed deliberately saying any civilians deaths were the result of 
exceptional episodes or the unavoidable consequences of war 
africa watch said the government is taking similar harsh 
measures against civilians in central and southern somali where 
two new rebel groups the somali patriotic movement and the united 
somali congress emerged in early 1989 
but the organization acknowledged it had not been able to 
gather sufficient information based on its own research to detail 
alleged atrocities in those regions 
siad barre a major general said to be in his 80s seized power 
in a bloodless coup in october 1968 to prevent the election to the 
presidency of a civilian opposed by the army 
in recent years he has ruled a deteriorating nation beset by 
tribal rebellions in the north and south clan warfare and a 
bankrupt economy 
somalia became independent in 1960 after the unification of the 
north and south colonized by britain and italy respectively

gestures such as the release of a few political prisoners 
theres a tremendous yearning in this country to hope for the

substituting the wish for the reality

sen phil gramm is promising to get tough on 
drug thugs with a series of stiff anticrime proposals that would 
require most inmates to work and could deprive them of such prison 
amenities as airconditioning 
but an official of the american civil liberties union says the 
plan is an electionyear ploy that fails to address the causes of 
drug abuse and drug dealing and ignores such issues as education 
treatment and prevention 
every election year we see these new gettough approaches to 
the drug problem and theyre offered as though we havent gotten 
tough on the drug problem said gene guerrero a legislative 
representative for the aclu 
guerrero said drug use is actually down prisoners are serving 
longer sentences and prison populations have tripled since 1970 
the military is involved in the fight against drugs yet more 
potent drugs are more readily available at cheaper prices than ever 
gramm rtexas and house minority whip newt gingrich rga 
are proposing legislation that would declare a fiveyear national 
drug and crime emergency act to deal with the problems of our 
bleeding nation 
what i think we need to do is string some of these people 
criminals up gramm told a capitol news conference wednesday 
gramms bill would require mandatory sentences without parole 
for federal drug and violent crime convictions it also imposes 
stiff penalties for drug users allows states local governments 
and businesses to conduct random drug testing and restricts the 
courts right to limit prison overcrowding 
under gramms proposed state of emergency prisoners could be 
housed in temporary space including military bases or in tents 
while costs for building new prisons could be cut by eliminating 
such nonessentials as airconditioning

communique wednesday that the government has won its war against 
drugs traffickers and offered to dismantle their empire in 
exchange for a pardon 
they released two kidnap victims to back up the offer which was 
similar to previous proposals rejected by the government except for 
its acceptance of defeat 
also wednesday a colombian brother and sister were flown to the 
united states to face cocainetrafficking charges bringing to 13 
the number of colombians extradited to the united states since 
barco launched the crackdown in august 
in the 11point communique which was carried by one of the 
freed kidnap victims the traffickers said we accept the triumph

the drug cartels communique followed barcos comment in 
response to reporters questions tuesday night that his government 
is not inflexible regarding a negotiated settlement with drug 
lords 
previously barco ruled out talks 
but wednesday night minister of government carlos lemos 
simmonds said in a television interview that the governments 
position of not negotiating with the traffickers stands 
i dont see why we have to change our position when our own 
enemies have declared that that position has won out lemos 
simmonds told channel 7 news a nationwide program 
barco president bush and the leaders of the cocaineproducing 
countries of peru and bolivia have joined forces to fight drug 
traffickers they are expected to sign an accord to that effect at 
a drug summit in cartagena colombia on feb 15 
patricia echavarria who was kidnapped dec 16 in medellin along 
with her daughter carried the communique when the two were freed 
wednesday in medellin 
we submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of 
obtaining from the government and from society respect for our 
rights and our return to our families and communities the 
communique said 
that has been the traffickers way in the past of saying they 
want pardons and to not be extradited to the united states 
we have decided to suspend the shipment of drugs and surrender 
the weapons explosives laboratories hostages the clandestine 
landing strips and other effects related to our activities at such 
a time as we are granted constitutional and legal guarantees it 
continued reiterating previous offers 
presumably government pardons would mean none of the 
traffickers would be prosecuted for the murders of scores of people 
in colombia including governmment officials judges journalists 
and members of security forces 
the communique said mrs echavarria and her daughter dina had 
been freed as proof of the cartels desire to make peace 
barco began his crackdown on drug dealers five months ago after 
drug lords assassinated leading presidential candidate sen carlos 
galan who demanded more action against drug trafficking by law 
barco cant run for reelection 
as part of the crackdown barco revived colombias extradition 
treaty with the united states something feared by colombian 
traffickers 
in the latest extradition diana maria caballero rangel gamber 
29 and roberto caballero rangel 32 were turned over to us 
marshals by colombian authorities the marshals service said 
the two were arrested oct 20 by colombian authorities in 
bucaramanga on trafficking charges stemming from a 1988 indictment 
in the united states 
drug traffickers have responded to the government crackdown with 
a terror campaign that has killed 209 people including 107 who 
died when a bombed jet crashed outside bogota in november 
more than 1200 people have been injured in the attacks 
in the last 45 days 85 people have been kidnapped and police 
believe most of them were abducted by the traffickers 
in the communique the traffickers offered to act as 
intermediaries to end violence by groups fighting for control of 
colombias emerald mines and to stop activities of rightwing death 
squads 
in the last four years death squads have killed more than 1000 
people suspected of being sympathizers with marxist guerrilla 
groups

among the refugees milling around the armenian 
republics office in moscow was a 49yearold music teacher her 
face swollen and blackened from a fractured jaw her broken left 
wrist and two fingers encased in plaster 
they are killing us said alisa arakelova 
along with dozens of other armenian refugees from the ethnic 
strife in the southern caucasus she had gravitated to the armenian 
mission wednesday in search of help 
armenian media say some 1500 refugees from azerbaijan are 
arriving daily in yerevan capital of the bordering republic of 
armenia 
in all more than 7000 armenians have been evacuated from the 
azerbaijani capital of baku the reports say 
no matter what arakelova said she will never go back to baku 
authorities say dozens of people have been killed since 
antiarmenian riots in the city saturday night touched off 
armenianazerbaijani battles in the hills around the disputed 
territory of nagornokarabakh 
most of the victims have been armenians attacked by mobs in 
baku 
arakelova fled for moscow days before the outbreak but not 
before falling victim to an ethnically motivated attack 
she said some azerbaijani men broke into her apartment a week 
ago and they began beating me with everything they could find 
including a brick and a heavy wooden pole 
she fled that night and along with her two children and 
mother left her hometown a few days later not even stopping to 
find the identity papers she must produce to check into a soviet 
hotel they took all my property and there is somebody living in 
my apartment already she said 
she said the police had lost control of the city and advised 
them to leave 
armenian refugees gathered at the armenian mission traded 
horrendous stories of atrocities but none claimed to be direct 
witnesses 
the official tass news agency reported that people were set on 
fire in baku and a russian resident said she saw women dangled and 
dropped from balconies 
many of the armenians vilified soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev blaming him for failing to halt the violence that has 
torn the two southern republics for nearly two years 
they yelled that gorbachev was an oppressor and a poor learner 
who had yet to understand the blooy history of the caucasus 
the refugees at the mission and government newspaper izvestia 
said much of the violence in baku involves azerbaijani refugees 
from armenia forcing armenians from their apartments so they will 
have a place to live 
izvestia said tens of thousands of azerbaijanis who fled ethnic 
violence in armenia in late 1988 remain without homes or jobs in 
baku 
there have been no reports of new waves of azerbaijani refugees 
the armenians in the moscow mission did not seem to be getting 
any help there were no officials in sight and many simply left 
after doing no more than exchanging their bitterness with others in 
the same plight

a us supreme court ruling that 
california can tax religious items sold by jimmy swaggart 
ministries could lead to selective taxation of unpopular religious 
groups the evangelist said 
now it is clear that all taxes including income taxes put on 
business can now be put on churches swaggart said now we have 
the real threat of intrusion of government into the religious 
ministry of churches and synagogues 
wednesdays unanimous ruling upheld lower court rulings that 
california could collect 183000 in back taxes on books records 
tapes and other items produced and sold by the baton rougebased 
ministry between 1974 and 1981 
mailorder sales from swaggarts louisiana base to california 
consumers during those years totaled 17 million sales of 
merchandise at california crusades totaled 240000 
the evangelist did not challenge californias taxing of 
tshirts mugs bowls and crownofthorns replicas sold by his 
ministry during the period 
his challenge of the california tax had been supported by an 
array of religious groups including hare krishnas and mainline 
protestants 
lawyers for the national council of churches representing most 
protestant denominations called the california tax a serious 
threat a tax on the dissemination of religious messages and 
thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion 
swaggart whose ministry was damaged by a 1987 scandal arising 
from his alleged dalliances with a new orleans prostitute said the 
courts decision could have ominous consequences 
unpopular religions small religions that dont please one 
particular state government could conceivably be taxed out of 
business because many churches derive a great part of their incomes 
from the sale of tapes records bibles et cetera he said 
most states tax the proceeds of at least some mail order sales 
to their residents but california and virginia appear to be the 
only states that do not exempt religious organizations 
other states searching for additional tax revenues now could 
follow californias lead 
the supreme court said the california taxes do not violate 
religious freedom 
californias nondiscriminatory sales and use tax law 
imposes no constitutionally significant burden on swaggarts 
religious practices or beliefs justice sandra day oconnor wrote 
for the court 
swaggarts lawyers had relied on a 1943 high court ruling that 
overturned the convictions of jehovahs witnesses who violated a 
city ordinance requiring all people engaged in doortodoor 
canvassing to get licenses and pay fees 
but wednesdays decision drew a distinction between those fees 
and the california tax 
our concern in the 1943 ruling that a flat license tax would 
act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is 
simply not present where a tax applies to all sales and uses of 
tangible personal property in the state oconnor wrote

a kinder gentler geraldo 
perish the thought say producers of the troubled daytime 
television talk show who nonetheless are trying to veer away from 
such topics as battered lesbian lovers and topless doughnut shops 
this is a return to my roots geraldo rivera said wednesday 
at the national association of television program executives 
convention where he and his producers are gamely making the best 
of the worst thing to hit geraldo since a skinheads chair in 1988 
the show straining for more viewers during the november 1989 
ratings period when it went up against the oprah winfrey show 
in 125 markets went a little wild said executive producer 
martin m berman 
they also irritated a number of big important sponsors which 
irritated a number of big important tv stations eliciting what 
berman called station concerns advertiser concerns 
the producers reacted quickly to the criticism and commissioned 
surveys of stations advertisers and viewers 
they did not want to see a less provocative show they did not 
want to see a kinder gentler geraldo berman said but at 
the same they didnt want to see geraldo doing the kind of subjects 
that they believed were not subjects that geraldo was comfortable 
with 
and geraldo said well theyre right im not comfortable 
with this its not what i want to do its not the legacy i want 
to leave 
the finetuning began around thanksgiving berman said and for 
the past seven weeks there has been no decrease in the ratings 
the fact is that for the last seven weeks weve done no shows 
that would fit into that exploitive sensational category he 
said 
next week the show will announce the formation of an 
investigative unit to do some serious investigative stuff as part 
of the mix 
were not changing were just shifting the profile of our 
repertoire away from the bottom end of it he said 
berman said geraldo would leave the convention with 
virtually its full lineup of stations and has struck deals with 
some stations to use the show through september 1993 
ads for the show promise that in 1990 youll experience a 
better balance of personal and public topics and information a 
wider range of important issues in the social moral and political 
arenas more responsiveness to local stations and a more sensitive 
more concerned more humanitarian geraldo 
the show has its work cut out for it said john rohr a senior 
marketing executive for blair television which is the sales 
representative for about 145 tv stations 
geraldo probably will be renewed for next fall but the 
preponderance of time periods he will get will be morning time 
periods rohr said 
morning is a lot less expensive in terms of the licensing fees 
that tv stations pay for their programs conversely its a lot 
less lucrative for the program than say early fringe time 4 
to 6 pm est when there are many more viewers at the tube and 
advertisers pay more to run their commercials 
even if he doesnt change he is less of a liability than he 
is in the afternoon rohr said 
rivera says hes enjoying the finetuning of his show 
for better or worse ive been singing the same words for 20 
years rivera said this is a return to my roots i want to go 
back to busting crooked doctors

consecutive trading days the market started turning up on 
wednesday only to start down again on a rumor that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev would resign 
the market has been very sensitive to rumors lately partly 
because it is pessimistic and lacking energy said tadahiro 
makita a dealer with yamaichi securities co 
rumors about gorbachev affect shares in companies thought likely 
to profit from increased trade with reforming east bloc countries

discouraging the stock market and the price of bond futures was 
down 087 today to 9642 bringing the yield as high as 685 
percent the highest level in five years

players spread a rumor that petroleum supplies from saudi arabia 
would decline said naozumi tsusumi a trader with daiwa bank 
somebody spread the rumor to move the market because it was 
inactive due to a lack of fresh marketaffecting news he said

wednesday in washington did not help the yen recover he said 
the us commerce department reported the nations trade deficit 
in november rose to 1050 billion from a revised 1025 billion in 
october some economists had predicted a deficit of around 94 
billion 
the bank of japan sold an estimated 200 million to check the 
dollars rise the central bank does not comment on its exchange

efforts to reshape south koreas 
factionridden politics took a new turn today when president roh 
taewoos governing party indicated it would dissolve itself to 
form a new grand conservative party 
the move by the governing democratic justice party coupled with 
strenuous efforts by the two centrist opposition parties to merge 
made the countrys political picture complex 
we will actively respond to moves by the two opposition 
parties to merge said the governing partys secretary general 
park junbyung 
another democratic justice official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it is possible that we would consider forming a 
new pannational centrist party representing all democratic 
groups 
if the new conservative party is formed the governing party 
could be folded and its leader roh would give up party membership 
and stay neutral the same official said 
kim youngsam head of the no 2 opposition group said today 
that he would firm up plans next month to merge his reunification 
democratic party with the no 3 opposition group the new 
democratic republican party led by former premier kim jongpil 
the two opposition leaders earlier agreed in principle to merge 
their parties possibly before local elections scheduled in the 
first half of this year 
it would not be a simple merger of two parties the new party 
to be born would be a central force comprising all conservative 
groups kim youngsam told reporters 
kim said his ultimate goal is to make the present fourparty 
system into a bipartisan setup 
if the two parties merge it would become the largest opposition 
group replacing kim daejungs party for peace and democracy 
the emergence of a centrist opposition party would be welcome 
news for the governing party which has been trying to isolate and 
discredit kim daejungs liberal proreform party 
kim daejung holding a news conference today vehemently 
opposed the planned merger by his opposition rivals contending an 
artificial restructuring of the present fourparty system would 
only benefit rohs governing party 
he said the government camp would try to use the planned 
opposition merger to seek a conservative alliance through which it 
would try to remain in power beyond 1993 when roh steps down at 
the end of a single fiveyear term 
many politicians believe the government camp also favors a 
political realignment that would enable it to hold onto power as 
japans governing liberal democratic party does 
if its plan to merge or seek alliance with opposition moderates 
is successful the government camp assured of enough votes in the 
assembly would propose a constitutional amendemnt to change the 
present presidential system into a cabinet setup headed by a prime 
minister they said 
the governing party with 127 seats in the assembly is 
currently far short of a twothird majority required for a 
constitutional amendment 
south koreas politics are currently controlled by four main 
parties neither of which has a controling majority in the 
299member national assembly the three main opposition parties 
have a combined majority in the single house but intense rivalry 
makes it difficult for them to cooperate 
at his news conference kim daejung said he would try to rally 
support from centrist democratic forces to counter moves by his 
rivals to merge or seek alliance however his proposal lacked 
details 
he also reiterated that his party would if the government 
endorses the plan send delegates to communist north korea in the 
first half of this year to discuss national unification 
if the dispatch of the party delegation is proven successful 
kim said he would visit pyongyang with government approval to meet 
with north korean leader kim il sung 
he said president roh responded favorably when he raised the 
issue last week but presidential and government officials said the 
opposition plan to send delegates to the north was premature

boston university president john silbers entry 
into the massachusetts governors race is only the latest in a 
lifetime of audacious acts 
the 63yearold transplanted texan who voted for presidents 
reagan and bush and has described himself as elitist and populist 
announced wednesday that he will seek the democratic gubernatorial 
nomination 
he said he can turn the crumbling massachusetts economy around 
with a little oldfashioned grit and conservatism 
in recent years i have become increasingly dissatisfied with 
the direction of the democratic party he said it has become 
increasingly a party of very narrow special interests and 
singleissue politics 
the governorship became a wideopen race a year ago when michael 
s dukakis announced he would not seek another term when his third 
term expires at the end of 1990 
silber joins three others seeking the democratic nomination lt 
gov evelyn murphy former state attorney general francis bellotti 
and state house taxation committee chairman john flood 
former federal prosecutor william weld state house minority 
leader steven pierce former us rep paul cronin and former 
metropolitan district commissioner guy carbone are among those 
seeking the republican nomination 
silber a man with no previous political experience relishes 
change but his way 
he can count among his admirers henry kissinger who served with 
him on the national bipartisan commission on central america 
kissinger said of silber last year when he first started my 
only question was if i killed him would it be considered murder or 
justifiable homicide he is very fierce in his convictions he 
takes no prisoners i swore id kill him and then as the weeks 
went by i grew extremely fond of him 
silber has long defied the pigeonholers 
he said that at the age of 10 he defended fdr to his father but 
he also is fiercely anticommunist and favors us intervention 
abroad 
his views have been consistently archconservative on almost 
every single issue arnold offner a bu historian said recently 
of silber with whom he has had differences his views are much 
more congenial with the reagan part of the world than the 
democratic party on foreign policy 
silbers 95yearold mother who joined him at wednesdays 
announcement was a schoolteacher his father an architect who had 
emmigrated from germany 
they raised their son as a christian when silber went to the 
university of bonn on a fulbright scholarship and after his father 
had died he discovered his father was jewish and a sister of his 
fathers had died at auschwitz 
silber the father of seven children was 44 when he took over 
boston university 19 years ago after being fired as dean of the 
college of arts and sciences at the university of texas at austin 
he steadily transformed an academically uneven school burdened 
by a projected deficit of 88 million into one of the countrys 
more respected private institutions 
last year the 26000student school across the charles river 
from mit and harvard boasted revenues of 4648 million an 
endowment of 183 million and a budget approaching 500 million 
silber did much of it through hard work his office is open from 
8 am to 8 pm with a staff that works in shifts to keep up with 
his 80hour to 100hour workweek 
silber has appointed nearly 90 percent of the current faculty 
he has been faithful to those he has supported he is disdainful of 
professors he believes are incompetent or lazy and openly refers 
to them as thirdraters 
he was 5 years old before realizing his right arm was withered 
he has said soon enough he also discovered the hard bone of the 
stub was useful in boyhood fights 
he is an active kant scholar a frequent public speaker and the 
author of a book published last year that is characteristically 
bold 
its title straight shooting whats wrong with america and 
how to fix it

moves down well 
west who still dresses up as batman for public appearances 
sought 900000 in damages for invasion of privacy unfair 
competition and unauthorized use of an endorsement

west would whirl to go to the bat poles

massachusettsbased discount store chain

agencies involved in the commercial had paid dc comics for the 
right to use the likeness of the batman character

a videotape showing a young man 
writhing in pain after being shot three times in the chest is a key 
piece of evidence against a man charged with two murders and the 
attempted slaying of his wife 
konstantinos fotopoulos 30 is charged with hiring two men to 
kill his wife lisa 29 the daughter of a wealthy greek immigrant 
court records show six mostly bungled attempts to kill her over 
five days 
mrs fotopoulos suffered a gunshot wound to the head in the 
final attempt on nov 4 but says she has recovered 
bryan chase the man allegedly hired to kill mrs fotopoulos for 
5000 is dead shot by fotopoulos who told police chase was 
burglarizing his home and had shot his wife 
fotopoulos now is charged with the murder of chase of plotting 
his wifes killing and in the killing of 19yearold mark kevin 
ramsey whose death was captured on videotape 
also charged is deidre michelle hunt who told authorities that 
she killed ramsey while fotopoulos videotaped the slaying 
all involved in the case are barred from discussing it because 
of a gag order imposed by a judge who became incensed when he 
learned of reenactments of parts of the case on the syndicated 
television shows a current affair and inside edition 
but search warrants police affidavits and arrest reports 
unsealed tuesday help complete a portrait of fotopoulos 
daytona beach police lt charles evens described the 57second 
videotape of ramseys grisly killing in one of the court documents 
the camera then pans to the face of kevin ramsey and then back 
to deidre she says ready the male voice says ok with that 
deidre draws the gun from her right side aims at the chest of 
kevin ramsey and fires three times into the chest kevin grunts 
with pain and says god he then says ahhhh and lifts his left 
leg in pain with that deidre walks to him grabs his hair raises 
his head up and puts the gun to his left temple area and fires once 
more kevin falls forward and is silent his hands can be seen tied 
behind him with rope video ends 
the male voice was identified as fotopoulos who evens said shot 
ramsey in the head with a rifle 
ramsey was an employee of fotopoulos but the unsealed court 
documents give no motive for his killing 
an indictment alleges that fotopoulos hired chase 18 to break 
into his house and kill his wife then thinking his wife had been 
shot to death fotopoulos allegedly killed chase to silence him 
police initially thought fotopoulos was a husband protecting his 
home and wife 
but detectives noticed that chase had entered the house through 
one of the few windows not hooked to an alarm system had walked 
past bedrooms occupied by mrs fotopoulos mother and brother 
ignored expensive stereo equipment and other property and had gone 
straight to the couples bedroom where he shot mrs fotopoulos 
the indictment says ms hunt 20 worked for fotopoulos at top 
shots a billiard hall he owned on daytona beachs boardwalk 
arranged for the hiring of chase and served as the contact between 
fotopoulos and the hit men 
she and fotopoulos are charged with firstdegree murder in the 
deaths of ramsey and chase conspiracy to commit murder in planning 
the death of mrs fotopoulos ramsey and chase attempted 
firstdegree murder and solicitation to commit murder

a federal jury has awarded 244 million to 
the citys first female homicide detective and the four officers 
who supported her sexdiscrimination complaint 
carol keenan 38 alleged she was the victim of a pattern of 
discrimination and her colleagues argued they were transferred out 
of the homicide unit merely because they supported her 
after two months of testimony the us district court jury 
wednesday awarded the five officers 640000 in compensatory 
damages and 18 million in punitive damages 
the largest part went to keenan now a detective in south 
philadelphia the jury awarded her 220000 in compensatory damages 
and 600000 in punitive damages 
keenan who joined the police force in 1976 predicted the 
verdict will help other women in the department 
the next woman who makes this kind of complaint wont be 
ignored theyll listen she said 
keenan contended throughout the trial that she repeatedly tried 
to resolve the problem informally but officials refused to take 
her complaints seriously 
she filed the lawsuit in 1988 saying she was subjected to 
unusual scrutiny by robert grasso after he became commander of 
homicide she also alleged discrimination led to her transfer from 
the unit in 1987 
she was joined in the lawsuit by lawrence gerrard walter smith 
ernest gilbert and daniel rosenstein 
the city planned to appeal 
the verdict is totally out of proportion to justice law and 
reality and will be appealed from now to infinity said deputy 
city solicitor richard g freeman 
jurors said they hoped their decision sends a message to the 
city 
i would say there was simply little if any defense said 
jury foreman thomas gilbert 
juror harry wilson jr said he hoped the verdict showed city 
police officials that they have to be fair in their treatment of 
all their employees flat and simple

convicted killer gerald smith who had said 
he wanted to die was executed by lethal injection early today 
becoming the second missouri prisoner put to death in a 
quartercentury 
smith 31 of st louis was pronounced dead at 1209 am said 
dick moore director of the missouri department of corrections 
smith was executed for the 1980 beating death of karen roberts 
his former girlfriend in st louis in a letter to a newspaper 
smith said he murdered ms roberts because he believed she gave him 
a venereal disease 
smiths wife lynn watched the execution along with 
courtappointed defense attorney c john pleban 
as the first lethal drug was administerred mrs smith raised 
her left hand and made a v sign she mouthed i love you 
smith became the 121st prisoner executed since the us supreme 
court allowed states to resume carryuing out the death penalty in 
1976 
deathpenalty opponents made a lastditch effort to save smiths 
life by filing a motion wednesday afternoon with the us supreme 
court but the court voted 72 to reject the appeal by the missouri 
capital punishment resource center in kansas city 
smith came close to execution several times before but stays 
were issued as he changed his mind about whether he wanted to die 
last week associate justice harry blackmun stayed an execution 
for smith that was scheduled last thursday to allow the court to 
consider motions by pleban 
but the full court lifted that stay on tuesday and the missouri 
supreme court acted swiftly to schedule the execution 
smith also was under a death sentence for the 1985 slaying of 
fellow deathrow inmate robert baker 
opponents of capital punishment gathered for prayer services at 
churches in st louis and jefferson city 
gov john ashcroft was asked to reprieve smith on wednesday by 
the missouri coalition against the death penalty the governors 
spokesman bob ferguson said ashcroft would not interfere with the 
judicial process

milam ungers basketball coach he was a wellrounded student

to be like him 
unger was one of 29 people killed in the nations capital so far 
in 1990 including a woman whose body bearing multiple stab 
wounds was found in a parking lot early today that rate is ahead

we have seen great progress where it counts in the streets 
where record amounts of cocaine have been seized yet we have

president bush hailed the superb 
job of columbias astronauts today as they headed for fridays 
homecoming after taking control of their ship when a bad navigation 
signal from the ground sent it into a slow spin 
in a radiophone call from the white house the president termed 
their rescue of a huge science satellite a very exciting grab 
and he invited the five crew members to meet with him at the white 
house after the mission 
commander dan brandenstein said the retrieval of the satellite 
was a highlight among several important accomplishments of the 
space journey 
well done were proud of you bush said 
the president also mentioned the erratic spin imparted to 
columbia by the faulty signal when he said im calling to 
congratulate you and the crew after all those somersaults for 
doing this superb job up there 
brandenstein had been roused from sleep during the night to 
manually override the shuttles navigation system he stabilized 
the craft until mission control transmitted correct guidance 
signals 
there was no danger to the five astronauts but we had a 
little excitement tonight said flight director bob castle 
after analyzing data controllers reported that columbia had 
made four rotations in yaw sidetoside one rotation in pitch 
upanddown of the nose and tail and threefourths of a rotation 
in roll 
at times they said all movements were taking place 
simultaneously each rotation took two minutes too slow for the 
astronauts to sense while asleep 
another flight director lee briscoe said it appeared that a 
couple of words got dropped in the navigation program so the 
vehicle thought it was around the center of the earth instead of 
repeatedly passing back and forth across the equator at a 28degree 
angle 
the incident happened wednesday night about 2 hours before 
their scheduled wakeup a false fire alarm also got them out of 
their beds wednesday 
a third wakeup at the planned time was music to their ears a 
rendition of washington and lee universitys fight song one of the 
astronauts david low is a graduate of the school 
good morning columbia after what must have been a restful 
or restless night the control center radioed 
brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee successfully tested 
columbias flight control systems to make sure they were in good 
shape for returning home during the 10day mission the astronauts 
have deployed a navy communications satellite and retrieved an 
11ton science laboratory that had orbited for six years 
snow was falling this morning at the landing site at edwards air 
force base calif and about an inch had covered the desert before 
dawn 
briscoe said forecasters were watching the weather closely but 
it still looks good for tomorrow the predawn landing is 
scheduled at 254 am pst 
recent heavy rains have closed the public viewing area and the 
space agency discouraged citizens from driving to the base to watch 
the touchdown 
while brandenstein and wetherbee checked the shuttles systems 
mission specialists bonnie dunbar marsha ivins and low completed a 
series of medical and science experiments and began stowing them 
away 
castle said columbia began its slow spin after an errant 
navigation signal from the ground caused six small steering jets in 
the shuttles nose to fire on and off the longest for two minutes 
that sent the shuttle into an unwanted spin of about 3 degrees a 
second or about one rotation every two minutes castle said 
he said the navigation data had suffered radio interference 
during the transmission but that an operator on the ground failed 
to catch it 
castle said that if nothing had been done columbia would have 
continued to rotate at that rate but there would be no threat to 
the astronauts 
im concerned about what happened because we have to find out 
what happened and correct it castle said but im not real 
concerned it was an error on the ground columbia did exactly what 
columbia should have done 
nasa spokesman jack kroehnke said the astronauts would not have 
felt the spin imparted by the six thrusters part of a system of 44 
steering jets on the shuttle 
if we had not awakened the crew theyd eventually have 
awakened themselves im sure and looked out to see the earth view 
changing in the windows kroehnke said

older couples who drink coffee appear to 
be more sexually active than elderly noncoffee drinkers according 
to a new study 
in response to a survey 62 percent of married women 60 and 
older who drank coffee said they were sexually active forty 
percent of women older than 60 who do not drink coffee said they 
were active 
among married men the same ages 36 percent of coffee drinkers 
said they sometimes were impotent compared with 59 percent of 
those who dont drink coffee 
the study in the january issue of the archives of internal 
medicine did not give a margin of error or date for the survey of 
744 michigan residents done by dr ananias diokno of william 
beaumont hospital in the detroit suburb of royal oak 
diokno attempting to explain the results said coffee 
stimulates the central nervous system and relaxes certain muscles 
but he said it also was possible that people who drink coffee also 
happen to be more liberal in their sexual behavior 
we want to pursue this and find out why there is this 
connection between sex and coffee he said 
the study team did not ask participants whether they drank 
regular or decaffeinated coffee or how much they drank diokno said 
some researchers were skeptical of the findings 
oh lord help us now theyve linked coffee and sex said 
gail kershner riggs associate director of restorative medicine at 
the university of arizonas college of medicine who has done her 
own research on sex among elderly women 
dr diokno is a respected researcher said dr tom stanisic 
a professor of surgery and urology at the university of arizona 
college of medicine in tucson but before anyone starts drinking 
coffee to boost their sex life it would be wise if other people 
looked into this a little more 
its not something i would act on immediately 
coffee and caffeine are popular research topics more than 500 
studies on their effects have been published in medical journals 
since 1983 some studies have linked coffee to heart disease high 
cholesterol levels and pancreatic cancer while others found no 
such relationship 
dioknos survey also found that about 75 percent of married 
elderly men and 56 percent of married elderly women remain sexually 
active compared with 31 percent of unmarried elderly men and 5 
percent of unmarried elderly women

a woman whose 4monthold son has a rare 
bone disease is suing the childs father to force him to donate 
bone marrow to save the boys life 
the boy has osteopetrosis which affects bone growth the 
lawsuit filed wednesday in roanoke circuit court says the boy is 
expected to live six to 12 months if he does not receive a bone 
marrow transplant 
sue argabright asked the court to force sanford andrew moore to 
undergo tests to determine if can donate bone marrow to the 
couples son andy 
the lawsuit argues that andys biological father has a duty 
and obligation to undergo minimally intrusive tests and if 
eligible to donate bone marrow to his son 
john fletcher director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of virginia said forcing the father to donate bone 
marrow would set a bad precedent 
once you start to compromise donation by using force then you 
have opened the door for a lot of other things including selling 
organs said fletcher 
the tradition in the united states for organ donation 
including donation between relatives is that it is a gift of 
life said fletcher 
university of virginia officials said they are searching bone 
marrow registries to find potential donors 
the lawsuit says a biological parent is much more likely to be a 
suitable bone marrow donor than a stranger however ms argabright 
was tested and was found to be an unsuitable donor the lawsuit 
said 
ms argabright issued a public appeal for donations earlier this 
week saying she could not afford to pay for the transplant which 
doctors have told her could cost as much as 180000 
she said she gets no support money from moore and has no private 
health insurance it was not clear if ms argabright and moore have 
ever been married 
moore could not be located for comment someone answering his 
phone wednesday said he would be out of town until friday 
most of andys medical expenses so far have been covered by 
medicaid ms argabright said but the virginia medicaid program 
does not pay for transplants for children 
osteopetrosis prevents the body from breaking down and reforming 
bone bones become increasingly brittle and deposits build up 
putting pressure on the optic and auditory nerves 
doctors say andy probably will be blind and deaf by his first 
birthday

more than two months after hardline 
communist leader todor zhivkov was ousted signs of change are few 
in his hometown a sleepy lakeside resort nestled among mountains 
northeast of sofia 
like many bulgarians people in pravec still harbor serious 
doubts that after more than 40 years of authoritarian rule the 
sweeping democratic reforms promised by zhivkovs communist 
successors will materialize in the near future skepticism appears 
to run deeper in the countryside than in the capital sofia 
on a narrow fir treelined lane zhivkovs family house one 
of over 30 luxurious residences he kept nationwide is shuttered 
up the whitewalled garden decked in snow untrodden for weeks 
hefty stone street signs that until recently bore the name of 
zhivkovs mother marutsa zhivkova have been replaced by new 
plaques dubbing the road vassil levsky after bulgarias most 
revered national hero 
in sofia tens of thousands of prodemocracy demonstrators have 
taken to the streets regularly since the former leaders overthrow 
nov 10 demanding quicker steps toward democracy from former 
foreign ministerturnedreformist leader petar mladenov 
but pravec only 19 miles away is another world 
in principle there has been no change whatsoever said velin 
ogledalov chief cook at the pagodaroofed shatra restaurant where 
zhivkov often held state dinners for visitors that included former 
romanian dictator and honorary pravec citizen nicolae ceausescu 
the bulgarians are thinking we have taken a load off our 
shoulders but there is still fear said ogledalov 
department six secret police used to be everywhere and 
theyre still there only now theyre smiling he added 
in early january the burly 34yearold set up pravecs first 
independent trade union which is campaigning for multiparty 
democracy private enterprise and freemarket economics 
he claims he is not afraid but often checks the restaurant 
dining room around him for eavesdroppers 
the old leaders are all still there only the moment they 
start falling can we begin making real changes he said 
the state news agency bta reported today that zhivkov was 
arrested and charged with malfeasance in office among other 
charges 
according to leading opposition figure petar beron zhivkovs 
family and cronies also will likely be tried but he said a 
parliamentled commission investigating abuses of power during the 
cliques 35year rule would probably stop short of unearthing 
evidence of corruption by other leading communists who are very 
much still at large 
beron said zhivkov was at his boyana residence near sofia being 
protected from the wrath of the people 
parliament on monday struck the communists guaranteed leading 
role in society from the constitution east germany czechoslovakia 
and hungary already have done so 
but for the time being the balkan country still remains at 
least constitutionally a socialist state headed by the 
working class major steps toward democracy look far away in 
bulgaria 
all our neighbor countries are ahead of us now said emil 
angelov 21 a medical student fom pravec but he said he was 
optimistic that time will take its course if we really have 
free elections the communists will lose 
opposition leaders are not so sure zhelio zhelev president of 
the opposition union of democratic forces says his group might not 
be prepared in time for the general elections mladenov has pledged 
for may 
claiming the statecontrolled media is still biased toward the 
communists zhelev has called for twostage elections with a vote 
in may to eject close zhivkov associates from parliament followed 
by a full election in november 
people feel freer and were trying for change but all weve 
had up to now is the nationalities problem said angelov 
tensions flared between bulgarian nationalists and the countrys 
estimated 15 million ethnic turks and moslems after the countrys 
new leaders on dec 29 reversed zhivkovs harsh ethnic assimilation 
policy which banned the use of turkish names and language and 
moslem religious rites 
the decision sparked protests and strikes and brought about a 
national debate that distracted attention from calls for swifter 
political reform 
some opposition figures even have accused veteran local party 
officials of inciting hatred among the nationalists in an attempt 
to cling to power 
it basically put our struggle for more democracy on ice and i 
cant see the process speeding up that much in the near future 
said zhelev 
both ogledalov and angelov said the tensions have been used to 
postpone painful decisions on bulgarias real problems its 
oneparty system and its tattered centrallyplanned economy 
in pravec a few inhabitants laugh and joke about zhivkov now 
but most are reluctant to talk about the man known familiarly as 
toshko whom ogledalov remembers as jovial and hearty with a 
good sense of humor and a good network of bodyguards 
zhivkov made pravec a socialist showpiece and its inhabitants 
were often resented for their pretty homes clean air and 
wellstocked stores rarities in many bulgarian towns 
but we werent privileged said ogledalov every month we 
had to scrub every inch of the town with our own hands before 
zhivkov arrived

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki asked 
parliament today to move up this years democratic elections for 
local governments the last bastion of communist power in poland 
the radical economic and political reforms of the east blocs 
first government led by a noncommunist are being slowed by 
resistance on the provincial and municipal level and mazowiecki 
said the voting should be held in april 
the elections had been expected in june or november but 
solidarity leader lech walesa on monday urged earlier balloting 
saying reforms were not being carried out quickly enough 
the governments most important task next to leading the 
nation out of economic collapse is the building of a strong and 
stable democratic foundation for a democratic system mazowiecki 
told the sejm the lower house of parliament 
until we create a real selfgovernment we will not defeat 
the resistance that we meet while introducing reforms he said 
the lawmakers showed their approval of mazowieckis views with a 
standing ovation 
gen wojciech jaruzelski the communist president looked on 
from a gallery during mazowieckis 40minute speech jaruzelski 
agrees with the new election timetable the prosolidrity gazeta 
wyborcza newspaper reported wednesday 
noncommunist candidates are expected to do well in the local 
and provincial elections 
solidarity candidates won an overwhelming victory in the 
partially free parliament elections in june 1989 leading to 
creation of the solidaritydominated government that ended four 
decades of communist control of poland 
on jan 1 the government began implementing reforms to create a 
marketoriented economy and curb inflation 
mazowiecki praised poland as a leader of east bloc reform and 
a stabile point on the european map 
our society accepting with dignity and calmness the 
difficulties connected with the repairing of the economy arouses 
respect in many countries he said 
the course of our reform is giving stimulation to the changes 
in other countries of the region the failure of our efforts could 
make more difficult the evolution occurring in central and eastern 
europe he said 
east germany hungary czechoslovkia bulgaria and romania also 
are carrying out political reforms following popular uprisings of 
their own 
mazowiecki is to visit czechoslovakia next week and he urged 
closer alliance with the new prague government in close 
cooperation our significance in europe could be greater he said 
polands economic reforms include a tight wage policy as part of 
the attack on inflation prices are soaring however because they 
are no longer controlled by the government or kept artificially low 
by budget subsidies 
finance ministry officials say it will take at least six months 
for prices to stabilize and that the interim period will be 
difficult for workers 
more than 6000 miners demanding higher pay struck for a third 
day today at five mines in southern poland the official pap news 
agency reported 
the strikes are the first significant labor protest since the 
government began implementing the reforms 
none of the mines currently on strike participated in the august 
1988 protests that pushed then former communist government to begin 
talks on political reform with the solidarityled opposition 
the solidarity trade union will open a sixday national congress 
on april 19 its first since before the 1981 martial law crackdown 
debate over the governments economic policy and possibly even 
walesas leadership can be expected during the congress to be held 
in gdansk where the union was born during an august 1980 lenin 
shipyard strike 
the communist party which is struggling to maintain a role in 
poland will open a congress jan 27 and is expected to vote to 
form a new party based on the social democratic model with a new 
name and a redefined program

east germanys top opposition group met with 
government officials today for the first time since demonstrators 
stormed secret police headquarters and said the nations revolution 
must remain peaceful 
the negotiators backed a resolution calling for all guns 
grenades and other weapons belonging to the secret police to be 
turned over to the interior ministry by jan 31 
they also proposed that the government nullify former communist 
party chief egon krenzs oath of secrecy thus requiring him to 
give a complete account of secret police functions when he appears 
before the next session of talks monday 
krenz cited the oath during earlier testimony before a 
commission investigating police brutality during demonstrations in 
october in east berlin 
at the start of todays session the eighth between opposition 
groups and the government new forum issued a statement repeating 
the organizations insistence on a peaceful revolution 
the government blamed new forum the largest opposition 
organization for the rampage monday of secret police headquarters 
in east berlin new forum organized the protest outside the 
building but said it was to be peaceful and it denied 
responsibility for the rampage 
even one hour of property damage is too much it said 
new forum demanded to know who had opened the door to the 
complex to allow protesters inside many east germans have said 
they suspect government infiltrators instigated the rampage to 
weaken the opposition before elections may 6 
the 16 opposition groups political parties and the communists 
represented at the negotiations joined in a call for protesters to 
reject any violence in future protests 
the demonstration monday was to oppose the stasi or secret 
police who under former hardline leaders used strongarm methods 
to suppress dissent premier hans modrow has promised the secret 
police agency will be completely dismantled by june 
krenz who resigned in early december on wednesday faced a 
commission of the east berlin city government that is investigating 
police violence during massive street protests oct 6 and 7 
the protests coincided with the visit of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and were a turning point that led to the 
ouster of hardline leader erich honecker 10 days later 
krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for falsely 
estimating dissident citizens and dissident groups for years 
from todays viewpoint that is incomprehensible said 
krenz who succeeded honecker and was himself ousted six weeks 
later 
krenz whose appearance before the commission was broadcast on 
east german television also said that the former ruling politburo 
had failed to consider negative developments in society 
beginning last summer tens of thousands of east germans began 
to flee the country while at the same time pressure built from 
those staying at home 
another former politburo member guenter schabowski told the 
commission that honecker working closely with then secret police 
chief erich mielke had personally ordered the attacks on the 
protesters 
honecker took things into his own hands schabowski told the 
panel 
the panel members are investigating possible criminal charges 
against the ousted leaders honecker and mielke are targeted for an 
indictment for high treason no formal criminal investigation of 
krenz has been announced

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev faces an 
unstable situation in his country but he will likely remain in 
power because few of his colleagues have an alternative program 
says veteran diplomat george f kennan 
kennan 86 said economic difficulties in the soviet union along 
with ethnic unheaval have created a situation of great difficulty 
and danger for gorbachev who is viewed as personally responsible 
for all these crises and difficulties 
kennan a former ambassador to the soviet union and a professor 
emeritus at the institute for advanced studies at princeton nj 
made his comments wednesday in an appearance before the senate 
foreign relations committee 
so great are gorbachevs problems that it is unlikely he could 
have remained in office for so long had he not attained such 
international prestige an important asset for the soviet union 
kennan said 
moreover kennan said none of gorbachevs senior colleagues has 
any program to offer as an alternative to the one he has created 
and carried forward 
kennan said it is in the interests of the united states to see 
that gorbachev stays in power as he moves to ease cold war tensions 
to that end washington should consider suspending trade 
restrictions such as the jacksonvanik amendment that denies most 
favored nation trade status and export credits to the soviet union 
and most other communist nations that restricted the right of their 
citizens to emigrate he said 
on a related issue the washington post reported that president 
bush plans to lift the jacksonvanik restrictions from 
czechoslovakia 
kennan also said the united states could take a more 
forthcoming attitude on negotiations to reduce conventional arms 
in europe and should consult regularly with moscow about questions 
arising from the momentous changes in eastern europe

hungary today stepped up its demand for a 
quick withdrawal of soviet troops from its soil and made a surprise 
proposal for sharp cuts in all foreign troops stationed in europe 
ferenc somogyi state secretary of the hungarian foreign 
ministry made the proposals as part of eastwest talks on reducing 
conventional armed forces in europe 
his plan goes well beyond the manpower limits suggested by 
president bush in the negotiations between the 16 nations of the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the seven countries of the 
warsaw pact 
hungary has previously called for the kremlin to remove its 
troops but somogyi modified the demand by saying his nation wanted 
the soldiers out this year or next year at the latest 
there are no reasons be it of political military security or 
armscontrol character that would justify the stationing of foreign 
troops on the territory of hungary he told a news conference 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth recently met with soviet premier 
nikolai ryzhkov to arrange talks on the issue 
nemeth had stressed that withdrawal depended on an agreement at 
the vienna talks on cutting conventional or nonnuclear forces in 
europe 
czechoslovakia also wants all soviet soldiers out this year 
about 10000 soviet troops already have left hungary and 
czechoslovakia under the phased withdrawal of 50000 men from 
eastern europe soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced 
that withdrawal in december 1988 
an additional 6000 of the 52000 soviet troops said to remain 
in hungary are due to leave this year and an undisclosed number 
are scheduled to leave czechoslovakia where officials say there 
are 70000 soviet forces 
somogyi told reporters that his proposal for eastwest troop 
cuts does not set a ceiling on the number of foreign soldiers that 
could be stationed in another country in europe 
but he said the overall foreign troop deployment in europe 
should be much lower than bushs proposal calling for the united 
states and the soviet union to pare their forces in europe to no 
more than 275000 each 
to meet the bush proposal the soviets would have to pull out 
300000 troops and the united states 30000 
somogyi said his plan would apply to troops of all countries 
not just the superpowers the soviet union has been talking about a 
limit of 300000 to 350000 troops stationed abroad by each 
alliance 
as somogyi spoke top military officers from 35 nations met for 
a third day to discuss eastwest military strategies the 
threeweek meeting is part of negotiations designed to reduce 
military tensions in europe 
on wednesday military officers of czechoslovakia poland and 
east germany who are attending that meeting emphasized their 
governments defense concerns rather than those of the warsaw pact 
the shift reflects the political changes that have swept the 
east bloc and the emerging individuality of nations 
we proceed from the fact that our national interests are 
fundamental said gen anton slimak chief of czechoslovakias 
general staff 
gen colin powell chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
said some eastbloc governments seemed to be making unilateral 
judgments on the structure of their armed forces 
yet they continue to say they are part of an alliance so i 
think the warsaw pact alliance is shifting in its character to a 
more political institution he told a news conference 
no country gave any indication in private talks that it was 
thinking of leaving the alliance powell said

three men with alleged mob ties were charged 
with running a 335 millionayear sports betting network that used 
a nationwide tollfree number and fax machines to accept wagers 
police said 
alleged kingpin alfred mart 72 of fort lauderdale fla and 
40 other people were arrested on felony gambling charges during 
raids tuesday and over the weekend in new york city point 
pleasant nj and florida mart also was charged with 
racketeering said new york police inspector frank biehler 
biehler gave details of the case at a news conference wednesday 
where investigators displayed a duffle bag containing gambling 
records and 1 million in 100 bills investigators also seized 
700000 in cash from three safedeposit boxes and froze 300000 
in deposits at new york city banks 
the raids were timed for the heightened gambling during the 
national football league playoff games which took place last 
weekend biehler said 
marts alleged chief lieutenants in new york were identified as 
joseph yedbovnick 70 and martin mcdarby 65 both of the new york 
borough of queens they were charged with felony gambling 
all three were identified as associates with the genovese crime 
family biehler said 
we believe yedbovnick and mcdarby are bookmakers 
bookmakers they would not in our opinion accept anything that 
would be termed a small wager biehler said 
gambling records seized during the raids revealed numerous 
wagers of 25000 to 50000 and indicated the ring was doing 335 
million worth of business a year the inspector said 
he said the ring laundered money through a checkcashing service 
in florida and instructed losing bettors to wire their money in 
amounts smaller than 10000 to circumvent a federal law that 
requires information about checks over that amount 
biehler said the ring passed itself off as a legitimate business 
to obtain the tollfree number 
fax machines and wats lines and tollfree numbers are not 
unknown in a lot of forms of criminality as technology increases 
the criminals certainly take advantage of it too he said

the navy plans to mothball the battleships 
iowa and new jersey in a moneysaving move that would leave only 
two active battleships a defense department official says 
the iowa which was damaged in the april 19 explosion that 
killed 47 sailors would be repaired before being mothballed the 
official said wednesday night 
its as good as done said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but he conceded that political pressure from new york city 
where the navy had planned to base the iowa could cause another 
ship to be thrown into the pot to replace that one at that new 
base now about 70 percent complete 
it had been known previously the navy would seek to mothball two 
battleships but it was not known which two would be chosen if the 
mothball plan is carried out the navy would retain one battleship 
the wisconsin in the atlantic fleet and one in the pacific fleet 
the missouri 
figures on how much the navy expects to save by mothballing the 
ships were not immediately available 
the iowa explosion occurred when the middle 16inch gun in the 
battleships threegun no 2 turret exploded during firing practice 
in the atlantic 
the navy has said the explosion was most probably the work of a 
member of the gun crew trying to commit suicide a conclusion 
strongly opposed as unsupported by many members of congress 
meanwhile the iowas commanding officer capt fred j 
moosally on wednesday announced plans to retire after 24 years of 
navy service moosally had received a nonpunitive letter of 
caution last fall for administrative deficiencies aboard the 
ship but it was not made part of his permanent file 
moosally said of his reason for retiring theres a lot of 
things but im not going to get into specifics i thought about 
staying in that was an option 
the iowa entered the norfolk va navy yard earlier in the week 
for a 14week refit that will cost 26 million and restore the 
crippled turret to full operation 
in addition to the structural electrical and equipment repairs 
needed in the turret the navy also plans to overhaul pumps 
freshwater and saltwater piping gunfirecontrol equipment 
electronic equipment and steam fuel and water valves 
under a plan to disperse the battleships attacked by critics as 
pure porkbarrel politics the navy planned to base the iowa and 
its four or five smaller escorting frigates and destroyers at a new 
base on staten island in new york city and the new jersey at long 
beach calif 
the official gave no indication what would happen to the 
facilities lined up for the home ports commenting earlier this 
week on the possibility that the iowa would be mothballed guy 
molinari borough president of staten island who has just resigned 
as the areas republican congressman said it is my educated 
guess that we probably will not have the iowa but we will have 
a surface action group coming to staten island and it will be a 
different configuration of vessels 
current plans call for the wisconsin to be based at corpus 
christi texas and the missouris group of ships to be split 
between pearl harbor hawaii and long beach 
the new jersey and the iowa are the two older ships launched 
during world war ii in 1942 and entering service the following 
year all four ships saw action in that war served through the 
korean war years and were mothballed in the 1950s 
the four ships were brought out of mothballs starting in 1982 
despite criticisms that they would be extravagantly expensive to 
operate because of the large crews needed 65 officers and 1453 
enlisted men each 
if the new jersey which fired at targets in lebanon in 1982 is 
returned to the inactive fleet it will be for the third time the 
ship also was used and deactivated during the vietnam war 
the ships are 887 feet long and displace 58000 tons in 
addition to 16inch guns they carry tomahawk cruise missiles 
harpoon antiship missiles 12 5inch guns and four rapidfiring 
20mm antiaircraft guns for closein defense

prime minister yitzhak shamir today defended 
his statement that israel must hold onto the occupied territories 
to settle large numbers of soviet jewish immigrants 
the united states criticized the statement sunday but shamir 
said it overreacted 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc said the statement 
was in line with his belief that israel should never return the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip in exchange for peace with arab 
neighbors 
everyone knows what my positions and the positions of the 
likud are concerning the future of israel he said in an 
interview with israel radio 
a peace settlement with the arabs should not contain a 
territorial compromise shamir said the country is very small 
no new division can solve problems it will just create problems 
he said 
in a speech sunday shamir said israel needs the occupied lands 
to settle an influx of soviet jews 
us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler termed 
shamirs suggestion not helpful 
we do not think that building settlements or putting even more 
settlers in the territories promotes the cause of peace mrs 
tutwiler said in washington 
asked whether his statement provided ammunition to arab leaders 
seeking to pressure the soviet union to halt jewish emigration 
shamir said arabs oppose all immigration regardless of what has 
been said or not been said for them the immigration of soviet 
jews to israel in large numbers is a sign of defeat in their 
war against the state of israel and zionism 
moslem fundamentalists in the occupied lands today distributed 
leaflets urging palestinians to increase resistance to israeli rule 
to protest the arrival of soviet jews 
palestine is screaming said the leaflet circulated by the 
hamas or zeal movement america supports the jewish state with 
money and weapons and russia is feeding israel with people and 
experts so where are the moslems 
fewer than 100000 israelis have settled among some 17 million 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
as many as 100000 soviet jews are expected to come to israel 
this year 
jordans king hussein expressed alarm over shamirs statement in 
an interview published today 
who will these thousands of immigrants replace and what will 
happen to those who will be replaced by these new arrivals 
hussein told the jordan times newspaper 
he indicated the settlement of immigrants could lead to mass 
expulsions of palestinians to jordan which israeli extremists 
argue is already a palestinian state 
shamir today also criticized as very harmful a proposal by 
senate minority leader bob dole who said a 5 percent cut in us 
aid to big recipients such as israel would free funds to help 
fledgling democracies in eastern europe and latin america 
israel receives 3 billion a year from the united states more 
than any other country 
shamir said the dole proposal comes at a time when israel is 
seeking more aid from the united states to help in the absorption 
of soviet immigrants 
he said he did not believe the dole statement was intended to 
press israel to make concessions in middle east peace efforts the 
process is deadlocked because of israels insistence on written 
us guarantees that the plo be kept out of peace talks 
plo chief yasser arafat has threatened to resign if the 
usbrokered peace efforts fail 
in an interview published today he said the problem is a result 
of washington coddling israel and he said arabs should use oil as 
a weapon to force concessions from the united states 
arafat told the magazine almussawar he will announce his 
resignation if the peace efforts reach a dead end

harlem should be declared a health disaster 
area according to a doctor whose study found that a man in harlem 
has a worse chance of living past age 40 than one in 
povertystricken bangladesh 
we have a chronic disaster area right in front of our eyes 
that most people are not aware of said dr harold p freeman 
director of surgery at harlem hospital 
the report published in todays new england journal of medicine 
was compiled by freeman 56 and dr colin mccord 61 who worked 
in bangladesh between 1972 and 1980 and noticed after returning to 
the united states that the mortality rates were worse in harlem 
the doctors reviewed records from 1979 to 1981 and found that 
the death rate among men under 65 in harlem was the highest in new 
york and almost three times that of white us men under 65 
its a national disaster and a national disgrace said 
mccord attending surgeon at harlem hospital 
mccord said no formal study has been done through the 1980s but 
a review of records from 1980 to 1987 shows deaths continued to 
increase with the onset of aids crack homelessness and increased 
use of illegal drugs 
he said that during the sevenyear stretch deaths among those 
25 to 45 years old rose 35 percent in harlem 
the findings of the formal study based on 1979 to 1981 figures 
stem from an analysis of new yorks central harlem health district 
where 96 percent of the population is black and 41 percent live 
below the poverty line 
the researchers found that 2095 men under 65 died in harlem 
from 1979 to 1981 if the death rate in harlem had been the same as 
for white men under 65 across the united states the number of 
deaths would have been only a little more than onethird as high 
720 among all harlem residents the death rate was more than 50 
percent higher than the death rate for all us whites the 
researchers found 
to dramatize their figures the researchers compared them with 
bangladesh by age 40 the life expectancy of men in bangladesh 
begins to exceed that of harlem men in bangladesh 55 percent of 
men and 50 percent of women live to age 65 in harlem 40 percent 
of men and 65 percent of women live that long 
freeman said the fiveyear survival rate of women who learn they 
have cancer in harlem is 32 percent but it is 75 percent for white 
women elsewhere in america 
he blamed the results on lack of education poor access to 
health care substandard housing isolation alienation a tendency 
to live day to day and malnutrition 
reacting to the study a spokeman for mayor david dinkins said 
the city already financially strapped needs federal help after 
years of reduced health care during president reagans 
administration 
our hope would be in a kindler gentler world that thered be 
a greater federal involvement in financing the health system lee 
jones said

someone apparently bent on taking the 
wind out of a police crackdown on speeders has been puncturing 
tires on patrol cars and motorcycles by sprinkling the officers 
highway hideaways with roofing nails 
since may more than 40 tires on patrol cars and motorcycles 
have been flattened by the roofing nails authorities said 
wednesday 
after it happened more than once westminster police figured 
they were targets of boobytraps placed by someone who knew just 
where officers would park while looking for speeders 
it was just too coincidental said police spokesman rick 
kempsell 
the latest incident occurred wednesday on a ramp leading to 
westbound us 36 two tires on a police car were punctured police 
estimated 300 to 500 of the small nails were scattered along the 
ramps shoulder less than a quarter mile from police headquarters 
roofing nails also have been found scattered near emergency 
vehicle turnaround areas along the turnpike and interstate 25 
the threequarterinch mails have flattened at least 30 patrol 
car tires and ruined at least a dozen police motorcycle tires since 
may car tires can be repaired but the motorcycle tires must be 
replaced at a cost of 127 apiece 
police said theres no way to know how many passing motorists 
also have had tires flattened by the nails

the mayor of nagasaki the target of death threats 
since he said emperor hirohito bore some responsibility for world 
war ii was shot and wounded today police said they arrested the 
leader of a rightist group 
the 67yearold mayor hitoshi motoshima was rushed to surgery 
at nagasaki public hospital after being shot in the back outside 
nagasakis city hall doctors told japan broadcasting corp nhk 
television a bullet pierced his left lung but he was not in 
serious condition 
about five hours after the attack police said they had arrested 
a man who confessed to shooting the mayor police identified him as 
kazumi tajiri 40 of tokyo and said he was arrested at a hotel in 
nagasaki a city 600 miles southwest of tokyo 
a police spokesman described tajiri as the leader of a rightist 
group called sane thinkers school 
rightist groups in japan venerate the imperial family and are 
strongly anticommunist they draw much of their inspiration from 
the militarism that prevailed before world war ii 
the police official said the sane thinkers school has about 30 
members in nagasaki more than any other rightist group in the 
city it was established nine years ago and some members have been 
arrested in the past for shooting at a district court judge and for 
other crimes said the police official 
city spokesman megumi nobeta said the mayor was shot as he was 
about to get into his car the attack left a pool of blood in the 
street beside the car 
the kyodo news service quoted witnesses as saying the gunman a 
slim man wearing a dark brown suit came out of city hall and shot 
motoshima at close range 
television showed tajiri after he was arrested and then 
broadcast a video of a 1987 interview in which tajiri condoned 
terrorism 
asked in the 1987 interview if he would kill somebody he hated 
tajiri responded yes because after all rightwingers are 
terrorists the comments were made after a 1987 shooting in which 
a reporter for a liberalleaning newspaper was killed 
chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama said todays shooting 
was an extremely cruel crime and it will have a strong impact on 
society 
it was the first time a politician had been shot in japan since 
world war ii national police agency records showed but the 
records showed 25 previous attacks on key politicians by rightists 
using knives swords explosives or fists the agency said 
such attacks while not common give credence to threats by 
rightist groups the most dramatic was in 1960 when a rightwing 
student in an assault at a socialist party rally that was being 
televised stabbed party chairman inejiro asanuma to death on stage 
motoshima has been receiving threats from ultranationalists and 
others since december 1988 when he said at a city assembly session 
he believed hirohito then on his deathbed shares responsibility 
for the war as well as all of us who lived in that period 
motoshima said hirohito could have ended world war ii sooner and 
perhaps spared nagasaki from the atomic bomb nagasaki was hit by 
an atomic bomb aug 9 1945 three days after hiroshima became the 
first city to be hit by a nuclear weapon 
the mayors comments enraged fringe groups that reject any 
criticism of the imperial family and motoshima continued to 
receive threats even after hirohitos death one year ago 
in december a rightwing doctor 62yearold shigeru kajiyama 
was sentenced to two years in prison for threatening to kill the 
mayor testimony at his trial said he had sent three anonymous 
letters containing live bullets to the mayor 
in january 1989 a rightist was arrested after breaking into 
city hall with a knife intending to force motoshima into retracting 
his statement 
early last year rightists mobilized about 100 sound trucks to 
circle city hall and blare slogans denouncing the mayor police at 
one time had about 1200 officers deployed to prevent trouble in 
the city 
nhk reported that police had relaxed their special guard on 
motoshima at the end of 1989 and no longer had officers following 
him when he was outside his office or home 
though the rightists made a great deal of noise supporters of 
the mayors position sent him a petition with some 286000 
signatures in april calling for more freedom to express opinions 
even on taboo subjects such as the late emperors war responsiblity 
while many scholars believe hirohito was a figurehead and the 
militarists made all important decisions during the war the 
emperor was the nominal commander in chief and approved key 
decisions critics say hirohito could have ended the war sooner 
but during his life the late emperor never gave much detail on his 
role during the war 
motoshima was an independent supported by the longgoverning 
liberal democratic party but his remarks on the emperor estranged 
him from the liberal democrats who sent a delegation demanding he 
retract his opinion he refused

a judge dismissed a lawsuit against the phone 
company by two former installers who say they were ordered to 
perform 1200 wiretaps but also made it tougher for the company to 
win its defamation case against the two men 
hamilton county common pleas court judge fred j cartolano on 
wednesday declared all the participants in the case public figures 
which raises the standard of proof necessary for the jury to find 
defamation occurred 
cincinnati bell telephone co its parent cincinnati bell inc 
and phone company managers james west and peter gabor accused 
leonard gates and robert draise of defamation for saying they were 
ordered to perform 1200 wiretaps between 1972 and 1984 
gates and draise claiming they were injured because bell 
officials called them liars countersued the judge dismissed the 
countersuit ruling wednesday that gates and draise failed to prove 
they were injured based on their status as public figures 
the trial on the suit and countersuit has been going on for 
seven weeks closing arguments on the remaining issues were 
expected to begin today 
the law says a public figure must prove he was libeled through a 
reckless or malicious disregard of the truth a private figure must 
show only that an allegation was untrue and that the person making 
it was careless in finding out whether it was the truth 
draise and gates became public figures by injecting themselves 
into a public controversy cartolano said they said they 
intentionally used the press to get their story out 
bell also qualifies as a public figure cartolano said to rule 
otherwise would have a chilling effect on the community 
because people would be afraid to criticize the company he said 
west and gabor are public figures as agents of their 
employer and because they participated in a news conference bell 
held last year in an attempt to refute gates and draises charges 
cartolano said 
bell contends gates and draise lied to get revenge against the 
company because they were fired for other reasons gates was fired 
in 1986 and draise in 1979 
gates and draise said they started doing the wiretaps for 
members of the cincinnati police intelligence squad about 1972 and 
a few years later began getting their orders from west and gabor 
the taps originally were done on suspected criminals but later 
included judges lawyers business and political leaders police 
and journalists according to gates and draise 
several former members of the police intelligence squad have 
admitted using gates and draise to do illegal taps in the early 
1970s but bell west and gabor deny any knowledge of the activity

the kremlin boosted military units to wartime 
strength in several regions and called up reservists in its 
struggle to end ethnic strife in two southern republics the 
defense minister said today 
the minister dmitri yazov called the armenianazerbaijani 
warfare which has left at least 66 people dead and more than 200 
wounded a great disaster 
most of the victims have been armenians attacked by mobs in the 
azerbaijani capital baku terrorized armenians were said to still 
be fleeing by the thousands 
soviet troops ordered in tuesday to enforce a state of emergency 
have become caught up in the fighting their efforts hampered by 
defiant nationalists who set up blockades 
yazov told soviet radio that in order to ensure order we are 
compelled to bring up to wartime strength some units in 
neighboring regions he did not say how many troops were being 
called up or from where 
the republic of georgia which has its own ethnic quarrels and 
the russian federation are the areas nearest to armenia and 
azerbaijan 
moscow radio said some young men who recently completed 
compulsory military service were being recalled 
president mikhail s gorbachev today made his first public 
comments on the civil strife between the armenians who are mainly 
christians and the neighboring azerbaijanis who are predominately 
moslem 
the problems which have been accumulating for tens no for 
hundreds of years have erupted he told a meeting in moscow 
we are now busy trying to halt this process to prevent it 
from going deeper and getting more acute gorbachev said in 
comments broadcast on staterun radio we have resorted to the 
use of force against criminals against this vandalism 
the kremlin on tuesday poured more than 11000 additional troops 
into the troubled region in a bid to quell the violence the worst 
since a decadesold feud over the land of nagornokarabakh began 
anew two years ago 
the land is inside azerbaijan but populated mainly by armenians 
the armenian republic wants to annex it 
soldiers were authorized wednesday to fire on gunmen who attack 
them or people who are trying to steal weapons yazov said their 
numbers were still insufficient to bring the situation under 
control 
he said he understood reservists would be unhappy about being 
called up to maintain order in another soviet republic but 
emphasized that no one is setting them the task of killing 
shooting going onto some offensive it is principally to protect 
public order 
however soldiers lives have been endangered an interior 
ministry lieutenant was shot and killed in nagornokarabakh and a 
private was mortally wounded according to official reports 
radio moscow detailing the difficulties facing units sent to 
the caucasus region said armenians seized one transport plane that 
arrived with troops and demanded to be flown to safety 
the capital of nagornokarabakh stepanakert lost twothirds of 
its water supply when saboteurs blew up parts of its water supply 
pipe tass said today 
the reservist callup was needed in part because recent cuts 
under gorbachevs plan to slash the nations armed forces have 
depleted the pool of units that can be moved to the caucasus yazov 
said 
he did not say how many of the newly mobilized troops would be 
sent to the area of fighting 
interior minister vadim bakatin in an interview printed today 
said internal security forces were already feeling the pinch of 
trying to cope with the unrest while fulfilling their usual duties 
which include guarding prisons and fighting crime 
in comments to the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda bakatin 
referred to the strife as civil war becoming the first 
highlevel member of the soviet government to use those terms 
radio moscow said antiarmenian attacks continued in baku the 
azerbaijan capital no new killings were reported in the city over 
the past 24 hours and 30 hostages held in one neighborhood were 
set free 
the latest violence exploded saturday with bloody antiarmenian 
riots in baku that led to battles by bands of heavily armed 
armenians and azerbaijanis in and near nagornokarabakh 
in moscow interior ministry spokesman dmitri seleznev said the 
death toll was up to 66 and that 220 people had been wounded 
he said 4658 more armenians had been evacuated from baku since 
wednesday adding to the 7000 evacuated earlier in the week 
there were 45 pogroms or ethnically motivated attacks in 
the oilproducing center during the same period and 26 people were 
detained said seleznev speaking in a telephone interview 
he said pickets were up at two military airfields in azerbaijan 
and that attempts were made in baku to block streets to obstruct 
the progress of troops trying to restore order in the city of 17 
million 
members of the azerbaijani peoples front said today they warned 
moscow that if a curfew or martial law were imposed on baku they 
would launch a general strike in the strategic oil center 
in armenia seleznev said people continued attacks on armories 
to steal firearms since wednesday 198 more weapons were seized 
including four armored cars and one world war iivintage t34 tank 
which he said was towed away although it is not in working order 
according to soviet press reports and officials the warring 
sides have helicopters armored vehicles machine guns and other 
arms seized from government arsenals or offered by compatriots 
many armenian refugees streaming into moscow blamed gorbachev 
personally for failing to halt the violence 
the government newspaper izvestia said much of the violence in 
baku involved azerbaijani refugees from armenia who needed a place 
to live and were forcing armenians to leave their apartments 
izvestia said tens of thousands of azerbaijanis who fled ethnic 
violence in armenia in late 1988 remain without homes or jobs in 
baku 
an azerbaijani government spokesman today deplored the baku 
killings at a news conference in moscow but cited the azerbaijani 
refugees situation as a one cause 
zaur rustamzade also said armenian aggression against 
azerbaijani villages in nagornokarabakh led to response 
actions from azerbaijanis tass said 
in the azerbaijani region of nakhichevan about 3000 armenians 
blockaded the village of kerki defended by 30 residents who were 
aided by 50 soldiers seleznev said he said there had been 
shooting but no deaths 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev dispelled 
rumors that the borders with iran and turkey had been sealed 
irans official tehran radio said dozens of azerbaijanis crossed 
into iran today from the soviet union chanting islamic slogans as 
they arrived the soviet azerbaijanis share the moslem religion and 
language with iranians in that countrys region of the same name

thousands of filipinos today 
protested a government plan to suspend a provincial governor linked 
to last months coup attempt but the official later agreed to step 
down 
in manila a senior us presidential adviser expressed strong 
support today for president corazon aquino amid rumors of another 
impending attempt to topple her government 
the rumors have been sweeping manila for weeks because many 
leaders of the failed coup dec 19 remain at large 
late today rodolfo aguinaldo governor of the cagayan province 
agreed to give up his post for 60 days while he is being 
investigated for his alleged role in the failed coup 
aguinaldo will turn over his post friday to his vice governor 
defense secretary fidel ramos said 
local governments secretary luis santos tried to serve the 
suspension order to aguinaldo earlier today in the provincial 
capital of tuguegarao 200 miles north of manila but 5000 people 
confronted santos party demanding that aguinaldo be retained in 
office 
aguinaldo a former lieutenant colonel said in a radio 
interview dec 1 that he was sending tanks and artillery to manila 
to support the insurgents the national bureau of investigation 
says aguinaldos troops were turned back by loyal soldiers in 
northern luzon island 
the governments ability to enforce the suspension is widely 
seen here as an indicator of administration resolve to punish 
participants in coup attempts 
aguinaldo was implicated but never charged in an august 1987 
coup attempt afterward he resigned from the military and raised 
his own private army ostensibly to fight communist rebels 
he was elected governor of cagayan province by a landslide in 
the january 1988 regional balloting 
in manila robert gates deputy us national security adviser 
said president bush sent him to express his personal support for 
democracy and the constitutional process in the philippines 
he authorized me to be able to give him a firsthand report on 
developments here and after i had a very good meeting with 
president aquino i can do that gates told reporters among 
other things i would tell him that she is very confident 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
gates visit indicated the united states very strongly supports 
the aquino government and noted that bush ordered air support to 
help put down the dec 19 coup attempt 
at least 113 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in the 
failed december coup the sixth and bloodiest attempt to oust mrs 
aquino since she took power in the february 1986 uprising that 
toppled the late president ferdinand marcos 
in announcing gates trip wednesday fitzwater acknowledged 
reports that military dissidents would try again to oust mrs 
aquino 
there of course are continuing reports of problems in terms 
of security forces and so forth fitzwater said she is taking 
measures to deal with those to prevent future coups we simply 
want to consult with her on those efforts 
gates onetime deputy cia director is the chief deputy to brent 
scowcroft bushs national security adviser 
during the december coup attempt gates was a key figure in 
convening and running allnight meetings at the white house to 
monitor developments and plan the us response while bush was 
flying to malta for talks with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev

ousted communist leader todor zhivkov has 
been placed under house arrest on charges of inciting ethnic 
hostility misuse of state property and malfeasance in office the 
state news agency reported today 
the announcement came more than two months after the hardline 
party chief who had ruled for 35 years was ousted by a peaceful 
prodemocracy revolution and replaced by more moderate communists 
who have promised free elections and democratic reforms 
also today sources said talks between the governing communists 
and the fledgling opposition on the transition to democracy were 
suspended until at least monday because of disagreements over 
opposition demands for a voice on state radio and television the 
two delegations agreed to work out a compromise on the issue said 
western diplomats on condition of anonymity 
the leader of the communist party delegation andrei loukanov 
said the revival of anticommmunism would be dangerous for the 
transition to democracy the official bta news agency reported 
he did not elaborate but appeared to be referring to the 
anticommunist slogans at a rally sunday by more than 50000 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
zhivkov 78 was charged with incitement of ethnic hostility 
and hatred with unwarranted receiving of excessive amounts of 
public property and with gross malfeasance the official bta news 
agency reported 
it said a team of prosecutors has been assigned to conduct the 
investigation and a warrant has been issued by the 
prosecutorgenerals office to remand zhivkov in custody 
bta said zhivkov was not jailed but remained under guard at 
one of his residences prevented from moving from the house 
zhivkov reportedly had been under government protection at a house 
near the capital sofia 
it was unclear how far the proceedings against zhivkov have 
gone and the date of the arrest warrant was not known 
immediately after his ouster zhivkov was accused of corrupt 
practices in maintaining at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats 
throughout the country 
bta said the investigation was launched on the basis of 
materials supplied by a parliamentary commission of inquiry into 
the abuses and breaches of the law committed in the state public 
and economic life by the previous regime 
like other ousted hardline leaders in eastern europe zhivkov 
has been accused of abusing power by enriching himself at the 
peoples expense and damaging the economy through cumbersome 
central planning 
zhivkov also has been accused of enforcing discrimination 
against the countrys ethnic turkish minority 
todays announcement made clear zhivkov is now officially held 
responsible for the forced assimilation of the 12 million ethnic 
turks who are mainly moslem under the forced assimilation policy 
the ethnic turks were forced to adopt ethnic slavic names and their 
language and religious rites were banned 
last summer 320000 ethnic turks emigrated to turkey citing 
unbearable living conditions under zhivkovs harsh rule but 80000 
later returned for lack of jobs and proper housing in turkey 
the new government overturned zhivkovs assimilation policy on 
dec 29 
petar mladenov a former minister under zhivkov replaced him as 
communist party leader and promised reforms and free elections this 
year 
on monday parliament repealed the communists guaranteed 
monopoly on power making bulgaria the last warsaw pact country to 
formally do so 
the party is still powerful however and opposition groups 
complain that it is not moving swiftly enough on reform 
a wave of democratic reforms also has swept poland hungary 
east germany czechoslovakia and romania forcing out their 
hardline communist leaders 
nicolae ceausescu of romania was convicted of grave crimes 
under his 24year rule and executed dec 25 three days after his 
ouster 
the former east german leader erich honecker is under 
investigation for high treason abuse of power and corruption 
in czechoslovakia former communist party chief milos jakes was 
ousted on nov 24 and his fate is still unclear a communist party 
commission investigating abuse of political power ordered jakes to 
resign from the party 
in hungary janos kadar was removed as party leader in 1988 he 
died in july 
only polands gen wojciech jaruzelski has managed to remain as 
president under a government now controlled by noncommunists

a senate committee chairman and colombias 
ambassador today joined president bush in rejecting an offer by 
colombian drug lords to quit their smuggling in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution 
you like us are highly skeptical sen joseph biden 
ddel told colombian ambassador victor mosquera chaux at a joint 
hearing of his senate judiciary committee and the senate caucus on 
international narcotics control 
mosquera in response to a question said the government will 
not negotiate with the medellin cartel despite the overture this 
week 
the government has indicated that it will not negotiate with 
the traffickers and that even if they were to turn themselves over 
they would be brought to justice mosquera said in spanish 
through an interpreter 
even though i dont think that the war has been won i think 
the colombian government is very close to obtaining a total 
victory he said otherwise this change in attitude of the 
extraditables would be very hard to explain since its very 
different from their past activities 
the communique allegedly sent by the extraditables the armed 
wing of colombias powerful drug leaders offered to declare 
colombias government the winner in its war on narcotics 
traffickers it said the drug lords would halt illegal activities 
in exchange for constitutional guarantees 
the drug cartel released two kidnap victims to back up its 
offer which was similar to previous proposals that have been 
rejected by the government 
the communique followed colombian president virgilio barcos 
statement tuesday night that his government is not inflexible 
regarding a negotiated settlement with drug lords previously 
barco ruled out talks 
asked wednesday about the offer by the drug lords bush said 
theyve got a credibility problem with me 
biden said he was holding todays hearing with the ambassadors 
of colombia peru and bolivia primarily to discuss longterm plans 
to combat the cocaine problem 
the envoys testified that drug trafficking was linked to 
problems of foreign trade especially the lack of an international 
coffee pricing agreement foreign debt and internal poverty 
particularly among farmers 
mosquera proposed a onetime 1 billion economic support program 
to colombia to mitigate the costs associated with the drug war 
as well as the negative effects from the breakdown of the 
international coffee agreement 
the breakdown of the agreement has cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars in losses to the colombian economy he said 
ambassador cesar atalanazal of peru attended the hearing even 
though he had been recalled as a result of the us invasion of 
panama dec 20 to oust gen manuel antonio noriega 
i am now back in washington to participate in this hearing 
he said saying it was a gesture of respect and appreciation 
otherwise the position of peru in regard to panamanian events 
remains unchanged he said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass also asked that the events in 
panama not interfere with the andean drug summit scheduled for feb 
15 in cartagena colombia 
bush and the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia had been 
scheduled to attend the summit peruvian president alan garcia has 
since said he would send a minister in his stead unless us 
invasion troops are out of panama before then 
bush said wednesday however that the summit schedule would not 
force him to speed the troop withdrawal 
we want the troops out of there as soon as possible he 
said its my objective to get the troops out and get back to the 
levels before this military action it has nothing to do with the 
summit in cartagena at all im not driven by the summit 
whatever our differences on that issue all of us hope that 
the summit will be helpful and that it will generate a new spirit 
of cooperation kennedy said 
he added that we also regret the unfortunate controversy over 
the administrations proposal to locate us warships off the coast 
of colombia 
defense department sources said last week that the aircraft 
carrier john f kennedy has been chosen to lead an interdiction 
effort off colombia but that no final decision had been made on 
deployment 
word of the proposed deployment off the colombian coast touched 
off rumors around the hemisphere denied here that the united 
states might try to blockade colombia or perhaps even invade it as 
a followup to the panama invasion

boleslavs maikovskis 86 is charged with complicity in the 
shooting deaths of 170 residents in the village of audrini in the 
soviet republic of latvia in january 1942

hanging of a jewish man from audrini in may 1942 while acting as a 
commander of a pronazi police force 
maikovskis a former resident of mineola ny fled the united 
states in 1987 he was facing proceedings that could have led to 
his deportation to the soviet union for alleged war crimes 
the soviet union sentenced maikovskis to death in absentia in 
1965 
maikovskis applied for asylum in west germany after leaving the 
united states but was arrested at his home in muenster in october 
1988 he is in poor health and has been held in a prison hospital 
maikovskis today was questioned about his life in latvia but not 
about his alleged crimes 
speaking through an interpreter he described himself as a 
fighter for latvias independence and said he had joined a 
progerman organization long before latvia was occupied by nazi 
troops 
the organization later became an auxiliary police force that 
started wearing german uniforms in 1942 he said he joined the 
police force to help achieve latvias independence 
maikovskis told the court he withdrew with german troops to 
germany in 1944 at the end of the war he spent six years as a 
displaced person before receiving permission to emigrate to the 
united states in 1951 
the united states began deportation proceedings against 
maikovskis in 1976 but they were delayed by several appeals the 
last of which was denied by the us supreme court in 1986 
the trial adjourned until monday it is expected to last until 
june

some stops vice president dan quayle wanted to 
make in central and south america may have to be scheduled for a 
later time the white house said today as latin countries 
continue to voice resentment over the us invasion of panama 
its not dont come quayle acknowledged today in an 
interview with the associated press its a matter of timing on 
when you will come he said expressing the reaction he has 
gotten from nations he wanted to visit 
quayle said his trip will be important both symbolically to 
show the administrations interest in keeping good relations with 
its neighbors and diplomatically to try and smooth any feelings 
injured by last months invasion 
the itinerary announced wednesday by quayles office for his 
trip next week with stops in panama honduras and jamaica falls 
short of the journey indicated by president bushs announcement 
jan 5 
some of the trips may have to be scheduled for a later time 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today he 
declined to comment on the reported resistance from latin countries 
when youre scheduling these kinds of things some can be 
scheduled earlier than others fitzwater told reporters 
the question of when the meetings take place is not nearly as 
important to us as simply that the message is delivered that bush 
wants to restore good relations with the latin nations fitzwater 
said 
asked whether the countries were snubbing bush in requesting 
that quayle not visit at this time fitzwater said obviously 
there were concerns in latin america following the panama 
situation obviously there were reasons why the president felt it 
was necessary to reiterate our support and our interest in working 
with them 
quayles trip to the jan 27 honduran presidential inauguration 
has long been planned on that trip aides said wednesday he will 
stop in panama where he is expected to voice support for the 
usinstalled government of guillermo endara 
he also is to visit jamaica which joined the 201 vote on dec 
22 deploring the us military invasion of panama 
other than those stops quayles office has been unable to set 
up any specific visits except the previously scheduled trips to 
chile and brazil for their midmarch inaugurations said one 
official speaking on condition of anonymity quayles office said 
he would make stops yet to be determined as part of that trip 
it is anticipated that he will use the three inaugural trips to 
meet with other presidents who attend 
venezuelan officials in washington have told reporters they 
would prefer that quayle not visit 
in caracas today venezuelas foreign minister reinaldo 
figueredo said we understand hes not coming but refused to 
say why 
figueredo said in a television interview wednesday however 
maybe his visit is not the most adequate step to be taken given 
the conditions that exist with respect to the us invasion of 
panama 
in addition the head of venezuelas main opposition party 
eduardo fernandez said wednesday that a visit would not be 
convenient 
quayle aides wednesday night declined to confirm or deny a 
report in todays editions of the new york times that quayle had 
dropped plans to stop in venezuela and mexico because of objections 
from those countries 
quayle said wednesday that diplomatic sensitivities have 
held up scheduling of his trip but he denied any lingering deep 
resentment among latin leaders after the dec 20 invasion of 
panama 
no country has said we dont want the vice president 
period he told a luncheon gathering of the hoover institution 
he later told the associated press however there are 
diplomatic sensitivities theres a matter of timing on when you 
go theres a matter of coordination and these things have all got 
to be worked out 
the jamaica stop is another signal of the much friendlier 
relations between washington and the government of prime minister 
michael manley a onetime strident opponent of the united states 
latin officials have said this is not a good time for quayle to 
visit their countries because of strong sentiment against the 
continued presence of us troops in panama 
an official who spoke anonymously said all have indicated they 
will welcome quayle eventually but not this soon after the 
invasion subsequent reports that bush was planning to use us 
ships to intercept drugs off colombia which surprised the 
colombian government added further to the antiamerican feelings 
the official said 
bush in assigning quayle to visit the region said he 
understood the sensitivities of the latin americans to the us 
military action in their region and was sending quayle to explain 
the action was not taken lightly or without rationale 
quayle told the lunch group he was not going to the region to 
apologize but to consult with the leaders on how we make panama 
a successful democracy 
he told a reporter later i do not believe that the heads of 
state are unhappy or resentful of our actions in panama i think 
they understand it thats one of the reasons im going down to 
find out what their true feelings are 
bush said wednesday he wants to withdraw the invasion force from 
panama as soon as possible but he feels no pressure to get 
them out before the feb 15 drug summit 
perus president alan garcia is refusing to attend the drug 
summit while the troops remain but he plans to send a minister 
bush congratulated gen maxwell thurman the commander of the 
us invasion at the white house on wednesday for an outstanding 
job 
the president denied difficulties in finding countries willing 
to host quayle in the region

the government has canceled a national 
referendum on whether to ban the communist party and reimpose the 
death penalty because the decision to hold it was not carefully 
thought out a spokesman said today 
siviu brucan of the governing national salvation front said the 
decision was made wednesday night during a meeting of the fronts 
executive council at the same meeting the council ruled that the 
communist partys assets will be confiscated 
the referendum will no longer take place brucan told a news 
conference 
it was the second major turnaround by the revolutionary 
government in less than a week 
on saturday president ion iliescu retracted a ban on the 
communist party that he had announced the previous day and instead 
said it would be on the referendum jan 28 along with the 
previously scheduled question of whether to reimpose the death 
penalty 
like brucan today iliescu said he backed off his decision 
because it had been made too hastily 
brucan said leaders were guilty of almost panicky 
decisionmaking friday when they promised the referendum to end 
huge protests by people demanding legalization of the death penalty 
and a ban on the communist party 
earlier today government spokesman dan radulescu said the front 
was considering either calling off or postponing the referendum 
because of time constraints 
it is very difficult to organize a referendum in only 10 
days he said 
the cancellation was the latest sign of the governments 
indecision over crucial issues and its difficulty coping with the 
publics lingering distrust of the government which includes 
several former communists 
during the past week several visting west european officials 
who have come to discuss aid to romania have spoken out against 
renewal of the death penalty which was outlawed after the 
executions dec 25 of ousted leader nicolae ceausescu and his wife 
elena 
also today two daughters of exiled king michael flew from 
geneva to bucharest for their first visit to the country the king 
who went into exile in 1948 has offered to return as head of a 
constitutional moncharchy 
princesses margarita and sophie were expected to stay at least 
five days but sources close to the family gave no further details 
on their trip 
the minister of petroleum victor murea said in an interview 
that the country cannot produce enough natural gas to meet all its 
needs and will be forced to limit some energy supplies to 
nonessential industries 
murea told the newspaper adevarul that the country can only 
produce natural gas to meet 60 percent of its needs and that 
production is dropping as resources are depleted 
daily production today is only 79 percent of what it was three 
years ago he said 
to conserve natural gas some industrial users will have to 
switch to oil and others will have to be shut down at least 
temporarily he said only those economic units that produce 
strictly necessary goods can be allowed to function he said 
on wednesday officials in the domestic food ministry said the 
country was also being forced to reimpose food rationing in some 
areas because of shortages 
during ceausescus rule heating and food supplies were strictly 
limited as an austerity measure to help romania pay off a 105 
billion foreign debt 
after the otherthrow of ceausescu on dec 22 the government 
immediately increased heat in apartments and offices and stopped 
rationing

twenty sick or disabled iranian soldiers 
captured by iraq in their eightyear war arrived in tehran on 
thursday a day after iran repatriated 50 similar iraqi prisoners 
tehran radio reported 
the prisoners were welcomed at tehrans mehrabad airport by 
mahmoud aqamiri an official in charge of iraqi prisonersofwar in 
iran 
aqamiri deplored the lopsided exchange saying that the fact 
that the iraqi regime had released only 20 iranian prisoners in 
exchange for 50 released by us the previous day limits the 
possibility for other such exchanges according to the broadcast 
monitored in cyprus 
aqamiri said that 53 iraqi prisoners had been freed by tehran 
wednesday but that three had requested asylum in iran 
the iranians were flown to iran aboard the same international 
red crosschartered plane that carried the iraqis 
an iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said the release of the 
iranian prisoners was made in confirmation of iraqs humanitarian 
policy and its commitment to international conventions 
the red cross had mediated an agreement between iran and iraq to 
repatriate the ailing and disabled pows immediately after the 
ceasefire which took effect in august 1988 
according to red cross estimates more than 900 ailing and 
disabled pows remain held by both sides with a total of 50000 
other prisoners held by iran and 19200 by iraq 
united nations officials and diplomats put the total number of 
pows held by both sides at about 100000

president bush today denounced as a 
charade a democratic proposal to cut the social security payroll 
tax and said it was really an attempt to force him to raise other 
taxes 
bush also promised that he will not acquiesce in any move that 
would raise taxes or lead to lower social security benefits for 
older americans 
reporters asked the president about the proposal by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny at the start of a meeting between bush 
and visiting turkish president turgut ozal 
bush pointed to his foreign visitor and replied we have the 
same feeling about it we both draw a blank when we hear about it 
its an effort to get me to raise taxes on the american people 
by the charade of cutting them or cut benefits and i am not going 
to do it to the older people of this country he said 
it was bushs first public comments on the sensitive moynihan 
proposal which has drawn support from democrats and republicans 
alike despite warnings from the white house that it was a trap for 
the gop 
moynihan has suggested rolling back the recent social security 
payroll tax hike saving workers 7 billion this year and 55 
billion in fiscal 1991 
another democrat sen ernest f hollings of south carolina has 
proposed a 5 percent valueadded tax a national sales levy to 
raise 53 billion in 1991 and cover the revenues lost both by the 
social security tax cut and bushs proposal to lower the tax on 
capital gains 
first we had the tax cut and now we have the tax increase can 
cuts in benefits be far behind look out older americans white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier today 
fitzwater boasted that he was a prophet on monday when he called 
the politically popular moynihan proposal a wolf in sheeps 
clothing and just a ruse to force an increase in other taxes 
vice president dan quayle in an interview wednesday with the 
associated press also labeled moynihans proposal a political 
trap that would lead to higher overall taxes later 
the payroll tax paid by both employers and employees jumped to 
765 percent on jan 1 from 751 percent and it is now levied on 
wages up to 51300 instead of 48000 selfemployed people pay 
153 percent 
moynihan contends the payroll tax should be scaled back now 
because of mounting surpluses in the social security trust funds 
under a plan endorsed by a social security rescue commission that 
moynihan was part of in 1983 the trust funds are supposed to build 
up annual surpluses of tens and eventually hundreds of billions of 
dollars each year to help pay for baby boomers retirement in the 
next century 
but the excess now is being lent to the government which uses 
the funds to pay for other federal programs and hold down the 
overall deficit 
hollings wants to impose a value added tax on sales of 
everything except food health care and housing it would be levied 
at each stage of production 
asked if he felt there was a conspiracy between hollings and 
moynihan fitzwater said 
theyre all part of the same party that has this interest in 
this proposal but its been clear from the beginning that if you 
cut the social security taxes at some point you got to raise taxes 
to get the money back or you got to cut benefits we dont want to 
be associated with either one of those outcomes

rocket motors for the military burst into flames after being struck 
by a car early today killing the cars driver and forcing the

shootings such as that of nagasakis mayor hitoshi 
nagashima are rare in japan where weapons control has been strict 
since the samurai were forbidden to carry swords in 1868 
about 315 gun battles between rival gangs during a 198588 
underworld power struggle accounted for the bulk of the nations 
shooting incidents in that period twentyfive people died in those 
shootings 
overall murder has been declining in japan from about 1650 
cases in 1980 to about 1450 in 1988 of these only a tiny 
fraction were committed with guns 
in the united states with twice the population there were more 
than 20000 murders in the same year about half of them committed 
with firearms japans overall crime rate has been estimated at 
about onefifth that of the us rate 
strict gun control under japans firearms and sword control law 
and a tradition of obedience are among reasons cited for the 
difference 
illegal possession of hand guns can result in prison sentences 
of up to 10 years the maximum penalty for murder is death carried 
out by hanging 
in recent years however gunrunning from southeast asia 
especially the philippines has been on the rise the national 
police agency says it seizes about 1500 firearms mainly pistols 
each year 
the smugglers are mostly yakuza gangsters arming themselves 
for gang skirmishes some of the gangs reputedly have close ties to 
rightwing groups 
since the end of world war ii political assassinations have 
been rare the shooting of motoshima was the first attack on a 
major political figure with a gun since the war police records 
show 
but rightists have carried out 25 other attacks on key 
politicians using knives swords explosives or fists the agency 
said 
in the most famous case on oct 12 1960 socialist party 
leader inejiro asanuma was stabbed to death with a sword by a 
rightwing assailant during a televised rally 
assassinations were frequent in japan during the 1930s a period 
in which rightwing nationalism eventually led to de facto military 
rule prime minister osachi hamaguchi was killed by rightwingers 
in 1930 
in may 1932 prime minister tsuyoshi inukai was assassinated 
and democratic government collapsed in japan until its revival 
under the allied occupation in 1945

the boeing co said today it expects to lay off 
1700 workers in the puget sound area by april and anticipates 
reducing its work force in the area by as much as 5000 people this 
year 
attrition should account for about half the total reduction the 
company said in a news release 
boeing by far the largest private employer in washington state 
said about 1400 of the 1700 hourly employees expected to be laid 
off are at the companys everett plant where production startup 
for the new 747400 jumbo jet has been completed 
the announcement made no mention of layoffs at boeing plants in 
other parts of the country it had been rumored since late last 
year 
because the new 777 airplane program is still not formally 
approved and with uncertainties in the defense budget boeing will 
continue to review and revise its workforce requirements throughout 
the year the company said 
layoff notices will be issued friday to about 1900 employees 
who might be among the 1700 workers laid off starting march 20 
the company said it said it will provide counseling and help the 
laidoff workers find new jobs 
at the end of 1989 boeing had just under 106700 employees in 
washington state and increase of almost 10000 from the beginning 
of the year 
nationwide boeing employment had grown to 145200 up 10800 
from the beginning of the year

the european parliament on thursday 
urged the european community to grant emergency aid to armenia and 
the region of nagornokarabakh but did not specify how much 
it also suggested a factfinding mission be sent to the troubled 
region in the southern soviet union 
in a resolution backed by almost all political groups in the 
518seat assembly the parliament called on the soviet government 
to order an end to the blockade of armenia and nagornokarabakh and 
to guarantee the safety of people there 
parliamentarians said they were concerned that the repeated 
threats of secession would have dire consequences on the 
budding process of democratization in the soviet union 
the largely armenian population of nagornokarabakh wants to be 
under the control of the republic of armenia not the republic of 
azerbaijan 
the parliament urged the european community to make 
representations to the soviet authorities to order the full 
and immediate lifting of the blockade imposed on armenia and 
nagornokarabakh 
the ec should also call on the soviets to guarantee the 
freedom of movement and the safety of goods and persons between 
armenia and nagornokarabakh the parliament said 
noting that according to some sources arms from iran have 
been delivered to the azerbaijanis the parliament called on all 
nations especially those bordering armenia to avoid all 
interference

its still dangerous to exercise the right of free 
speech in japan especially in criticizing an imperial family that 
is held sacrosanct by a violenceprone rightist fringe 
the shooting thursday of nagasaki mayor hitoshi motoshima was a 
vivid demonstration that rightist death threats can become real 
motoshima who provoked controversy for saying the late emperor 
hirohito bore some responsibility for world war ii was shot in the 
back and seriously wounded five hours later police arrested the 
leader of a rightist group on suspicion of attempted murder and 
said he had admitted the shooting 
the government and some who have been targets of rightist 
attacks including reporters quickly condemned the attack 
these sorts of attacks using violence to curb freedom of 
speech are unforgivable said osamu asano deputy secretary 
general of the japan newspaper publishers and editors association 
the attack shows the lingering threat from anticommunist 
extremists who have intimidated government officials and 
businessmen for years 
the arrested leader of the sane thinkers group kazumi tajiri 
was on record saying he was willing to kill 
asked in 1987 if he would kill somebody he hated tajiri 
responded yes because after all rightwingers are 
terrorists tv asahi broadcast a tape of the interview after 
tajiri was arrested 
rightists prowl the streets of tokyo and other cities in huge 
black trucks decorated with the rising sun flag of the militaristic 
past using powerful loudspeakers to harass their targets 
newspapers embassies government offices and companies with 
earsplitting military music and epithets 
the groups have scant public support but the threat of a visit 
from them is enough to prevent many japanese from speaking their 
minds 
executives doing business in socialist countries generally 
refuse to be quoted government officials responsible for relations 
with the socialist bloc are also reticent 
if i allowed you to use my name the trucks would be right 
outside the doors of our company and maybe even outside my home 
said one businessman they already give us enough trouble 
motoshima violated the rightists most sensitive taboo in 
december 1988 when he said that hirohito on his deathbed at the 
time was partly responsible for the war hirohito died jan 7 
1989 at age 87 
more than 70000 people died in nagasaki on aug 9 1945 when a 
us plane dropped an atomic bomb on the city three days earlier 
about 140000 died in hiroshima the first city ever to suffer an 
atomic bomb attack japan surrendered six days after the nagasaki 
bombing 
hirohito was worshiped as a living god before renouncing his 
divine status after the war and the rightists still venerate the 
royal family 
motoshima received strong public support a group of nagasaki 
residents sent him petitions with more than 286000 signatures 
backing him but he also got death threats and a procession of 
rightist sound trucks outside his office 
death to motoshima was a constant chant the mayor received 
threatening letters containing bullets city hall was fired upon in 
march 
motoshima an independent is the 26th major politician in 
postwar japan to be assaulted police say 
the most shocking case came in 1960 when a rightwing student 
fatally stabbed japan socialist party chairman inejiro asanuma at a 
televised party rally 
in may two rightists slightly injured socialist secretary 
general tsuruo yamaguchi and another socialist politician at a 
party gathering 
in december a rightist group reportedly sent a severed finger 
to prime minister toshiki kaifus residence to protest the 
government debate over funding inaugeration ceremonies for 
hirohitos son emperor akihito 
another rightist fired a pistol and barricaded himself inside a 
tax office near the imperial palace in central tokyo in july to 
protest the inheritance tax levied on the emperors 129 million 
estate nobody was injured 
leftwing extremists have launched attacks on the imperial 
family leftists recently fired projectiles at the home of prince 
hitachi akihitos younger brother causing some damage but no 
injuries 
journalists also have been casualties of rightist attacks 
in may 1987 a masked gunman walked into a bureau of japans 
secondlargest newspaper the asahi shimbun and killed one 
reporter and wounded another 
other newspapers also have experienced attacks and the asahi 
shimbun headquarters has been fired upon and harassed by rightist 
sound trucks 
the people who attacked the asahi shimbun still havent been 
caught said asano of the publishers association violence of 
this sort threatens our freedom of speech and of the press 
author sae sawachi agreed using terror to threaten people who 
hold different opinions is the greatest threat to democracy 
sawachi said

inga lourey says shes never met a drug 
trafficker but for seven months she and other business owners 
unwittingly paid rent to one 
now theyre paying the federal government which seized the 
property 
ms lourey and her husband carl own a supermarket in the park 
ii alto mesa shopping center on el pasos upscale west side 
unbeknown to them the 43 million center was owned by rafael 
munoz talavera considered the premier godfather of cocaine 
smuggling from mexico into the united states government officials 
say 
federal investigators say he headed a smuggling ring that moved 
at least 60 tons of cocaine into the united states during 1989 
including the 214 tons discovered last september in a warehouse in 
sylmar calif 
munoz talavera was arrested shortly after the warehouse was 
seized and now is jailed just a few miles from ms loureys store 
across the border in cuidad juarez mexico 
in november the us marshals service seized the shopping 
center and told the loureys and other merchants who their landlord 
had been 
ms lourey said she had no idea who owned the shopping center 
we just had an address we sent the rent to she said 
there are a lot of people doing business with criminals who do 
not have any way of being aware of it at the time said steven t 
boyle spokesman for marshals service headquarters in arlington va 
the shopping center is one of more than 26300 properties seized 
by the marshals service in 1989 from real estate to cars and 
personal belongings as the result of drug investigations boyle 
said 
there is little anyone can do to avoid doing business with a 
drug dealer boyle said since usually the first information 
linking someone with the illegal trade comes out when theyre 
indicted or arrested 
and by then it probably is too late for the innocent business 
person to avoid feeling the consequences as the loureys found out 
when the public learned of the shopping center seizure some of 
ms loureys customers believed merchants there might be fronts for 
drug dealers 
we had some snide remarks from customers some were saying 
if youre involved in laundering money were not coming to the 
store anymore others said they would boycott the store she 
said 
merchants became so worried that they got the us marshals 
service to issue a statement saying their businesses are legitimate 
but ms lourey worries that something similar will happen again 
and she doubts she could do anything to prevent it 
shopping centers change hands if this happens again are you 
going to ask the landlord are you ok is your money all right 
she asked 
boyle said about the only tipoff to a drug connection is 
someone trying to buy something with a briefcase full of cash 
the man who sold the shopping center said he too was a victim 
he said he sold the property to and did business only with rafael 
munoz tellez the father of munoz talavera not knowing the link 
it hurt my business tremendously i lost clients a lot of 
people in town talk said the property seller who spoke only on 
the condition that his name not be used he said more publicity 
would further erode his business which is just beginning to 
recover 
the shopping center was one of about a dozen residential and 
commercials properties seized in el paso and ruidoso nm as a 
result of the september cocaine seizure in california the federal 
government will maintain them until a court rules whether the 
suspects must forfeit the properties 
the number of properties seized by the marshals service has been 
escalating with the drug war seven times as many properties were 
seized last year than were just three years ago 3645 in 1986 
last years seizures were valued at 109 billion

save all that capt fred p moosally said wednesday

the government will reassess 
the need for bans on the african national congress the south 
african communist party and other militant opposition groups the 
justice minister said thursday 
a comprehensive review of the legal status of all restricted 
and banned organizations was beginning said justice minister kobie 
coetsee 
the anc outlawed since 1960 has listed the lifting of such 
bans as one of its preconditions for halting its guerrilla campaign 
and joining negotiations on a new political system that would 
include the black majority 
murphy morobe spokesman for the united democratic front a 
national antiapartheid coalition aligned with the anc said if 
mr coetsee really means what he says it can only be welcomed 
coetsees statement followed a defiant announcement wednesday by 
the united democratic front that it would resume fullscale overt 
operations the front has been forced to operate clandestinely 
since february 1988 when it was among 17 groups prohibited from 
conducting any activities 
law and order minister adriaan vlok in response invited the 
united democratic front to apply for the restrictions to be lifted 
but said its leaders could face prosecution of they resumed 
operations without getting permission 
morobe called vloks comment disturbing morobe said the 
government needs to learn that freedom of expression and 
association should never be dished out like an act of benevolence 
it is a human right which we in the udf strongly believe the 
government has no legitimate right to deny 
the progovernment newspaper beeld said in an editorial that the 
government should lift the bans that prohibit south african news 
media from quotiing designated opposition leaders including many 
officials of the anc and communist party 
in the same edition beeld quoted banned communist leader joe 
slovo as saying his party no longer endorsed the goal of a 
oneparty system for south africa 
business day a liberal daily carried similar remarks by slovo 
in its editions thursday there has been no indication either

more than 50 protesters rallied at a 
downtown hotel today disrupting and forcing recess of a meeting 
sponsored by a wisconsin lobbying group opposed to some indian 
treaty provisions 
the three days of meetings are sponsored by the wisconsin 
counties association a group of elected county officials in 
wisconsin gov norm bangerter has said utah officials would shun 
the meeting 
about 20 of the protesters including indians and their local 
supporters picketed outside the hotel inside 30 others lined up 
at the meeting room door trying to gain entrance to the meeting 
from which most indian tribal leaders were denied entry 
mark rogacki executive director of the association said 
representatives of county governments in more than a dozen states 
planned to attend the conference he said the conference would 
center on issues surrounding the exercise of rights within treaties 
and application of indian governments on nonindians 
wca director mark rogacki recessed the session following an 
angry confrontation with david hill a choctaw indian from konawa 
okla who entered the room and refused to leave 
when rogacki told hill he could not attend the meeting hill 
called rogacki a cockroach and said he would not voluntarily 
leave rogacki recessed the meeting 
about a dozen police officers were called to the hotel and began 
clearing the meeting area there was no violence 
critics say members of the association are trying to curtail 
indians offreservation access to natural resources 
theyre out there to find reasons to abolish the treaties 
chippewa spokesman michael allen said in wisconsin 
chippewa in wisconsin have offreservation rights to timber 
wild grain fish and game under 19th century treaties upheld by a 
federal court in 1983 treaty opponents say the ruling 
discriminates against nonchippewa businessmen fishermen and 
hunters 
rogacki said the issues are complex concerning water rights 
mineral rights gambling the judicial process and tax exemptions 
he said wisconsin county governments have jurisdictional disputes 
with the chippewa tribe 
the treaties were signed originally with the federal government 
but federal officials refuse to help he said adding the feds 
have taken a walk on this 
loretta metoxen recording secretary for the national congress 
of american indians said the group seeks to abrogate the treaties 
and take away indians rights 
i think the fact that the counties are meeting out there and 
not inviting indians suggests something might be amiss said sue 
erickson a spokeswoman for the great lakes indian fish and 
wildlife commission which oversees offreservation fishing and 
hunting regulations for wisconsins chippewa 
utahs governor is avoiding the conference and hopes to improve 
relations with utah indian tribes francine giani a spokeswoman 
for bangerter said wednesday that he wants to avoid the 
appearance of anything that would threaten treaties 
giani said the governor has worked hard to improve relationships 
with utahs various tribes and wants to continue to work with them 
conference organizers failed to make the meeting a cooperative 
affair between indians and local governments she said

the chairman of house armed services committee 
called on the bush administration thursday to delay production of 
some hightech weapons in light of budget pressures and a lessening 
soviet threat 
what we might do is pursue a real research and development 
system rather than a develop and buy system rep les aspin 
dwis said in a speech delivered to the national strategy forum 
in chicago 
a text of the address to the private group interested in 
national security issues was released in washington 
the wisconsin democrat said the warsaw pact can no longer be 
perceived as a cohesive military alliance ready to respond blindly 
to orders from moscow in response to areas where the threat has 
diminished the united states should reduce its spending on defense 
if an agreement is reached creating numerical parity among 
warsaw pact and nato the united states might not need to pursue 
expensive risky hightech weapons designed to attack them we 
have been pursuing such weapons he said 
specifically aspin said full production of the advanced 
tactical fighter a top secret stealthlike aircraft might be 
delayed until it is determined whether a soviet threat exists that 
requires a fighter plane of the future 
for the budget year 1991 the house armed services committee 
might hold up atf and buy the current generation of fighters f15 
and f16 the congressman said 
but aspin stressed the need for a new class of us submarines 
the ssn21 or seawolf class in response to the greatly improved 
soviet subs present day us submarines cannot physically 
accomodate the necessary improvements he said 
aspin said the bush administration has made consideration of the 
1991 military budget difficult because it failed to supply 
sufficient information about changes in the soviet threat and began 
discussing budget cuts before presenting a strategy 
the budget that comes to us in 10 days will undoubtedly be 
cut the question is how wisely aspin said what we hope to do 
with the strategy is give our colleagues a new way of dealing 
with the budget without such a strategy the strongest guiding 
force may be the aroma of pork

an international treaty to protect the dwindling 
herds of african elephants by banning trade in ivory went into 
force thursday but leading producing and consuming nations refused 
to be bound by it 
five southern african nations that regularly cull their elephant 
populations have filed for exemption while china has declared it 
will continue importing the prized tusks 
britain has asked for a sixmonth trading extension for hong 
kong to allow the colony to sell off its ivory stockpile of 670 
tons the worlds largest 
the trade ban was agreed after bitter debate at an october 
meeting of the 103nation convention on trade in endangered 
species countries had until thursday to file for an exemption to 
enable them to continue trade with those members who also filed 
reservations or with the 60 countries outside the convention 
south africa zimbabwe zambia botswana and malawi submitted 
reservations by the deadline said jeanpatrick le duc spokesman 
for the swissbased convention secretariat 
south africa and zimbabwe which both have large wellmanaged 
elephant populations have argued they need revenue from ivory 
sales to continue protecting the majestic beast successfully 
at last years conference the southern african countries 
clashed with the proban lobby led by kenya and tanzania which 
have seen their once thriving herds drastically reduced by poaching 
conservationists estimate there are between 400000 and 700000 
elephants still roaming the african continent compared with 15 
million in 1978 
the world wide fund for nature which says that 125000 
elephants were killed in 1988 warns that the largest land animal 
may become extinct in 10 years if the rate of slaughter increases 
the worlds biggest consumer of ivory japan bowed to 
international public opinion and announced at the end of october it 
would respect the ban in previous years the country had purchased 
about 40 percent of world ivory exports buying about 106 tons in 
1988 
britain had declared it would abide by the ban but only hours 
before the deadline filed a sixmonth reservation for hong kong 
the colony has no separate voting rights in the convention 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said the extension to the 
trading period was designed to give traders time to dispose of the 
legally acquired stocks 
a greenpeace spokesman in london said the organization was 
horrified by this governments sacrifice of the african elephant 
to appease the greed of the hong kong ivory barons 
news of agreement on the ban in october prompted demonstrations 
last year in hong kong where about 4000 people many of them 
elderly craftsmen earn their livelihood from carving ivory 
beijing has imported on average 50 tons of ivory each year and 
will be an important market for the african nations now that 
markets in the united states europe and japan are closed 
but an official from the international group said there was 
concern that despite government prohibitions residual demand in 
western countries will still be met by smuggled ivory be if from 
poached or legally killed beasts 
bans on trade in a number of other animal and plant species 
placed on the endangered list at the october meeting also entered 
into force thursday these include the salmoncrested cockatoo 
pacific island flying foxes and 60 types of orchid

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki asked 
parliament thursday to move up the date for democratic elections 
for local governments saying communist holdouts are resisting 
reform 
the governments most important task next to leading the 
nation out of economic collapse is the building of a strong and 
stable democratic foundation for a democratic system mazowiecki 
told the sejm the lower house of parliament 
until we create a real selfgovernment we will not defeat 
the resistance that we meet while introducing reforms 
parliament members rose to their feet and applauded his call for 
earlier elections despite concern that poles may blame the east 
blocs first noncommunist government for suffering caused by the 
radical economic and political reforms it imposed 
as a sign of that discontent more than 6000 miners demanding 
higher pay were on strike for a third day at five southern mines 
the official pap news agency reported the strikes are the first 
significant labor protest since the government began implementing 
the reforms 
the local elections had been expected in june or november but 
solidarity leader lech walesa on monday urged earlier balloting 
mazowiecki said the reforms are being implemented too slowly at 
the provincial and municipal levels where the communist officials 
remain in power 
during the 40minute speech mazowiecki also announced that 
legislation abolishing censorship will be submitted next week 
a law lifting restrictions on free speech and gatherings will be 
ready in february he said

mazowieckis speech from a gallery agrees with the new election 
timetable the prosolidrity gazeta wyborcza newspaper reported 
wednesday 
with a noncommunist prime minister and the communists power 
waning as economic reform sweeps staterun industries the 
provincial and municipal governments are a last area of control for 
the party apparatus 
the government elected in free and autonomous elections is 
executing its power in the name of the people and answers directly 
to them mazowiecki said we have never had such a 
selfgovernment since world war ii 
the law has allowed the prime minister to approve candidates for 
mayor before they are elected by municipal councils in that way 
all local governments were ultimately controlled by the 
communistdominated central government

party apparatus to run local affairs including commerce

parties

reform and a stable point on the european map 
our society accepting with dignity and calmness the 
difficulties connecting with the repairing of the economy arouses 
respect in many countries he said

of the region the failure of our efforts could make more difficult 
the evolution occurring in central and eastern europe he said 
the prime minister also assured poles that price increases will 
lessen as the economy moves toward capitalism he appealed to the 
increasingly restive agricultural sector to understand that the 
market must replace guaranteed prices for farm products

college and university leaders should treat 
students as individuals and integrate academic life with the 
nonacademic as a way to combat apathy alcohol abuse and racial 
and ethnic conflicts an educator said thursday 
what higher education needs today is not more rules but a new 
postinlocoparentis theory of campus governance a set of 
agreedupon standards to guide the conduct of all members of the 
community and give direction to the institution overall said 
ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching 
boyer addressing more than 1200 higher education leaders at an 
american council on education meeting suggested five principles 
that can serve as a framework within which a vital community of 
learning can be built 
colleges and universities must integrate the academic life with 
the nonacademic honor the sacredness of the individual and 
vigorously affirm equality of opportunity he said freedom of 
speech must be uncompromisingly protected and civility powerfully 
affirmed he said 
colleges and universities must have welldefined procedures that 
guide behavior for the common good as well as promote service 
and show support 
boyer said he was troubled by a 1989 carnegie survey that found 
student apathy alcohol abuse and racial and ethnic divisions 
those things he said weaken the vitality of many institutions 
administrators are understandably concerned about these 
problems but they also are we found ambivalent about how they 
should respond boyer said 
the study found twothirds of the professors interviewed believe 
their students are not academically wellprepared more than 60 
percent said they are teaching undergraduates what the students 
should have learned in high school and 55 percent said 
undergraduates were doing just enough to get by 
a separate study found 77 percent of students spent fewer than 
16 hours every week in outofclass study 
this is hardly surprising since according to the latest ace 
data threefourths of todays students have a job and work on 
average 37 hours every week boyer said 
the survey boyer said found a growing inclination among some 
students to use words as weapons of assault 
more than 60 percent of the presidents at research and doctoral 
institutions say sexual harassment is a problem and about half 
listed racial harassment as a problem he said 
boyer said twothirds of all college presidents rate alcohol 
abuse a serious problem while the figure is 82 precent at research 
and doctoral institutions 
when we asked all presidents to name their greatest concerns 
substance abuse especially alcohol was listed number one he 
said 
boyer a former us education commissioner said his proposals 
were a preview of an upcoming carnegie special report called 
campus life in search of community 
the yearlong study was launched in cooperation with the ace 
the coordinating body for higher education 
the carnegie foundation headquartered at princeton university 
was founded in 1905 as a policy center to strengthen american 
education

some us diplomatic missions boast an 
impressive array of weapons including antitank missiles to 
protect americas envoys from armed attacks according to a bush 
administration official 
the white house complained loudly after recently finding such 
weapons at the nicaraguan ambassadors residence in panama city and 
said the practice may violate international laws governing embassy 
activities 
the residence was supposed to be off limits to outsiders but the 
us forces had been led to believe that the ambassador lived 
elsewhere 
president bush called the incident a screwup but criticized 
the nicaraguan ambassador atenor ferrey for having weapons up 
to his eyeballs at the residence 
the remark angered an administration official who said the 
united states own efforts to rotect its diplomats sometimes 
include stashing large quantities of weapons at its missions 
if a hostile group entered us facilities in these countries 
dont you think they would find rpgs rocketpropelled 
grenades the official asked you dont think we have tow 
antitank missiles in some compounds 
several officials all requesting anonymity said the incident 
at the nicaraguan embassy and others in panama involving us 
troops may make american diplomats the targets of reprisals 
one administration official accusing the us military of 
failing to consider the possible fallout of its actions said we 
cannot conduct diplomacy on the basis of 25watt thinking 
over the last decade the state department has been working to 
enhance security at posts where us policies are highly 
controversial 
the potential vulnerability of diplomatic missions was 
underscored by the 1979 iran hostage crisis and the 1983 attack on 
the us embassy in lebanon which claimed 47 lives 
the discovery of the weapons cache at the nicaraguan embassy in 
panama prompted an administration statement jan 8 questioning the 
legality of the nicaraguan actions 
the us ambassador to the organization of american states 
luigi einaudi said in a speech to the oas that international law 
requires diplomatic missions to be used solely for diplomacy 
it would appear that the existence of a substantial arms cache 
in the ambassadors residence in panama is inconsistent with the 
diplomatic functions protected by the vienna convention einaudi 
said 
but the union of career us diplomats the american foreign 
service association said the incident at the nicaraguan embassy 
and others at the panamanian missions of the vatican cuba and peru 
may pose threats for us envoys 
the incidents put in jeopardy american diplomatic missions all 
over the world said perry shankle a former president of the 
association he was the only official interviewed who was willing 
to be quoted by name 
the association has expressed its concerns in a letter to 
defense secretary dick chaney 
the state department insists the united states subscribes fully 
to rules spelled out in the vienna convention of 1963 which set 
rules covering the rights and privileges of embassies 
on the other hand the department acknowledges that an unusual 
situation has prevailed in panama 
in an effort to track down panamanians who had served deposed 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega american troops have been 
checking cars entering and leaving the cuban mission some experts 
contend such vehicles apparently are exempt from such examination 
under international law 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler has said the 
cuban ambassadors car has very dark tinted windows which 
require troops guarding the mission to open the doors to identify 
the passengers 
but one state department official who asked not to be named said 
the action exposes every american ambassador to the possibility 
of an armed blockade he would have to agree to be searched this 
is appalling this is the most appalling thing ive ever seen

china has released 573 people arrested for their 
part in prodemocracy protests last spring and held for six months 
or more without being formally charged it was reported thursday 
the lawbreakers were released after they pleaded guilty 
and showed repentance the official xinhua news agency quoted a 
public security ministry official as saying 
the report did not provide the names of any of the released and 
chinese sources familiar with those being let go say it does not 
appear that any leading student activists from the apriljune 
democracy movement are among the freed 
chinese sources reported recently that significant numbers of 
people were being released including students but none was a 
leader of the movement 
the releases like the lifting of martial law in beijing last 
week seemed directed at foreign governments that are considering 
whether to resume soft loans to china 
the martial law decision did little to ease political repression 
in the capital still guarded by largerthanusual troop and police 
forces 
western nations have urged china to lift martial law and release 
political prisoners as measures needed to restore relations 
strained by the beijing governments bloody suppression of the 
democracy movement 
thousands of students and their supporters were detained 
nationwide after the military attack of june 34 that killed 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
the official media have reported the executions of 20 people 
none of whom were students for rioting during the nationwide 
turmoil 
chinese sources say others have been executed secretly or 
sentenced to lengthy jail terms but an official news blackout has 
left it unclear how many remain in prison and whether charges have 
been brought against the detainees 
chinese law says prosecutors must file formal charges in court 
within 45 days after a person is detained but authorities may 
extend that period in serious cases and the law is widely ignored 
also ignored is the legal requirement to notify families many of 
whom received the first word on their relatives fate when they 
were released 
the ministry official said public security departments always 
strictly observed the law and proceeded from facts in dealing with 
these lawbreakers who took part in the counterrevolutionary riots 
he said our policy is to educate anyone who can be educated 
and temper punishment with leniency 
he said he hoped others who broke the law and obstinately 
stuck to the wrong course would repent and plead guilty for 
leniency 
chinese sources say that many of those released still must 
report to police once a week for further investigation and 
confession writing some have had their academic degrees withheld 
or are unable to get jobs

the issue raymond buckey and his mother 
peggy mcmartin buckey wanted the jury to consider was not whether 
they were perfect people but whether they were guilty people 
the buckeys spoke openly at the mcmartin preschool mass 
molestation trial about buckeys problems with alcohol his 
collection of pornographic photos and mrs buckeys own molestation 
as a child 
but they strongly argued that such dirty laundry as they 
characterized it fell far short of proving them to be child 
molesters 
i never in my life have harmed a child nor could i comprehend 
how anyone could harm a child buckey testified in a 1986 bail 
hearing in his first statements to the court 
the buckeys were the last remaining defendants in wha started 
out in 1983 as the largest and most sensational child molestation 
case ever seven defendants accused of molesting as many as 125 
children 
charges were dropped against five defendants leaving the mother 
and son to face 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of 
conspiracy involving the alleged molestations of 11 children at 
their familyowned school 
during a 2year trial some of the former students testified in 
detail of being molested by the buckeys and spoke of being 
photographed playing games like naked movie star and watching 
buckey mutilate small animals 
the buckeys were jailed through much of the case 
ive been isolated in a nightmare buckey said after his 
release in february on 15 million bail his mother eventually was 
released on 295000 bail 
we are all innocent and have not done one thing wrong mrs 
buckey said in may 
mrs buckey 63 was director of the preschool which closed in 
1984 
she became involved in the 1960s running one of two 
familyowned preschools she took charge of both several years 
later when her mother and school founder virginia mcmartin began 
having health problems in 1976 the schools merged 
fond of loud muumuus and flashy jewelry mrs buckey was 
described by parents as flamboyant almost to the point of being 
tactless she surprised many parents for instance when she 
admitted that as a girl she was molested by a neighbor 
she also said she kept a close eye on her son who started 
working at the school in 1981 after dropping out of san diego state 
university among his duties were watching children as they napped 
or checking on children who stayed awake to play during the lunch 
hour 
mrs buckey watched her son so closely that to allay the fears 
of a parent worried about a man working at the school she checked 
to see if he became aroused when students climbed onto his lap she 
said he did not 
mrs buckey characterized her son as a good teacher except for 
a problem with maintaining classroom discipline she said her son 
loved children and became a better teacher as he gained experience 
he told me he felt very comfortable that he enjoyed working 
with children and felt children accepted him she said he did 
not always feel that way about adults the children liked him for 
what he was 
other witnesses including buckey himself testified about his 
drinking problem his use of marijuana and his habit of wearing 
shorts without underwear once a student grabbed his genitals in a 
classroom mrs buckey testified 
buckey also said he collected adult photos which he used to 
sexually gratify himself 
but buckey denied he was guilty of child molestation 
i have no sexual desire for children he testified in 
august i never have and never will

detention of opposition leaders aung san suu kyi and tin oo 
other pamphlets contained the texts of voice of america radio 
broadcasts critical of the government he said

the white house broke with its usual practice 
of not commenting on federal reserve policy thursday by suggesting 
that cuts in interest rates are justified by current economic 
conditions 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the jan 8 
reduction in the prime rate by banks to 10 percent from 105 
percent hasnt been totally passed through and that the 
administration hoped it would be 
although it has engaged in more subtle forms of credit easing 
the fed has not changed its bellwether discount rate the rate for 
shortterm loans it charges to banks and other financial 
institutions for nearly a year 
the discount rate stands at 7 percent usually changes in that 
rate by the fed result in changes in other interest rates 
throughout the economy 
asked whether the administration was intentionally sending a 
message to the independent central bank from the white house 
briefing room fitzwater said this is not a new message but 
its important occasionally to point out that lower interest rates 
are normally good for the economy 
his comments came amid reports that momentum for easing interest 
rates at the fed may have ended 
fitzwater said recent economic reports argue for an easier 
credit policy 
fitzwater in particular said thursdays report by the commerce 
department that housing starts fell by 8 percent in december was 
not good news and was well below market expectations 
thats the best indicator we have i mean housing starts are 
more responsive to interest rates than anything else he said 
fitzwater said bush will tell the national association of 
homebuilders in atlanta on friday that interest rates are going 
down 
the president will also tell his audience we hope lower 
rates will be translated into increased market sales and that we 
have always favored lower interest rates and we still do 
fitzwater also reacted to an article in thursdays editions of 
the wall street journal quoting two fed members vice chairman 
manuel johnson and wayne angell as indicating that lower interest 
rates were not likely in the near future 
were hopeful that they the fed will take a look at this 
mornings indicators and understand that these numbers are low and 
indicate that inflation has remained very steady over the last 
seven or eight years and that lower interest rates are justified 
the spokesman said 
the article said the comments of the two fed members who have 
led the move for lower interest rates in recent months made 
further easing by the fed unlikely for now 
although the fed has not lowered the discount rate since last 
february it has engaged in financial finetuning since last june 
that has relieved pressure on interest rates 
the most recent was action last dec 20 in supplying extra 
reserves to the banking system that enabled banks to lower the rate 
they charge each other for overnight loans the socalled federal 
funds rate to 825 percent from 925 percent 
to further bolster the administrations case that interest rates 
should be further lowered fitzwater cited the labor departments 
thursday report that showed inflation had grown a moderate 04 
percent in december and had increased by 46 percent for all of 
1989 
although it was the highest annual increase since 1981 bush 
said the cpi report showed in general that inflation is low and 
under control 
asked whether bush had spoken to federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan recently on the subject of interest rates fitzwater 
said he has spoken to him so often im not sure thats 
relevant 
david berson an economist for the federal national mortgage 
association said white house jawboning of the fed is to be 
expected 
every administration wants lower interest rates he said 
i dont think the current administration is different from any 
administraion 
furthermore he said he did not think the low housing start 
figure was evidence of any basic weakness in housing its 
evidence only that we had very bad weather in december he said

undersea explorer jacquesyves cousteau said 
thursday the six children he took along on his recent mission to 
antarctica sometimes had a sweet view of what constitutes a good 
time 
during one jampacked day when the group went to see colonies of 
penguins seals and other creatures from the ice continent they 
stopped at a polish research station on the way back to their ship 
cousteau said when he asked one of the children if hed had a 
good day the child replied oh it was great they gave us 
cookies at the polish station 
cousteau left jan 3 from chile for antarctica with one child 
from each of the six other continents the children ages 11 and 
12 returned to chile on sunday 
the mission was meant to symbolize that antarctica belongs to 
future generations not to us he said 
the cousteau society has joined an international initiative 
sponsored by the french and australian governments to declare 
antarctica a natural reserve and land of science and ban mining 
or other industrial activities 
cousteau said they built an igloo a symbolic home while 
there and some group members slept one night in it 
the next morning we brought them a big thermos of hot 
chocolate and cakes he said they were happy like clams

chancellor helmut kohl long vague 
about the eastern border of an eventually reunified germany 
appears to be abandoning claims to what is now polish territory as 
a means of easing european fears of german revanchism 
a day after kohl assured poles that germans do not covet 
territory lost after world war ii the leader of the free democrats 
who share power with kohls party called thursday for formal 
recognition of the current polish borders 
kohl made his most convincing promise to date about the security 
of the polishgerman border during a speech in paris on wednesday 
before the french institute of foreign relations 
we want a durable reconciliation with poland and to that 
belongs the certainty that those in poland know that they live 
within secure borders kohl said no one wants a second 
exiling as the first one was horrible enough 
after the nazi defeat in world war ii millions of germans were 
driven from their homelands when the territory was deeded to 
poland about 2 million of the impoverished and defeated germans 
died during the forced exile 
kohl has been criticized for failing to assure poland that its 
current western border would be respected by a reunified germany 
calls by some bonn government figures for reunification within 
the 1937 borders have made european neighbors fearful of a 
revanchist germany one that would seek to recover territory lost 
with the war 
finance minister theo waigel leader of the archconservative 
christian social union of bavaria is most prominent among those 
west german officials to have openly coveted the lost german 
territories 
waigels csu and the liberal free democrats under otto graf 
lambsdorff are the junior partners in bonns threeparty governing 
coalition 
lambsdorff fanned the border issue during a parliamentary debate 
thursday when he proposed that the bundestag and the east german 
parliament jointly declare recognition of the border between 
germany and poland to be the oder and neisse rivers the current 
delineation 
kohl has contended only a formal peace treaty between poland and 
germany could establish permanent boundaries but he made no effort 
to contradict his coalition partner during the bundestag session he 
attended 
the chancellor said in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the 
sept 1 1939 nazi invasion of poland that west germany holds no 
claims to territory in poland 
but then and again before his november visit to warsaw kohl 
argued he could not commit an eventually reunified germany to the 
border policies of the western state 
prospects for return to a single germany have brightened 
considerably over the past two months since the berlin wall and 
other borders were thrown open and east germans began welcoming 
closer ties with their western brothers 
poles and other europeans have grown increasingly uneasy during 
that time fearing that those in east germany and west germany 
could seek to recover the former german territories now part of 
poland and the soviet union 
kohls speech in paris offered no concrete promises but its 
tone and references to the horrors of exile appeared aimed at 
assuring poles and others that the border would not be tampered 
with 
the germans and no one should doubt it have no intention 
of starting in tomorrows europe a discussion about frontiers which 
would necessarily compromise the order of european peace to which 
we all aspire together he said 
west german newspapers on thursday hailed the paris speech as

they were evenly matched two against two 
veteran prosecutors and defense attorneys equally obsessed with the 
mcmartin preschool molestation case that consumed their careers for 
years 
in the prosecution corner sat lael rubin 47 english teacher 
turned prosecutor whose belief in the guilt of the defendants 
propelled her to push on in a case many said was unwinnable 
ms rubin a 1978 graduate of the university of west los angeles 
school of law spent nearly six years on this crusade and for half 
of that time was assisted by roger gunson 50 a taciturn 
prosecutor who once saw his most famous defendant roman polanski 
slip out of the country to avoid sentencing gunson a graduate 
of ucla law school stepped in when two prosecutors bowed out in a 
storm of controversy 
on the defense side of the courtroom sat two lawyers as 
different as opposite sides of a coin danny davis 43 a 
texasborn advocate with a smooth voice and an inexhaustible supply 
of verbiage represented raymond buckey with a zeal that bordered 
on excess he argued buckeys innocence with the fervor of a 
revival preacher and personally attacked those who opposed him 
davis is a former marine corps captain and a graduate of the 
university of texas at austin he handled corporate and civil 
litigation but few criminal cases before he took on raymond 
buckeys defense 
his cocounsel dean gits 45 a los angeles defense attorney 
since 1972 was so soft spoken that sometimes he could not be heard 
in court gits always gave polite deference to his client peggy 
mcmartin buckey he fought hard in his quiet way to defend a woman 
he believed was innocent 
overseeing the combatants was the stern superior court judge 
william pounders a legal scholar who often seemed pushed beyond 
his endurance by the mcmartin case 
once he told participants he felt that everyone who ever 
touched the case was poisoned by it and he spoke of his own 
attraction to it as a moth to a flame 
to his chagrin the case stretched over 2 years becoming the 
longest and costliest in us history with a price tag over 15 
million 
buckey 31 and his mother 63 were charged with 65 counts of 
conspiracy and molestation at their family owned preschool in 
manhattan beach five other defendants originally charged had their 
charges dismissed after a preliminary hearing 
pounders nemesis in the long trial was davis and he often 
denounced the defense attorneys tactics he used a computer to 
keep track of how long davis spent on each crossexamination and 
scolded him for prolonging the trial 
once after listening to davis question a burly exfelon for 
five days about buckeys purported jailhouse confession pounders 
declared he was ending davis inquiry 
at some point youve got to sit down and shut up and im 
saying that time is now he told davis 
i trust the court is not angry with counsel davis replied 
unflustered 
yes i am pounders snapped i dont want to spend the 
rest of my life sitting here being bored to death 
pounders 50 was appointed to the los angeles county superior 
court in april 1985 after serving almost 13 years as a deputy 
attorney general and two years as a los angeles municipal judge 
a loyola law school graduate pounders is regarded as a highly 
intelligent jurist who has compiled a meticulously organized file 
of more than 20000 notations on index cards as references for his 
rulings

christian gen michel aoun escalated his 
drive to muzzle dissent in the media thursday by suspending the 
operations of one newspaper and barring another from the christian 
enclave he controls 
the albayrak newspaper was ordered to stop publishing for seven 
days it was the second such order by aoun this week 
aoun also started legal proceedings against the newspaper for 
defying a directive he issued tuesday which barred the media from 
referring to elias hrawi as the president of lebanon 
aoun refused to accept hrawis government because it was formed 
as part of a peace accord that aoun opposed 
until now lebanons press the freest in the arab world had 
remained unfettered throughout the 14yearold civil war 
the latest measures left only the conservative newspaper 
ananwar functioning in the christian enclave 
ananwar has adhered to aouns rules calling hrawi mr elias 
hrawi and referring to the prime minister whom aoun also refuses 
to recognize as professor salim hoss hoss holds a doctorate 
in economics 
the christian regions leading daily addiyar was ordered 
wednesday to cease publication for a week because it defied aoun 
albayrak followed aouns order wednesday but on thursday 
publisher milhem karam published a frontpage editorial in which he 
vowed to defend press freedom 
radio and tv stations in the israelicontrolled zone in south 
lebanon usually sympathetic to the christian army commander also 
ignored aoun 
so did middle east television a branch of the rev pat 
robertsons fundamentalist christian broadcasting corp which 
broadcasts from the southern zone 
three radio stations maintained a news strike for a third day to 
protest aouns measures 
the army generals troops stopped a truck carrying copies of the 
frenchlanguage lorientle jour from entering east beirut from the 
moslem sector in the west 
an official from the distribution company said an army captain 
told the truck driver lorientle jour is banned for not abiding 
by the generals directives 
the annahar newspaper the nations most prestigious 
arabiclanguage daily did not publish for a second straight day to 
protest aouns orders it is published in west beirut but most of 
its editorial staff live in the christian enclave and commute daily 
lorientle jour and annahar had been the only west 
beirutbased papers allowed by aoun to sell in the 310squaremile 
christian enclave 
the remaining four dailies operating in west beirut have not 
been allowed into the christian enclave for more than a year 
because of their strong opposition to aouns policies 
the leftist newspaper assafir which operates from west beirut 
said aoun was isolating the media in east beirut in preparation 
for declaring his own state of free lebanon in the enclave 
the ban the paper said was the first step in a series of 
measures that the general wants to apply hell partition the 
unions the economy and everything in lebanon 
aouns directive said hrawi should only be referred to as a 
former parliament deputy 
hrawi was elected president under a peace plan worked out by 
lebanese legislators in october aoun opposed the peace plan 
because it did not include a deadline for the withdrawal of syrian 
troops who were deployed in lebanon in 1976 to quell civil war 
fighting 
aoun said the syrians abrogated their mandate by siding with the 
moslems in the war and he has vowed to drive them out

a leading palestinian activist was accused in 
court papers thursday of giving money to a plobacked underground 
group and supporting its plans for guerrilla attacks in israel 
army radio said 
in another court case the army filed charges against col 
yehuda meir the highestranking officer to face trial during the 
25monthold palestinian revolt in the occupied west bank and the 
gaza strip 
soldiers shot and wounded 17 palestinians during stonethrowing 
clashes in in the occupied lands arab hospital officials said the 
army said it was checking the reports 
palestinian feisal husseini was listed as an unindicted 
coconspirator in documents filed at the start of a trial of five 
other palestinians 
a military court in lod has charged the five ages 19 to 35 
with forming a plosupported popular army unit to carry out the 
orders of the underground leadership of the uprising 
according to court documents husseini gave the men 450 to buy 
uniforms in october 
military prosecutor capt roni shapira told the court that a 
member of the group informed husseini of its plans to carry out 
attacks in israel the army radio said husseini voiced support for 
the idea and agreed to discuss guerrilla action but the suspects 
were arrested before they could meet court papers say 
husseini denied the claims there is no truth to that story 
he said in an interview 
husseini 49 heads the nowclosed arab studies society in east 
jerusalem he spent 18 months in israeli prisons at the start of 
the uprising but was never charged or tried 
in recent weeks israel has issued two orders banning him from 
traveling to the occupied lands and abroad the bans also applied 
to six other palestinians and drew a strong protest from the united 
states which said the move could hurt the middle east peace 
process 
husseini scion of a large and influential palestinian family 
is expected to play a leading role if israelipalestinian peace 
talks are held 
he has said that the uprisings most pressing aim this year is 
to win the confidence of israelis who deeply distrust palestinian 
declarations of peaceful intentions 
earlier this week attorney general yosef harish said he will 
investigate remarks husseini made at a news conference that 
allegedly supported collaborator killings 
during the uprising palestinians have killed at least 170 
fellow arabs accusing them of helping israeli authorities 
another 648 palestinians have been killed by israelis 43 
israelis also have died in the violence 
meir who served as military commander of nablus the largest 
town in the west bank is charged with ordering soldiers to beat 
and break the limbs of 20 bound and gagged arabs in january 1988 
israel radio said 
troops under meirs command left beaten and bound palestinians 
in a field until other arabs arrived and rushed them to a hospital 
the armys chief of staff lt gen dan shomron reprimanded 
meir and gave him the choice of leaving the army or facing trial 
meir resigned but the supreme court last month overturned the 
militarys decision not to prosecute him 
meir is charged with improper conduct abuse and causing 
grievous bodily harm if convicted he faces a prison sentence of 
up to 20 years israel radio said

for the second year in a 
row tragedy in the armenian community in the soviet union has 
muted christmas festivites for armenian christians here 
the small armenian community in israel canceled some christmas 
eve festivities thursday because of the ethnic fighting in two 
southern soviet republics that has left dozens of armenians dead 
and thousands homeless 
jerusalems armenian patriarch yeghishe derderian accused 
moscow of not doing enough to stop the violence in which moslem 
azeri turks are battling christian armenians in the latest round of 
a protracted ethnic conflict 
we condemn the negligent attitude of the soviet authorities in 
the past derderian said he appealed to world leaders to act 
with the utmost speed to stop the continuing bloodbath 
the soviet union sent thousands of troops to the area but 
scores of people have been killed since saturday many of them 
armenians who were attacked by mobs in the azerbaijani capital 
baku terrorized armenians were fleeing the region by the thousands 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek who met with derderian this week 
said thursday that he offered his assistance to bring armenian 
refugees to jerusalem kollek said he also sent messages to the 
mayors of cities with large armenian populations including new 
york san francisco and st louis asking them to speak up and 
protest the bloodshed 
armenian christians in israel said they would mark christmas 
with religious services but not exchange gifts or hold parties i 
dont see any reason why we should be celebrating said nassri 
nasser 43 a municipal employee in bethlehem its even worse 
than last year 
on dec 7 1988 25000 soviet armenians were killed in an 
earthquake casting a pall over christmas festivities for armenians 
in bethlehem 
we are going through a tough time said george hintlian an 
aide to the patriarch we decided there will be no festivities 
only religious services 
the highlight of the armenian christmas is the midnight mass 
celebrated by derderian in the church of the nativity in bethlehem 
the patriarch arrived at manger square on thursday escorted by 
israeli troops and police 
about 4000 armenian christians live in israel and the occupied 
west bank 
the armenian church is one of the eastern rite churches that are 
organized along ethnic lines and accept the authority of the pope 
but have considerable autonomy in ritual and questions of 
discipline armenian christians celebrate christmas on dec 25 
jan 6 or jan 18 depending on the sect they belong to

maine voters never intended to give felons 
the right to carry guns in amending the state constitution two 
years ago a state attorney told the maine supreme judicial court 
on thursday 
but a lawyer whose client escaped prosecution on a charge of 
possession of a firearm by a felon on the basis of the 
constitutional amendment said its wording leaves little room for 
any other interpretation 
you would have to call black white daniel bates said during 
an hourlong hearing dominated by spirited exchanges between the 
justices and the lawyers 
assistant attorney general charles k leadbetter said the trial 
judge committed a fundamental error in dismissing the charge 
against edward brown of cumberland 
leadbetter said that state lawmakers in sending the amendment 
out to the voters made clear in their statements that it was 
intended simply to clarify the right to bear arms not to supplant 
any existing restrictions on who may carry guns 
the legislature expressly addressed itself to that 
leadbetter said asserting that it makes absolutely no sense 
from logic or law to ignore the legislative history 
what youre saying is that nothing changed with the passage 
of the amendment said justice david g roberts 
leadbetter said nothing changed in the voters perception 
some of the justices questioned how comments made by legislators 
prior to the referendum could override its clear wording 
the enactors were the people not the legislature said 
justice caroline d glassman the legislature gave its opinion 
bates said maine lawmakers could have included language stating 
that certain restrictions are allowed as about 40 other states 
have done 
the brown case fostered an unusual alliance among the national 
rifle association the national center to prevent handgun violence 
the sportsmans alliance of maine and the maine chiefs of police 
association all of which supported the states appeal 
last july a lower court judge dismissed a charge of possession 
of a firearm by a felon against brown who previously had been 
convicted under the states habitual offender law for operating a 
motor vehicle after his drivers license had been revoked 
superior court justice stephen l perkins cited the 
constitutional amendment that voters approved in november 1987 and 
also found no rational connection between browns earlier 
conviction and his possession of a firearm 
perkins ruling did not affect the portion of the law 
restricting the possession of guns by people convicted of crimes 
involving the use of dangerous weapons 
the amended state constitution reads every citizen has the 
right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be 
questioned the amendment deleted wording that said the right was 
for the common defense

vice president dan quayle facing resistance 
to proposed visits to several latin american nations may have to 
settle for talks with some leaders outside their home countries 
administration officials indicated thursday 
without going into detail quayle said that by the end of a 
march trip to presidential inaugurations in brazil and chile 
following a jan 27 trip to the inauguration in honduras he 
believed we will have personally communicated with almost every 
leader in the hemisphere 
however several countries have signaled that it is too soon for 
quayle visits because of simmering resentment over the us 
military invasion of panama officials said 
quayle speaking thursday of his scheduled trip to the 
inauguration in tegucigalpa said therell be a lot of leaders 
there if we are able to work in the schedule and meet most of them 
its not necessary just to go and pay a courtesy call in each 
individual nation he said in an interview with the associated 
press 
he is expected to carry president bushs explanations regarding 
the dec 20 panama invasion which rankled the latin world 
aides said other as yet undetermined stops are expected on the 
midmarch trip to brazil and chile 
quayle said he will not meet with the leaders of peru colombia 
and bolivia because bush will see them feb 15 at the colombia 
summit meeting on how to fight illicit drugs 
the vice presidents aides are scheduling at least four 
bilateral sessions with heads of state who attend the honduras 
inauguration said his press secretary david beckwith 
he did not specify the countries 
aides have said scheduling of the trip has been bogged down by 
reaction from countries such as venezuela where some officials have 
said it would not be good for quayle to come while troops remain in 
panama 
in caracas venezuelas foreign minister reinaldo figueredo 
said thursday we understand hes not coming but refused to 
say why 
figueredo had said a day earlier however maybe his visit is 
not the most adequate step to be taken given the conditions that 
exist with respect to the us invasion of panama 
quayle on thursday characterized the latin response as its 
not dont come its a matter of timing when you would come a 
day earlier he acknowledged that diplomatic sensitivities had 
come into play in planning the trip 
the administration on thursday tried to play down those problems 
at the same time it acknowledged inability to schedule visits to 
some capitals 
some of the trips may have to be scheduled for a later 
time but well continue to work on that said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
obviously there were concerns in latin america following the 
panama situation obviously there were reasons why the president 
felt it was necessary to reiterate our support and our interest in 
working with them he said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler sought to 
deflect reports that quayle is unwelcome at this time by stating 
that bush in announcing quayles trip did not list a specific 
time he did not list specific dates he very clearly said how 
important this region is to us 
bush announced jan 5 he would dispatch quayle to explain to the 
latins that he had not unleashed the us military in panama 
without a rationale 
but quayle said his goal is not to go down on any 
fencemending mission or going down to apologize but essentially 
create an understanding of how do we go about establishing a 
democratic government in panama 
he said he would push for countries to recognized the 
usinstalled government of guillermo endara

a judge on thursday denied requests for a 
gag order and for questioning of grand jurors about their 
objectivity in the case of a man authorities say killed 11 women 
attorney david murante sought the gag order to prevent police 
and other officials from commenting further on the case of arthur 
j shawcross a grand jury is to begin hearing evidence friday in 
the case 
murante said many comments made by police and the district 
attorney to the press about shawcross have appeared to convict his 
client before he is tried 
i dont know how my client can ever hope to receive a fair 
trial he said i dont see how any grand jury can hear this 
case fairly 
but monroe county judge charles t maloy said a gag order would 
be impractical there always will be sources and news leaks he 
said 
shawcross was at the hearing but did not speak 
murante also asked that the grand jury investigation be 
postponed 45 days and that jurors be questioned individually to 
determine if publicity about the case had influenced them maloy 
denied both requests but said he will remind jurors to base 
decisions solely on the evidence 
prosecutor charles siragusa said a gag order is an extreme 
measure that would have been impossible to enforce over the eight 
months to a year it could take before the case comes to trial 
shawcross 44 was arrested jan 3 he has been charged with 
nine counts of murder in the deaths of nine women the grand jury 
is to review those charges as well as two other killings police 
believe he committed 
he was paroled to rochester in 1987 after serving 15 years in 
prison for the 1972 strangulation of an 8yearold girl in 
watertown

the federal nuclear regulatory commission 
said thursday it will make a decision within three weeks on 
licensing the seabrook nh nuclear power plant 
the announcement by nrc chairman kenneth carr came after the 
commission listened for three hours as plant operators and the nrc 
staff reported that the long embattled plant is ready to begin 
producing electricity at full power in a victory for plant 
opponents the nrc agreed to rule on several contested issues 
including emergency evacuation plans before deciding on the 
license 
under the schedule outlined thursday a decision to grant a 
fullpower license could mean that seabrook would be producing 
enough electricity to power a million new england homes by may 
there is reasonable assurance that the plant can and will be 
operated without endangering the health and safety of the public 
the nrc staff concluded in its report to the commission the 
staff recommends commission approval to issue a fullpower 
license 
thomas murley the nrcs director of nuclear reactor regulation 
told the commission that emergency preparedness at seabrook is 
adequate to support fullpower operations 
conceived more than two decades ago the plant built near a salt 
marsh two miles north of the massachusetts border cost 64 billion 
and the price tag is still rising seabrook has generated mass 
protests by environmentalists lawsuits by massachusetts officials 
and bankruptcy protection for its beleaguered principal owner 
public service company of new hampshire 
according to opponents there are three crucial issues under 
dispute which the nrc must consider whether evacuation plans are 
adequate what is the definition of adequate and how to 
resolve a disagreement between to lowerlevel nrc boards over 
aspects of the new hampshire evacuation plans aspects that 
include the availability of shelter for beach crowds and the role 
of school teachers in an emergency

israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin wound 
up talks with bush administration officials thursday saying he had 
reason to believe us assistance to his country would hold 
steady at 3 billion a year through 1991 
but rabin registered concern beyond next year saying israels 
budget is strained by a rising influx of soviet jews and increased 
soviet weapons shipments to syria iraq and libya 
he also indicated that secretary of state james a baker iii was 
unable to resolve a diplomatic impasse that is delaying mideast 
negotiations on the future of the israeliheld west bank and gaza 
there are still gaps that remain between the palestinians and 
israelis rabin told israeli reporters 
the key question is whether the palestine liberation 
organization will have even an indirect role in the negotiations 
that baker hopes to launch 
rabin stressed israels budget problems and concerns about us 
aid after he saw baker 
when it comes to the middle east the glasnost is not seen 
there rabin said 
he referred to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
openness which has lowered barriers to jews seeking to emigrate 
at the same time rabin said the soviets had increased both the 
flow and quality of arms to the three arab countries 
in view of all this we believe that we deserve the 
continuation of the level of support that we get rabin said 
israel is the largest recipient of american foreign assistance 
receiving 18 billion in military aid and 12 billion in economic 
aid out of a worldwide budget of 146 billion 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas apparently with the 
support of the administration proposed this week diverting about 
400 million from current recipients to eastern europe and panama 
but congressional sources said thursday that president bush 
planned to ask congress to boost spending on foreign aid and other 
international operations by about 18 billion in 1991 forgoing 
cuts in assistance to israel 
meanwhile it was learned the us ambassador to israel in an 
assessment for the state department concluded israel could get 
along with less than the 12 billion it receives in economic aid 
a us official who declined to be identified said ambassador 
william browns assessment first reported in the washington times 
was the sort american embassies make periodically throughout the 
world 
still doles proposal and assertions tuesday by the state 
department it seeks flexibility in distributing foreign aid 
has raised concerns in israel 
the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
baker had told rabin that the united states has always supported 
israel and will continue to support israel 
asked if us aid would be trimmed ms tutwiler said i have 
never heard secretary baker discuss any cuts for israel or for any 
other country specifically for this year 
israels concerns go beyond 1991 however and while there seems 
little doubt us aid will go to the country the question is 
whether it will be less than 3 billion 
rabin did not say who assured him that israel could count on 
current levels at least through fiscal year 1991 which ends sept 
30 1991 but he made the statement in discussing a meeting he held 
wednesday evening with defense secretary dick cheney 
i believe that for this fiscal year the budget is approved 
and unless there will be cuts which i hope will not take place 
there will be continuation rabin said when it comes to fiscal 
year 1991 i have the reasons to believe there will be no reduction 
in the support to israel 
asked if he meant both military and economic aid rabin replied 
the answer is yes 
defense department spokesman pete williams asked if it were 
true that foreign aid to israel would not be cut responded 
thats fundamentally correct 
rabin met alone with baker for 40 minutes the discussion 
continued in the presence of us and israeli aides for another 20 
minutes 
asked if there was a breakthrough on the diplomatic front 
spokeswoman tutwiler said were still working 
baker has been trying for three months to arrange a meeting in 
washington with foreign ministers moshe arens of israel of esmat 
abdelmeguid of egypt 
the main obstacle is disagreement over the palestine liberation 
organization 
israel seeks to preclude any plo role in the session and future 
negotiations leading up to elections on the west bank and gaza 
baker is due to meet on friday with abdelmeguid their third 
session this week

the government thursday called off a 
national referendum on outlawing the communist party and reimposing 
the death penalty saying it promised the vote in a fit of near 
panic and had made a mistake 
the leadership made clear it will stick to its earlier decisions 
to ban capital punishment and allow the communist party to be legal 
moves that prompted huge protests one week ago 
the governing national salvation front tried to appease the 
angry demonstrators by scheduling a referendum jan 28 to decide 
the death penalty issue and by announcing a ban on the communist 
party 
the following day president ion iliescu revoked the ban saying 
it had been a hasty decision he said the partys fate also would 
be put on the referendum 
during a news conference announcing the cancellation spokesman 
silviu brucan also disclosed more abuses of deposed dictator 
nicolae ceausescu he said officials learned that ceausescu had 
access to dozens of palaces and villas and ran agricultural 
enterprises that provided hardtoget food items to the communist 
elite 
the decision to call off the vote was made wednesday night 
during a meeting of front leaders 
at that meeting iliescu vice president dumitru mazilu and 
premier petre roman admitted the decision to hold the referendum 
was a political mistake brucan said 
he said the leadership was guilty of almost panicky 
decisionmaking under the pressure of the demonstrators jan 12 
and added it would be impossible to arrange such a vote in such a 
short amount of time 
brucan bristled when asked whether the decision meant the 
government does not view public demonstrations as a form of 
dialogue 
countries in the west put limits on demonstrations he 
responded and added dont ask us to be more democratic than the 
british or americans 
the council agreed wednesday that future decrees on political 
matters will be discussed by the entire council before being 
announced he said 
the romanian people are learning democracy and we are learning 
to govern democratically he said learning presupposes that 
you make mistakes my hope is we will not make too big ones 
the front outlawed the death penalty after the dec 25 
executions of ceausescu and his wife elena who were found guilty 
by a military court of genocide and of ruining romanias economy 
after the executions brucan said we joined the civilized 
world by abolishing the death penalty maintained by nicolae 
ceausescu against the spirit of the romanian people 
brucan said those who led ceausescus regime will be punished 
very severely for life 
the decision follows statements against the death penalty by 
several european leaders who have visited romania recently to 
discuss foreign aid 
the ban on the communist party was reversed because it was 
antidemocratic and against the principles of the national 
salvation front brucan said 
in the world there is no democracy that forbids by law the 
existence of the communist party he said 
brucan quoted iliescu as saying that all those who served in 
high places in the communist party and the state under ceausescu 
should gradually be removed 
but brucan also said this policy should take into account their 
professional competence and moral character 
romanian newspapers and opposition figures have complained that 
several of leading members of the national salvation front also 
were leaders under ceausescu 
they include brucan and the vice president mazilu who led 
anticommunist chants at the jan 12 demonstration brucan said 
mazilu apologized wednesday night for allowing himself to be 
pressured by the crowd 
brucan said the assets of the communist party will become the 
property of the entire romanian people and will belong to the 
state 
these include ceausescus former residences in bucharest the 
nearby resort of snagov and the mountain resorts of sinaia and 
predeal which were among what brucan termed 21 palaces the 
dictator used 
in addition he said ceausescu had a villa available for his use 
anytime in each of romanias 41 counties and 20 hunting lodges 
the carpati trust run by the party managed 60 enterprises 
with a yearly profit of 420 million including 220 million in 
hard currency brucan said 
the communist party also controlled 45 agroindustrial 
enterprises employing 80000 people who produced 40 million tons of 
meat 20 million tons of milk and 40 million eggs each year to feed 
the communist elite he said besides exporting produce at a profit 
of 15 million a year 
under ceausescus 24year rule many of romanias ordinary 
citizens endured severe hardships incuding shortages of heat and 
food while the dictator focused on paying off the countrys 
foreign debt 
a militarycivilian uprising drove ceausescu from office dec 22 
brucan said the government will now focus on organizing national 
elections the national salvation front proposed the election for 
april but opposition leaders want it put off at least until june 
so they have more time to organize 
a key dispute in planning the election will be whether the army 
which made ceausescus overthrow possible by backing the revolt 
will be allowed to sit in parliament brucan said 
he noted that romanians have had no experience with free 
elections since world war ii and that the government may accept 
international supervision of the vote

the worm program that disabled thousands 
of computers nationwide was intended simply to enter computers but 
an error caused it to go haywire the graduate student who designed 
it testified thursday 
my purpose was to see if i could write a program that would 
spread as widely as possible robert t morris told jurors in his 
federal computer tampering trial 
the worm spread on the network far faster than i expected 
said morris 25 who spoke publicly for the first time about the 
november 1988 attack that paralyzed an estimated 6000 computers 
linked to the internet network 
the suspended cornell university student said he designed the 
worm to break into internet when questioned by federal prosecutor 
mark rasch 
morris said he gathered passwords from various universities and 
without permission decoded them to ensure the worm would spread 
widely he also said he took steps to make the worm harmless and 
protect it from easy eradication 
during questioning by defense attorney thomas guidoboni morris 
said he included mechanisms to limit the worms growth and 
programmed the worm so it would not cause permanent damage to 
existing files in computers it attacked 
morris said it was difficult to limit the worms growth and 
safeguard against easy detection of the worm to stop it from 
entering their systems 
morris thought the worm would duplicate a few times a day or 
every few hours but he made a programming error that caused the 
worm to replicate wildly 
once i released it i had essentially no contacts at all with 
it i couldnt control it he said 
morris said he let the worm enter the internet network through 
computers at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge 
after releasing the worm from cornell at about 8 pm on nov 2 
1988 he went out for dinner when he returned about three hours 
later he said he noticed cornells own computer was slow to 
respond to commands 
on finding copies of the worm in the cornell system he said he 
knew it was spreading and was not working right he said he started 
to get scared 
morris said he considered sending out a second worm to track 
down and destroy the first one but decided against that after 
seeing the unpredictable nature of the first worm he also was 
unsure he could get into the computer system once the worm had 
begun to cripple it he said 
instead he said he called andrew sudduth a friend at harvard 
university and asked him to send a message on an electronic 
bulletin board read mainly by internet users morris said he wanted 
to apologize for unleashing the worm and tell users how to 
eliminate it 
sudduth testified at morris trial wednesday that he eventually 
did send a warning message but it didnt show up on the computer 
system for two days because the route he picked to keep his 
identity a secret already was backed up with mail sudduth said 
lawyers said they expected to give closing statements monday 
if convicted morris of arnold md faces up to five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine

the navy declared its newest and deadliest 
missile program on track thursday for a march deployment 
announcing that the problems that caused submarinelaunched trident 
2 missiles to spin out of control have been cured 
my confidence is fully restored that weve solved the problem 
beyond a shadow of a doubt rear adm kenneth malley told 
reporters at a pentagon briefing 
two of the first three submarine tests of the 44foot 265 
million missile formally known as the d5 failed when the 
missiles selfdestructed 
following two successful undersea launches earlier this week 
malley predicted the missiles will be deployed aboard the submarine 
tennessee on schedule 
the navy has touted the trident submarines and their new 
missiles as the the most effective strategic platform in the 
world today 
the trident 2 program is now on track it still looks like 
its very solid for the end of march the admiral said of plans 
to have the submarine armed and ready for patrols 
the uss tennessee will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea 
each with 24 of the weapons the trident 2 is capable of hurling as 
many as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4600 
miles away 
malley said that the missiles motor nozzle system blamed for 
two test failures of the trident 2 missile earlier this year has 
been redesigned 
the admiral said that five separate fixes had been developed 
to solve the complex problem on the 130000 pound weapon which 
involved water entering the missiles nozzle system and a buildup 
of pressure that caused elements of the direction system to fail 
that made the missile go into a pinwheel and selfdestruct 
the overall cost of the missile weapon program is 355 billion 
a figure that includes the planning and procurement of 871 missiles 
through fiscal year 2001 eventually the missiles will be deployed 
aboard 21 ohioclass submarines the navy said 
greenpeace protesters tried to halt a trident 2 launch dec 4 by 
sending the 190foot vessel mv greenpeace with 25 people aboard 
into the tennessees launch safety zone 
a navy ship intercepted the intruding vessel and damaged it by 
repeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the 
smokestacks stopping the engines navy sailors in swift boats 
corraled two greenpeace highspeed rafts that tried to approach the 
tennessee cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safety 
zone 
greenpeace had halted a trident 2 test with the same tactics in 
july

representatives of the insurance banking and 
thrift industries on thursday promised a social compact with 
the nations distressed neighborhoods to expand by billions of 
dollars the available loans and investment capital needed to 
produce affordable housing 
commercial banks thrifts and insurance companies are 
committing to increase their conventional lending their 
marketrate lending to low and moderateincome borrowers and in 
low and moderateincome neighborhoods said william a 
whiteside executive director of the neighborhood reinvestment 
corp at a news conference 
the additional private financing would be combined with 
belowmarket rate capital from local state and federal 
governments foundations and the nrc over the next 10 years for 
singlefamily home purchases whiteside told reporters 
the new funds would be used to expand a 17yearold loanbuying 
program administered by the nrc through neighborhood housing 
services of america 
the savings and loans have been and are americas primary 
housing financer said robert b obrien jr vice chairman of 
the league of savings associations and chairman of the new 
jerseybased carteret savings bank 
the thrifts have helped nhsa purchase more than 40 million in 
loans in 300 lowincome neighborhoods with few defaults nationwide 
obrien said 
area residents whose income equal 80 percent of a neighborhoods 
median income about 15000 to 25000 in most lowincome 
neighborhoods would qualify for loans he said 
we think we can provide billions of dollars to rehabilitating 
the urban neighborhoods with marketrate investments said wayne 
e hedien chairman of allstate insurance co 
this is a demonstrable coming together of private 
neighborhood and public entities to accomplish a major goal and 
thats what we mean by the social compact said preston martin 
chairman of the californiabased wsgp financial management co 
the expansion program amounts to a commitment in the financial 
community to help save older sections of the countrys urban and 
rural areas said martin a former vice chairman of the federal 
reserve board 
thursdays speakers offered few specifics on how soon or how 
much money would be budgeted for the program 
however an annual 50 million interest rate subsidy mandated by 
last years federal savings and loan bailout legislation would be 
included in any final figures obrien said 
a written statement promised that a group of 20 industry 
representatives the social compact leadership group shortly 
would announce goals for both direct and indirect increased 
lending and investment in such neighborhoods all across america 
throughout the 90s the group is recruiting additional program

some students at a roman catholic elementary 
school are reporting to a hospital to give urine samples in what 
may be the nations first primary school drug testing program 
school officials said thursday 
the first of the 25 students chosen at random from the sixth 
through eighth grade at st sabina academy were taken by their 
parents wednesday night to little company of mary hospital for the 
test principal linda bond said 
testing is to continue through friday evening a lottery to 
choose a different group of students for testing will be held each 
quarter of the school year 
then we wait for the results and if any kids are tested 
positive they are going to be going through counseling bond said 
jay miller executive director of the american civil liberties 
union of illinois called the testing outrageous but said it 
couldnt be challenged on constitutional grounds in court because 
it had been adopted by a private school 
its the first case ive heard of in this country of any 
testing being done on children in this age group miller said 
i think its a terrible overreaction 
but many youngsters at the allblack school and their parents 
are proud that the school may be the nations first to test pupils 
for drugs 
i care about the lives of these children says the rev 
michael pfleger pastor of st sabinas church when you talk 
about rights if a child dies on drugs he has no rights 
pfleger who has gained a national reputation as an antidrug 
crusader said officials doubt a drug problem exists at the school 
but were doing the preventative stuff to make sure we dont 
the chicago archdioceses office of catholic education rejected 
a proposal by pfleger that drug testing be introduced in all local 
parochial schools but said it wouldnt block individual schools 
from introducing such programs 
st sabinas school board approved the random drug test program 
in november after a survey found that 210 parents favored it and 
only five opposed it pfleger said 
the overwhelming majority of parents are behind the program 
although weve encountered opposition from some parents who feel 
strongly about the psychological effects and invasion of privacy 
said parent sheila grace 
graces 13yearold son sherman an eighthgrader at the 
school said he was glad to participate in the program 
im proud to be a part of it because we are making history in 
showing that our school wants to be drugfree said sherman who 
was to be tested thursday 
the school held a lottery this week in which the names of 25 
students were pulled out of a container holding the names of the 
schools 200 or so sixth seventh and eighthgraders about 500 
students attend st sabina which offers classes from preschool to 
eighth grade 
pfleger bond and three teachers also volunteered to be tested 
pfleger said the testing is only one component in the schools 
comprehensive antidrug program which also includes classroom 
teaching faculty and staff training parent education and 
community outreach

here are some facts and figures about azt the drug used to 
treat aids 
azt or zidovudine does not cure aids it does reduce the 
severity of symptoms and can prolong the lives of aids patients it 
also delays the onset of symptoms in those infected with the virus 
who are not yet sick 
it works by inhibiting reproduction of the aids virus 
it has strong side effects including nausea headaches and 
injury to bone marrow that can make transfusions necessary during 
treatment 
it was the first antiaids drug certified by the us food and 
drug administration which approved its use for seriously ill aids 
patients in march 1987 
it is marketed by burroughs wellcome co under the name 
retrovir 
it costs between 2700 and 6500 per year depending on the 
dose 
it is derived from herring sperm and was originally 
synthesized by dr jerome horowitz in the 1960s in a search for an 
anticancer drug azt failed those tests but was revived when it 
demonstrated success against the aids virus 
the first azt tests against the aids virus occurred in 
february 1985 and tests on aids patients were performed in july 
1985 
azt is now available in a new strawberryflavored syrup that 
is easier for children to swallow than capsules and allows dosages 
to be adjusted for body size

a woman described by her father as a 
poster child for compulsive gambling was fined 750 thursday 
for underage gambling in a pattern that stretches back four years 
debra kim cohen who turns the legal gambling age of 21 on feb 
8 also received a suspended 30day sentence and a years 
unsupervised probation as part of her agreement to plead guilty to 
charges of violating her probation and playing blackjack dec 13 in 
trump plaza hotel and casino while underage 
municipal prosecutor steve smoger said ms cohen of ventnor 
failed to follow terms of her original probation he said he didnt 
know what more could be done for her since she will soon turn the 
legal gambling age 
her original probation included counseling and attendance at

shes now making the transition from underage gambler to 
possibly compulsive gambler smoger told municipal judge bruce 
weekes she will have to deal with the problem as she sees fit 
smoger said later that the fines are the largest ever imposed on 
an underage gambler in atlantic city 
when ms cohen was a 17yearold high school student she 
received complimentary dinners and limousine rides from casinos in 
a series of incidents in 1987 a complaint was filed in october of 
that year and five casinos later paid 18000 in fines and made 
donations of 162000 to compulsive gambling programs 
ms cohen denied outside the courtroom that she gambles 
compulsively her father disagreed 
i pray that when she turns 21 the excitement of the game 
no longer exists said leonard cohen an atlantic city police 
detective kim has pretty much become a poster child for 
compulsive gambling 
cohen who wrote letters to the casinos long before his daughter 
was first caught also blamed the gaming halls for weaving an 
illusion they are the way to wealth 
smoger said his investigation showed the casino acted properly 
wayne g marlin a spokesman for the state division of gaming 
enforcement said the agencys investigation is continuing 
weekes said in sentencing ms cohen that she can no longer blame 
others for her problems 
smoger said he grew tired of hearing ms cohens reasons why she 
could not attend counseling one of which was that she felt 
uncomfortable at gamblers anonymous meetings because she was 
surrounded by older men

british refusal to join a ban on trade in 
ivory threatens the international effort to save the african 
elephant from poachers the world wildlife fund said thursday 
the united states and most other countries have joined in the 
ban illegal slaughter of elephants has greatly reduced their 
numbers in recent years 
were afraid britains action will collapse the whole 
international agreement said dana lauren west a press officer 
for the organization 
its a shock a complete reversal of the british position 
they did it to protect hong kongs trade ms west said 
china is due to take hong kong back from britain in 1997 but 
britain still acts for the colony in world affairs hong kong is 
among the leading processors of ivory 
theyre sitting on 600 tons of it now ms west said 
china opposed the trade ban from the start 
it was to go into effect on thursday as a result of a vote last 
oct 17 by representatives of 103 governments meeting in lausanne 
switzerland all are members of the convention on international 
trade in endangered species 
south africa zimbabwe and zambia also submitted 
reservations in effect exempting themselves from the ban 
they supply both raw and carved ivory ms west said there was an 
unconfirmed report that they are now being joined by botswana as 
well as britain member countries have until midnight thursday to 
make their decisions 
after that environmentalists will have to get together review 
the effects of the defections amd decide what to do next she added 
japan and singapore which had been mainstays of the ivory 
trade have so far said they are ready to go along with the ban 
ms west reported the fund said in an earlier statement that 
singapore has several tons of stockpiled ivory and a flourshing 
industry in carving it into goods for export 
ms west said that british prime minister margaret thatcher on 
wednesday transferred authority on the issue from her environment 
ministry to the foreign ministry which submitted the british 
reservation 
because britain belongs to the european economic community 
were afraid it may serve as a funnel to the other countries she 
added 
goods flow with few restrictions among the 12 members of the 
community which include the main countries of western europe 
its appalling said ginette hemley head of the funds unit 
that monitors trade in wildlife 
englands and chinas decision is a green light to ivory 
poachers its ironic that great britain one of the first 
european countries to ban ivory is the only western nation to 
oppose the decision while japan one of the largest consumer 
countries of ivory has remained steadfast in its promise to uphold 
the ban

the federal aviation administration is 
appealing to the nations airlines not to go public when they 
receive terrorist threats against passenger flights an faa 
spokesman said thursday 
the agency plans to make its case during a meeting friday with 
industry representatives in the hope a consensus will emerge 
the faa called the meeting in the aftermath of the decision by 
delta and northwest airlines to publicize recent threats against 
some of their flights the disclosures ran counter to traditional 
policy in the airline industry to take threats seriously but not to 
publicize them 
faa officials believe such publicity is counterproductive 
disruptive and serves only to boost the number of false threats a 
spokesman said 
but bert ammerman the head of an organization formed after the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland strongly 
disagreed arguing that airlines should tell passengers but not 
the press of any threats against their flights 
it is unconscionable that the faa would be meeting with the 
airlines to suppress information that is the right of every 
traveling person to have based on the circumstances that presently 
exist said ammerman a new jersey school administrator who is 
president of victims of pan am flight 103 his brother tom 
was among 270 people killed in the december 1988 bombing 
ammerman contends that telling passengers of threats is 
essential because airlines cannot now provide adequate security to 
protect their flights 
right now their attitude is we cant protect you we are 
not going to tell you so therefore passengers please continue to 
play russian roulette ammerman said 
ammerman and his organization are calling for the creation of an 
independent agency to increase security at airports train security 
personnel and evaluate performance 
faa spokesman fred farrar said that in a typical year some 200 
to 300 bomb threats are received of which only a tiny fraction 
perhaps less than half a threat are genuine 
our position up to now is that such threats should not be 
publicized farrar said we are going to be talking with the 
airline representatives about whether it is a good idea 
we know from experience that in excess of 99 percent of the 
threats that are received are hoaxes farrar said when 
terrorists are involved they do not advertise their intentions 
publicizing a threat serves only to gratify some kind of 
urge and will likely lead to further threats he said 
additionally he said making a threat public causes people to 
disrupt travel plans out of what is in most cases needless 
concern 
that is not to say that we take these threats lightly 
farrar said they are all checked out and any measures that need 
to be taken are taken 
ammerman said he is not advocating that the airlines give 
threats wide publicity but rather convey them privately to 
passengers holding tickets on the flights involved 
im not saying it should be given to the associated press and 
united press international and sent out around the world he said 
in an interview you would be telling a lot of people that making 
a threat is a fun thing to do 
i am saying that passengers should be told of the threat when 
they come to the counter in the terminal that they should be told 
that measures have been taken and then the offer should be made to 
make other travel arrangements if they are not comfortable he 
said 
you have to allow the traveling public to make a decision 
ammerman said 
doug miller a spokesman for northwest airlines said its policy 
is similar to the one ammerman suggests 
we have a policy not to make any bomb threats public unless we 
feel there is a specific and credible threat to a specific flight 
and then we will tell only the passengers miller said 
the passengers are the only ones that are impacted by the bomb 
threat and we feel they are the only ones with an absolute right to 
know about the threat he said 
miller said northwest had planned to follow that policy in the 
case of a threat to a recent specific ight between paris and 
detroit 
but he said news organizations learned of the threat prompting 
the airline to confirm it because we felt it would be naive of us 
to deny it

the unseasonably warm weather that washed across the eastern 
half of the nation this week has been a blast for outdoor vendors 
and others who have to be outside but it put a crimp in some 
winter recreation 
its such a great day joann melonie said as she rushed back 
from her lunch break in camden nj its too nice to be inside 
the nice weather even forced postponement of a golf tournament 
the 20th annual polar ice cap golf tournament on spring lake at 
grand haven mich scheduled for saturday was postponed because 
ice on the lake was getting too thin it got into the 50s wednesday 
were supposed to have winter and here we have spring 
complained crystal shipe a staff member with the grand haven 
chamber of commerce which cosponsors the event people are 
confused by this we should be able to play golf 
the week started with record highs in the mississippi valley 
but as cooler air moved in the record highs thursday were confined 
to the east they included 62 at boston and newark nj 70 at 
baltimore 57 at concord nh 64 at philadelphia 58 at portland 
maine 71 at roanoke va and 68 at washington 
but as a reminder of what time of year this is thursdays low 
in yellowstone national park was 22 degrees below zero 
catherine geiger said the boardwalk peanut shoppe where she 
works on the boardwalk in atlantic city nj benefited from extra 
foot traffic drawn out of the casinos and down to the shore 
business has been great she said it hasnt exactly 
doubled but its better by far 
the balmy temperatures also are good for the hot dog business 
its incredible at this time said gladys mendes who has 
been selling franks outside newark city hall for five years two 
weeks ago cold no business the people too cold keep in the 
office 
the warmer air formed an inversion over parts of northern new 
jersey and new york city trapping pollutants and creating 
unhealthy conditions thursdayfor the elderly and the sick 
officials said the new jersey department of environmental 
protection said there were high levels of smoke and particulates 
buffalo ny got 3 feet of snow during decembers record cold 
wave but it was nearly all gone by thursday because of the warm 
weather wednesdays high was 55 but the heat wave did not disrupt 
the citys winterfest city officials decided in september to 
cancel it because warm weather played havoc with it the last three 
years 
out west denver doesnt have any snow and that concerns the 
producers of the new movie die hard ii starring bruce willis 
who planned 10 days of filming in the city starting monday 
it cant be 70 degrees said die hard ii publicist marcy 
bolotin the film happens at christmas when its cold and dark 
we need snow it all depends on your weather 
in minnesota the warm spell was not enough to thaw a 42inch 
layer of frost in the soil that could prevent much moisture from 
soaking into the ground during the spring thaw weather officials 
say that deep a layer of frozen soil is as much as usually 
develops during an entire winter officials say 
when spring arrives the snow will all run off said jim 
campbell of the national weather service in minneapolis 
thats a problem because parts of the state are 40 months into a 
drought 
thanks to modern snowmaking equipment and the december cold 
snap that allowed production of very thick layers of manmade snow 
many ski resorts were able to weather the warmth and keep at least 
parts of their slopes open 
even in georgia sky valley at dillard had three of its five 
slopes open this week the temperature hit 58 wednesday and 500 
skiers turned out said janie yearwood the resorts director of 
recreational activities 
were still doing extremely well although some people are 
disappointed when they come to find out how we make snow and we 
cant do it because its not cold enough she said

president bush and turkish president turgut 
ozal discussed thursday the implications for nato of the changes in 
eastern europe and reaffirmed close usturkish security ties 
an administration official who asked not to be identified said 
bush also assured his guest that he will vigorously oppose a 
pending senate resolution to designate april 24 as a day of 
remembrance for armenians allegedly massacred by ottoman turks 
decades ago 
bush at the outset of his oval office meeting with ozal 
expressed to reporters his delight with a sen bob dole 
proposal to shake up us foreign aid allocations and give the 
white house not congress more say over where the money goes 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that in the 
oval office meeting and a private lunch bush and ozal talked at 
length about the middle east and the sweeping changes in eastern 
europe with special reference to the balkans 
they also discussed the conventional force reduction talks in 
vienna and natos vital role in a changing europe fitzwater 
said turkey plays a major defense role on natos southern flank 
and is home to strategically important us bases 
the president and president ozal agreed to continue their 
pattern of close consultations and stressed the importance of 
usturkish security cooperation at this time of rapid change in 
europe and in eastwest relations he said 
the two leaders also reaffirmed their support for united 
nationssponsored negotiations to solve the cyprus question 
turkey hotly disputes charges that ottoman turks massacred 15 
million armenians between 191523 ozal said in a speech at the 
international club of washington wednesday night that this is a 
matter for historians not political people to decide 
a resolution designating april 24 1990 as a day of remembrance 
for the armenians passed the senate foreign relations committee 
last fall despite strenuous lobbying by turkey and strong white 
house objections 
the white house source said bush assured ozal his administration 
will vigorously oppose the resolution in its current form when 
it comes before the senate which returns next week from a holiday 
recess bush also indicated a willingness to work with congress 
on a balanced resolution the source said 
ozal met earlier thursday with dole the senate minority leader 
from kansas and author of the armenian resolution 
asked if he planned to discuss doles proposed foreign aid cut 
bush replied i wont be talking about that ill be talking 
about my delight that somebody understands that its the president 
that ought to set these priorities and thats why im very pleased 
about it 
i want to see it put the power where it should be on this 
matter and not mastermind foreign policy through 138 subcommittees 
allocating funds bush told reporters at the outset of the oval 
office meeting with ozal 
dole has said he will propose legislation cutting allocations to 
turkey and the four other biggest recipients of us foreign aid by 
5 percent to free 330 million to help the emerging democracies in 
eastern europe 
doles proposal would seek to curtail the common congressional 
practice of earmarking chunks of the 14 billion in us 
foreign aid for specific countries and projects 
id like to see it done the way i think the founding fathers 
intended for it to be done and dont worry about our friends 
turkey we will take care of that said bush 
ozal said wednesday that his country would refrain from 
interfering in the conflict raging in the soviet caucuses and he 
took pains to distance turkey from its ethnic ties to the 
azerbaijani people 
ozal is on a 10day visit to the united states that includes 
meetings with the heads of the international monetary fund the 
world bank and american investors

us undersecretary of state robert 
kimmitt said thursday that warmer ussoviet relations have 
created an opening for a political end to afghanistans protracted 
civil war 
kimmitt hinted that the two superpowers have embraced a more 
conciliatory approach to afghan peace talks 
while washington still insists that marxist president najib be 
removed his departure is no longer seen as a prerequisite to 
opening peace talks 
moscow has resurrected a yearold offer of a transitional 
government which washington believes means najibs eventual 
removal kimmitt said 
a senior us administration official said eastern europes 
rejection of singleparty communist rule coupled with unrest in the 
soviet unions own republics increased pressure on moscow to 
stabilize its relations with washington 
washington plans to capitalize on this to find a political end 
to afghanistans brutal war but one that does not include najib 
said the official who spoke on condition he was not identified 
he said however usbacked rebel fighters would likely be 
willing to talk to elements within kabul this is seen as a 
concession to moscow which has demanded the ruling communist party 
take part in a postwar settlement 
the resistance has indicated it is prepared to talk to 
elements within kabul those they euphemistically refer to as 
good moslems he said 
their greatest hatred has been najib and criminal elements 
around him 
kimmitts threeday visit to pakistan was part of us 
preparations for next months meeting between secretary of state 
james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
kimmitt was the highestranking state department official to 
visit pakistan since last years withdrawal of soviet combat troops 
from afghanistan 
he told a news conference the soviet union which has sent huge 
arms shipments to its communist allies in kabul is prepared to 
discuss in good faith an end to the 11yearold war 
more than 15 million people have reportedly died in 
afghanistans guerrilla war which was launched in 1979 to rout 
soviet combat troops sent by moscow to crush a burgeoning moslem 
insurgency and replace one communist government with another 
the red army left afghanistan after only managing to fight 
usbacked rebels to a stalemate najibs government was expected 
to collapse within weeks of the withdrawal of more than 103000 
soviet soldiers last feb 15 
but almost a year later najib controls all of afghanistans 
major cities and the rebels control most of the countryside 
washington has shipped millions of dollars worth of weapons to 
the antimarxist rebels who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors 
but bitter internal feuding among rebel leaders headquartered 
in pakistan has paralyzed a socalled guerrilla government many 
afghans and western observers say the rebels have failed miserably 
on the political front unable to attract minority groups or rebels 
living in iran to their selfstyled government 
but the senior us official noted that moscow dug up its offer 
of a transitional government while kabuls ruling communists had 
the upperhand in the civil war he said this may mean moscow is 
ready to talk despite the rebels shortcomings 
western diplomats say the soviet union spends about 300 million 
a month supplying afghanistan with arms and humanitarian aid 
on wednesday the guerrillas unveiled a complicated formula to 
select a new leadership the announcement made to coincide with 
kimmitts visit fails to unite the fractious rebel leadership or 
include those living in iran 
hardline islamist gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of hezbiislami 
rebel group dismissed the formula demanding elections instead 
kimmitt refused to comment on the proposal but was expected to 
meet with guerrilla leaders in the border city of peshawar before 
leaving for new delhi

to users the consumer product safety commission said thursday 
the agency said the jc penney co inc voluntarily recalled

the united states would provide aid to help 
buy perus coca leaf crop under a plan proposed thursday by the 
peruvian ambassador 
cesar atala nazal said peruvian farmers would dream to be on 
the side of the law even if it meant earning slightly less by 
growing other crops the coca leaf is used to make cocaine 
growers in the upper huallaga valley face continual harassment 
from both police and drug traffickers atala said adding that the 
growers share of the huge profits from the drug trade is very 
small 
atala said the upper huallaga valley produces 180000 metric 
tons of leaves with an average price of 1300 a ton the average 
farmer in peru he said does not make more than 1000 a year 
the purchase plan would last only a few years until crops could 
be substituted and other economic improvements are made 
payments to the farmers about 234 million for one years 
worth of crops would find their way into the economy as well 
atala said noting that last years drugfighting aid totaled 254 
million 
i am absolutely convinced that the farmers themselves would 
profit by getting this money but working within the law rather than 
continue being the victims of traffickers the terrorists and the 
peruvian police he said at a news conference 
atala offered the proposal at a joint hearing of the senate 
judiciary committee and the senate caucus on international 
narcotics control 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the judiciary 
committee said the proposal sounded feasible but doubted many 
would favor it he said it would have to be done in conjunction 
with operations against traffickers and producers 
ambassador jorge crespo velasco of bolivia also supported the 
proposal 
most of the cocaine that enters the united states comes from 
peru bolivia and colombia representatives of those three 
countries will meet with president bush at a feb 15 drug summit in 
cartagena colombia 
also at the hearing atala reiterated criticism of last months 
us invasion of panama atala and colombian ambassador victor 
mosquera chaux said at a news conference that participation by us 
warships in drug interdiction efforts off the andean nations 
waters is unwelcome and unnecessary 
what your armed forces could do we could do if necessary 
atala said 
mosquera chaux said us naval forces could begin by trying to 
control the entry of narcotics within their own waters 
biden called thursdays hearing to gather comment on his 
proposed debtfordrugs legislation under which the united states 
would exchange debt relief for antidrug efforts by drugproducing 
countries 
the proposal is modeled after similar notions of exchanging debt 
for equity or debt for protection of natural resources biden 
acknowledged that the administration was cool to the idea but said 
he hoped it would be included on the summit agenda next month 
the three ambassadors told the panel that the drug trade was 
inextricably bound with other economic problems some of which they 
blamed on the united states 
mosquera chaux proposed a onetime grant of 1 billion to offset 
the economic consequences of the war on drugs and the breakdown of 
an international coffee agreement he said will cost colombian 
growers 600 million this year

three us technicians working for 
lockheed aircraft corp hope to leave chad early sunday after being 
detained for two weeks a negotiator for the company said 
len r webb lockheeds regional manager for africa and the 
middle east said thursday it was possible the three will leave 
ndjamena for paris early sunday on an air afrique flight 
the three irving thrash marvin gambill and ernest ruse all 
from the atlanta area refused comment other than to say they 
would be glad to leave the north african country

chain 
police took the men into custody jan 5 releasing them only 
last monday on condition they not leave the hotel while lockheed 
negotiated their freedom with the chadian government their 
passports also were confiscated 
webb has termed the detention a misunderstanding that 
involved the destruction of a manual for a lockheed c130 military 
transport aircraft purchased for the chadian air force 
it was the first lockheed plane of several in use in chad 
that was purchased new by president hissene habres government 
the contract called for a team of three technicians from the 
lockheed aeronautical systemsgeorgia subsidiary to be stationed in 
chad for a year to teach the chadians how to maintain the plane 
the year ended in december 
webb said the dispute was over a single highlevel technical 
overhaul document not needed for daytoday maintenance the 
technicians destroyed the document as they prepared to leave chad 
but the chadians thought it was sold with the plane 
lockheed did not have the state departments export permit for 
the document webb said but authorization now has been obtained 
and the chadians provided with a new copy 
chadian authorities are believed to have since made maintenance 
arrangements with another company 
webb who is based in amman jordan says the three technicians 
were not held hostage and have not been mistreated or harassed 
lockheed headquarters are in calabasas calif

the republican partys internal debate over 
abortion boiled into the open thursday with a party committee 
refusing to consider a resolution affirming the gops fervent 
antiabortion stance 
the action came on the opening day of the republican national 
committees winter meeting a session dominated by public and 
private discussions about whether the party should moderate its 
official stand on abortion as 1990 elections approach 
the session also included a complaint from the leader of a black 
gop group who said despite minority outreach commitments from 
party chief lee atwater some state chapters overlook blacks 
fred brown head of the national black republican committee 
also said that while he has been unable to organize a presidential 
dinner as an organization fundraiser jesse jackson and other 
prominent black democrats constantly meet with the president 
but abortion overshadowed other topics as the rnc convened in a 
hotel blocks from the white house 
one rnc member idaho state gop chairman randy ayre sought to 
offer a resolution endorsing the partys 1988 platform recognition 
of the sanctity of life 
ayre was told that his request would not be considered because 
he had not submitted a formal resolution in advance of the 
gathering and that perhaps the issue would be discussed at the next 
rnc meeting in june 
but we have elections coming up he said to no avail 
during a meeting of the rncs resolutions committee 
ayre said after the session taking a stance similar to that of 
atwater that he personally opposes abortion and believes the party 
should too but that the gop should not use a candidates position 
on abortion as a litmus test for party support 
still he said i just feel that we should reaffirm the 
partys longstanding position on the issue 
ayre appeared uncomfortable speaking to reporters about his 
attempt and an impromptu session with several ended abruptly when 
an atwater deputy summoned him out of the room with a message that 
he had a telephone call 
atwater and other prominent republicans including bush and 
vice president quayle have sought in recent months to portray the 
gop as an umbrella organization that welcomes candidates with 
varying views on abortion and mindful of the role abortion played 
in several major elections won by democrats last year atwater has 
been urging republican candidates to state their position on the 
issue early and firmly to attempt to diminish abortions campaign 
role 
the party chairman has been criticized by some in the gops 
conservative wing who believe the party should hold firmly to its 
antiabortion stance atwater aides said he would dedicate a good 
portion of his friday speech to the issue giving what one called 
a better version of how he feels candidates should deal with 
the topic he also participated in a lengthy discussion about 
abortion politics at a private luncheon with rnc members sticking 
to his theme that the party is a big tent with room for 
differing opinions 
even some staunchly antiabortion rnc members said privately 
they would have difficulty supporting a resolution such as ayres 
because of the problems such a stance might cause some gop 
candidates 
those who are prolife can point to the 1988 platform and 
those prochoice can point to the presidents remarks about 
inclusion said one rnc member privately it does us no good to 
stir this thing up 
ayre in his brief session with reporters disagreed saying he 
proposed his resolution because of the timeliness of the issue 
another member of the resolutions committee iowa national 
committeeman stephen roberts said the decision to quash ayres 
request would only delay an inevitable and difficult decision 
by the party 
its clearly an issue he said 
roberts said he wanted to speak to other members before deciding 
what tack he would encourage the party to take he and others said 
abortion was a major topic in conversation and private sessions of 
the meeting 
he also joined ayre in saying rnc rules need to be improved so 
that resolutions considered at party meetings are meaningful 
god motherhood and the flag was how he summed up the 
committees business which included passage of resolutions 
praising the bush administration prodemocracy movements in 
eastern europe and the invasion of panama if youre going to 
have any meaning to it youve got to deal with the issues of the 
day he said 
other members however were more comfortable leaving the 
abortion debate off the public agenda except at presidential 
nominating conventions and perhaps even then 
this is an issue of conscience said haley barbour an 
antiabortion rnc member from mississippi and a key gop strategist 
in the south not everyone has to agree with me 
a sign of the partys reluctance to debate abortion publicly 
came when the resolution committee considered suspending its rules 
to consider a resolution from the rncs puerto rico delegation that 
was not submitted by the deadline the resolution was virtually 
identical to a gop platform plank endorsing statehood for puerto 
rico if its residents voted in favor of such a move 
rnc member elsie hillman of pennsylvania at barbours 
suggestion ruled the motion out of order after saying agreeing to 
consider it would make it harder to deny any other resolutions 
brought to us at the last minute

a group representing the nations largest 
corporations criticized congressional proposals to clean up air 
pollution thursday as being too expensive and said some of the most 
stringent provisions could force plants to shut down 
the business roundtable an association of 200 major 
corporations presented a study it commissioned that maintained 
that legislation before congress to tighten the federal clean air 
act could cost business 54 billion to 104 billion a year 
the cost figures were sharply higher than any that have surfaced 
so far in the debate over the legislation which has been given a 
high priority by congressional leaders and the white house senate 
floor debate on a clearair bill was to begin next week 
administration officials called the business groups cost 
predictions too high environmentalists said the estimates were 
inflated 
this is part of an industry ritual on the eve of any pollution 
control debate in congess they release inflated figures said 
richard ayres of the natural resources defense council 
earlier thursday president bush renewed his call for congress 
to break the stalemate and pass cleanair legislation as soon 
as possible aides have said privately for weeks that bush would 
like to have a toughtened air pollution bill in hand to sign as 
part of earth day celebrations in april 
bush speaking to administration officials urged congress to 
preserve the careful balance of legislation he proposed last 
summer to clean up the air and preserve jobs 
the administration has estimated the cost of the bush proposal 
as between 14 billion and 19 billion a year the cost to industry 
of a similar version advancing in the house has been put at about 
the same level but administration officials have opposed parts of 
a senate bill because they claim it would be more expensive and 
possibly threaten economic growth 
earlier this week staff members of the senate environment and 
public works committee disputed claims that the senate bill would 
add significantly to the cost of legislation proposed by the 
president 
a spokesman for sen max baucus dmont chief sponsor of the 
senate bill called the business roundtable cost estimates far too 
high and said the senate bills costs are comparable to the 
presidents proposal 
according to the commerce department air pollution control 
measures currently cost business and industry an estimated 32 
billion a year 
but the study presented by the business roundtable said a best 
estimate of complying with provisions of the senate bill would be 
an additional 54 billion a year and could soar as high as 104 
billion if businesses were required to meet the toughest 
healthbased standards suggested by the legislation for toxic 
chemical emissions 
dale denny author of the report said compliance with stringent 
healthbased toxic emission controls from industrial plants could 
add from 25 billion to 62 billion onto the cost of compliance if 
companies were required to curb emissions to levels that pose no 
more than a 1 in 1 million cancer risk 
the senate legislation calls for such risk levels to be a 
goal but would allow regulators to issue exemptions and set 
less stringent limits if economic or technological conditions 
warrant 
philip masciantonio vice president for environmental affairs 
for us steel corp said however that the toxic chemical 
controls in the senate bill could result in reduced industrial 
production job losses employment dislocations and possibly 
shutdowns of industries 
the steel industrys coke oven operations are threatened by the 
senate bill because they would be unable to meet some of the 
standards envisioned by that bill he said

some tour packages being offered for the super 
bowl dont include a ticket to the game the transportation 
department warned thursday 
the departments consumer affairs office said that if a ticket 
to the national football leagues denversan francisco extravaganza 
in new orleans on jan 28 is not specifically mentioned in an 
advertisement for the package or is not listed as a feature of a 
tour package it probably is not included 
fans should read promotional material carefully the department 
said 
and it advised paying by credit card which provides some 
degree of protection under fair credit practice laws 
the department said that super bowl packages involving public 
charter flights offer some clear advantages 
if the charter tour is supposed to include a game ticket and 
you do not receive one you are entitled to a full refund of the 
entire package price when you return it said 
customers may also cancel travel arrangements and receive a full 
refund if there is a change in the cities where flights originate 
if a hotel not named in the brochure is substituted or if a price 
increase of more than 10 percent is imposed it said 
in order to avoid being turned away at the loading gate because 
of checkin time limits imposed by both scheduled and charter 
airlines the department advised super bowl fans to get to the 
airport well ahead of time

former leader todor zhivkov was put under 
house arrest and charged with abuse of power and fomenting ethnic 
unrest during his 34year reign the governmentrun news agency bta 
reported thursday 
the state agency also said opposition talks with the ruling 
communists broke down thursday over access to bulgarias 
broadcasting networks 
the prosecutorgenerals office issued a warrant for the deposed 
dictator who was toppled in a november uprising charging zhivkov 
with malfeasance in office inciting ethnic hostility and misuse of 
state property 
the 78yearold stalinist was not jailed according to bta but 
was instead put under guard at an undisclosed location 
that makes him the second east bloc leader now under official 
investigation for abuses disclosed by the upheavals that have 
convulsed eastern europe former east german party leader erich 
honecker now hospitalized faces a charge of high treason 
the charges against zhivkov indicate he is being personally 
blamed by his reformist communist successors for the nations 
severe ethnic and economic problems 
zhivkov was the author of socalled bulgarization the 
persecution and forced assimilation of the nations 15 million 
ethnic turks and other native bulgarian muslims known as pomaks 
after his ouster zhivkov was accused of corruption when it was 
revealed he had maintained at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats 
throughout this poor balkan nation 
zhivkovs oftenviolent forced assimilation policy banned moslem 
religious practices and required ethnic turks and moslems to 
forsake their own names and take bulgarian ones 
most of bulgarias 9 million people belong to the bulgarian 
orthodox church 
more than 300000 ethnic turks emigrated to turkey to escape the 
harsh bulgarization campaign but about 80000 later returned 
citing lack of jobs and housing in turkey 
the talks with the reformist government of party chief petar 
mladenov have foundered over the governments refusal to allow the 
opposition to use the electronic media to spread its democratic 
message throughout this mostly rural nation in advance of promised 
national elections 
we are left with the impression that the delegation of the 
official authorities has no intention to carry out serious 
negotiations said the union of democratic forces the umbrella 
grouping of opposition organizations according to a statement 
carried by bta 
western diplomats said if the opposition and government liaison 
groups come to agreement on their differences another negotiating 
session is likely jan 22 
earlier this week the communist party agreed to allow the 
opposition to publish its own newspaper and promised it office 
space 
faced with the plummeting fortunes of the communist party in 
other eastern european states bulgarias communists appear to be 
trying to preserve as much power as possible and their total 
control of radio and television is key to that power 
the governmentrun media continues to attack opposition leaders 
in a clear attempt to discredit them with any potential electorate 
the government has proposed twostage legislative elections in 
may and november however opposition figures claim may is too soon 
for them to organize an effective election campaign 
during thursdays session of the talks the communist delegation 
leader andrei loukanov issued a thinlyveiled warning against 
anticommunist activities saying the revival of anticommunism 
would be dangerous for the transition to democracy according to 
bta 
loukanov was referring to anticommunist slogans at sundays 
prodemocracy demonstration in the capital sofia by more than 
50000 people one of the largest demonstrations in recent 
bulgarian history 
the demonstration testified to the fastgrowing popularity of 
the opposition which had been banned until zhivkovs ouster

british refusal to join a ban on trade in 
ivory threatens the international effort to save the african 
elephant from poachers the world wildlife fund said thursday 
the united states and most other countries have joined in the 
ban illegal slaughter of elephants has greatly reduced their 
numbers in recent years 
were afraid britains action will collapse the whole 
international agreement said dana lauren west a press officer 
for the organization 
its a shock a complete reversal of the british position 
they did it to protect hong kongs trade ms west said 
china is due to take hong kong back from britain in 1997 but 
britain still acts for the colony in world affairs hong kong is 
among the leading processors of ivory 
theyre sitting on 600 tons of it now ms west said 
china opposed the trade ban from the start 
it was to go into effect on thursday as a result of a vote last 
oct 17 by representatives of 103 governments meeting in lausanne 
switzerland all are members of the convention on international 
trade in endangered species 
south africa zimbabwe and zambia also submitted 
reservations in effect exempting themselves from the ban 
they supply both raw and carved ivory ms west said there was an 
unconfirmed report that they are now being joined by botswana as 
well as britain member countries have until midnight thursday to 
make their decisions 
after that environmentalists will have to get together review 
the effects of the defections amd decide what to do next she added 
japan and singapore which had been mainstays of the ivory 
trade have so far said they are ready to go along with the ban 
ms west reported the fund said in an earlier statement that 
singapore has several tons of stockpiled ivory and a flourshing 
industry in carving it into goods for export 
ms west said that british prime minister margaret thatcher on 
wednesday transferred authority on the issue from her environment 
ministry to the foreign ministry which submitted the british 
reservation 
because britain belongs to the european economic community 
were afraid it may serve as a funnel to the other countries she 
added 
goods flow with few restrictions among the 12 members of the 
community which include the main countries of western europe 
its appalling said ginette hemley head of the funds unit 
that monitors trade in wildlife 
englands and chinas decision is a green light to ivory 
poachers its ironic that great britain one of the first 
european countries to ban ivory is the only western nation to 
oppose the decision while japan one of the largest consumer 
countries of ivory has remained steadfast in its promise to uphold 
the ban

only 5000 to 10000 people from among 400000 
or more soviet citizens wishing to leave the soviet union for the 
united states will be accorded refugee status this fiscal year the 
nations top immigration official said thursday 
gene mcnary commissioner of the immigration and naturalization 
service also said he expects an increase in the number of 
armenians seeking refugee status or asylum in the united states as 
a result of the violence against them in the soviet republic of 
azerbaijan 
dozens of armenians have been killed in the fighting which has 
escalated in recent days to civil war proportions 
my guess is itll increase the numbers of armenians seeking 
to come to the united states mcnary said at a news conference 
as many as 2000 armenians could be allowed into the united 
states each month under a category known as humanitarian parole 
which entitles them to some federal assistance but not to automatic 
citizenship about 12000 armenians came here last year 
mcnary said 40000 to 45000 of the 50000 refugee slots 
allocated by congress for soviet refugees in the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 will be reserved for applicants already waiting in 
italy these applicants left the soviet union last year and applied 
in rome for permission to enter the united states as refugees 
the rome channel was shut off by the bush administration as of 
oct 1 under a new system which only allows soviets to apply in 
moscow but attorney general richard thornburgh pledged to clear up 
the backlog in rome before closing down the transit facility there 
this year 
classification as a refugee is desirable because admission to 
the united states is done outside the regular immigration quotas 
and the us government pays for travel and resettlement and the 
refugees may become citizens 
the new system does not automatically assume as previous policy 
did that jews leaving the soviet union are entitled to refugee 
status which the united states grants people with a wellfounded 
fear of persecution on religious grounds instead consular 
officers have to investigate individual cases 
the shortage of slots for soviet refugee applicants the vast 
majority of whom are jews has become acute over the past year with 
a lifting of many previous restrictions on the emigration of jews 
armenians and evangelical christians 
after years of demanding the kremlin allow more soviets to 
leave the united states is now faced with exit permits far 
outstripping us budget ability to take in the emigres 
more than 71000 jews left the soviet union last year the 
highest annual rate ever and 36147 of them came to the united 
states as refugees 
jewish community officials say at least 100000 additional 
soviet jews have applied to leave and are waiting to be processed 
by the us embassy in moscow mcnary said as many as 300000 more 
could apply in the coming months 
mcnary said the ins was increased its staff in moscow to 24 and 
had begun operating an office in suburban washington to help in the 
processing of the soviet applications 
on another matter mcnary said the ins had received 3720 
applications from chinese studying or working in the united states 
for permission to stay here in light of the repression against 
prodemocracy movements in china of these more than 2800 have 
been approved he said

sam walton the 71yearold founder of 
the walmart discount chain empire has undergone treatment for 
bonemarrow cancer a company spokesman said thursday 
walton once the richest person in america has received two 
sessions of chemotherapy and some radiation therapy since sunday 
for multiple myeloma said don shinkle a walmart spokesman 
myeloma is a malignant tumor in the bone marrow it is generally 
made up of abnormal plasma cells 
a walmart statement said walton was expected to recover fully 
from treatment he underwent in houston at md anderson hospital 
it is the second time walton has faced cancer in 1982 he was 
diagnosed as having leukemia and also was treated at md anderson 
the leukemia has been in remission for several years 
along with mr sams doctors we are very encouraged that 
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is 
expected the statement said 
his doctors have advised him that they have had good success 
treating this type of cancer if its detected in time shinkle 
said hes in very good spirits 
shinkle said walton probably would spend another couple of weeks 
in houston the bottom line we hear from the doctors is that 
they caught this in time in the early stages he said 
walton had experienced aches and pains for several months but 
felt better after the therapy shinkle said 
i feel so much better already walton said in a twopage 
memo to walmart employees 
shinkle said the memo was issued because walton wanted employees 
to hear news of his illness from him rather than have them to 
hear a lot of rumors because many might be exaggerated or untrue 
shinkle said walton may be initially slowed down but that he 
expects to resume visiting outlets in a few weeks a common walton 
practice after this weeks treatments walton visited a sams 
wholesale club in houston 
walton has been known to drop in on local walmart managers with 
little advance notice to stay in touch with the retail business at 
the customer level 
the memo also described walmart accomplishments during the 
1980s which walton credited to the employees of the chains 1300 
stores it said walton looked forward to more success 
based on his holdings of walmart stock walton has been listed 
for the past several years by forbes magazine as one of the 
wealthiest men in the nation he was the wealthiest until he split 
his stock among family members 
walton stepped down as chief executive officer of the retail 
chain in 1988 and chose david glass to oversee the chain 
the chain blossomed under waltons philosophy of tight 
management and general marketing principles that the customer is 
always right 
born in kingfisher okla walton grew up as the son of a 
farmmortgage banker he graduated from the university of missouri 
with an economics degree in 1940 and joined jc penney co as a 
management trainee in des moines iowa after serving three years 
in the army he went to arkansas and opened a ben franklin 
fiveanddime in 1962 sam and his brother james l walton opened 
the first walmart discount city 
three of his four grown children are involved with the company 
in various capacities

the navy will propose that the uss iowa and 
new jersey two of its four battleships be mothballed as a 
costcutting maneuver in the next pentagon budget defense 
department sources said thursday 
all four warships have become targets of budgetcutters on 
capitol hill and elsewhere but navy brass and the lawmakers from 
some states where the ships were to be based have been fighting 
to retain the decadesold vessels 
its going to be proposed one military source said 
thursday its going to be the iowa and the new jersey 
another pentagon official who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that while political pressure could result in a 
reversal of the decision the action seems to be a fait accompli 
i havent seen the final paperwork on it but its as good as 
done the official saidck cheney that it must trim programs in its 
1991 spending plan 
president bush is slated to send the budget to congress on jan 
29 
under a plan attacked by critics as pure porkbarrel politics 
the navy planned to place the battleships at four bases around the 
country 
the iowa was slated to be at a new 300 million base on staten 
island in new york city while the new jersey is at long beach 
calif plans call for the wisconsin to be based at corpus christi 
texas and the missouri at a west coast base as yet undecided 
the officials said they had no indication what would happen to 
the facilities lined up for the homeports although the second 
official indicated that other ships might be sent to placate local 
officials concerned about job cutbacks or economic impact 
some new york politicians continued to voice hope that the 
staten island base would survive even in a strippeddown state 
my gut feeling is the homeport is going to survive said 
rep george hochbrueckner dny a member of the house armed 
services committee 
lawrence korb a former assistant secretary of defense 
disagreed 
i think its dead said korb director of the brookings 
institutions center for public policy and education 
the new jersey and the iowa are the older ships launched in 
1942 during world war ii and entering service the next year all 
four ships saw action in that war served through the korean war 
years and were mothballed in the 1950s 
the four ships were reactivated starting in 1982 despite 
criticism they would be extravagantly expensive to operate because 
of the large crews needed 65 officers and 1453 enlisted men each 
if the new jersey which fired at targets in lebanon in 1983 is 
returned to the inactive fleet it will be for the third time the 
ship also was used and deactivated during the vietnam war 
the ships carry 16inch guns tomahawk cruise missiles harpoon 
antiship missiles 12 5inch guns and four rapidfiring 20mm 
antiaircraft guns for closein defense 
the iowa which was damaged in the april 19 explosion that 
killed 47 sailors is undergoing repairs in norfolk va 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee called the prospect of the iowa and new 
jersey being mothballed a grave disappointment 
warner said future us operations may require amphibious 
assaults and the battleships are key to that type of work

the struggle for union democracy that has 
closed a ford motor co plant for 11 days and left one worker dead 
is the latest example of the rankandfile dissent after years of 
close unionmanagement cooperation 
workers occupying the cuautitlan plant 15 miles north of mexico 
city accuse union leader hector uriarte of being promanagement and 
say the mexican labor federation put him in office after a 
fraudulent election 
the dissidents want uriarte booted and refused an offer of a 
referendum because union officials wouldnt agree to provisions for 
ensuring a fair vote said dissident leader salvador fuentes reyes 
other demands are secondary said fuentes 
now its not a question of profits fuentes said the 
basic problem is democratic life in the union 
the refrain is a common one as organized labor searches for its 
footing in a changed mexican political and economic environment 
dominated for decades by governmentallied leaders known for 
manipulating funds and using their posts as springboards to public 
office rankandfilers lack leaders and experience in fighting for 
better conditions 
seven years of economic crises have eroded raises and the 
oncebountiful fringe benefits oldschool leaders were able to hand 
out to pacify workers and turn out the vote for the governing 
institutional revolutionary party 
many of the entrenched bosses under attack are close to fidel 
velazquez who is 89 for 45 years he has ruled the 25 million 
member mexican workers federation known as ctm for its spanish 
initials 
in his drive to restore prosperity president carlos salinas de 
gortari has kept labor off balance he opened the door to new 
boldness by cracking down on corruption and jailing the boss of the 
powerful oil workers union 
but deposed bosses have been replaced by leaders also aligned 
with the government and salinas has left no doubt his priority is 
streamlining production privatization of governmentowned industry 
has cost thousands of jobs 
last year a monthlong strike by dissidents in the 11 
millionstrong national teachers union forced the removal of their 
boss of 17 years his replacement though progovernment has 
allowed the dissidents a greater voice in union affairs 
in a monthslong battle that began with a gunbattle between 
rival union groups at a luxury hotel dissident members of the 
musicians union managed to get rid of venustiano reyes a 
velazquez crony 
but the dissidents are still barred from union offices and 
continue to press their cause in concerts from a makeshift 
bandstand at one of the busiest corners in town 
at the ford plant workers and newspaper accounts said 150 to 
250 thugs inside the plant began firing guns and beating workers as 
they arrived for the morning shift jan 8 ten workers were 
injured one died two days later 
workers accused uriarte and the company of being in cahoots 
saying the attackers arrived in labor federation buses 
the company let them in said jose antonio galindo 
hernandez a dissident who has been fired galindo and other 
workers said the attackers wore company uniforms and identification 
badges 
ford has filed a criminal complaint with authorities to 
clarify this situation and fix responsibilities said company 
spokesman carlos bandala when asked about the accusations 
about 1500 workers occupied the plant in aroundtheclock 
shifts workers have accused armed uriarte hirelings of going to 
dissident employees homes and threatening them 
in newspaper ads ford said it would not reopen until there was 
security for the plants 3800 workers 
anyone who says ford wants to close the plant is not 
right bandala said he said production had been increased from 
360 to 450 units a day the past six months and 800 to 900 new 
workers were hired 
he did not have an estimate of how much the shutdown was costing 
the company

federal health officials said thursday that nine 
preventable chronic diseases are responsible for more than half the 
deaths in this country but get only 2 percent of the public 
health dollars spent by the states 
meanwhile another preventable cause injuries remains the 
leading cause of premature loss of life with suicide and 
homicide and aids also ranking high 
the national centers for disease control reported that nine 
chronic diseases diseases with long periods of onset or suffering 
by themselves accounted for 11 million deaths in 1986 52 
percent of the deaths nationwide 
they are stroke heart disease diabetes obstructive lung 
disease lung cancer breast cancer cervical cancer colorectal 
cancer and cirrhosis of the liver 
theyre all largely preventable or preventable to some 
extent said dr robert hahn a cdc epidemiologist 
the preventable risk factors for those nine chronic diseases 
include cigarette smoking overweight high blood pressure 
drinking and lack of exercise 
we know what the risk factors are hahn said we know less 
about how you get people to act on them 
according to a report from 45 states and the district of 
columbia less than 2 percent of state public health expenditures 
are allocated to prevent and control chronic disease the cdc said 
thats low hahn said noting that other chronic diseases 
not included in the cdcs dangerous nine also could be targets of 
increased public health efforts 
the average state expenditure on chronic disease control and 
prevention is 66 cents per person per year hahn said 
that amount includes money spent on efforts such as disease 
screening programs but does not include education or direct 
doctors camparable figures on federal public health spending for chronic 
disease were not available hahn said many of the federal 
governments health programs concentrate on research epidemiology 
and education not the traditional screening and prevention efforts 
of statefunded health clinics 
dr robert blendon chairman of the department of health policy 
and management at the harvard school of public health said the 
bulk of state health expenditures in this country are tied up in 
medicaid and the situation has grown worse with the mounting 
federal deficit in the 1980s 
most public health activities at the state level were always 
paid for by federal grants blendon said noting that those 
grants are now gone and states are left scrambling to fund 
medicaid care of their sickest citizens 
prevention of chronic disease became the residual that 
disappeared he said 
its very frustrating we just dont have the earlywarning 
prevention systems the minimal stuff that anybody who looks 
sensibly at this would want to do blendon said 
the tne chronic diseases included 
593000 deaths from heart disease 149000 from stroke 125000 
from lung cancer 71000 from obstructive lung disease such as 
emphysema and 55000 from colorectal cancer 
four others caused fewer deaths but made the cdcs list of nine 
because they can be prevented or controlled breast cancer 40000 
deaths diabetes 37000 cirrhosis 26000 and cervical cancer 
4500 
the total of 11 million deaths is down about 10 percent from 
1979 hahn said largely becaus of decreases in heart disease and 
stroke 
leading causes of death not on the chronic disease list include 
unintentional injuries which killed some 95000 people according 
to 1987 reports and pneumonia and flu which killed about 69000 
death rates from the nine preventable chronic diseases listed by 
the cdc were generally lower in the west the agency reported the 
highest 1986 death rate was in michigan 518 such deaths per 
100000 people lowest was in hawaii 327 per 100000 
meanwhile the cdc said thursday unintentional injuries take 
the greatest toll when age is factored into death statistics to 
measure years of potential life lost 
the cdc routinely studies the leading killers of young people by 
measuring years not lived by people who die before 65 65 is an 
arbitrary cutoff since the nations life expectancy is somewhat 
higher 
in 1988 the latest year for which analysis is available deaths 
from unintentional injuries robbed their under65 victims of an 
estimated 23 million years of life the cdc said such injuries 
kill about 28000 americans under 65 every year 
cancer took 18 million years of potential life heart disease 
accounted for 15 million years and suicide and homicide together 
accounted for 14 million years 
the numbers of actual premature deaths in 1988 were not 
available however 1987 totals were unintentional injuries about 
28000 victims under 65 cancer 160000 heart disease 141000 
and 24000 suicides and 20000 homicides 
aids was the sixth leading cause of lost years of life in 1988 
after birth defects and robbed its victims of an estimated 472000 
years of life it was seventh in 1987 when 13000 deaths accounted 
for 363000 years of life lost or 30 percent less than in 1988

police government officials say the number of agents and 
informants was nearly 200000 
in presenting the resolution new forum representative reinhard 
scult called the secret police a danger to development of 
society and a danger to internal peace 
the secret police force known as the stasi used strongarm 
methods to suppress dissent during the honecker era 
negotiators thursday asked that former communist party leader 
egon krenz be forced to reveal comprehensive information about the 
secret police when he appears before the panel next week 
on wednesday krenz cited an oath of secrecy in refusing to 
divulge such information to a commission investigating the brutal 
tactics used by police to disperse prodemocracy protests oct 78 
honecker has denied responsibility for the brutality but on 
wednesday ousted politburo member guenter schabowski said honecker 
was to blame 
honecker took things into his own hands schabowski said 
all decisions and orders that led to the police actions against 
demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through 
honecker and mielke

a charge that an 18yearold supplied the cocaine that president 
bush used as a prop in a speech last september 
a jury convicted the young man keith jackson on three other 
drug counts 
after two days of deliberations the jury was unable to reach 
verdicts on two charges against jackson selling crack cocaine to 
an undercover federal agent in lafayette park across the street 
from the white house last sept 1 and using a telephone to arrange 
the sale us district judge stanley sporkin declared a mistrial 
on those two counts 
the jury convicted jackson of distributing crack cocaine at a 
shopping mall and twice near a high school in the district of 
columbia between last april 24 and july 27 
jackson was retried on the five charges after another jury 
failed to reach verdicts on any counts in december 
sentencing was set for march 16 under federal sentencing 
guidelines he faces a minimum of 12 years in prison and a maximum 
of more than 15 years according to the us attorneys office

surrounding the presidents speech 
white house aides decided to have the president hold up a bag of 
crack for the camera drug enforcement administration officials 
changed the location of a pending undercover purchase to 
accommodate a white house request to get the drugs near the white 
house the president noted the location of the purchase in his 
speech

come to lafayette park because he didnt know where the white house 
was 
jacksons lawyer charles stow brought out in court that a dea 
agent in the lafayette park transaction wore a body microphone that 
didnt work a cameraman who was supposed to videotape the 
transaction was unable to do so because he was assaulted by a 
homeless person

all else being equal a married prochoice 
democratic woman would easily defeat a married antiabortion 
republican man in a hypothetical election held today according to 
a survey released thursday by a womans political organization 
the poll conducted for emilys list shows a 12point margin 
between two such candidates in a hypothetical election it was the 
widest spread among the combinations of candidates presented to 
poll respondents 
the results are a key to electing more democratic women which 
is not an easy task said ellen malcolm president of the 
organization which raises money and identifies political 
opportunities for female democratic officeseekers 
the poll said that when marital status and sex were not 
specified prochoice democrats would have a 10point advantage 
over prolife republicans emilys list said it used the terms 
prochoice and prolife because of the strong images they 
present and because of the likelihood that candidates would use one 
of the terms to describe themselves 
malcolm said the survey was designed to single out the affects 
of being prochoice or prolife and therefore did not offer 
respondents any other information about the hypothetical candidate 
besides that party affiliation sex and marital status 
the release of the survey coincided with a meeting of the 
national republican committee which was expected to focus on how 
gop candidates should deal with abortion in elections this year 
after democrats demonstrated in virginia and new jersey in 1989 
that a prochoice stand was key to winning statewide offices 
republican leaders began saying the gop was a big tent with 
room for both views despite opposition to abortion from president 
bush and the party platform 
the pitfalls of that position were reflected in the emilys list 
poll which had hypothetical prochoice republicans doing less 
well overall than hypothetical prochoice democrats because the 
republicans were not supported by conservatives 
we wish the republicans luck in trying to find a place in 
their tent for all the members of their party said malcolm 
the only bright spot for republicans in the polls findings was 
for those running as prochoice against antiabortion democrats 
republican candidates who are prochoice have a 5point 
advantage over democratic candidates who are prolife said 
celinda lake of greenberglake the analysis group inc which 
conducted the poll 
her telephone survey was conducted from dec 1216 1989 among 
810 randomly selected registered voters each state was represented 
in proportion to its share of the nations population 
the responses should be within 35 percentage points of those 
that would have been obtained if all registered voters had been 
questioned said lake 
the survey also included a sample of 200 hispanic voters who 
proved to be remarkably prochoice according to lake 
she said 37 percent of hispanic voters supported keeping 
abortion legal under all circumstances 51 percent under certain 
circumstances twelve percent were against legalized abortion 
a difficult issue for prochoice candidates is whether minors 
should have to secure a parents approval to have an abortion 
as in other surveys voters overwhelmingly support parental 
consent lake said with 68 percent in favor to 27 percent 
opposed in this survey 
malcolm said prochoice candidates must show great concern and 
sensitivity about the question of parental consent 
she said her organization had no pat strategy for prochoice 
candidates in states where parental consent is in the legislative 
forefront 
what we will say is you need to look at the landscape in 
your district she said 
emilys list was founded in 1985 principally to raise seed 
money for candidates its name is an acronym for early money is 
like yeast it makes the dough rise 
the group in 1986 helped make barbara mikulski of maryland the 
first democratic woman elected to the senate

hungary on thursday demanded that the 
estimated 52000 soviet troops in its country go home in 1991 at 
the latest accelerating its timetable for a pullout 
at eastwest arms control talks it also broke ranks with the 
soviet union and proposed dramatic cuts in foreign troops 
including us soldiers stationed in europe 
the surprise announcements by ferenc somogyi state secretary of 
the hungarian foreign ministry were another sign of the growing 
independence of members of the sovietled warsaw pact 
czechoslovakia said this week wants the 75000 soviet troops 
within its borders out by the end of 1990 in poland solidarity 
leader lech walesa made a similar demand thursday in talks with 
soviet ambassador wladimir browikow 
walesa said he told browikow the soviet troops should have been 
withdrawn a long time ago because a situation may occur when it 
will be hot and people start to protest 
in the drive toward democracy the budapest government has told 
moscow it wants its troops withdrawn but gave no deadline somogyi 
insisted thursday that they must leave this year or 1991 at the 
latest 
there is no political or military reason which would justify 
or call for the foreign troops in hungary he told a news 
conference 
he said the hungarian armed forces was capable of defending its 
own territory 
in 1956 the soviets sent troops and tanks into hungary to 
silence a popular uprising against stalinism reformist premier 
imre nagy was later convicted of treason in a show trial and 
executed 
hungarys cuurent premier miklos nemeth recently met soviet 
premier nikolai ryzhkov to arrange talks on a pullout nemeth had 
stressed that withdrawal depended on an eastwest agreement to 
reduce conventional or nonnuclear forces in europe 
about 10000 soviet troops already have left both hungary and 
czechoslovakia under a gradual withdrawal of 50000 soldiers from 
eastern europe announced in december 1988 by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
an additional 6000 of the 52000 soviet troops said to be left 
in hungary are due to leave this year an undisclosed number are to 
leave czechoslovakia where officials say there are 75000 soviet 
troops 
somogyi also said he formally proposed greater cuts in foreign 
troops than previous us or soviet proposals at the 23nation 
negotiations on reducing conventional arms in europe 
president bush has suggested the united states and the soviet 
union trim their forces stationed in europe outside their home 
territory to 275000 on each side that would require the soviets 
to pull out 300000 troops and the united states 30000 
the soviet union has talked about a limit of 300000 to 350000 
troops stationed abroad in each alliance that would cover not only 
american but also british french and other western forces 
stationed in west germany 
somogyi said his plan would go farther 
the ceiling he said should cover all foreign forces and be 
brought much below the currently negotiated level of 275000 
troops 
he gave no number 
he said hungary believes there would be no need of foreign 
troops in europe were the current political developments to 
continue but he said it would be unrealistic now to push for total 
withdrawal 
the arms negotiations is between the 16 nations of the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the seven of the warsaw pact nato 
wants to reach an agreement this year troops tanks artillery and 
other conventional arms 
senior military officers from 35 nations also were meeting in 
vienna for a third day to discuss eastwest military strategies 
romanias military chief gen vasile ionel said the new 
government was working to create a democratic society he said the 
government wanted a military budget that provided the minimum 
amount necessary for national defense

the court also ratified an arrest order against miguel orellana 
febres corderos soninlaw and his private secretary while he was 
president 
orellana is a fugitive from justice on the earlier arrest order 
the warrant against febres cordero involves the alleged payment 
of 150000 to an israeli antiterrorism expert in 1987 while febres 
cordero was president 
when asked by the channel 10 tv reporter whether he would resist 
arrest febres cordero replied arrest me arrest me why would 
they 
febres cordero a wealthy industrialist returned to his 
hometown of guayaquil ecuadors largest city and its commercial 
hub 165 miles southwest of quito when his fouryear term of office 
ended in 1988 he continues to enjoy wide popularity there 
according to radio sucre in guayaquil after the courts 
decision became known hundreds of people gathered outside febres 
corderos home a caravan of 60 to 80 cars followed him to his 
private office where he gave the tv interview 
the people are my judge he said if the people want to 
support the one who has defended them thats fine with me let 
them come forth so that the country can begin the restitution of an 
honest uncorrupted judicial system 
late thursday riot police used tear gas to break up a crowd of 
hundreds of profebres cordero supporters who assembled on central

1988

the central bank which orellana says was used to pay israel 
security adviser ram gazit for advice in fighting a small leftist 
guerrilla group then active in ecuador 
before orellana vanished he said he could not present proof of 
how the money was spent because gazit for security reasons could 
not appear in his defense 
after moderate leftist rodrigo borja was elected president in 
1988 the central bank revealed the 150000 was withdrawn in cash 
and no accounting for it was given 
febres cordero charged at the time that the case was meant to 
embarrass him politically and said he assumed responsibility for 
the spending of the money 
febres cordero had a stormy term of office he was kidnapped in 
1987 by paratroopers loyal to an air force commander who had 
rebelled against the government in 1986 after febres cordero won 
his release by pardoning the jailed general the leftistcontrolled 
congress sought to impeach him

three silicon valley computer workers 
have been charged with breaking into government and telephone 
company computers in a case that prosecutors said thursday 
demonstrates the vulnerability of those systems 
the three are accused of committing what may be the first 
electronic invasion of a military computer network according to 
one expert a federal indictment charges them with obtaining flight 
orders for a military training exercise of eavesdropping on 
private telephone conversations and getting fbi information on 
associates of the late philippine president ferdinand marcos 
the case does signal a vulnerability in the pentagons 
computers us attorney joseph russoniello said thursday at a news 
conference in san francisco 
the indictment unsealed wednesday in us district court in san 
jose is one of the first in the nation to use federal criminal 
statutes directed at computer crime said assistant us attorney 
robert k crowe in a news release 
the charges crowe said reveal the extreme vulnerability of 
the phone network 
charged were kevin l poulsen 24 a former employee of sri 
international a menlo park computer consulting company mark k 
lottor 25 a current sri employee and robert e gilligan 31 who 
worked for computermaker sun microsystems 
poulsen could do whatever he wanted to do with the telephone 
system as well as with government computers crowe said wednesday 
the three are charged with 19 counts of conspiracy computer 
fraud fraud involving computer access devices using fictitious 
names or addresses possession of electronic wiretapping devices 
falsely repesenting a social security number interception of 
electronic communications embezzlement and theft of public 
property 
poulsen is named in 17 counts involving all of the offenses 
lottor is named in five counts and gilligan named in seven counts 
if convicted lottor and gilligan face 20 years in prison and 
fines of 30000 poulsen could be sentenced to 37 years in prison 
and a 50000 fine 
according to the indictment poulsen used common burglary tools 
including surgical gloves powdered graphite and lock picks and 
forged a pacific bell employee card to steal the telecommunications 
equipment and access codes from the regional phone companys 
offices 
gilligan and poulsen are accused of trafficking in codes that 
allow access to government computers through electronic mail 
the pair got access to the armys masnet computer network the 
indictment said without detailing uses of the computer 
in late 1987 and early 1988 poulsen got air tasking orders for 
a military exercise at fort bragg nc called cpx caber dragon 
the indictment said the information secret at the time has been 
declassified because the event has already taken place russoniello 
said 
the marcos information was a computer list of phone numbers and 
cable assignments of marcos and others that related to an fbi 
investigation the indictment said 
peter g neumann a computer security expert at sri said this 
was the first case he knew in which classified information was 
allegedly obtained by computer breakins 
the indictment accuses poulsen of using his computer knowledge 
to obstruct the investigation into his alleged activities 
gilligan and lottor were expected to surrender voluntarily 
poulsen who called federal authorities but manipulated the 
computer so the call couldnt be traced remained at large 
poulsen quit sri in 1988 and took a job at sun but later moved 
back to los angeles to live with his parents said donn parker 
security expert and senior management consultant with sri 
poulsen was hired by sri despite company officials belief he 
once broke into a computer at the university of california los 
angeles parker said 
the people who hired him did know he had some hacker 
experience in his background but he was a very bright guy 
parker said they considered the earlier incident youthful excess 
he said 
the indictment doesnt indicate what authorities believe the men

the african national congress on thursday 
conceded it could not step up insurgent actions inside south 
africa and said it may have to prepare for negotiations with the 
whiteled government in pretoria 
the armed struggle must continue but looking at our situation 
realistically we must admit that we do not have the capacity within 
our country to intensify the struggle in any meaningful way said 
anc secretarygeneral alfred nzo 
addressing the first session of a threeday gathering of the anc 
national executive committee nzo said the black guerrilla group 
risked being caught off balance by political reforms introduced 
by president fw de klerk 
south africas government was pushing ahead with reforms at a 
speed designed to outmaneuver the anc and activists campaigning 
against the apartheid system of racial separation nzo said 
nzo urged guerrilla leaders not to trail behind events with 
our feet shackled by old perceptions and a fear to confront a new 
reality 
we must break new ground and keep the initiative firmly in our 
hands he said unless we act quickly we will surrender the 
initiative to pretoria 
the movement began a campaign of bombing and sabotage attacks in 
1961 
outlawed in south africa the anc has repeatedly said it will 
not negotiate with de klerk until its jailed leader nelson mandela 
is released the organization is legalized political trials are 
halted and troops are withdrawn from black townships 
nzo said the lusaka meeting will review developments in south 
africa and focus on the expected release within weeks of mandela 
and his future role in the organization 
among the eight freed activists visiting the anc external 
headquarters in lusaka for the talks with exiled leaders are walter 
sisulu 77 onetime anc secretarygeneral and five others 
released by de klerk in october after serving more than 25 years in 
prison 
the eight are scheduled to travel to tanzania where the anc has 
several guerrilla training camps on jan 23 later they will fly 
to europe where they are expected to visit ailing anc president 
oliver tambo 
tambo suffered a heart seizure last august and is under medical 
care in sweden 
nzo said the stroke paralyzed tambos right side but he was 
regaining strength and was now able to walk without assistance it 
was the first confirmation by the anc that tambo had been 
immobilized by the stroke

lech walesa accepted an invitation to 
visit moscow formally delivered thursday by the soviet ambassador 
and seized the chance to tell him all soviet troops should be 
withdrawn from poland by years end 
during ambassador vladimir brovikovs visit to the headquarters 
of the once outlawed opposition movement solidaritys walesa 
assailed the last 50 years of polishsoviet relations as based on 
political domination by one side 
in a communique after the meeting the state news agency pap 
reported walesa said normalizing sovietpolish relations also 
requires 
an explanation of what went on behind the scenes in the soviet 
invasion of poland as world war ii began in september 1939 
the location of graves of polish soldiers walesa said were 
murdered on soviet soil in april 1940 
a full explanation of the imprisonment of 16 polish leaders 
summoned to postwar moscow and 
compensation for those polish citizens who were expelled from 
territory annexed by the soviet union after the war 
the katyn massacre of thousands of polish army officers on 
soviet territory early in world war ii is one of the emotional 
issues still tainting sovietpolish relations 
walesa told brovikov soviet troops should have left a long 
time ago because a situation may occur when it will be hot and 
people start to protest 
it should be at your initiative we do not want emotions 
concerning the troops to influence relations between neighbors 
you are the empire and we know that waving sabers at the soviet 
union would be stupid 
the envoy replied that the troops may be an anachronism from 
europes past but a warsaw pact agreement exists and the two 
governments will have to decide the issue 
walesas moscow visit will be at the official invitation of 
soviet trade unions and likely include a meeting with president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
no date was announced but the trip probably will be scheduled 
for late march or april brovikov said 
he said he would like walesa to advocate more mutual trust and 
respect i would also like you to speak against all 
demonstrations of antisovietism in a more decisive way 
i am going to do this but we have to clear up the foreground 
first walesa responded referring to issues still straining 
relations 
we are doomed to be neighbors so we have to make sure that it 
should be good and friendly walesa said after the session 
brovikov called the meeting a breakthrough 
it was the meeting of the representative of a state that is 
reforming itself and a reformer he said 
the two men discussed the need to structure relations on a 
partnership basis pap said as well as to explain matters that 
put a shadow on contacts between the two nations 
brovikov said for the sake of a better future we do not have 
to pretend there was no past 
we are supporting the polish government because it was formed 
in a democratic way we are aware that it is an authentic 
government and that this is something permanent 
we are realists too and you have to look at us through the 
new glasses too give us time the ambassador said 
walesa traveled to moscow for the first time on dec 18 for the 
funeral of fellow human rights activist and nobel peace laureate 
andrei d sakharow 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the solidarity editor who 
became the east blocs first noncommunist government leader in 
august visited the soviet union in late november

a federal report thursday concluded that 
racial animosities between indians and nonindians have escalated 
in northern wisconsin during the past five years of tribal 
spearfishing 
the report said the rise in hostilities centered on indian 
treaty rights and was most noticeable because of increased racist 
attacks on chippewa spearfishers 
gov tommy g thompson said he hopes the report released by the 
wisconsin advisory committee to the us civil rights commission 
will spur congress to address the conflicts 
its about time the federal government said you know what 
we should do something thompson said theyre the ones who 
set policy 
but thompson said despite attempts at negotiations among treaty 
rights factions the issue ultimately would be decided in the us 
supreme court 
wisconsins six chippewa indian tribes retain the right to 
spearfish hunt cut timber and gather food on offreservation 
lands under 19th century courtaffirmed treaties that ceded 
northern wisconsin to the us government 
in recent years opponents to those rights have staged large and 
sometimes hostile protests at boat landings and lakes where the 
chippewa spearfish each spring protesters contend its unfair to 
allow only the chippewa to legally spearfish since the method is 
very efficient 
last year the protests escalated into rockthrowing and 
namecalling incidents and large police forces were called in to 
keep the peace some 200 protesters were arrested during the 
demonstrations 
james l baughman committee chairman of the report said 
overall the information received indicated that little has 
changed since the committees last review of indian treaty rights 
in 1984 except for an increase in racial polarization 
the committee members said confrontations where the indians 
spearfish have the potential to become even more violent in future 
years 
the increased hostility has been particularly provoked by 
spearfishing baughman said 
the sevenmember committee sent the report to the civil rights 
commission after it was unanimously endorsed 
efforts to negotiate settlements that would pay the tribes 
millions of dollars to curtail its treaty rights have been rejected 
during the past year by tribal members 
the report contained no recommendations on how to deal with the 
conflicts but detailed incidents of increased racism since the 
1984 study 
the report said racism was reflected in slogans such as save a 
walleye spear an indian and save a deer shoot an indian 
found on hats handguns and bumper stickers sold in northern 
wisconsin 
baughman said the creation of organized antitreaty rights 
groups in recent years also has fostered racism 
theyve served as a catalyst baughman said theyve made 
it a more emotional more spirited issue than it needs to be 
but chuck valliere vice chairman of protect americans rights 
and resources which was formed about four years ago said his 
group doesnt promote racist attitudes despite the presence of 
racism in northern wisconsin 
i think our role is more to promote education about treaty 
rights issues he said i think that its racism just 
something that comes out on the side and it comes from both 
sides 
the committee reported complaints about lack of public 
information available about indian treaty rights and the need for 
indian culture and history in curriculum 
it also said lack of complete accurate news media coverage was 
a complaint lodged by many people 
willie nunnery a madison attorney and committee member said 
the state government cannot wash its hands of the issue 
shifting all of this to the federal government is like 
shifting the buck he said

portugal asked for help 
thursday to combat an oil slick that has devastated wildlife and 
coated the beaches of one of its islands with foulsmelling slime 
officials said 
the government requested aid from the european communitys 
antipollution task force in brussels belgium to coordinate 
international assistance to the madeira island of porto santo a 
navy spokesman said 
cmdr antonio monteiro coelho said portugal asked for floating 
barriers pumps and solvents from the european community to protect 
nearby islands in case a change in the wind put them in the path of 
the oil spill whose origin remains a mystery 
monteiro coelho said 200 tons of crude oil had already been 
removed from the tiny island where oil from the 12milelong slick 
first washed ashore sunday 
however pollution experts in porto santo said the cleanup may 
take three months 
the slick covered porto santos rocky north and east coasts and 
hit the white sands of a famous sixmile beach that is the islands 
main tourist attraction 
porto santo part of portugals madeira achipelago is about 625 
miles southwest of lisbon the mainland capital and 435 miles west 
of morocco 
environmentalists said the deaths of dozens of rare loggerhead 
turtles gulls and fish constituted an ecological disaster and 
accused local and central authorities of responding slowly to the 
slick 
in a telephone interview monteiro coelho said if the slick 
continued its course it would avoid a nature reserve on the 
uninhabited desertas islands 35 miles to the south and the volcanic 
cliffs of the main madeira island a major winter destination 
the desertas are home to a variety of rare maritime animals 
including one of the worlds last breeding colonies of the 
mediterranean monk seal an endangered marine mammal 
patches of oil washed up on madeiras north coast wednesday but 
were described as insignificant by a madeirabased naval 
officer 
still islanders on porto santo were using reserves of drinking 
water after desalination plants providing 80 percent of the water 
supply were closed after oil contamination of the seawater supply 
the islands fish market was also closed because of fears of oil 
contamination

thursdays acquittals in the mcmartin 
preschool molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors 
botched it while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of 
justice over hysteria and hype 
motherandson defendants peggy mcmartin buckey 63 and raymond 
buckey 31 wept as the verdicts were announced jurors found the 
pair innocent of 52 charges and couldnt reach a verdict on 13 
other counts prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges 
in a new trial 
i just said i told you ray mrs buckey said asked if 
her son was surprised she said he had fear definitely 
buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his 
lawyer 
if it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to 
you too if it had not been in my faith in god i wouldnt be here 
today she said 
but several parents of former students at the school said the 
buckeys won because the system lost 
it was never done properly said parent alan lagunoff who 
moved to central california from suburban manhattan beach i have 
to sit back and figure out what to do with my son i fear that 
because of this verdict no child will be seen as a credible 
witness from now on 
his son now 10 attended the school for 1 years but wasnt a 
witness at the trial 
i dont think its worth it to bring this thing back into the 
courts it will just be another sixyear travesty lagunoff said 
the system is not going to protect children said jackie 
mcgauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but 
didnt testify in the case i dont know what the message is that 
the jury wanted to get out im anxious to hear that 
charles buckey father of raymond and husband of mrs buckey 
suggested deputy district attorney lael rubin who prosecuted the 
case for its entire six years was motivated by personal ambition 
my concern primarily was lael rubin who is anything goes in 
order to secure a conviction if you dont win you dont get 
promoted he said 
juror brenda williams said the evidence failed to convince the 
jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges 
even if you accept that the children were molested it didnt 
necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin preschool 
ms williams told reporters 
raymond buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail 
during the case which defense attorneys said was the result of 
community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic 
mother of one child at the preschool 
some observers accused thendistrict attorney robert philibosian 
of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing reelection 
campaign against ira reiner who beat him and now runs the district 
attorneys office 
philibosian however insisted he would not have handled the 
matter differently 
ira reiner has had that case for five years and i am not 
going to take any public criticism directed at me let him respond 
to the criticism said philibosian now in private law practice 
also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a 
private child therapy group childrens institute international to 
conduct the original interviews with the children defense 
attorneys maintained that questions by the institutes researchers 
were leading and prejudicial 
jurors agreed 
we never got the childrens stories in their own words said 
juror john breese 
childrens institute officials didnt immediately return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
originally there were seven defendants including raymond 
buckeys sister peggy ann buckey and virginia mcmartin the 
founder of the school mother of mrs buckey and grandmother of 
raymond buckey 
hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the 
case which gained worldwide attention with its tales of 
underground tunnels at the school and satanic rituals 
the focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as 
reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants 
after reviewing the case the underground tunnels were never found 
no proof was ever produced of satanic rituals 
reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long 
expensive prosecution 
it took far too long and cost far too much money to have what 
has been called perfect justice we need reform reiner said 
adding that in trying to describe the case insane is the word 
that comes to mind 
the case was the longest and the costliest in american judicial 
history at 2 years and 15 million superior court judge william 
pounders said he did what he could to limit its length cutting 50 
witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case 
for parents and others there was more to ponder than legal 
questions 
life is not fair i tell my children all the time there is 
no such thing as fair said robert currie whose son attended 
mcmartin but didnt testify at the trial 
its really a travesty for a case to take this long said 
ms rubin the prosecutor not only for the families the 
children in this case but also for the defendants as well

thursday appealed to the united states and other countries for help 
in rebuilding the economy where he said a third of the work force

own work and the adjustments needed to make out economy competitive 
again

dictator manuel antonio noriega

has no plans to marry soon 
we are getting to know each other endara who is 54 told 
reporters

economic efforts and to strengthen democracy and freedom and to 
make sure that the sacrifices of panamanians and americans were not 
in vain he added referring to the dead during the us invasion

us officials to speed up the flow of economic assistance to 
panama the united states has expressed a willingness to help 
panama but declined to give figures on how much aid money will be

preschool operators raymond buckey and his 
mother were acquitted thursday of 52 child molestation charges in 
the nations longest and costliest criminal trial inciting outrage 
among parents whose children attended the nursery school 
jurors deadlocked on 12 sex abuse counts against buckey and a 
single conspiracy count against him and his 63yearold mother 
peggy mcmartin buckey 
superior court judge william pounders declared a mistrial on 
those counts and dismissed the deadlocked conspiracy charge against 
mrs buckey he set a jan 31 hearing to determine whether the 13 
unresolved counts will be dismissed against buckey 
announcement of the innocent verdicts brought gasps and sobs in 
the packed courtroom 
buckey 31 who spent nearly five years in jail because of the 
charges and his mother who was jailed for almost two years cried 
as the verdicts were read 
ive gone through hell and now weve lost everything mrs 
buckey said outside court my concern was for my son and what 
theyve done to him because my son would never harm a child 
i feel wonderful said charles buckey father of raymond and 
husband of mrs buckey raymond buckey avoided reporters and 
slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer 
jurors said they didnt believe the molestation stories told by 
nine children who testified in the case because they had been 
manipulated by the suggestions of parents and therapists 
i tried to believe the children said juror daryl hutchins 
but he said the children had been so contaminated by leading 
questions from adults that he couldnt 
about an hour after the verdicts were announced parent jackie 
mcgauley said im still in shock when i first heard it i 
didnt believe it i thought someone had made a mistake her 
child wasnt among those testifying as victims 
mary mae cioffi another parent who is vocal about the case 
through her children didnt testify added i am really 
disappointed the anger is beginning to rise we have programs all 
over the country that tell children to run and tell when somebody 
hurts them and our children told some of them spent 35 days on 
the stand and they get a not guilty it shows that our justice 
system needs a revamp for kids 
i know my children were molested i had my daughter sleep 
between my husband and i for a whole year because she was so afraid 
somebody would come and get her that they would kill her because 
she told she said 
the investigation of alleged mass molestation at the suburban 
mcmartin preschool ignited a nationwide wave of worry about child 
abuse when it came to light in 1983 it produced widespread fear 
among working parents that their children might be at risk at 
school 
the trial lasted nearly three years and cost 15 million making 
it the longest and most expensive criminal proceeding in us 
history 
i was not surprised by the verdicts the judge said at a 
news conference afterward i would not have been surprised at any 
decision the jury made he also said legislation was needed to 
prevent such lengthy proceedings in the future 
asked if the state owes the defendants an apology pounders said 
no he calculated that only 30 percent of the time consumed in the 
case was devoted to the prosecution 
the length of the trial was due primarily to the defense 
rather than the prosecution he said 
prosecutor lael rubin said we ultimately must respect the 
jurys decision even though i personally disagree with it i 
believe that the families involved in this case and the children 
involved in this case cannot be forgotten or overlooked in 
terms of what they have had to endure in the kind of system we 
presently have 
district attorney ira reiner also said judicial reform was 
needed 
insane is the word that comes to mind we need two things 
move cases to trial much more rapidly and through the court more 
rapidly he said 
rubin said she would consult with parents in the case before 
deciding whether to refile charges against buckey on the 13 
deadlocked counts 
mrs buckeys attorney dean gits said his client would now try 
to get on with her life 
she wants to piece her life back together thats all she 
really has lost everything and what she hopes to do is to move away 
and eventually build a house settle down and be left alone with 
her family said gits 
another defense attorney danny davis said several members of 
the buckey and mcmartin family planned to file a federal lawsuit 
friday naming the city of manhattan beach los angeles county and 
others as defendants

pounders was the first to see the 52 sealed verdicts which 
absolved the defendants of an array of child sexual abuse 
allegations involving rape sodomy and fondling 
the conspiracy count alleged that buckey and his mother 
conspired to commit an assortment of lewd and lascivious acts on 
children under 14 years old 
this is somebody elses system complained parent bob curry 
whose child didnt testify in baseball its never over till 
its over in child molestation and this is a good example of it 
its never over when its over 
the jury spent nine weeks deliberating on the charges against 
the buckeys who were accused of molesting 11 children over five 
years at the familyowned school in suburban manhattan beach 
you have endured where all else has failed the judge told 
jurors there is really no way i can thank you for your service 
when he announced you are excused from further jury 
service the panelists broke into shouts and applause 
in interviews in the courtroom afterward the jurors said they 
believed some of the children were molested but the prosecution 
never established that the defendants were responsible 
they also said parents fears and the techniques of 
psychologists who interviewed the students may have planted ideas 
in the childrens heads 
i believe that the children believed what they were saying was 
true in the courtroom said juror brenda williams at the 
childrens institute international where psychologists conducted 
taped interviews with the children she said i could not tell 
from watching the tape that the children were telling what actually 
happened to them or if they were repeating what their parents told 
them 
as for the pressures on the jury ms williams said there 
were days when i didnt know if i could stand it anymore i 
think its going to be very hard getting back into the real world 
a single scream was heard in the crowded courthouse hallway when 
the verdicts were read an unidentified woman wept into her hands 
and another looked distressed friends or relatives shielded the 
women from tv cameras 
theyre making a big mistake said chris collins 18 who as 
a child was a student at mcmartin preschool but wasnt one of the 
children involved in the abuse allegations when i woke up this 
morning i thought they would be going to jail the next day the 
justice system has let us down 
buckey who was released on 15 million bail in february and 
his mother free on 295000 bail were required to stand trial 
after an 18month preliminary hearing but five teachers who worked 
at the preschool had charges against them dismissed among those 
were buckeys sister peggy ann and his grandmother virginia 
mcmartin who founded the once prestigious but now defunct nursery 
school 
a jury of 12 plus six alternates began the trial in april 
1987 as months and years passed job problems and illness left 
just a dozen panelists all necessary to deliberate and avoid a 
mistrial on all 65 counts 
more than 1000 pieces of evidence were introduced and 124 
witnesses testified 
the case began in august 1983 when judy johnson mother of a 
child at the school told the manhattan beach police departments 
sex abuse and juvenile investigator that her sons bottom was red 
and that he had spoken of a man named ray who worked at the school 
letters were sent alerting parents to check their children for 
signs of molestation 
mrs johnson suffering from alcohol and mental problems died 
at age 44 a few months before trial began defense attorneys 
contended she was unbalanced and that the case that emerged was 
largely the result of her increasingly bizarre allegations 
on the basis of her complaint buckey was arrested released and 
later rearrested by 1984 when indictments were handed up 
prosecutors accused buckey his mother sister grandmother and 
three other teachers of molesting hundreds of tots at the school 
children gave investigators accounts of satanic rites and 
animals tortured to frighten youngsters into silence 
when buckey and his mother finally came to trial in 1987 the 
focus of the prosecution had narrowed what had originally been 
hundreds of counts of child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and 
a shared count of conspiracy the 41 children once said to have 
been abused came down to 11 alleged victims

a un spokesman said thursday that 
peacekeeping operations face severe limitations because of overdue 
payments a key concern as diplomats work to enhance the world 
bodys role in cambodia peace efforts 
the financial situation has been ominous and now its the 
worst it has ever been said matthew nerzig a spokesman for 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
nerzig said that as of the end of 1989 overdue payments 
assessed for the un peacekeeping budget came to 4473 million 
the cost of un peacekeeping for 1989 was roughly 700 million he 
said 
the united states owes the most in overdue payments including 
152 million for peacekeeping the soviet union owes 125 million 
to the peacekeeping budget 
after two days of meetings this week in paris the un security 
councils five permanent members issued a statement calling for the 
united nations to supervise elections while international 
peacekeepers guarantee security in cambodia 
representatives from the five countries the united states 
soviet union china france and britain plan to meet again in 
about two weeks in new york to push the cambodian peace plan ahead 
the vietnamesebacked communist government of cambodian premier 
hun sen and the three guerrilla factions allied in an uneasy 
coalition all have given at least cautious support for a major un 
role some of the guerrillas are ussupported 
perez de cuellar called the actions in paris another sign of 
growing confidence in the world bodys ability to settle 
conflicts but made it clear that money will be a major factor in 
whether a peace agreement can be reached and supervised by un 
forces 
in recent years the united nations has heightened its 
involvement in mediating regional conflicts clearing the way for 
an end to the iraniraq war and overseeing moves toward 
independence in namibia 
arthur zegelbone a spokesman for the us mission to the united 
nations said washington is committed to seeing a peace plan 
implemented in cambodia but he said it is too early to estimate 
the level of funding the united states can make available 
when you talk about an enhanced role such as that referred to 
by the representatives meeting in paris youre talking about a lot 
of money zegelbone said 
president reagan ordered the withholding of us dues to the 
united nations in 1985 saying the organization was spendthrift and 
had a bloated bureaucracy us arrears rose to well in excess of 
500 million by late 1988 
in september 1988 reagan announced he was satisfied with un 
efforts toward fiscal reform and ordered payment of all back dues 
however the us congress has not authorized full payment citing 
the us budget deficit as a reason for not paying the arrears

seven aborigines four children and 
three adults died of thirst on a desert road after their truck 
broke down in 120degree heat in the australian outback police 
said friday 
as each victim perished those remaining in the group of 11 
buried them along the road officials said police found three 
survivors in the great australian sandy desert on thursday which 
led to the recovery of four of the bodies in shallow graves 
police officers and the royal flying doctor service searched the 
harsh outback in helicopters light planes and fourwheel drives in 
hopes of finding another man who left the band to get help he was 
feared dead 
i think it just reinforces our constant warnings to people 
traveling in the outback to be careful out there said police 
spokesman john skeffington these people are well versed in 
bushcraft and survival techniques and yet they perished 
the survivors were picked up by a passing motorist and were 
reported in stable condition in port hedland regional hospital 
a police spokesman said the group left port hedland in far 
western australia state last friday to return to their remote

jurors in the mcmartin preschool molestation 
case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a 
police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case 
seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference 
after acquitting raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin 
buckey on 52 molestation charges thursday said they felt some 
children who testified may have been molested but not at the 
familyrun mcmartin preschool 
and they said some children may have merely repeated stories 
told them by their parents and interviewers at childrens institute 
international 
the private child therapy center which specializes in abused 
children videotaped interviews with children from the mcmartin 
school after reports of molestations surfaced jurors saw the tapes 
in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and 
leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from 
children 
asked what led to acquittals juror brenda williams focused on 
the taped interviews from the center jurors call cii 
the cii interviews i could not accept them mrs williams 
said i believe the children believe what they were saying was 
true but at cii i could not tell if the children were saying what 
was told to them by interviewers or if they were repeating what 
their parents had told them 
if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had 
not seen them i could have believed the children a little more 
mrs williams said 
the cii tapes did not help me they gave me a lot of 
reasonable doubt agreed juror julie peters 47 a supermarket 
meat wrapper 
the children were never allowed to say in their own words what 
happened to them all the questions were leading they never had a 
chance to tell their stories said juror john breese 51 a 
medical technician and grandfather of five 
i tried to believe the children said juror daryl hutchins 
28 an oil company lease operator but if the child was so 
contaminated by the interviews i couldnt 
equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the 
manhattan beach police department to parents of mcmartin school 
children the letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at 
the school and to buckeys arrest 
the police letter should never have been sent said juror 
sally cordova 27 a supermarket checker it put the information 
out there too early the whole city knew 
at that point jurors said they felt parents had been 
programmed to believe their children had been molested 
one child said his parents told him that he was molested even 
before he went to cii mrs williams recalled 
the panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic 
allegations including some childrens accounts of being molested 
in a car wash we just dismissed those said mrs williams 
they said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact 
because they werent sure what they were seeing in the photos of 
childrens genitals 
although they acquitted defendants of most charges the jurors 
deadlocked on 13 counts some said they were unsure whether buckey 
was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove 
its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt 
jurors said they didnt rule out that some children in the case 
were molested but not by these defendants 
even if you accept that the children were molested said 
juror mark bassett the evidence didnt establish that they were 
molested at the mcmartin preschool 
the panelists said they were aware of the trials enormous toll 
on defendants as well as children and parents 
i think everybody is a victim said ms peters i dont 
think anybody came out of this case a winner i think its sad 
because everybody lost something the defendants their lives have 
been ruined they lost their business their reputation its sad 
mrs williams added the children have to live with this the 
parents have to live with this theres nothing i can say that will 
make it better 
as for themselves the jurors said their lives were put on 
hold for nearly three years bassett lost his job as a research 
computer scientist when his company folded mrs williams got 
married breese said his wife died during the trial and he has 
since remarried 
its been very hard said mrs williams a telephone company 
service representative there were days when i thought i couldnt 
stand it anymore 
i dont really know my job anymore she said its going 
to be hard getting back into the real world 
the jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews

several hundred contra guerrillas have 
crossed into nicaragua in recent days raising fears they will 
attempt to disrupt the electoral process leading up to the feb 25 
elections nicaraguas vice foreign minister said thursday 
theyre hoping to spoil the electoral process said vice 
foreign minister victor hugo tinoco at a press conference here 
there are indications theyre hoping to create irregularities 
prevent voting create a series of problems 
nicaraguas general elections are a key part of the central 
american peace process the ruling sandinistas promised a fair vote 
in return for disbandment of usbacked contra guerrillas based in 
honduras 
tinoco also said president daniel ortega was not planning to 
attend the jan 27 inauguration of rafael leonardo callejas as 
honduran president 
when asked if ortega had bowed out to avoid a confrontation with 
vice president dan quayle tinoco said ortega declined an 
invitation because the nicaraguan campaign is entering its final 
month 
ortega is running for reelection at the head of the sandinista 
ticket his major opponent is violeta barrios de chamorro 
candidate of a coalition of 14 opposition parties 
tinoco said the challenge facing the sandinistas is to win 
despite the terrible economic problems of the last 10 years 
problems the sandinistas blame on us hostility including 
sanctions and support for the contras 
with us support the nicaraguan rebels refused to disband 
pending the outcome of the elections both contra and sandinista 
officials said contra fighters infiltrated into the country in 
october and november 
contra leaders said they were going to await the outcome of the 
elections and did not plan to take an aggressive posture but the 
sandinistas called off a ceasefire and fighting flared for a time 
last november 
tinoco said the contras were infiltrating the countryside and 
would probably be able to affect or frustrate voting in isolated 
areas but he was confident the elections would be judged fair and 
thought the united states would have no choice but to end its 
support of the contras 
the presence of international observers will make it very 
difficult for the government of the united states to say the 
opposite of the truth said tinoco the united states will have 
no alternative but to recognize the result even if the 
sandinistas win 
tinoco noted nicaragua had played host to observers from the 
united nations and the organization of american states for months 
he emphasized the role of former president carter saying last 
mays panamanian elections lost their credibility when carter said 
supporters of gen manuel antonio noriega were commiting fraud 
tinoco said that even if the majority of contra fighters wait 
until after the elections they will be allowed to return 
peacefully he said many fighters including some top leaders had 
already returned 
tinoco was in mexico city to promote conflict and peace a 
collection of his speeches reflections and interviews on the 
central american peace process

the medellin cocaine cartel freed a 
kidnap victim on thursday who bore a memorized message for 
president bush repeating the drug lords pledge to release all 
their hostages and abandon their illicit trade 
the cartel said wednesday it had been defeated by colombias 
antidrug offensive and would stop its activities in exchange for 
amnesty bush whose administration enthusiastically backs the drug 
war here retorted in washington that drug traffickers promises 
should not be believed 
we are going to release all of our hostages the 
extraditables an armed group representing the cartel promised in 
their message to bush the message was repeated from memory by 
roberto toro gonzalez who was kidnapped on dec 14 
in washington spokesman sean walsh said thursday night that the 
white house would have no comment on the cartel message to bush 
the 23yearold merchant son of a wealthy family that owns a 
chain of stores said in a radio interview that the extraditables 
made him memorize the message before chaining him to window grating 
of a house in medellin 
journalists from colombias two major radio networks caracol 
and rcn were tipped off by anonymous phone callers and arrived at 
the scene shortly after toro gonzalezs captors drove off 
authorities estimate at least 18 people remain in the hands of 
the cartel 
the extraditables message indicated that bush should view 
cartel leaders as any other suspected traffickers willing to cut a 
deal with authorities 
if president bush and the men of the drug enforcement 
administration do not believe the word of drug traffickers why do 
they negotiate with them and why do they let them testify against 
other suspects the message asked 
the cartel apparently was referring to plea bargaining 
agreements often made between drug suspects and us authorities 
toro gonzalez is the third medellin cartel hostage to be 
released since wednesday when the cartel freed patricia 
echavarria the sister of president virgilio barcos soninlaw 
and her daughter 
the two kidnapped in medellin on dec 16 carried a communique 
from the extraditables conceding defeat by the cartel 
leading politicians said thursday it meant the struggle was 
almost over but the press said the government must fight on 
the government says the drug traffickers will have to surrender 
to authorities and face the judicial system 
police using helicopters raided a new cocaine laboratory near 
santander in cauca state 200 miles southwest of bogota and 
captured one suspect the national tv news program 24 hours 
reported late thursday 
it said the lab was capable of processing 6600 pounds of 
cocaine a month and that police seized more than 7000 gallons of 
chemicals used to process the drug in wednesdays raid 
the program showed videotape of the laboratory 
before the cartels thursday message was sent interior minister 
carlos lemos simmonds said the government would not be tricked into 
ending its antidrug offensive and that under no circumstances 
would the government negotiate with the traffickers or drop its 
policy of extraditing suspects to the united states to face charges 
two liberal party presidential candidates ernesto samper and 
william jaramillo said in declarations published by el tiempo 
newspaper thursday that the offensive had pushed traffickers into 
an unconditional surrender 
their optimism was shared by medellin mayor juan gomez who has 
repeatedly called for negotiations with the medellin cartel 
el tiempo quoted gomez as saying the extraditables wednesday 
communique was an important step toward peace 
but el tiempo said in its lead editorial the drug war had not 
ended and the concession proved only that the government offensive 
was working 
thursdays headline on another bogota daily la prensa said 
the war will continue 
el espectador the bogota paper whose offices were bombed by 
traffickers in september called the concession another episode in 
the traffickers efforts to extort peace talks 
the cartel has repeatedly promised to down arms and abandon the 
cocaine business in exchange for a government pardon 
since barco ordered the crackdown in midaugust authorities 
have extradited 13 drug suspects to the united states and killed a 
leader of the medellin cartel gonzalo rodriguez gacha in a 
gunfight 
the drug traffickers responded with a terror campaign that 
killed 209 people including 107 who died when a bombed jet crashed 
outside bogota in november 
the extraditables said earlier they would end their bombing and 
assassination campaign and free a number of hostages in the last 
45 days 85 people were kidnapped and authorities said many were 
held by the cartel

president bush boasting that all america 
has triumphed in his first year in office defended the panama 
invasion against critics and again prodded congress to act on his 
unfinished domestic agenda 
bush who starts his second year in office on saturday spoke at 
constitution hall at what amounted to a pep rally with vice 
president dan quayle the cabinet and more than 2000 other top 
officials who hold presidential appointments 
later at a reunion of bush campaign workers he invoked 
humourous memories of his 1988 drive for the presidency against 
democrat michael dukakis 
tonight i really came over to thank you for one thing you did 
not ask me to do you never asked me to make a video riding in a 
tank he said recalling a much ridiculed dukakis campaign pose 
the toughest part for me was the debates some time has passed 
so i want to recognize my opponent bush said with a straight 
face he was strong tough tenacious and a real fighter and i 
gained a newfound respect for dan rather 
bush also praised his vice president saying nobody took more 
heat and did a better job for our ticket and our election than 
you 
quayle for his part quipped to the crowd its hard to 
believe that its been over a year since george bush rode to 
victory on my coattails 
earlier in the constitution hall speech bush said that during 
his first 12 months in office all america has triumphed 
looking back its been quite a year 
just wait till the secondguessers see our second year he 
said 
the panama invasion that toppled manuel antonio noriega was a 
tremendous success he said 
yes theres going to be some secondguessing mondaymorning 
quarterbacks at work but lets not forget 92 percent of the 
people in panama supported operation just cause said bush 
using the pentagons catchy code name for the dec 20 operation and 
referring to a cbs poll in panama 
calling the panamanian people our bothers and our sisters 
he said they deserve our help and so do all our friends in 
latin america and the caribbean and theyll receive it 
while pledging that the united states will support democracy in 
eastern europe i will not neglect this hemisphere bush said 
bush said america was enjoying the longest peacetime boom in 
our history with low unemployment and moderate inflation 
as he has in recent weeks bush prodded congress to reduce 
capital gains tax rates and enact his proposals on childcare 
clean air public education and fighting crime he called for 
passage of the death penalty for cop killers not at some point 
not sometime but now in the past the president has called for 
such legislation both at the federal level and by the states 
the agenda is unfinished the public awaits said the 
president 
quayle often a target of criticism from democrats as an alleged 
intellectual lightweight received a prolonged standing ovation 
including cheers and whistles when he preceded bush on stage white 
house chief of staff john sununu introduced quayle as a key if 
not the key member of the bush administration 
its been a great year said quayle 
president bush has kept his promises to the american people 
no new taxes peace through strength and the day of the dictator is 
over said the vice president sounding three themes from bushs 
inaugural address 
bush cut short his own standing ovation from the crowd in the 
daughters of the american revolution auditorium quipping i 
wanted to stop the applause so you could get back to work

police arrested an avowed rightwing terrorist 
thursday in the shooting of nagasakis mayor who had endured a 
year of death threats after saying emperor hirohito bore some 
responsibility for world war ii 
the shooting said to be the first of an important politician in 
this country since the war outraged many japanese and brought 
calls to heighten respect for freedom of speech 
hitoshi motoshima 67 was shot in the back thursday as he left 
city hall he was reported in serious but not lifethreatening 
condition after surgery to repair damage from a single bullet that 
pierced his left lung 
the gunman escaped alone in a white car but within five hours 
police said they had arrested kazumi tajiri 40 of tokyo in a 
nagasaki hotel tajiri admitted to shooting motoshima and was held 
on suspicion of attempted murder said a nagasaki police spokesman 
who refused to have his name used 
tajiri was the leader of a rightist group with a record of 
violence nagasaki police said and the group had been active in 
the campaign of intimidation that erupted in december 1988 after 
the mayor spoke out on the late emperors wartime role 
in 1987 tajiri appeared in a tv asahi interview where he was 
asked if he was willing to kill somebody he hated 
yes because after all rightwingers are terrorists 
replied tajiri 
his group called the sane thinkers school was the largest 
rightist organization in nagasaki with about 30 members police 
said it also had branches in tokyo and osaka people who answered 
the phone or the door intercom at its offices refused to speak to 
reporters 
rightists have denounced the nagasaki mayor since december 1988 
when he said that emperor hirohito shares responsibility for the 
war as well as all of us who lived in that period 
he said the emperor could have ended the war sooner and spared 
nagasaki from becoming the second city to be atomicbombed 
nagasaki was struck on aug 9 1945 three days after hiroshima 
and japan surrended on aug 15 
the comments came as the 87yearold hirohito was on his 
deathbed he died of cancer jan 7 1989 
though the mayors opinion is shared by many japanese and 
286000 people signed petitions backing his statement it outraged 
the fiercely anticommunist fringe which also venerates the 
imperial family 
rightist groups mounted a public campaign of intimidation by 
convoys of sound trucks circling nagasaki city hall blaring death 
to motoshima 
the mayor received three anonymous letters with bullets a 
nagasaki doctor was convicted of sending those letters and 
sentenced to two years in prison a young rightist was arrested in 
city hall carrying a knife saying he intended to force motoshima 
to recant 
soon after the controversy erupted motoshima said in an 
interview that he hadnt thought there would be such an uproar over 
his opinion 
i guess the real mistake was i waited to say it until now 
he said 
motoshima a roman catholic said he had been bullied in school 
and in the wartime army in which he was a military instructor 
because he could not accept the doctrine then that the emperor was 
divine 
when i was asked by my superior in the army about which is 
more to be respected the emperor or jesus i answered both and 
was punched badly he said 
hirohito renounced his divinity after the war during it most 
historians say he was a figurehead with militarists in the 
government making the decisions but some critics claim he played a 
more active role and the emperor himself declined to shed much 
light on the issue 
motoshima is an independent conservative formerly supported by 
the longgoverning liberal democrats he has been estranged from 
the party since the controversy arose 
after he was shot the government and other japanese decried the 
clear threat to freedom of speech 
its an extremely cruel crime and it will have a strong 
impact on society said chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama 
speaking for the government 
newspapers have been hit repeatedly by the rightists an attack 
on an asahi shimbun office in 1987 killed one reporter and wounded 
another 
coupled with the fact that culprits responsible for a series 
of attacks on offices of the asahi shimbun have yet to be uncovered 
by police the shooting reminds us that our society still remains 
vulnerable to a nightmare of terrorism against freedom of speech 
the asahi said in an editorial in fridays edition 
free speech is guaranteed in japans postwar constitution but 
those who exercise it in ways that arouse the rightist fringe must 
be braced for intimidation by threats and the convoys of extremist 
sound trucks 
national police said its records showed 25 attacks on prominent 
politicians since world war ii but all were by knives swords 
explosives or fists not guns japanese law bans possession of 
handguns though the criminal world and rightists seem to have them

veronique le guen a cave explorer who set a world 
record after living in underground isolation for 111 days died of 
an overdose of barbiturates police said thursday she was 33 
her body was discovered late thursday in a car in northeastern 
paris said police who called the death a suicide there was no 
indication how long ms le guen had been in the car 
ms le guen descended into a cavern 260 feet underground on aug 
10 1988 near millau in southern france equipped with 264 gallons 
of water 900 books and crates of canned and frozen foods 
she wore no watch and bore no other instrument to determine what 
time or day it was or what was taking place above ground 
a pale but healthy ms le guen returned to the surface on nov 
29 1988 eclipsing a 20yearold record set by josie laures who 
stayed underground for 88 days 
ms le guen had said her fondest memory during the ordeal was 
reading one hundred years of solitude a bestselling book by 
the colombian author gabriel garcia marquez 
she said she grew to like her damp surroundings and talked to 
stalactites the only sound around her was that of dripping water 
and her only contact with the outside world was a telephone 
the calls put into my ears the sounds of people living without 
me in the free air she said i missed that and felt bad about 
it 
upon leaving the cave she said she felt the joy of being 
reunited with her family and a poignant sadness at leaving this 
cave which id become attached to after all 
in a book on her experiences that was published last summer 
alone at the bottom of the pit she described the stress 
brought about by the long isolation and her fear of sleeping and 
staying in hibernation

gov rose mofford announced thursday that she 
wont be a candidate this fall to extend the term in the office she 
inherited after the impeachment of former gov evan mecham 
the 67yearold democratic governor made the announcement on her 
first day back at work after undergoing surgery dec 18 for removal 
of her gallbladder but she said her health was not a factor in her 
decision not to run 
mrs mofford a government employee for almost 48 years when her 
elected predecessors impeachment elevated her from secretary of 
state to governor in 1988 said she realized while lying in her 
hospital bed that there were many things she could do only after 
retiring 
there are so many things i want to do that i dont think there 
is time left in my life to do all off them she said i feel 
this one i have to call for rosie 
mrs mofford has been plagued by medical problems as well as by 
political critics since she became governor 
ive served arizona long and hard and i think i have done an 
outstanding job for 50 years mrs mofford said 
im not tired she said i wish i had 50 years to go 
she said she decided to make her announcement now to end all 
of the speculation 
mecham and several other republicans have already announced 
their intention to run for governor this fall but other democrats 
have steered clear of the contest deferring to mrs mofford 
two democrats often mentioned as possible candidates if mrs 
mofford decided not run have been phoenix mayor terry goddard and 
chief justice frank gordon jr of the arizona supreme court 
gordon presided at the senate impeachment trial where mecham was 
ousted elevating mrs mofford from her elected but largely 
ceremonial post as secretary of state 
soon after becoming governor mrs mofford suffered a concussion 
in a fall from a platform she also underwent treatment for 
cataracts and headaches and was hospitalized for gallbladder 
surgery dec 18 
doctors predicted she could be back at work quickly and mrs 
mofford gave an abbreviated state of state address jan 8 but she

any production of macbeth with as 
interesting an actor as raul julia in the title role should be home 
free the new york shakespeare festivals revival now on view at 
the public theater is about halfway there 
the best thing about it is julia who plays the renegade 
scottish king as a fearful monarch driven by a desire to be found 
out rather than as a symbol of pure evil 
watch his eyes and you can in the small tightly enclosed 
playing area in the publics anspacher theater they are forever 
darting never resting on one person or another but the looks get 
more steely more crazed as the killings go on and macbeth tries 
to consolidate his power 
julia negotiates the big soliloquies and this play is chock 
full of them with skill his voice is strong resonant his 
manner thoughtful theres even a hint of dark humor as he 
gradually gets caught up in the bloodletting and accepts it as 
inevitable 
but he has little rapport with melinda mullins a disappointment 
as lady macbeth shes supposed to be the instigator the cheering 
section leading macbeth on to those terrible deeds but her support 
and cajoling is more shrewish than savage and she has a tendency 
to become strident in the plays most emotional moments 
richard jordans straightforward direction is workmanlike 
almost tentative still there are some striking moments banquos 
ghost is a quite literal apparition a walking zombie doused in 
blood and when macduff learns about the death of his wife and 
children he pulls a hood over his head in grief 
but other moments dont quite work the three witches are 
reduced to a cackling greek chorus which sporadically watches the 
action from behind a long wooden fence the battle scenes are 
strenuously athletic in fact they are so exuberant and 
freewheeling that you fear for theatergoers sitting in the front 
rows 
most of the supporting cast is strong particularly larry 
bryggman as the doomed banquo thomas gibson as a boyish eager 
malcolm and william converseroberts as the passionate macduff 
macbeth is shakespeares most desolate play a bleak 
rumination on the nature of evil you wont be surprised or 
startled by the production but theres always julias intelligence 
at work to keep you absorbed he makes that evil seem very human 
indeed

playwright charles fuller has staked a claim to a large segment 
of black history in we the collective title for his ambitious 
fiveplay project set in the last half of 19thcentury america 
fullers third effort in the series entitled jonquil 
arrived over the weekend under the auspices of the negro ensemble 
company at offbroadways theater four jonquil is the best so 
far more dramatic and coherent than its predecessors although it 
retains their episodic nature still one longs for more character 
development 
in the play set in south carolina right after the civil war 
fuller deals with efforts by former slaves to exercise their 
hardearned right to vote the title character is a blind black 
woman who still works for a white family but most of the action 
concerns calvin a fledgling black politician who preaches a policy 
of passivity and his wife sally 
you dont need to have seen the first two plays in the series 
sally and prince to fully appreciate jonquil but it 
helps this third play is riddled with references to people in the 
earlier works 
the direction by douglas turner ward is equally sketchy the 
actors try to fill in the blanks but have little material to work 
with only iris little as sally manages to create a flesh and blood 
character during this bare bones evening

the defense ministry called up reserve troops 
thursday to help 29000 soldiers quell ethnic violence in the 
caucasus that has killed at least 66 people and wounded more than 
220 
defense minister dmitri t yazov said the additional troops were 
necessary to maintain order and possibly enforce a curfew a 
measure authorities in the republic of azerbaijan have refused to 
impose despite reports of vicious attacks by azerbaijani extremists 
on armenian residents 
at least 10500 armenians reportedly have been evacuated from 
the azerbaijani capital of baku where rampaging azerbaijani mobs 
began the violence saturday 
extremists have obtained heavy weaponry including helicopters 
tanks and groundtoground missiles in what interior minster vadim 
bakatin on thursday called a civil war 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov told abctvs prime time live 
early friday that the number of people killed as compared to 
saturday and sunday is now decreasing in fact almost none 
however the mood among a certain part of the population is still 
very tense 
in his first public comments since the baku riots president 
mikhail s gorbachev defended the kremlins decision monday to 
declare a state of emergency but said the ethnic problems date back 
centuries 
the problems which have been accumulating for tens no for 
hundreds of years have erupted and acquired the character we are 
now confronted with in the baltics moldavia and now in such forms 
this interethnic strife are going on in transcaucasia in 
azerbaijan and armenia he told a meeting in moscow 
we are now busy trying to halt this process to prevent it 
from going deeper and getting more acute gorbachev said in 
comments broadcast on state radio we have resorted to the use of 
force against criminals against this vandalism 
it was not clear whether the kremlin intended to impose the 
curfew in baku and other parts of azerbaijan or if yazov expected 
the azerbaijani authorities to do it 
members of the azerbaijani peoples front said thursday they had 
warned moscow that if a curfew or martial law were imposed on baku 
they would launch a general strike in the strategic oil center 
on wednesday the 29000 troops already in azerbaijan and the 
republic of armenia were authorized to shoot if necessary to stop 
the bitter fighting in the hills around the disputed territory of 
nagornokarabakh according to soviet media 
foreign reporters were barred from travel to the republics 
in nagornokarabakh a largely armenian enclave inside 
azerbaijan officials expanded an existing curfew by two hours 
thursday said tass the official soviet news agency 
the military commandant in nagornokarabakh also ordered 
unregistered organizations dissolved tass said 
yevgeny primakov a topranking soviet legislator confronted a 
mass antigovernment demonstration outside the azerbaijani 
communist party headquarters in baku and said the riots had to 
stop the demonstrators called for the liquidation of soviet power 
in azerbaijan and the resignation of the azerbaijani leadership 
reported interfax a news service of radio moscow 
soviet authorities sent 5000 army troops into azerbaijan 
tuesday interfax said thursday there are also 24000 interior 
ministry troops in the two southern republics 1250 miles southeast 
of moscow 
extremists in azerbaijan have blockaded highways interrupting 
the movement of troops and halted 136 freight trains including 
three carrying military equipment interfax said 
yerevan the armenian capital was reported to be running out of 
fuel because of the azerbaijani blockade armenians countered with 
a blockade of nakhichevan an azerbaijani enclave inside armenia 
interfax said 
yazov said more troops were needed because the area was so large 
and the people in literally all towns and all populated areas 
have been roused by these events according to radio moscow 
yazov did not specify how many reserve soldiers had been called 
up he said men were being called up from neighboring regions 
but did not specify tass said the men had recently completed their 
compulsory military service 
yazov said he understood reservists would be unhappy about his 
move but emphasized that they are not going with the task of 
killing shooting going onto some offensive it is principally to 
protect public order 
he said the reservist callup was needed in part because recent 
cuts under gorbachevs plan to slash the nations armed forces by 
500000 men have depleted the forces that can be moved to the 
caucasus 
extremists besieged the interior ministry department in the town 
of masali for two hours interfax reported 
hundreds of trucks with armenian militants patrol the border 
with the lachin and kubaltin regions of azerbaijan interfax said 
and troops have been reinforced 
interfax also said thousands also rallied in nakhichevan on 
wednesday to protest plans to rebuild border defenses and string 
barbed wire along the middle of the araks river the border with 
iran 
hundreds of azerbaijanis have crossed the river illegally in 
recent weeks to visit relatives and demand removal of the border 
barriers 
detailing the difficulties facing units sent to the caucasus 
radio moscow said one transport plane arriving with troops had been 
immediately seized by armenians fleeing the fighting who demanded 
to be flown to safety 
pickets continued at two military airfields in azerbaijan and 
attempts were made in baku to block streets interior ministry 
spokesman dmitri seleznev said 
he said the death toll in the ethnic bloodshed was up to 66 from 
the 58 reported wednesday and that 220 people had been wounded 
in the past 24 hours he said 4658 more armenians had been 
evacuated from baku and 45 ethnically motivated attacks were 
reported there 
in the azerbaijani enclave of nakhichevan 3000 armenians 
blockaded the village of kerki defended by 30 residents who were 
aided by 50 soldiers seleznev said he said there had been 
shooting but no deaths 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev dispelled rumors the 
soviet borders with iran and turkey had been sealed saying that as 
far as he knew the border zone but had not been totally shut 
tehran media reported that hundreds of people were crossing into 
soviet territory from iran 
in armenia the interior ministry official said people 
continued attacks on armories to steal weapons during the 24hour 
period 198 more weapons were seized including four armored cars 
and a t34 tank

the ballyhooed powers of oat bran are challenged 
by a study today concluding this faddish food fails to lower 
cholesterol after all 
the idea that oat bran lowers the level of dangerous cholesterol 
in the blood has been widely accepted in recent years some health 
experts have recommended starting the day with a bowl of oatmeal 
and oat bran has become a common ingredient in muffins cookies 
bagels even doughnuts and potato chips 
the new study found that peoples cholesterol levels indeed go 
down when they eat lots of oat bran but its only because they 
also eat less saturated fat and cholesterol than usual 
there really isnt any cholesterollowering property in oat 
bran said dr frank m sacks a coauthor of the study

if you like a good horror story lavish 
victorian costumes misty london streets with dark wet 
cobblestones and fine british acting proceed sunday to abcs 
jekyll amp hyde starring michael caine as both 
a tv version of the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde 
robert louis stevensons novella about good and chemically induced 
evil its a crisp enjoyable bundle from britain it has but one 
yank in it cheryl ladd 
she essays sara the lovely sisterinlaw who becomes the object 
of the widowed dr jekylls affections and mr hydes horrible 
attentions the former charlies angels member speaks in a 
passable british accent but seems a tad old for the part no harm 
though she manages to fit in 
while abcs movie retells a familiar tale it tells it well 
with writer david wickes burnished antique dialogue a joy to the 
ears in this age of filmschool graduate scripts that mainly 
consist of burps obscenities and scenes stolen from 
casablanca 
its hard not to like a show where 
a powerful old doctor joss ackland hates jekyll suspects his 
married daughter ladd has taken him as a lover and sternly asks 
her has he seduced you is that it he later bellows 
adulteress and orders her from his house out out out into 
the rain 
the crusty editor of the london record who tells sleazy ace 
reporter ted snape david schofield stay with it i smell a 
scandal brewing 
caine as jekyll teaching a class of medical students calmly 
tells them evil a short pause for effect is not a 
scientific word 
none of this is camped up by the way while such dialogue could 
collapse the show if done by actors of lesser skill this cast 
plays things straightforwardly and with care 
its sheer pleasure to watch them work even those in the 
smaller roles such as joan heal as jekylls disapproving 
housekeeper and lionel jeffries as the doctors irreverent father 
tautly directed by wickes who earlier teamed with caine on a 
notsogood tv version of jack the ripper sundays exercise 
starts with an auction suddenly halted of the late dr jekylls 
goods 
we then learn of the plight of poor sara who has borne a son of 
her jekyllhyde days she works as a stablehand and just wants to 
be left alone of course there ensues a flashback to the whole 
story 
the tale is of the benevolent jekylls relentless 
experimentation in drugs which although he hopes it will prove for 
the betterment of mankind keeps turning him into hyde his 
loathsome grotesque violent murderous alter ego 
not only is hyde jekyll rents a room for him in a seedy 
brothel the dark side of humanity he also is in his screaming 
moments of transformation a fine example of why we all should 
just say no to drugs 
the doctor mixes and downs his terrible potion in moments his 
hands thicken his body contorts his face swells and pulsates and 
his features well neighbors this is mr hyde and he is plumb 
gnarly 
back and forth from jekyll to hyde he goes with hyde nearly 
killing a child here savagely beating a prostitute there setting 
fire to a pub and finally killing a scotland yard detective who 
with a colleague had joined th police search for him 
the ring starts closing after mr hyde assails the lovely sara 
temporarily then permanently ensconsed in dr jekylls townhouse 
the good doctor tells her his bad secret and they fall in love 
worse she remains mum when the constables come to investigate 
her attack the work of reporter snape proves a catalyst in all 
this as does jekylls tormented bid to rid himself of hyde 
caine may seem to appear in movies and tv shows at the rate of 
one a day but he rarely turns in a dull performance hes in top 
form throughout here highly believable and showing no waste motion 
his screaming facebubbling hyde transformations may strike 
some as old hat but dont blame caine blame foxs old 
werewolf series its weekly mantobeast changes took the edge 
off the normaltogrotesque racket 
be that as it may be sure to inspect abcs twohour jekyll amp 
hyde on sunday it is horror the good oldfashioned english 
way

you spell it easy he spells it eezi you want 
quick results he wants kwik rezults 
if you want to call the whole thing off language buff and 
activist ted w culp probably would tell you to wait becuz victori 
is inevitabel in this linggwistic endevor 
culp is the president and founder of the internasional union for 
the canadian langwaje which campaigns for reforming english into 
canadian he says canadean as an international language 
half the battle is already won because people know that 
reformation needs to be done he said theres a universal 
recognition that theres a problem with the english language 
culp declined to say exactly how many people belong to his 
admittedly small organization but he insisted that he has members 
and contacts scattered around the world 
and if youre wondering why a reformed english should be called 
canadean well why not 
all the other languages of the world are linked to a nation 
culp said when theyre linked to a nation it removes any sense 
of fear the world needs an international language but it needs 
one thats rational 
talking over coffee at a neighborhood fastfood restaurant culp 
detailed why he thinks the soft c in english should be changed 
to s as in sentense why czechoslovakia should have been 
changed long ago to checkoslovakia why fast as flite on 
trucking slogans reads just fine to him and why the large american 
toystore chain should change its name to tois ar we 
he puts out regular nuzeletters and has started a small 
nuzepaper the times ov toronto that has made it through three 
fourpage issues 
we urj all owr reeders tu abandon the obsolete anoying 
english langwaje and tu adopt the emerjing rasional canadean 
langwaje an editorial calling for linggwistic chanj said it 
iz so eezi 
culp a grayhaired secondary schoolteacher said he always was 
interested in language and created his canadian in 1987 the 
centenary of the artifical language esperanto that had been touted 
as the way to an international communication 
theres no sense creating a language that no one speaks he 
said of esperanto and its late founder the polish philologist 
ludwig zamenhof thats the fatal weakness from which it will 
never recover it was just the wrong strategy 
canadean on the other hand would take advantage of the 
prominence of english as an international language but make it 
easier for foreigners learning english who often are confused by 
its spelling and grammar 
using the worlds no 1 language you can read and understand 
this he said in canadean you must say whats there 
culp said the rules for canadian appeal to those who have 
problems spelling as well as those with scientifically educated 
minds who prefer their systems to be rational the increasing use 
of computers and computer languages can only help the move to 
develop a more rational language he said 
among the rules for canadean are an alphabet with 25 
letters eliminating q from the current latinenglish alphabet 
the addition of a verb tu must as in yu must tu work and 
the elimination of all silent and extra letters 
culp conceded that his language work would have to be developed 
over the long term 
theres a tendency to linguistic conservatism he said of 
those reluctant to change people say its the richness of the 
language but its very rich nonsense

when martin galvin walked into the irish 
northern aid office one saturday morning six months ago it 
basically was gone the files the telephones the checkbooks the 
fax machine 
all that was left were some rusty old desks on his own desk 
galvin found a message free state traitor 
the office he realized had not been hijacked by british agents 
or protestant terrorists it had been taken by other members of 
irish northern aid or noraid an american group which supports the 
irish republican armys guerrilla war against british rule in 
northern ireland 
for two decades noraid has been the heart of the insular world 
of american irish nationalism where free state traitor a 
phrase meaningless to most irish americans since the irish free 
state hasnt existed for more than 40 years is a choice insult 
the noraid offices disappearance in july was the beginning of a 
rift that has divided the iras american supporters into at least 
three groups cut its flow of dollars to ireland and raised doubts 
that irish nationalism can ever win much support in the united 
states 
how can unity be brought about if the major victims continue 
to snipe at each other asked former new york city council 
president paul odwyer who has long defended the ira 
noraid was formed in 1970 by michael flannery an old ira 
soldier who moved to new york in the 1920s the ira had been 
dormant for years but in the late 60s protestant mobs attacked 
catholic civil rights demonstrators in northern ireland when 
britain sent troops to keep order they quickly came to blows with a 
revived ira which didnt want britain in ulster under any 
circumstances 
noraid contributed millions to the effort although the money 
ostensibly went to ira soldiers families noraid was widely 
suspected of diverting funds for weapons british politicians and 
tabloids made noraid a whipping boy 
but noraid never transcended its narrow base of irishborn 
americans living in big northeastern cities and sinn fein the 
iras political party and the conduit for noraid funds began to 
want more than money 
the united states was a critical diplomatic and propaganda 
battlefield where the nationalist message had to reach a broader 
audience it had to focus on the present rather than the past 
instead of lamenting the formation of the irish free state in 1921 
a first step in irish independence that nevertheless preserved 
british rule in the north noraid needed to emphasize british 
human rights abuses and the material misery of the provinces 
catholic minority 
noraid however remained little more than a loose federation of 
groups with no regular meetings dues or membership roll it 
centered on fundraising events rallies dances testimonials 
pub socials and sales of tshirts and raffle tickets at the end 
of 1988 noraid agreed to try to broaden its appeal its executive 
committee was expanded sinn fein sent an organizer to the united 
states and more time and money was devoted to lobbying and 
propaganda 
the new emphasis suited galvin an articulate young lawyer far 
more than it did pat oconnell its president oconnell who 
emigrated in 1961 is as uncomfortable with politics as he is 
dedicated to fund raising 
americans he says are fed up with their own nations 
politics they sure as hell dont want to get involved in irish 
politics they only want to give money for the prisoners and their 
families not for political lobbying 
oconnell and the sinn fein organizer clashed repeatedly but 
oconnell no longer had the support of a newly expanded noraid 
board so one night in july he and several supporters cleaned out 
noraids manhattan office they opened a new one in the bronx 
disconnected the noraid telephone and replaced its listing with the 
number at the new bronx location 
for a while there were two noraids galvin and noraids 
executive committee took out a newspaper ad that denied a split yet 
reaffirmed that noraids address and phone number were the same 
as ever 
finally after prodding from sinn fein oconnell returned the 
files and agreed to stop using the noraid name 
but the split widened in october when a letter in new yorks 
two irish weeklies charged that under galvin and company noraid 
is being steered in a direction toward politics and away from its 
original humanitarian objectives 
the 41 signers included leading dissidents but the big surprise 
was the first one michael flannery at 88 still the most respected 
irish nationalist in america flannery it turned out had quietly 
resigned from noraid in 1986 after sinn fein declared itself 
willing to take seats in the irish parliament which he regards as 
the equivalent of the illegitimate free state parliament 
a few days after the letter appeared a meeting was called but 
flannery angered some young irishborn participants by calling 
sinn fein leaders free staters they in turn yelled up the 
ira at flannery who had served in the ira before his hecklers 
parents were born nothing was settled 
then ira soldier joe doherty who has become a hero to many 
irish americans during five years in a federal jail in manhattan 
in a statement denounced flannerys misleading and reactionary 
attack on sinn fein 
since then the combatants have gone their own ways galvin and 
noraid have tried to regroup oconnell formed the friends of irish 
freedom and flannery formed the irish freedom committee he and 
oconnell are raising money but it is unclear who in ireland will 
accept it since the ira is aligned with noraid 
everyone claims publicly to harbor no animosity a facade that 
cracks easily 
oconnell says noraid is crippled by the defection of most of 
its most zealous workers the people who will stand at a table 
each sunday selling tshirts galvin loves publicity says 
oconnell he doesnt care if its good or bad he just loves to 
be on tv but he cant raise money 
paul murray an albany businessman who is noraids new chairman 
calls oconnell a pathological liar 
the squabble over who really leads the movement get a little 
silly for instance oconnell claims a noraid fundraiser in lynn 
mass attracted only 92 people while a friends of irish freedom 
function in nearby malden attracted 400 noraid says it was the the 
other way around 
the ira meanwhile apparently got lost in the shuffle because 
of the interruption in fund raising murray says less money and 
food was sent to ireland last christmas than at any time since 
noraid was founded 
to flannery it all seems familiar weve had so many breaks 
and splits and every time its harmful thats the tragedy of 
irish history

the anticommunist revolutions in eastern 
europe have yielded a bonanza for israel in renewed diplomatic ties 
and the israelis hope it also means the end of training and weapons 
support for arab radicals 
new openings toward israel by countries that once firmly backed 
the arab cause ends a twodecade sovietbloc boycott of the jewish 
state imposed by moscow after the 1967 middle east war 
we are now opening a new page in our relations with eastern 
europe said yossi benaharon a top aide to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir 
foreign minister gyula horn of hungary who recently visited 
jerusalem described the changes as irreversible 
the old order cannot be restored the jerusalem post quoted 
him as saying in an interview 
but it remains unclear whether the renewal of ties will 
translate into longterm diplomatic support for israel in the 
middle east conflict 
horn indicated hungary was more interested in flourishing 
economic ties than the middle east conflict however he said he 
supported an international middle east peace conference a proposal 
accepted by the arabs but staunchly rejected by shamir 
the eastern europe of today is not as propalestinian as 
before but if israel continues its hard line toward the 
palestinians we cannot expect to win the support of these 
countries said moshe zimmermann a historian at the hebrew 
university of jerusalem 
palestinian analysts meanwhile acknowledged the palestine 
liberation organization suffered a diplomatic setback in eastern 
europe because of its association with the overthrown communist 
dictators they said the plo faced an uphill struggle to win the 
support of the new leadership 
the atmosphere is to a certain extent hostile to the 
palestinians said ghassan katib a prominent palestinian 
communist and west bank university lecturer we must establish a 
dialogue with the these new forces 
antiarab sentiment is especially strong in romania where arabs 
were identified in revolutionary quarters as fighting in the ranks 
of the hated securitate secret police who sought to crush the 
popular uprising against dictator nicolae ceausescu 
in the meantime the new eastern european leaders are knocking 
on israels door to renew ties cut in 1967 hungary was first in 
september while poland and czechoslovakia are expected to follow 
this spring romania never severed ties although it supported and 
trained arab guerrillas 
israel never had relations with east germany but a senior 
israeli official said such ties were expected if as seems likely 
the east germans drop their refusal to accept moral responsibility 
for the holocaust 
in light of east germanys economic problems israel would be 
satisfied with a token payment of reparations the official said 
eastern european leaders are mainly driven by the need to rescue 
their crippled economies and israel a close ally of the united 
states is seen as an important mediator 
they believe israel can pave the way for improved economic 
relations with the western world said mark heller an analyst at 
tel aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic studies 
but israel is also seen as an economic partner in its own right 
israeli exports to eastern europe and the soviet union jumped to 
100 million last year up 70 percent from 1988 
the new eastern european leaders whose political survival 
depends in part on their ability to end food shortages at home are 
especially interested in israels agricultural knowhow 
in december the governmentowned israeli company agridev signed 
a cooperation agreement with bulgaria under which israel will 
provide experts and equipment to run bulgarian farms a similar 
agreement is expected to be signed with poland 
in the past year many doors have been opened due to the 
changes in the political situation and the desire to supply enough 
food said amram olmert managing director of agridev 
in addition to the diplomatic and economic windfalls israeli 
officials cite a third beneficial development an end to state 
sponsorship of palestinian terror squads 
in the past the plo and other palestinian groups maintained 
close ties with eastern europe especially romania czechoslovakia 
and east germany which trained and armed hundreds of palestinian 
guerrillas according to israeli intelligence sources 
these countries provided training weapons served as host 
facilities for terrorist organizations and sometimes provided 
sabotage materials said heller 
israeli intelligence officials noted that eastern european 
support for palestinian guerrilla groups has considerably dropped 
in the past year a trend they expected to continue 
i wouldnt be surprised if that activity stopped completely 
heller said

james crotty and michael lane dont wait to 
return home to spin tales of their latest travels in fact they 
dont return home at all 
crotty lane and their two cats have been on the road for four 
years and 85000 miles publishing a totally mobile magazine monk 
they eat sleep travel and work in a 26foot 1986 fleetwood 
motorhome a solarpowered macintosh computer is mounted on the 
dashboard ads are sold by lane 39 and crotty 30 from phone 
booths a mailing address described as a suite is actually a 
5inch by 10inch postage box in santa fe nm 
what started as a newsletter has turned into a magazine with a 
circulation of about 30000 and a cover price of 295 375 
abroad 
monk is about life on the road in each issue we describe the 
latest segment of our travels and encounters with the lucky victims 
of our latest pit stop everyone from dogs to dancers vision 
queens to country singers and occasionally even real live monks 
the two monks wrote in their seventh issue july 28 we are a 
gentle tickle in the side of the earnest seeker the frazzled 
housewife and the corporate climber though we can also be quite 
useful in fact thousands of readers use our quarterly rag to 
teach dogs how to fetch 
lyrical philosophical kind of zany thats the kind of thing 
readers expect from monk and its foundereditors new age hippies 
who held down a series of jobs in san francisco before they 
answered the call of the open road 
we represent a new style of spiritual nomad who is not bound 
by religious norms they say a kind of traveling soap opera 
flop house and nunnery all rolled into one 
originally they were fed up with rising rents but crotty said 
the monks odyssey was also a quest for simplicity in their lives 
and resulted from a burning desire to create a lifestyle that was 
completely mobile 
thats obviously a dream of a lot of people or mobile homes 
wouldnt be so popular we were just a little more passionate about 
that than most 
the magazine describes their adventures in a 
streamofconsciousness chatty gonzo style occasionally people 
they encounter contribute articles 
its like charles kuralt with jack kerouac and they pick up 
laurel and hardy hitchhiking and then go on an adventure crotty 
said 
follow the monks to new mexico where its high its clear 
its desert and its peyote land follow them to the scene of 
the crime white sands missile range where one of the first 
nuclear test blasts occurred on july 6 1945 
listen as the monks expound on turbans china cola the benefits 
of geese in weeding farms how arkansas got its name and what you 
wont learn through the arkansas department of tourism 
the magazines advertisements offer allnatural sunscreens 
herbal toothpaste the secret to instant memory massage tables 
indianstyle ceremonial drums and the xrated bible 
with advertiser and reader support the monks break even 
eventually lane hopes to distribute monk in europe and to travel 
overseas for now they explore the united states changing 
directions on a whim 
last winter they were in minnesota and chose to go to mardi 
gras in new orleans but the van slid off an icy road and about 30 
residents of the tiny village of calico rock ark to emerge with 
shovels we almost lost the van and ourselves lane said 
these people all came out and rescued us and helped us get 
started it was touching 
being on the road you have to open up to all people therere 
a lot of people traveling like us in vans but they would never have 
these chance encounters because they will just stick to certain 
tourist centers or whats expected 
as a result stereotypes crumble along the way 
in the south we thought they were going to be a bunch of 
bigoted racist rednecks and though that exists everyone you run 
into is really openminded most people everywhere are incredibly 
friendly lane said 
this is a simple journey that many people have carried out we 
just got very complex about it crotty said we go to places 
that are unheralded or to places that you dare not go with a motor 
home and manhattan fits into the latter category absolutely no 
motor home magazine will recommend that you go to manhattan 
there is a reason of course while in manhattan the van was 
parked in a garage but that didnt prevent thieves from stealing a 
bicycle from the monks who were last reported more safely 
ensconced in north bergen nj

fewer siberian cranes are migrating to 
their favorite wintering ground in the marshes of western india 
and some bird watchers fear they are being shot down over 
afghanistan 
only 17 cranes arrived this winter in the keoladeo national park 
at bharatpur once a duckshooting preserve of maharajahs and now a 
sanctuary for more than 400 bird species 
the small number cannot be taken lightly since 24 cranes 
came in the winter of 198889 and 31 the winter before that said 
vs vijayan a scientist with the bombay natural history society 
who has been working at bharatpur 
indian wildlife officials and environmentalists agree with jim 
harris an orthnologist with the international crane foundation 
based i baraboo wis that the birds may be falling victim to 
gunners in afghanistans war 
a soviet scientist rejected the theory and other indian 
officials said recurring drought in bharatpur may be contributing 
to the declining number of arrivals at the sanctuary 
the group gathered recently to discuss the cranes at the bombay 
natural history society office in bharatpur 
ornitholgists know little about the redbeaked white birds that 
fly more than 3100 miles in about one month from their breeding 
ground in the tundras of western siberia to bharatpur in rajasthan 
state in western india 
a smaller flock migrates to iran the two flocks perhaps 
totaling fewer than 50 birds leave the ob river valley in soviet 
siberia in september or october just as it is starts snowing they 
return in late february or early march 
the indiabound flock probably makes only two stopovers in 
soviet kazhakistan and in afghanistan according to vladimir flint 
head of the soviet unions animal protection department at the 
allunion research institute of nature conservation and reserves in 
moscow 
no precise estimates are available of the number of western 
siberian cranes harris put the figure at fewer than 50 but other 
estimates place it as high as 200 
there is very little data about the birds flint said during 
the session we hardly know anything about them except that they 
fly over iran and afghanistan to the marshes here 
said harris and there are a lot of people with guns in 
afghanistan who are waiting to pull the trigger 
since the birds are safe from humans in the inaccessible 
siberian tundras and in the sanctuary at bharatpur harris added 
it is likely they are being killed during migration 
i do not agree that the birds are being killed over 
afghanistan said flint our next goal is to know the whole 
migration route and the dangers they face 
prakash gole head of the ecological society based in poona 
india agreed with harris that siberian cranes may have been killed 
in afghanistan he said other kinds of cranes were shot and sold 
for meat in afghanistan even before the war between the 
sovietbacked government and ussupported moslem guerrillas 
started in 1978 
harris also said a dead siberian crane turned up last year at a 
local meat market in pakistan 
the freshwater wasteland at bharatpur about 30 miles west of 
the taj mahal in agra was declared a shooting preserve for local 
maharajas and british colonial rulers in 1902 
bird shooting was outlawed here in 1972 and the marsh was 
declared a national park in 1981 
the parks director kl saini said in an interview later that 
the afghanistan theory is an interesting one 
but it is highly likely that the frequent droughts in the area 
may be the main reason for their decreasing number he added 
until about eight years ago we used to have regular floods which 
kept the marsh alive and produced enough food for the birds 
another set of cranes apparently no different from the western 
siberian crane breeds in eastern siberia and migrates to china in 
winter the eastern siberian cranes are believed to number at least 
1400 like the western cranes they are considered endangered 
species 
flint said the soviets have initiated studies to genetically 
compare the two species 
but my guess is there will be no difference 
the declining crane migration is also worrying naturalists who 
earn their living by conducting tours of the sanctuary 
everyone comes to bharatpur to see the siberian cranes said 
udai singh who conducts tours and when they stop coming here 
even the tourists will stop and i guess we will have to close 
shop 
singhs oneday tours cost 100 for a western tour group and 
735 each for indian groups

a series of associated press stories that has prompted federal 
reassessment of the 39 billion drought relief program of 1988 
involved analysis of thousands of drought aid reports over the 
course of seven months 
using a computer database three ap reporters matched rainfall 
data and drought payments in every county in 14 states selected 
because of their 1988 weather conditions or the amount of aid 
received after picking 120 counties to study further the ap then 
used the freedom of information act to request those counties farm 
entitlement reports summaries of all farms participation in the 
program 
these reports from the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service more than 12000 in all showed what crops 
were involved how large the losses were which farmers or 
corporations were paid and how much relief aid was paid 
ascs records are not centralized so reporters traveled to 22 
county offices in eight states to examine the more detailed drought 
program files of 346 farmers also available under the freedom of 
information act most of the data never leaves the county office 
where payment checks are written 
in addition the ap interviewed 93 farmers who participated in 
the program and agriculture experts from 21 states

the moderate pragmatic cabinet members 
brought into office by president bush are still at their desks as 
the administration begins its second year but if history is any 
guide one or more of them will be leaving soon 
critics have targeted education secretary lauro cavazos as the 
weakest link in the bush cabinet and attorney general dick 
thornburgh as probably its biggest disappointment 
yet such criticism is no barometer of staying power 
the surest bet at the start of bushs second year is that his 
administration will not follow the pattern of the reagan presidency 
when the first cabinet official to depart was the secretary of 
state alexander m haig jr 
bushs secretary of state james a baker iii is a longtime 
ally 
there is no doubt that james baker is the strong man of the 
cabinet said presidential scholar stephen hess of the brookings 
institution 
year two of an administration generally sees the first 
departures from the cabinet 
martin durkin resigned as secretary of labor during president 
eisenhowers second year both john kennedy and richard nixon lost 
their secretaries of health education and welfare in the second 
year abraham ribicoff for kennedy and robert h finch for nixon 
jimmy carters original appointees on the other hand lasted 
from his inauguration in january 1977 to july 1979 when he shook 
up his cabinet in a whirlwind game of musical chairs 
thornburgh has been in his position longer than any of the 
others he was named attorney general by reagan in august 1988 and 
was kept on by bush he had been governor of pennsylvania and 
before that an assistant attorney general 
when he was appointed i rejoiced said norman ornstein a 
scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute i 
thought at that time that he had the potential to be a great 
attorney general he still has that potential 
but ornstein and others said thornburgh has not lived up to 
expectations 
he had a good reputation as a really broadminded person but 
he has taken the narrowest perspective on national security said 
landis jones a professor of political science at the university of 
louisville and former director of the white house fellows program 
i am a former pennsylvanian and i would have thought he might 
have been much better 
the attorney general has drawn criticism particularly from 
liberals for steps to tighten control on public information from 
his department and for legal moves he says are needed to protect 
state secrets in irancontra cases he also was accused of 
heavyhanded dealings with congress in the unsuccessful fight to 
have william lucas confirmed as his civil rights chief 
on the other hand gary bauer white house domestic policy 
adviser under reagan and now head of the family research council 
said that basically conservatives and certainly our group feel 
very good about him and amy moritz executive director of the 
national center for public policy research told the heritage 
foundation in a recent survey its good to have an attorney 
general with guts 
justice department spokesman david runkel dismissed criticism of 
his boss as a lot of inside the beltway chatter by people who 
havent taken the time to find out whats going on in the 
department of justice 
runkel called assertions that thornburgh has difficult relations 
with congress absolute nonsense 
we got the biggest budget increase in the history of the 
department out of congress he said congress doesnt give that 
kind of money to people they dont have respect for 
however the budget increase for the justice department could be 
attributed to the congressional rush to support efforts to combat 
drugs rather than a particular endorsement of the attorney general 
hess a white house aide in the eisenhower administration said 
one would have thought that thornburgh not only as a person who 
has been an assistant attorney general in a previous administration 
but been a very successful governor who had the usual fine antenna 
of the politician would have had a far less rocky first year than 
he has had 
while thornburgh is one of the most politically experienced of 
the cabinet cavazos a former university president and medical 
school dean is one of the least 
the washington post recently carried a frontpage article headed 
cavazos gets low marks that quoted critical remarks by 
educators about the education secretarys effectiveness 
cavazos responded by saying he remained committed to helping 
george bush be the education president and white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater told reporters he has the job as long as he 
wants it 
still there have been suggestions that he could be the first to 
go 
it is quite clear that cavazos is the weakest in terms of 
political support said ornstein 
the lowkey cavazos suffers in some eyes by comparison with his 
flamboyant predecessor william j bennett now director of the 
federal drug control program 
hess described the education department as in many ways a very 
modest agency but said you can as bill bennett proved turn 
it into a bully pulpit it just strikes me that this fellow 
doesnt have those sort of skills 
bauer said the jury is still out on whether you are going to 
get the kind of attention that i think you need to get if you are 
going to put education on the front burner 
bushs cabinet consists of the heads of the 14 departments plus 
richard darman director of the office of management and budget 
and carla hills us trade representative 
bauer said conservatives many of them skeptical of darman 
because of his long association with baker have been pleasantly 
surprised that he has held the line on things like taxes 
as for baker many conservatives have never liked him and they 
still dont in the heritage foundation survey which asked five 
conservative leaders to give report card grades to the cabinet 
members bakers marks ranged from c to dminus 
but then conservative political consultant craig shirley said 
in an interview it may be one of those situations where whoever 
is secretary of state conservatives arent particularly satisfied 
because they dont like the state department anyway 
most observers interviewed expressed no strong views one way or 
another on the remaining cabinet members 
most of the cabinet members have been out of sight most of the 
time said robert roberts an associate professor of political 
science at james madison university in harrisonburg va 
david caputo professor of political science and dean of 
humanities at purdue university said jack kemp secretary of 
housing and urban development has been fairly visible but i think 
some of the cabinet members have taken a low profile 
hess a longtime student of presidential performance said bush 
differs from reagan and some of his other predecessors in how he 
handles his cabinet 
he gives the cabinet officer his head a proper authority to 
come up with the right solutions and the right management if he or 
she is capable of it he said very often the weight of the 
white house staff under reagan was the heavier one

in the cold light of statistics a farm that 
sells less than 40000 worth of products a year is pretty small 
potatoes the big outfits are the ones that really count 
it depends whose statistics are being looked at and by whom 
millions of city families depend on nearby small farmers for 
much of their food says bud kerr director of the agriculture 
departments office for smallscale agriculture 
but despite his missionary zeal to convert mindlocked 
bureaucrats and others about the growing worth of small farmers 
kerr admits he is fighting some mighty impressive statistics 
for example in the 1988 calendar year farmers sold more than 
1514 billion worth of crops and livestock a record level of cash 
receipts from farming operations in the united states livestock 
accounted for nearly 788 billion crops for 726 billion 
cash receipts are one of the most useful indicators of farm 
production in an overall sense big farms produce more and have 
big receipts small farms produce less and have small receipts 
the latest analysis by the departments economic research 
service says that the largest farms those with annual sales of 
500000 or more accounted for 366 percent of the 1988 cash 
sales 
a middle group of farms in the sales class of 100000 to 
499999 collectively accounted for 40 percent of the sales those 
in the 40000 to 99999 category sold 136 percent 
thus the larger farms those with sales of at least 40000 a 
year produced 902 percent of the crops and livestock that 
americans consume plus huge quantities that are sold abroad 
that leaves the smallest category the ones with sales of less 
than 40000 a year producing only 98 percent of the nations 
food and fiber 
but kerr and other usda experts note that the smallest sales 
category accounted for 1554000 or 707 percent of the nations 
22 million farms in 1988 
the commercial farms of more than 40000 annual sales 
represented only 643000 farms or 293 percent the very largest 
category those with 500000 or more each year included only 
about 30000 farms or 14 percent of the total 
the largest farms produced 366 percent of the total farm 
products sold in 1988 according to the figures 
kerr said it is sometimes easy to overlook the real structure 
and impact of small farms when such statistics are recited so he 
recites some of his own 
small farms control onethird of all agricultural resources 
such as land buildings machinery and equipment he said 
smallfarm families are major buyers of agricultural inputs 
such as fertilizer and other supplies consumer goods and services 
they contribute to the wellbeing of their rural communities 
and are likely to be an integral part of the community where they 
farm supporting community schools churches and other social and 
civic activities he said 
one of kerrs recent publications smallscale agriculture 
today said that even in areas designated as metropolitan by the 
census bureau 90 percent of the land is actually rural and 40 
percent of it is in farms 
while farmers in the citys shadow face their share of 
problems they also can exploit opportunities that their country 
counterparts might relish the report said 
by being close to city consumers these metro farmers have 
direct access to readymade markets for highvalue produce 
overall they account for 76 percent of the nursery and 
horticultural crops sold 67 percent of the vegetables sweet corn 
and melons and 65 percent of the fruit nut and berries 
ten percent of metro farmers sell directly to the consumer 
accounting for 60 percent of us directmarketing sales and that 
doesnt include direct sales of nursery and horticultural 
products the report said 
the average metro farm at 247 acres is half the size of the 
518 acres of nonmetro farms and about 60 percent are less than 
100 acres the number of metro farms increased 4 percent between 
1974 and 1982 while nonmetro farms declined 6 percent 
kerr said in his report it is important to remember that as 
urbanization encroaches on rural areas the appropriate response is 
to adapt not surrender 
one way to cope with city sprawl and development is to sell off 
unproductive land and abandon landextensive enterprises such 
as grass pastures for livestock and then focus on highvalue 
intensive production 
it is better to make money on a small farm meeting consumers 
demands than to lose money on a big one growing conventional 
crops he said

sen daniel patrick moynihan shouted tax cut 
in an empty theater and then left town nobody noticed at first 
but now his proposal to scale back social security taxes has become 
the issue of the hour 
it has the administration nervous and it could give the 
democrats a tax cut to boast about even if they dont pass it 
as congress reconvenes for its electionyear session 
and it isnt even new business 
indeed when moynihan a new york democrat addressed the matter 
months ago it was in partnership with a republican senator even 
then he was repeating an old refrain of his 
that went largely unnoticed too 
the revival and the punch the issue carries these days is a 
lesson in the way the washington echo chamber works especially 
during a holiday recess moynihan proposed the social security tax 
cut at a news conference on dec 29 as the new years weekend 
began his was about the only show in town that day he went abroad 
soon afterward and was traveling in africa and the middle east 
while the proposal took hold as an issue 
that happened during the quiet days of early january with 
congress in the recess that ends tuesday the administration was at 
work on the budget president bush will present at the end of the 
month and the tax cut moynihan proposed would have a major impact 
on the deficit projected in that spending plan 
the conservative heritage foundation issued a paper praising the 
moynihan tax cut the liberal institute of policy studies praised 
it too as a boon to middle and lower income working people so 
did the us chamber of commerce it played well with business 
interests because employers match the social security taxes paid by 
their workers 
the white house rejected the idea democrats seem to want to 
fiddle around with the social security system said marlin 
fitzwater bushs press secretary we do not 
nice try but it didnt settle the matter democrats started 
talking about the moynihan measure as a counterattack on bushs 
renewed bid for a cut in the capital gains tax an alternative they 
could press as a tax cut for the average american 
there were signs of some republican support for the tax cut too 
offbalance the administration finally figured out its own 
counteroffensive thursday arguing that the moynihan measure would 
force an increase in other taxes and would lead inevitably to 
future cuts in benefits 
its an effort to get me to raise taxes on the american people 
by the charade of cutting them or cut benefits and i am not going 
to do it to the older people of this country bush said 
let me tell you something vice president dan quayle said in 
an interview cut these taxes the way that moynihan is talking 
about you have got to cut benefits at some time 
the new bush budget is to include plans to prevent the use of 
social security reserve funds to offset other spending and thus 
mask deficits the practice that got moynihan started on the 
subject that would be done gradually over at least two budget 
years 
moynihans tax surgery would force the issue by reducing the 
reserves the bill he is introducing would roll back a social 
security tax increase that took effect jan 1 and lower the rate 
in 1991 he said that would put the system on a payasyougo 
basis limiting reserves and using the tax to pay benefits due now 
in the process it would undo measures adopted in 1983 to build 
up the social security trust fund now in order to meet soaring 
benefit costs that will come when the baby boom generation begins 
reaching retirement age in about 20 years 
moynihan served on the commission that recommended that plan 
but he said it has been subverted by the use of the social security 
reserves to underwrite spending and conceal the real size of 
federal deficits thats done by investing the reserves in treasury 
securities which produces funds for other programs 
and without the trust fund reserves which offset 52 billion in 
deficit spending in the last budget year the government wouldnt 
have come close to meeting its mandated deficit reduction timetable 
moynihan chairman of a senate subcommittee on social security 
said the way the reserves are being used now amounts to thievery 
his tax reductions would reduce social security revenues by 7 
billion this year and by 55 billion in 1991 
the general accounting office already had suggested a possible 
tax reduction to eliminate the illusory buildup of reserves that 
now represents little more than a mechanism for using the payroll 
tax to finance the general operations of government 
nearly nine months ago sen john heinz rpa and moynihan 
joined in pressing that argument as the senate adopted their 
resolution saying that the trust fund reserves should not be 
counted in deficit reduction calculations the measure was approved 
without dissent on may 3 but it was not binding and it was ignored 
so for all the stir the moynihan proposal is hardly a secret 
weapon the senator said last spring that if the indirect use of 
social security reserves to finance current deficit spending wasnt 
stopped the alternative would be to cut the tax so the money is 
not there to be diverted to inappropriate and indeed immoral 
purposes 
he got yawns then now hes got an issue

its been 20 years since transplant surgeons 
gave a little boys liver to kim hudson unsure how long the 
3yearold girl would last beyond the operation indeed whether 
she would last at all 
kim hudson is now kim rasmussen wife of an air force sergeant 
and mother to three cats three dogs and any other animal that 
strays her way being the worlds longestsurviving recipient of a 
liver transplant is a distinction shed just as soon forget 
i dont like to talk about it she said i hate hospitals 
i do not like doctors that well i associate them with 
transplants its all scary i shake when i go in to get my blood 
work they thought i was going to pass out a couple months ago i 
hate it and it doesnt get any better 
every so often when shes back in polo ill visiting her 
parents shes approached by wellwishing curious folks when 
they start mentioning it you know they want to start talking about 
it i just want to run 
kim fears her luck will run out if she brags about her jan 22 
1970 transplant and how well she has done nevertheless thoughts 
of the transplant and the everpresent risks follow her 
everywhere 
i think about my health all the time i pray every day i stay 
healthy i pray that it all keeps working 
her family is used to her constant anxiety and refusal to 
discuss anything even remotely connected to transplantation 
she does so well she feels it will somehow jinx her said 
ethel hudson her mother she knows a lot of other ones who have 
died after getting back from it said her father bob 
even dr thomas e starzl who performed the transplant at the 
university of colorado health sciences center cant explain kims 
uninterrupted good health for practically all the time since we 
did her 
you could call it providential if you were inclined that 
way said starzl who is now at the university of pittsburgh 
starzl performed the worlds first liver transplant in 1963 as 
well as the 31 other liver transplants in denver that preceded 
kims only a handful of medical centers were transplanting livers 
at the time 
during that first decade children had a 30 percent to 35 
percent chance of living one year beyond surgery for adults it 
was 10 percent 
they were successful if they didnt die on the table and 
got out of the hospital said paul taylor a transplant 
coordinator who worked with starzl at the university of colorado 
the hudsons learned of those early efforts from an article in a 
medical journal their daughter had been born with biliary atresia 
a blockage of the bile ducts and time quickly was running out 
family doctors advised against the risky experimental procedure 
relatives said theyd be killing the child 
undaunted the hudsons persuaded their doctors to send kims 
medical records and blood samples to denver ten months after her 
name was placed on the waiting list in 1969 a matching liver was 
found 
by the time kim received the liver and gall bladder of a 
7yearold boy killed in a car accident on jan 22 1970 only four 
of the 32 previous recipients still were alive by mid1975 all 
four were dead 
kim lived on though followed by more and more survivors 
twentyeight of the 170 patients transplanted by starzl through 
february 1980 in fact still are alive for starzl each one was a 
moon walker 
up until then people with those diagnoses and those 
conditions really they had no hope this at least provided some 
hope as it turned out tangible hope he said kim hudson i 
think was the symbol of all that 
the real breakthrough came in 1980 when starzl began testing an 
antirejection drug known as cyclosporine on liver transplant 
patients oneyear survival rates soared eventually settling at 
todays 70 percent to 80 percent 
as the number of transplants grew a record 1680 nationwide in 
1988 so did the number of those seeking treatment as of jan 15 
834 americans were awaiting livers according to the united network 
for organ sharing 
cyclosporine approved by the us food and drug administration 
for general use in 1983 now is being surpassed by an even stronger 
drug known as fk506 the japanese drug is believed 50 to 100 
times more powerful than cyclosporine starzl has conducted the 
us clinical trials since february 1989 
doctors hestitate to change kims medication though since she 
has yet to experience organ rejection as a result she takes drugs 
prescribed long before the advent of cyclosporine as with any 
antirejection drug she must swallow her pills every day for the 
rest of her life 
there are side effects to all the drugs which help prevent 
rejection by suppressing the immune system and thereby increase the 
risk of infection so far kims only major side effect has been 
cataracts its nothing to worry about she said im not 
going to get myself all worked up 
kim goes out of her way to avoid germs and sick people she was 
particularly careful in okinawa where her husband curt 24 was 
stationed for three years he was transferred to mcconnell air 
force base kan last summer and the couple just bought a house 
in nearby derby she works part time at the base commissary the 
rest of the time she spends with her animals 
i enjoy life she said but it gets scary like when 
people get around me and theyre sick ive been real lucky 
she plans to celebrate the 20th anniversary quietly by going out 
to dinner with her husband and has but one wish i hope i live 
to be an old lady

students not scientists will harvest 
whatever discoveries are yielded by 125 million tomato seeds the 
space shuttle columbia returned to earth aboard the rescued long 
duration exposure facility 
the seeds contributed by park seed co of greenwood were sent 
into space in 1984 aboard the ldef a 21400pound satellite 
intended to study how materials systems and products withstand 
long exposure to conditions in space 
the satellite was to have been retrieved after 10 months but 
scheduling problems and the 1986 challenger disaster delayed 
retrieval atmospheric drag had been pulling the satellite toward 
earth about a halfmile a day if it had not been retrieved jan 12 
by columbia astronauts it was expected to fall to earth about 
march 9 destroying the 58 scientific experiments 
you can imagine that the scientific community would like to 
get their hands on the material said jim alston parks research 
director instead it will package the surviving seeds into 150000 
experiment kits for schools we dont want professional 
scientists preempting what the kids will find 
researchers expect some mutations alston said but we really 
dont know what to expect as results the question always comes up 
are we going to have killer tomatoes or anything like that no 
thats not going to happen 
theres 125 million seeds there can be any number of 
mutations theres also the possibility a very desirable plant or 
characteristic will pop up that can be developed for a commercial 
release or a new tomato type or something 
the seeds will be delivered to elementary and secondary schools 
and colleges chosen by nasa the schools will be asked to submit 
experiment results to oklahoma state university which will publish 
a report on the findings 
if our dreams come true well have about 4 million school 
kids participating in this project towards the end of this 
semester alston said the schools that do send in the report 
will get a certificate from nasa the more that do report the 
better our database will be 
park seed also placed aboard the ldef an additional 19 million 
seeds of 106 varieties for its own experiments it will study 
growth rates percentage that failed to survive and the fruits 
vegetables and plants the seeds produce 
the produce from the seeds will be edible because theyre not 
picking up enough residual radiation to be any problem alston 
said in fact there probably will be no more than here on earth 
right now 
it is not the first time park seed has been involved with the 
national aeronautics and space administration one of the nations 
largest mailorder seed companies park seed participated in a 1983 
shuttle experiment prompting the chief scientist for this mission 
to ask the company to devise a project involving a large number of 
students

groupe bull the french computer company that 
bought the computer business of zenith electronics corp in late 
december says it plans to keep the zenith operation a separate 
division with its own identity 
zenith data systems will be our pc arm with responsibility 
for microcomputer product marketing and development on a worldwide 
basis said francis lorentz groupe bulls chairman and chief 
executive 
groupe bull also announced wednesday a series of management 
changes under them roland pampel president and chief executive 
of bull hn information systems inc was named chairman of zenith 
data systems as well as senior executive vice president of groupe 
bull 
pampel 54 previously was president and chief operating officer 
of the former apollo computer inc bull hn information systems is 
bulls other us computer division which consists primarily of 
the former honeywell computer line 
in addition the french company unveiled a new logo for the 
zenith division that incorporates the zenith name but not the 
zigzag z used by zenith electronics corp with bulls 
stylized tree logo 
bull said it would keep zenith data systems headquarters in 
suburban chicago and its manufacturing plants in that area and in 
st joseph mich 
with the addition of zenith data systems bull says it now has a 
complete product line ranging from zeniths popular portable and 
desktop computers to bulls existing powerful mainframes 
analysts have generally praised bulls purchase of zeniths 
wellregarded computer division which was announced in october and 
completed last month they say it was a savvy move by bull to 
extend its product line 
i think if bull manages it right theyre going to have a 
winner here said bob tasker an analyst for the research firm 
international data corp 
tasker said that before the purchase bull was weak in the 
desktop market in addition he said the zenith acquisition should 
help bull tackle its poor name recognition in this country 
another benefit to bull is that the zenith acquisition opens up 
a wide variety of software to use on a combination of zenith and 
bull computers tasker said the existing bull machines can use 
only a narrow range of software while the zenith machines can run 
on a huge number of software packages he said 
by linking the zenith machines with bull computers bull can 
sell computer systems compatible with huge horizons of 
programs he said 
also wednesday the zenith division unveiled its first desktop 
machine that conforms with an industry standard zenith helped 
establish in 1988 
the standard called extended industry standard architecture 
was proposed by nine computer makers as a competitor to the 
microchannel computer architecture developed by international 
business machines corp 
in addition to being based on the new architecture zenith says 
the new machine offers greatly increased access to its computer 
disc which would be useful in applications where 30 users or more 
are hooked up to the computer system

the financial house listed as the biggest 
unsecured creditor in bankruptcy filings by federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp says its owed about half of 
what the documents indicate 
first boston corp issued a statement wednesday saying that the 
filings accurately list federateds and allieds combined unsecured 
obligations to first boston corp as 526 million 
but the new yorkbased firm said other factors limit first 
bostons total exposure to 293 million including exchange notes 
resulting from a temporary loan it made to federated 
the filings value securities at face or par value but first 
boston acquired many of those bonds at substantial discounts the 
company said the filing also includes custodial holdings for the 
firms customers first boston said 
in addition the filing accounts for zerocoupon bonds at their 
full value at maturity even though the bonds do not mature until 
2004 and their value today is significantly less first boston said 
troubled campeau corp put its federated and allied divisions 
which operate 258 department stores under federal bankruptcy court 
protection monday to allow the companies to operate while they work 
out a plan to satisfy creditors 
the us retail units now operate under the corporate umbrella 
federated stores inc g william miller the former treasury 
secretary and federal reserve board chairman named tuesday as 
chairman of federated met wednesday in cincinnati with the heads 
of the campeaus nine us department store chains 
the company would not comment on how federated and allied would 
reorganize and pay their creditors but retail analysts continued 
to speculate that sales of store groups are imminent 
i think theyll be selling off some assets they have some 
great names there and some wonderful stores they could sell said 
karen sack an analyst for standard amp poors corp in new york 
there are a lot of other retail chains around that would like to 
pick up the retail chains they have 
federateds stores are abraham and straus and bloomingdales of 
new york lazarus of cincinnati burdines of miami and richs of 
atlanta allieds stores are the bon marche of seattle jordan 
marsh of boston maas brothers of tampa and sterns of paramus nj 
in their chapter 11 filing the companies listed assets of 91 
billion and liabilities of 77 billion much of it debt used to 
finance torontobased campeaus purchases of allied in 1986 and 
federated in 1988 
the debt must be significantly reduced that was the cause of 
the problem and that is the only cure said monroe greenstein of 
bear stearns amp co inc the operating company is basically a good 
sound company until this huge overhang of debt hit it 
james m zimmerman president of federated and allied has said 
that executives want to resist selling divisions of the company to 
pay creditors the only exception is federateds 17store 
bloomingdales chain which it put up for sale last year 
the chains whose operations had been profitable before the 
chapter 11 filing should be able to operate normally now that they 
are temporarily relieved of their debt burden said jack seibald of 
salomon brothers inc 
the thing that got to them was not the operations it was the 
debt seibald said 
joseph chervin a new york bankruptcy lawyer who is representing 
some of federateds and allieds creditors said those at greatest 
risk during the bankruptcy court proceedings are investors who 
bought bonds campeau sold to finance its venture into american 
retailing 
everybodys getting paid except the bond holders chervin 
said the banks that put money in after mondays filing are 
getting taken care of the suppliers are getting taken care of 
creditors from before the filing will have a chance to vote on 
acceptance of the retailers reorganization plan which must be 
approved by the federal bankruptcy court said neal colton a 
philadelphia bankruptcy lawyer 
colton said bond holders could be asked to accept reduced 
interest payments or longer repayment periods 
the difference in a reorganization of this magnitude is that 
it is unclear whether there will be enough money to pay off 
everyone who holds debts colton said 
documents campeau filed with the securities and exchange 
commission earlier this month warned that even the sale of all its 
store groups might not raise enough money under certain conditions 
to pay off all the debts

the aura of invincibility that atampt managed 
to create with heavy advertising and dependable service has 
unraveled a bit with mondays network outage but the company will 
not be abandoned by its customers analysts say 
a more likely result will be a hardsell by american telephone amp 
telegraph cos competitors to get companies to add a backup 
carrier to their service 
they can now go to large customers and say see this is what 
can happen you need us as a backup said audrey stevoff an 
analyst with the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps inc 
atampt is up there with motherhood and apple pie and 
perfection ms stevoff said wednesday it shook everybody up 
including the company it really did tarnish their image it showed 
that they reallyarent perfect 
no 2 mci communications corp and no 3 us sprint wasted no 
time in capitalizing on atampts embarrassing misfortune 
this is a competitive business and beating up on the 
competition is the name of the game said geoffrey johnson a 
telecommunications analyst at argus research corp in new york 
mci and sprint were both just handed a giant club 
sprint came out swinging 
sprint which controls about 8 percent of the longdistance 
market placed a fullpage ad in several newspapers wednesday 
informing customers how to access its service if they have problems 
with other carriers dial 10333 then 1 the area code and the 
number 
the procedure is the same for mci except the access code is 
10222 
we dont want to rub salt in anybodys wounds said sprint 
spokesman sid courson but he added atampt has been heralding its 
system and its history of utter reliablity and it just aint so 
we have never lost the whole network he said they did 
atampt which has 70 percent of the longdistance market was 
planning to offer a day of reducedrate calling or another customer 
benefit to help atone for the inconvenience monday when half its 
calls didnt go through said spokesman harry baumgartner the plan 
could be announced today the company said 
it was possible atampt would ask its competitors to agree to 
temporarily transfer customers to each other should any of them run 
into similar problems baumgartner said 
on monday atampt operators at first refused to provide access 
codes for customers to reach mci or sprint the policy was 
abandoned when the seriousnes of atampts problem became apparent 
the company said 
baumgartner said we have focused on quality like no other 
thats why this is so painful for atampt 
he said the computer software glitch that knocked out service 
was an aberration and most of the companys customers will 
understand that and not jump to other carriers 
courson said sprints dallas office which concentrates on 
medium and large businesses averaged 20 unsolicited calls an hour 
tuesday and wednesday from companies asking about the service he 
said that prior to mondays outage the company averaged about 11 
unsolicited calls per day 
many large corporations already have backup carriers but many 
others do not probably because they never experienced such 
problems with atampt and did not expect to ms stevoff said 
atampt spokeswoman sue fleming said virtually all of the companys 
large business customers have the capability of adding a backup 
service with little expense but adding a backup carrier usually 
reduces the number of lines for the primary carrier she said 
figures on the percentage of atampt customers that also use a 
second carrier were not available from atampt mci or sprint 
the inconvenience of this weeks problems may push those with a 
single carrier regardless of which company it is to sign up a 
second carrier 
john hauser an mci spokesman said his companys strategy was 
similar to sprints 
were not going to have to do anything more than we have been 
doing he said we just have to announce louder that were 
around and that businesses probably shouldnt put all their eggs in 
one basket 
a spokesman for du pont co one of atampts largest customers 
said atampts failure affected all of his companys communications 
because none of its longdistance traffic moves on private 
dedicated lines 
the spokesman john wheeler said du pont is constantly 
evaluating its communications system because the network is vital 
to its business du pont does about 40 percent of its business 
overseas 
lets just say there was a very long pause in our business 
day he said but ive heard no suggestions here that du pont 
is either backing up or getting rid of atampt

the chief executive of british airways plc has 
called for the creation of a special international task force to 
help solve the airline industrys lack of capacity worldwide 
colin marshall chief executive and joint deputy chairman of the 
british airline said wednesday an action group should be set 
up under the international air transport association to deal with 
crowded airports runways and air traffic corridors 
what we need is an action group under the aegis of iata one 
which can approach the problems bluntly and directly operating 
from a basis of selfinterest and at the same time of overall 
industry concern marshall said in a speech to the wings club an 
aviation industry group 
if we cannot create something like this then i suspect the 
constantly growing airweed a cousin to that which can eventually 
stop even the largest oceangoing ships will bring us to a moribund 
halt he said 
trump shuttle president bruce nobles said he agrees with 
marshall about the capacity problems but isnt sure an 
international task force is the solution 
its an interesting idea but i dont know how necessary it 
is he said in an interview following the speech 
nobles is a member of the partnership for improved air travel a 
us lobbying group seeking to have money in the airport and airway 
trust fund earmarked for system improvement because of pressure to 
reduce the federal budget deficit neither the white house nor 
congress has been willing to dip into the aviation trust fund 
which is supplied by an 8 percent tax that is included in air fares 
the air transport association a us industry group in 
washington dc also said it found marshalls proposal 
interesting 
the us airlines would certainly be willing to consider any 
measure that would have a realistic prospect of improving the 
worlds airportsairways capacity problem said ata spokeswoman 
kathleen rosenauer she declined to elaborate 
in his speech marshall suggested that six or seven capable 
senior airline executives should get together with iata to 
determine how to set up an international task force 
british airways would be willing to offer the services of one 
of its best managers he said adding that we should not 
have any greater part in it than anyone else 
asked whether he was offering himself as a potential 
participant marshall replied im not accustomed to hiding my 
light under the bushes so why not

all christine m weakley wants to do as head of 
paces bank amp trust is run a successful business 
but as one of the few female chief executive officers of a bank 
she finds herself in the position of having to knock down 
misconceptions that paces is a womens bank 
though the majority of the banks stockholders directors and 
senior managers are women our interest first and foremost is to 
be a good bank ms weakley said 
stressing highly personalized service paces caters mainly to 
small businesses the atlanta bank opened last month and had as of 
dec 31 15 million in deposits and 500000 in loans 
because of the attention she has received as ceo and president 
several misconceptions have arisen about the bank ms weakley said 
there are always various and sundry comments that were all 
feminists out to right the wrongs of the world that we only bank 
with women weve even been called a prochoice bank ms weakley 
said 
one man who came in was real uncomfortable and said he had to 
talk to a man ms weakley recalled during an interview at her 
office wednesday he said no offense but women in banking to 
me is like men selling avon 
ms weakley is no newcomer to banking she worked for nine years 
at the first national bank of cobb county before deciding to open 
her own bank 
the preponderance of women in the organization helped paces 
qualify for the federal governments minority banks program the 
program helps open the door to accounts for such banks by making 
them eligible for deposits from government agencies and certain 
corporations 
the government still considers women a minority ms weakley 
said ive never been a rabid feminist and dont plan to be i 
simply saw it the program as a way to get started quicker 
the minority status has been a mixed blessing for paces and ms 
weakley it has helped the bank get a foothold in the competitive 
atlanta market but also has given it a label that makes some 
potential customers wary 
unfortunately it has been turned around that were 
automatically making a social statement ms weakley said when 
the publicity first started that was the angle the media used a 
womens bank opens in atlanta 
ms weakleys experiences with people uneasy about her position 
are not uncommon among women in highranking executive jobs said 
patricia mcdougall an associate professor of management at georgia 
state university who specializes in issues involving women 
its very common for female executives to face the problem of 
being stereotyped and their sex being reacted to rather than their 
expertise ms mcdougall said 
she said the problems occur especially at the higher levels of 
the corporate world because women in middle management positions 
now are not considered unusual 
ms mcdougall said negative reactions have accompanied most 
instances where women have done things that previously were taboo 
it goes back to when the first female walked out and filled 
your car with gas it was a shock she said now we think 
nothing of seeing women stand at selfservice pumps 
ms weakley said she and her bank have been accepted by those in 
the banking business but the misconceptions remain largely among 
the public which she said is not accustomed to seeing women run 
banks 
indeed ms weakley said that in most cases when she has been 
given the chance to talk to a wary potential customer she has 
overcome their hesitance 
a lot of people if they sit down long enough to talk to you 
they get over a lot of the preconceptions she said 
a treasury department roster of banks qualifying under the 
federal minority program lists 98 institutions across the country 
but does not distinguish between those that qualified because they 
are run by ethnic minorities and those run by women 
a treasury official in washington who asked not to be 
identified said most of the banks in the program are run by ethnic 
minorities 
the fact of the matter is there were more women banks in the 
country and more in our program but for whatever reason many of 
them folded it seemed to be an idea whose time hadnt come the 
official said

conrails restructuring plan met with praise 
from a railroad analyst who said the 1 billion stock repurchase 
and 300 million employee stock plan will help ward off any 
takeover attempts 
they probably couldnt come up with a better plan said 
analyst anthony b hatch of painewebber inc this is a prudent 
way to help them in the short and longterm 
officials of consolidated rail corp said wednesday they would 
launch today a 1 billion tender offer for up to 21 million of the 
railroads 671 million common shares with the price range for the 
dutch auction at 43 to 53 per share 
conrails shares closed wednesday at 4612 in new york stock 
exchange trading down 37 cents the restructuring was announced 
after the market closed 
although company officials would not comment on their motive 
analysts noted that conrail the nations fifthlargest railroad in 
terms of revenue loses its government protection against takeovers 
april 2 
hatch speculated the restructuring was a move to head off any 
takeover attempts by ensuring that its stock was fairly valued 
conrail could attract a corporate raider because of the 
railroads small longterm debt and cash reserves of about 600 
million analysts said they say conrail could be worth more broken 
up and sold off than the cost of all its stock 
conrails move was made possible in part by recent legislation 
that allows the freight railroad to buy back significant amounts of 
its own stock 
the philadelphiabased company created by federal legislation 
to rescue the penn central and five other bankrupt railroads in 
1976 was sold by the government to the public in 1987 however 
the government retained some power over the company such as 
limiting its repurchase of stock 
also wednesday conrail which operates in 14 northeastern and 
midwestern states and quebec reported 1989 earnings of 148 
million or 217 per share down from 306 million or 444 per 
share in 1988 
the 1989 earnings reflected a special charge of 234 million or 
216 per share related to layoffs consolidation of operating and 
administrative functions and a larger reserve fund for expenses 
related to accidents 
the special charge was taken in the fourth quarter which showed 
a loss of 81 million or 120 per share compared with earnings 
of 78 million or 113 per share for the same quarter in 1988 
hagen said the companys board of directors undertook the 
restructuring to improve performance and structure and thereby 
enhance shareholder value 
under the repurchase plan which expires feb 14 the company 
will conduct a dutch auction meaning stock owners will offer their 
shares to the company for a price that falls within the range 
conrail specified the company in turn will select a share price 
within the range that will enable it to buy the number of shares it 
set out to buy 
as part of its repurchase plan conrail said it will spend 200 
million to 400 million to buy additional shares on the open market 
after the dutch auction is completed the amount of the repurchase 
will depend in part of the results of the dutch auction it said 
conrail spokesman saul resnick said the railroad established the 
300 million employee stock ownership plan for nonunion employees 
but is still considering a similar plan for union employees 
for the fourth quarter conrails revenue totaled 823 million 
compared with 904 million in the same quarter of 1988 revenue for 
all of 1989 was 341 billion compared with 349 billion in 1988 
hagen said fourth quarter revenue was affected by a 47 percent 
drop in traffic volume with the largest declines in metals and 
related product shipments down 236 percent and in automotive 
shipments down 152 percent 
he predicted a further downturn in traffic in 1990 due to 
projected declines in auto and steel shipments 
meanwhile standard amp poors corp a creditrating agency 
lowered its rating of conrails debt in response to the 
restructuring which it said would weaken the companys credit 
standing somewhat 
sampp lowered its rating of conrail senior debt to a from aa and 
its equipment trust certificates to aa from aaa its highest rating

the 1986 chevrolet camaro topped a list of the 
nations moststolen vehicles thanks in part to the 
interchangeability of its parts with other general motors corp 
cars an insurance valuation company said 
a list compiled by ccc information services inc of chicago 
showed the 1986 camaro again in first it was followed by the 1987 
84 and 85 models of the camaro camaros also held the top four 
spots on the moststolen list for 1988 
the 1988 hyundai excel gl at no 10 was the only car not made 
by gm in the top 10 
car thieves for the most part are parts suppliers ccc vice 
president william geen said wednesday and interchangeability of 
parts such as between the firebird and camaro makes those cars 
more likely candidates for theft 
if the belief is that the no 1 reason that people steal cars 
is for the parts it would seem to be common sense that they would 
always appear on top geen said 
the 1988 ford mustang no 43 among stolen cars was the first 
nongm domestic car on the list compiled by ccc and used by the 
insurance industry to provide theft data 
gm is banking that in later reports newer camaros will drop in 
rankings 
were confident that our new passkey system will greatly 
reduce the number of thefts said gm spokeswoman ruth bouldes 
the system which shuts down the fuel system if someone tampers 
with the ignition system originally was introduced on the 1986 
corvette and the 1989 camaro 
the annual report also reflected the growing popularity of light 
trucks especially pickups not only among buyers but among thieves 
the 1986 and 1985 chevrolet fullsize pickup trucks zoomed to 
13th and 14th places respectively on last years list neither 
vehicle was in the top 100 in 1988 
the number of light duty trucks sold in the last two to three 
years is just off the charts geen said 
sales of domestic and foreign light trucks jumped to 47 million 
in 1989 up 93 percent from the 1985 level 
the increased popularity he said increases the likelihood of 
them becoming theft targets for parts suppliers

us airlines had their most fatal air crashes 
last year since 1968 but the government says the overall accident 
rate for commercial air carriers and commuters declined 
in all 278 people were killed in 11 crashes in 1989 involving 
scheduled and nonscheduled air carriers down slightly from the 
285 in 1988 the national transportation safety board said 
wednesday 
the most deadly year of the decade was 1985 when 526 people were 
killed in seven fatal commercial aviation accidents the least 
destructive year was 1980 when only one fatal accident took place 
killing just one person 
also last year 763 people died in accidents involving private 
or general aircraft the safety board said the lowest figure for 
that category since it began keeping statistics there were 781 
deaths involving general aviation accidents in 1988 
the board said the fatal accident rate for general or private 
aviation continued an improving trend that lasted most of the 
decade 
despite the high number of airline accidents involving 
fatalities last year the overall accident rate for commercial air 
carriers and commuters declined the safety board said 
there were 28 accidents involving us scheduled and charter 
airlines last year a decrease from the 32 accidents recorded in 
1988 the 11 involving fatalities were the most since the 15 of 
1968 
the fatal accident rate was 0144 for every 100000 scheduled 
and charter departures up from 0026 in 1988 
the major scheduled us airlines had 24 accidents last year 
down from 31 the previous year of those two dozen accidents eight 
involved fatalities the most since 1973

the federal government should close the 14 
percent pay gap between hispanic employees and other civil servants 
to improve its disturbing hispanic employment rate according 
to an advocacy group 
the average salary for hispanic white collar civil servants in 
1988 was 3918 less than for the their counterparts according to 
a report released wednesday by the national association of latino 
elected and appointed officials 
the pay gap damages the governments efforts to hire hispanics 
said harry pachon the groups national director 
richard mcgowan a spokesman for the office of personnel 
management said several factors affect white collar workers 
salaries including experience education and seniority 
hispanics made up 52 percent of executive branch employees and 
accounted for 73 percent of the private sector workforce in 1988 
the most recent year for which the information was available 
according to the study 
its a disturbing thing because if anybody should be 
exhibiting fair employment practices that represent the ethnic 
makeup of the country it should be the federal government said 
robert paral a researcher for the association 
only one of 13 federal agencies the justice department with a 
93 percent hispanic employment rate exceeded the private sector 
average said the report which reviewed 1988 affirmative action 
information 
of 1227 civil servants working at executive office agencies 
such as the office of management and budget only 13 or 11 
percent are hispanic the report said 
the lack of hispanics in those jobs is especially bothersome 
because these are the people who have the presidents ear paral 
said 
in a speech last month to hispanics opm director constance 
newman acknowledged that hispanics remain underrepresented in the 
governments 21 million civilian workforce she said the 
government has programs to recruit hispanics 
the report showed five of the agencies have hispanic employment 
rates of less than half the national average for instance 
hispanics make up 32 percent of the department of educations 
workforce 
the governments hiring rate for hispanics has steadily 
increased over the past 15 years growing from 37 percent in 1976 
to 53 percent as of march 1989 mcgowan said the number should 
increase as minorities and women make up a larger portion of the 
workforce he said 
hispanics account for about 9 percent of the nations 
population paral said since 1980 the number of adult hispanics 
who are citizens and therefore eligible for federal government jobs 
has increased by more than 45 percent he said

plans for a polishborn heiress to buy the 
shipyard where solidarity was born fell through this month after 
her representatives demanded a fiveyear strike ban and wages of 50 
cents an hour 
a newspaper says a portrait of barbara piaseckajohnson the new 
jersey heiress who last year offered to invest up to 100 million 
in the shipyard has now been replaced at the complex by one of 
polishborn pope john paul ii 
ms johnson had been hailed as a savior for offering the cash to 
keep the lenin shipyard afloat now officials say theyre drawing 
up a plan to sell shares in the yard to workers and investors alike 
the shipyards future has been uncertain since october 1988 
when polands government then run by communists announced plans 
to close the sprawling facility in the spirit of economic reform 
solidarity leader lech walesa who took charge of the 
independent movement that transformed the communist bloc during a 
1980 strike at the shipyard called the government move a 
provocation 
the communist authorities said the shipyard was unprofitable 
and closing it was just the sort of hardship workers would have to 
endure if polands economic slide was to be reversed 
mrs johnson who married the head of the johnson and johnson 
pharmaceutical firm and inherited his fortune signed a letter of 
intent to take a controlling interest in the shipyard during 
visits to poland from her new jersey home she appeared frequently 
smiling and joking at walesas side 
but terms were never reached and the letter of intent expired 
jan 1 although mrs johnson offered to continue the talks 
james whisenand a miami attorney who represents mrs johnson 
was not immediately available for comment wednesday 
zbigniew lis who negotiated for the solidarity local during 
talks with the government on the yards future told the communist 
youth daily sztandar mlodych that mrs johnsons conditions made it 
difficult for the workers to accept what she proposed 
he said her business representatives wanted a fiveyear ban on 
strikes and a 50cent hourly wage for the same period other joint 
ventures pay double that amount he said 
a new proposal to save the shipyard has been put forth by the 
solidarityled government it would allow the yard to reorganize as 
a joint stock company with workers being allowed to buy shares 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska told a jan 5 
news conference that foreigners including mrs johnson would be 
allowed to buy into the joint stock company 
there have been no indications if mrs johnson intends to 
participate 
however before the actual transformation of the shipyard into a 
joint stock company parliament must pass legislation on 
privatization of governmentowned industries that is expected to 
take six months the newspaper said 
meanwhile counting on mrs johnsons offer the shipyard may 
have passed up other potential offers from various foreign 
investors sztandar mlodych reported jan 8 
the newspaper said that workers had taken down a portrait of 
mrs johnson replacing it with one of the pope in the showcase at 
the main gate 2 entrance to the shipyard

southmark corp once a highflying real estate 
company built with junk bonds would be left with only a weak texas 
thrift controlled by creditors under a reorganization plan filed 
with the us bankruptcy court 
the plan filed wednesday envisions selling off all southmark 
assets except san jacinto savings and loan paying off most secured 
creditors and giving junk bond holders pennies on the dollar 
when southmark filed for protection from its creditors in july 
it had assets of 91 billion since then losses revaluations and 
asset sales have left it with 5 billion most of which is tied up 
in san jacinto texass ninth largest thrift 
officials said san jacinto based in bellaire is losing an 
average of 10 million a month 
under the plan which must be approved by creditors and the 
bankruptcy court southmark would inject 100 million into san 
jacinto bringing it into compliance with some but not all 
government regulations 
all other assets insurance oil and nursing home companies 
interest in casinos in atlantic city and san juan numerous real 
estate partnerships would be sold 
southmark acquired the assets mainly through financing provided 
by highrisk highyield junk bonds sold by drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
the highcost debt together with the collapse of the southwest 
real estate market led to southmarks demise said william g 
forster a managing director of shearson lehman hutton inc who has 
advised southmark since it filed for bankruptcy 
southmark chairman arthur g weiss hired a year ago said the 
speedy liquidation was the only way to leave even a small amount of 
money for creditors who also will retain ownership in a 
reorganized southmark under a new management and board of directors 
they will select 
the object was to take the assets that are here and to 
preserve the pie weiss told reporters wednesday he estimated 
the bankruptcy was costing southmark and the creditors about 3 
million a month in legal and administrative fees 
in addition federal claims against san jacinto estimated to be 
potentially 2 billion would have wiped out any assets otherwise 
available to debtholders he said 
weve got slices of the pie that have to be divided up 
forster said but the basic theory is that if we dont pull the 
pie out of the oven it will burn to a crisp 
under the plan holders of about 600 million in southmark junk 
bonds would get the first 200 million from sales of assets 
anything above that would go to other debtholders but forster 
estimated that they would receive less than 10 cents for every 
dollar owed 
southmark officials admit creditors may initially balk because 
of the low payback but weiss said we think that we have put 
forward a plan that ought to be appealing and at the end of 
the day creditors will vote to go along 
the plan envisions emerging from bankruptcy by mid1994 and 
foresees san jacinto as a much smaller thrift engaged in more 
traditional savings and loan businesses

housing starts slowed by record cold weather 
over much of the nation last month declined 8 percent in december 
and ended the year at the lowest level since the recession year of 
1982 the government reported today 
the commerce department said the december decline helped slow 
construction of new homes and apartments to 137 million units in 
1989 compared to 149 million units the previous year a 76 
percent drop 
the 137 million starts last year were the lowest since 1982 
when 106 million units were built both the federal national 
mortgage association and the national association of home builders 
are forecasting about 137 million starts in 1990 
before the abnormally cold weather hit last month the housing 
industry had been held back through much of this year by high 
interest rates which have moderated recently 
starts dropped from a high of 168 million units last january to 
126 million units in september before rebounding to 143 million 
units in october starts fell again in november to 134 million 
units pulled down by a 153 percent decline in multifamily 
projects 
according to a survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
fixedrate mortgages averaged 978 percent at the end of december 
after peaking over 11 percent last march 
the department said new homes and apartments were built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 124 million units in december 
down from a revised 134 million units in november 
construction of singlefamily homes in december fell 10 percent 
to an annual rate of 904000 units after falling 2 percent in 
november that was the lowest since 862000 units were started in 
december 1982 
apartment construction declined 24 percent to an annual rate of 
331000 units compared to a 153 percent decline in november 
the northeast posted the steepest decline down 233 percent to 
138000 units that was followed by a 10 percent drop in the south 
to 439000 units and a 98 percent decline in the midwest to 
268000 units 
starts rose only in the west where they gained 34 percent to 
39000 
applications for building permits a barometer of future housing 
activity bore potentially bad news for the new year they were 
down 04 percent from the previous month 
during all of 1989 134 million permits were issued the lowest 
amount since 1 million in 1982

digital equipment corp citing a slow us 
computer market thursday reported a 44 percent drop in second 
quarter earnings but the company said investments in new 
technology should help boost future sales 
digital the worlds secondlargest computer company said 
earnings totaled 1554 million or 125 per share for the fiscal 
quarter that dec 30 that compared with earnings of 2796 
million or 220 per share for the yearago period 
operating revenues for the second quarter were relatively flat 
at 318 billion less than a 1 percent increase from the second 
quarter of the previous fiscal year 
depressed earnings come as no surprise said terry shannon 
an analyst with framingham massbased international data corp 
computer market researcher but while he said the magnitude of the 
drop was surprising digital should rebound in the next 12 months 
once customers become more acquainted with products the company has 
introduced within the last year 
digitals announcement followed similar news wednesday by 
industry leader international business machines corp which 
reported a 75 percent drop in fourthquarter earnings and 35 
percent drop the year 
it appears that the overall market for computers in europe and 
japan is good but in the us the market is still slow kenneth 
olsen president of maynardbased digital said in a statement 
uncertain economic conditions are affecting customer 
purchasing intentions and slowing down the computer industry he 
said consequently we expect continued pressure on operating 
results 
digital plagued by slumping sales saw earnings decline 22 
percent for the fiscal year ended july 1 1989 the company last 
year froze salaries and transferred hundreds of employees from 
manufacturing to sales jobs 
olsen said digital has invested heavily in products that will 
allow customers to work on a variety of computers 
this means major investments and in the first six months of 
this fiscal year alone we have invested 796 million on research 
and development he said but it is we believe the cost of 
success in this industry 
for the sixmonth period digital reported net income of 3062 
million or 244 a share down 39 percent from 5029 million or 
390 a share in the yearago period operating revenues were 63 
billion up 3 percent from 61 billion the previous year

the white house breaking with its usual 
nocomment stance on activities of the federal reserve board said 
today that lower interest rates are justified 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said recent economic 
reports show that the economy could benefit from an easier monetary 
policy 
we had a recent drop in the prime rate that hasnt been 
totally passed through but we nevertheless remain hopeful that it 
will be fitzwater told reporters 
major banks lowered the prime interest rate on jan 8 to 10 
percent down from 105 percent the independent federal reserve 
however has not lowered its bellwether discount rate the rate it 
charges to other banks for nearly a year it stands at 7 percent 
asked whether sending a message to the central bank from the 
white house briefing room ran counter to the administrations 
general policy of not commenting on matters before the fed 
fitzwater said 
this is not a new message but its important occasionally to 
point out that lower interest rates are normally good for the 
economy 
fitzwater in particular said todays report by the commerce 
department that housing starts fell by 8 percent in december was 
not good news and was well below market expectations 
housing starts are more responsive to interest rate than 
anything else he said 
he said that when bush addresses the national association of 
homebuilders in atlanta on friday he will tell his audience that 
interest rates are going down 
fitzwater was asked about a story in todays edition of the wall 
street journal quoting two fed members vice chairman manuel 
johnson and wayne angell as indicating that lower interest rates 
were not likely in the near future 
were hopeful that they will take a look at this mornings 
indicators and understand that these numbers are low and indicate 
that inflation has remained very steady over the last seven or 
eight years and that lower interest rates are justified the 
spokesman said 
in addition to the weak housing starts report fitzwater cited 
the labor department report that showed inflation had grown a 
moderate 04 percent in december and had increased by 46 percent 
for all of 1989 the highest annual increase since 1981 
asked whether bush had spoken to federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan recently on the subject of interest rates fitzwater 
said they speak so often im not sure thats relevant

hobbyhorses date back to ancient greece but 
remain a favorite toy for spaceage tots ask chuck sakolsky who 
was in charge of making and selling nearly 55 million worth last 
year 
the funny thing is that even though it is a rocketship world 
kids interest in horses has never gone away the hobbyhorse is as 
basic to the toy business as anything there is said sakolsky 
general manager of the wonder products inc factory in northwest 
louisianas bossier city near shreveport 
the wonder horse a heavyduty plastic horse molded in 
midgallop and held up by strong steel springs is a 20th century 
descendant of the hobbyhorse a stick with a horses head at one 
end 
toy historians have traced hobbyhorses to the time of socrates 
and to illustrations in a french book of hours in the 15th century 
no references to rocking horses are known before the 17th century 
but whenever they were invented they had become immensely popular 
by the 1800s 
wonder introduced the springmounted horse in 1939 sakolsky 
said and bouncing horses had all but eliminated americanmade 
molded rocking horses from toy departments by the middle 1970s 
mostly whats out there are flat pieces of wood put together 
to look like a horse he said adding that most of todays molded 
horses on rockers are imported and are either expensive or cheap 
the wonder company plans to reintroduce its rocking horse this 
year capitalizing on growing nostalgia among parents and older 
people 
like the rocking horse wonder is coming back from almost 
nothing 
the company was founded in memphis the move to bossier city 
came after it had been sold twice cbs inc the broadcasting and 
entertainment concern that owned a louisiana swingset company 
called gym dandy put the two together 
cbs got out of the toy business a couple years back they 
sold the company to some of its managers they really didnt have 
the wherewithal to keep it going he said 
basic or not the company went under rotocast plastic products 
inc of miami bought it for 25 million last year at a sheriffs 
sale and brought in sakolsky to run it 
weve doubled our business since 1987 and well double it 
again in 1990 he said 
sakolsky estimated that wonder sold about 3 million worth of 
toys in 1988 55 million in 1989 and will probably sell nearly 
10 million worth in 1990 he declined to give the number of toys 
sold but said the company has relationships with retailers ranging 
from large toy chains to small shops 
at one time we had close to 70 percent of the market he 
said in 1988 i think we had around 30 percent i believe well 
have 50 percent of the market by 1990 
the companys mainstay remains the springmounted horse which 
retails anywhere from 40 for a 28inch model suitable for a 2or 
3yearold to more than 100 
we have palominos roans pintos were coming out with a 
dapple gray he said 
sakolsky also has gone back through 40 years of catalogs to find 
products worth bringing back and has created a couple of his own 
last year the company introduced a horse of a brighter color a 
handpainted replica of a 1914 carousel horse painted in vivid 
merrygoround hues priced at 150 the same horse mounted on a 
brass pole and sold as furniture retails for up to 500 
it is the rolls royce of the rideon horses said sakolsky 
i sort of think of these as grandmother horses because its the 
sort of thing a grandmother looks at and says gee thats what 
my grandchild has to have

modest acceleration over the 44 percent rates posted in 1988 and 
1987 still it was the steepest increase since 1981 when prices 
shot up 89 percent in a lingering aftershock from the doubledigit 
inflation of 1979 and 1980 
the seasonally adjusted increase in december was a bit lower 
than many analysts predicted but financial markets declined anyway 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 277 points 
in the first 90 minutes of trading to 265636 traders cited 
concern over lackluster corporate earnings and rising interest 
rates 
worry over higher rates was fueled by comments from two federal 
reserve board members who were quoted in the wall street journal 
today their remarks are being interpreted as suggesting the 
central bank wont reduce shortterm interest rates at least for 
now 
countering that the bush administration broke with its usual 
nocomment stance on fed policy white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said lower rates are justified and expressed concern 
over a sharp decline in housing starts last month 
the commerce department said housing starts dropped 8 percent in 
december as the cold weather slowed construction and ended down 76 
percent for the year the lowest level since the recession year of 
1982 
it said 137 million units of new homes and apartments were 
started last year compared with 149 million units in 1988 most 
analysts predicted starts would rebound in january 
meanwhile the labor department said in another report that 
americans inflationadjusted earnings were unchanged in december 
after falling 06 percent in november average weekly earnings were 
34081 in december up 32 percent from a year earlier not 
enough to keep up with inflation 
food prices jumped 56 percent in 1989 their steepest rise in 
nine years beating the droughtinduced increase of 52 percent in 
1988 
for december food costs were up 04 percent the same as 
november many analysts had expected the unseasonably cold weather 
near the end of the month to drive up fruit and vegetable prices 
however those prices actually fell 13 percent the full force of 
the freeze which dipped as far south as florida and texas likely 
will show up in january prices 
dairy products rose a sharp 22 percent in december bringing 
the increase for the year to 103 percent economists say dairy 
prices in 1989 were still reacting to increased slaughtering of 
herds during the previous summers drought 
the price of meat poultry fish and eggs jumped 10 percent in 
december 
much of that was attributed to a 37 percent advance in egg 
prices which climbed 354 for the year 
energy prices gained 51 percent last year driven up by a 195 
percent rise in fuel oil prices fuel oil increased 38 percent in 
december and a congressional committee is investigating allegations 
that oil companies used the cold weather as an excuse to grab 
profits 
gasoline prices which soared early in the year fell in six of 
the last seven months of 1989 including a 20 percent drop in 
december for the year they were up 65 percent 
natural gas prices increased 21 percent last month while 
electricity rose 08 percent 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose 04 
percent in december and 44 percent for the year a drop from 47 
percent in 1988 
analysts often look to this figure as a better indicator of 
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy they attribute 
the slowing in 1989 to economic sluggishness induced by the federal 
rserve board which fought inflation in the first half of the year 
by boosting interest rates 
most economists are expecting a modest improvement in overall 
inflation this year but some warn that inflation will be stubborn 
largely because the low unemployment rate is keeping wages rising 
the cost of services the catagory most heavily influenced by 
wages rose 04 percent in december and 51 percent for the year 
in other details 
new car prices jumped 10 percent in december but for the year 
were up only 23 percent held back by repeated discounting as 
dealers faced sluggish sales 
the cost of medical care rose 05 percent last month and 85 
percent for the year medical care costs have consistently risen 
faster than the general inflation rate 
clothing costs fell 07 percent in december the result of 
prechristmas reductions for the year they rose only 10 percent 
analysts say the relatively strong dollar has held down the price 
of clothing imports 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1261 percent in december that meant a 
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 
198284 base period would have cost 12610 last month up from 
12050 a year earlier

soybean futures prices opened slightly higher 
today on the chicago board of trade amid talk of soviet buying 
interest wheat and corn futures were narrowly mixed 
traders said exporters reported indications that the soviets 
bought about 150000 metric tons of us soybeans in recent days 
but others said the early rally was technically inspired after 
four days of lower prices 
the dull opening in the wheat and corn markets reflected a lack 
of significant new supplyanddemand developments traders 
discounted a rumor that china had bought 200000 metric tons of 
us corn 
the soviet union was said to be bidding for 500000 metric tons 
of us wheat at subsidized prices but that business has been 
largely factored into the market already 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in march at 401 a bushel 
corn futures were unchanged to cent higher with march at 242 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with march at 137 a 
bushel soybeans were cent to 1 cents higher with january at 
558 a bushel

american telephone and telegraph co today 
proposed to offer its residential business and international 
customers special valentines day discounts on longdistance calls 
to try to make amends for the near collapse of its network earlier 
this week 
in a filing with the federal communications commission the 
company said it was seeking approval to declare feb 14 as an 
additional day of holiday calling 
atampt chairman robert e allen said we are making this gesture 
to underscore how much we value our relationship with our 
customers knowing there is no way to make up for the inconvenience 
they may have experienced 
atampts special holiday prices discounted by an average 33 
percent from regular weekday prices will apply on all 
outofstate directdialed calls made by customers on atampts 
public network 
in addition atampt said price discounts also would apply for 
customers of its 800 services 
atampt suffered a ninehour outage to longdistance service 
nationwide on monday that was traced to a bug in a new software 
program 
allen on tuesday said he believed the outage in a callswitching 
network was a onetime hit against a network that serves 80 
million longdistance customers atampt handles about 70 percent of 
the nations interstate calling 
until the problem was contained more than half of the calls 
placed on atampts nationwide network did not go through the company 
said 
the company had said that billings would be adjusted to reflect 
the outage but details were not given in todays statement 
atampt said said the problem stemmed from a bug or logic 
problem inadvertently written into the software in a new york 
computer that helps direct calls through the vast network the 
problem spread to more than 100 switching centers 
allen said he could not estimate losses to atampt or its customers 
atampt has insurance to cover customers losses stemming from the 
trouble with its 800number tollfree service but does not have 
coverage for business customers using regular longdistance 
circuits 
some analysts said the disruption could be a boon to atampts 
rivals

the student charged with creating a 
worm that crippled about 6000 computers testified today that 
he intended to make it controllable but it grew to be unstoppable 
in the time it took him to go out to dinner 
under questioning from his defense attorney in federal court 
robert morris said he thought the computer worm would duplicate a 
few times a day or every few hours instead the worm spread far 
faster than i expected he said 
my intention was that it should not grow morris said 
once i released it i couldnt control it 
the cornell university graduate student said he released the 
worm into the internet computer network about 8 pm on dec 2 
1988 then went out for dinner when he returned about three hours 
later he said he noticed cornells own computer was slow to 
respond to commands 
morris testified that he released the worm into the national 
network through computers at the massachusetts institute of 
technology in cambridge mass in computer terminology a worm is a 
variant of socalled virus programs that can cause damage when 
they duplicate in computers 
morris said that when he found copies of the worm in the cornell 
system in ithaca ny where he was working from he knew it was 
spreading and he realized it wasnt working right he said he 
started to get scared 
morris said he considered sending out a second worm designed to 
track down and destroy the first worm but he decided it wouldnt 
work because of the unpredictable nature of the first worm and the 
way it curtailed his own access to the computer system 
instead he said he called andrew sudduth a friend at harvard 
university and asked him to send a message on an electronic 
bulletin board read primarily by internet users apologizing for 
unleashing the worm and explaining how to eliminate it 
sudduth testified at morris trial wednesday that he eventually 
did send a warning message but that it didnt show up on the 
computer system for two days because the route he picked to keep 
his identity a secret was backed up with electronic mail 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni has argued that morris had no 
criminal intent in designing the worm because he never realized it 
would cripple the computer network if convicted morris 25 of 
arnold md faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine 
a government witness testifying wednesday harvard graduate 
student paul graham said morris frantically called him for help 
he sounded like he had a final the next day that he hadnt 
studied for he sounded miserable he sounded in a state of shock 
and horror graham told the jury 
morris stressed in testimony today that he had no intention to 
read anyone elses private computer files or cause damage or leave 
any permanent files on the computers that were attacked

texaco incs profit slipped in the fourth quarter due mainly to 
a 355 million charge for environmental improvement programs while 
annual earnings nearly doubled the oil company reported thursday 
for the threemonth period ended dec 31 texacos aftertax 
earnings were 287 million or 99 cents a share down 3 percent 
from 296 million or 121 a share in the comparable 1988 period 
revenue rose 9 percent to 92 billion from 85 billion 
texaco the nations third largest petroleum company behind

image was tarnished by the nations worst oil spill in alaska last 
march more recently exxon has come under scrutiny for an 
underwater oil pipeline leak that fouled a new york city waterway 
exxon originally blamed the mishap on a faulty leakdetection alarm 
texaco said fourthquarter earnings also reflected the 
devaluation of an investment in an offshore california oil 
production facility

billion or 912 a share from 13 billion or 535 a share the

16 billion or 602 a share mainly from the sale of its 
lucrative texaco canada inc subsidiary to exxons imperial oil 
ltd of canada for about 324 billion 
texaco said the latest results showed gains in exploration and 
production earnings earnings from downstream or marketing and 
refining businesses suffered due to rising crude oil costs while 
its petrochemicals earnings also declined texaco said

its managers in the latest of a series of employee cutbacks 
continental managers said they were told last week not to expect 
the merit raises normally available every six months until later 
this year 
merit increases are being postponed until sometime in the 
fall continental spokesman art kent said wednesday 
a week ago houstonbased continental laid off about 150 
employees nationwide mostly middlelevel managers but company 
officials said the group represented a small fraction of its 35000 
workers some 11000 of which are in houston 
kent said managers were told about the raises when they met in 
houston last week to discuss the airlines performance 
every so often during the year we bring all the management 
people into houston kent said we brought everybody up to date 
on 1989 what our plans were for 1990

november 1988 to 659 cents in november 1989 in december prices 
hit 110 a gallon and many airlines this week were still paying 
more than 90 cents a gallon 
at the same time continental launched new fares some as low 
as 9 one way to help boost weak winter passenger traffic in 11 
cities in texas oklahoma and louisiana 
continentals sister carrier eastern airlines has been 
restructured as a smaller airline in the wake of a crippling strike 
that started last march 4 eastern has about 20000 employees 
mostly nonunion replacement workers down from 32000 before the 
strike

the top securities regulators of the united states 
and japan agreed thursday to take steps to ensure instant 
communications during sudden market plunges 
officials of the securities and exchange commission and the 
japanese finance ministrys securities bureau said they had 
designated facsimile lines and bilingual contact people for 
emergency communications in times of turmoil 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden also 
requested greater access to information on insider trading which 
his japanese counterpart masahiko kadotani promised to consider 
breeden said a 700 percent growth in japanese participation in 
the us securities market and a 500 percent increase in us 
trading in japanese equities since 1985 required greater 
cooperation on investor protection 
just as capital flows across borders so does fraud breeden 
said 
kadotani said he requested information about computerized 
program trading from the us delegation because the method of 
trading stocks and stockindex futures simultaneously is new in 
japan 
program trading in which millions of shares can be traded 
rapidfire has been blamed for accelerating sudden swings in the 
market breeden said his data showed program trading made up 30 
percent of market volume at times during a 190point plunge on the 
new york stock exchange last oct 13 
asked whether program trading was responsible for recent sharp 
declines in the tokyo market kadotani said its role was not 
significant but could become so in the future 
at the fourth annual meeting between the sides the countries 
top financial regulators also nudged each other to open each 
others markets 
among our objectives is moving toward a system where 
securities offerings can occur simultaneously in the us and 
japan breeden said 
but he admitted this would not occur soon and added it is an 
objective that will enhance the efficiency of capital flows around 
the world 
kadotani director general of the japans securities bureau 
said he had requested that japanese firms be allowed to operate 
investment trusts such as mutual funds in the united states 
breeden said the sec had recommended introducing such 
legislation in 1984 but that congress had not passed it 
but in a climate in the united states demanding more access to 
japanese markets he said congressional willingness to pass such 
legislation will be affected by progress in japan on allowing 
similar foreign activity

housing starts slumped in 1989 to their lowest 
level since the 1982 recession the government said thursday but 
many analysts looked for further drops in mortgage rates to improve 
the situation in 1990 
the drop in december housing starts is primarily due to severe 
weather in most of the nation last month said john a tuccillo 
chief economist for the national association of realtors 
the frigid weather pushed december starts to their lowest 
monthly level since october 1982 which in turn contributed to the 
years downturn 
the commerce department said construction of new homes and 
apartments tumbled 8 percent in december and helped drop total 1989 
starts to 137 million units the lowest since 1982s 106 million 
units starts totaled 149 million in 1988 
the housing industry had been sluggish through much of the year 
as the federal reserve pushed up interest rates by keeping a tight 
rein on credit as it sought to slow the economy and curtail 
inflation 
but as concerns grew that the economy might be slowing too much 
the fed allowed interest rates to fall gradually in recent months 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association which looks for 145 million starts this year said 
the forecast is predicated on our belief that rates are headed 
down 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders also is counting on a moderate decline in interest 
rates in the first half of the year to sustain his organizations 
forecast for 138 million starts in 1990 
on the other hand david berson chief economist for the federal 
national mortgage association looks for interest rates to edge up 
for much of the year and for starts to edge down 
commerce said new homes and apartments were built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 124 million in december down 
from a revised 134 million in november and 142 million in october 
construction of singlefamily homes plummeted 10 percent to an 
annual rate of 904000 units after a 2 percent drop in november 
that was the lowest since 862000 units in december 1982 as the 
economy began emerging from the recession 
but fannie maes berson said conditions were such that if it 
had not been for the weather singlefamily starts would have gone 
up and if januarys improved weather continues he said starts 
might rebound and even steal some that otherwise would take place 
in february 
apartment construction fell 24 percent to an annual rate of 
331000 units compared with a 153 percent decline in november 
and analysts said overbuilding in recent years will keep this 
sector weak 
the severe weather was widespread east of the rockies and 
starts in those regions posted the biggest declines starts were 
down 233 percent in the northeast to 138000 units down 10 
percent in the south to 439000 units and down 98 percent in the 
midwest to 268000 units 
starts rose only in the west where they gained 34 percent to 
390000 units 
applications for building permits a barometer of future housing 
activity edged down 04 percent in december during all of 1989 
134 million permits were issued the lowest number since 1 million 
in 1982

ppg industries inc a producer of glass 
coatings and chemicals said thursday its earnings dropped 08 
percent in the final three months of 1989 partly because of weak

development and plant operation and reduced demand for fiber glass 
textile

cents per share on sales of 14 billion that compared with 1023 
million or 94 cents per share on sales of 14 billion in the same 
period a year earlier 
ppg said its coatings business benefited during the quarter from 
strong automotive refinish activity reduced coatings sales to us 
automakers were offset somewhat by increased sales to transplant

in a stock market driven up partly by red chip 
shares is it any surprise that rumors about soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev contribute to nervous moves in share prices 
no say watchers of the tokyo stock exchange where capitalists 
have been placing some of their gambles on the communists 
this turn of events unthinkable a few years ago has its own 
internal logic 
peace is good for business especially in japan where the 
defense industry is a small sector of the economy gorbachev and 
president bush made progress toward better relations at their malta 
summit 
eastern european countries are opening their doors to outside 
business and japanese firms with possible deals in poland hungary 
or the soviet union the red chip stocks could be winners 
the tokyo stock exchange rode these two trends in the east bloc 
to a record high at the end of 1989 but since then the key nikkei 
stock index has been moving almost exclusively downward 
since the soviet union internal situation appears increasingly 
chaotic doing business in the old east bloc may not be simple if 
gorbachev were to leave office for any reason or if he is forced to 
abandon plans for a more open economy business prospects could dim 
so rumors hinting at the soviet leaders resignation or 
diminution of power tend to lower confidence and recent rumors in 
part explain the markets downtick 
if such events occur investors may unload red chip shares 
in trading companies and firms dealing in consumer electronic goods 
and environmental equipment thought most likely to be able to do 
well in eastern europe 
some market participants here are not so interested in 
fundamentals such as the price of the dollar or movement of 
interest rates said jan vandenberg senior economist at merrill 
lynch amp co in tokyo 
sales people she said have a tendency to couch something in 
terms of a rumor rather than in terms of a fundamental 
on jan 5 the second day of trading this year the tokyo nikkei 
225share index plunged 438 points more than 1 percent on rumors 
that gorbachev had canceled all meetings with foreign visitors to 
deal with domestic problems 
the soviet president had put off a meeting with british labor 
party leader neil kinnock but former japanese foreign minister 
shintaro abe soon after announced a trip to moscow to talk with 
gorbachev 
when the tokyo exchange closed wednesday the nikkei 225share 
index was at 3682114 about 5 percent below the record quote of 
3891587 at the end of 1989 again rumors that gorbachev was on 
his way out were part of the reason analysts said 
gorbachev will probably have to die a thousand times in such 
rumors this year yamaichi securities analyst kenji maeshiro said 
the peace dividend feeling that pulled the market up in 
december a belief that ussoviet tensions would be reduced by 
eastern europes democracy movement was buttressed by a consensus 
that japans central bank would not raise interest rates until 
after a national election in february 
but the bank confounded that consensus by raising the discount 
rate on dec 25 contributing to a loss of momentum the dollar 
also has been strong against the yen which could boost inflation 
in japan another confidencecutter 
lately though rumors have been center stage not a new 
phenomenon for stock exchanges several years ago the london 
markets took shock dips over rumors that president reagan had died 
a broker at a foreign securities firm who asked not to be named 
said wednesdays rumor about gorbachev losing his power base 
probably came from a bored investor in the foreign exchange 
market 
he said a gorbachev resignation story last week started when 
someone misread a news item 
the broker then passed on something that may or may not be as 
true as a gorbachev rumor his guess that the market is now 
oversold and shouldnt go down any more

wheat futures prices closed at 3month lows 
thursday on the chicago board of trade after tumbling late in the 
session on forecasts for heavy snow and rain in the heart of the 
us winter wheat country 
oat futures also retreated while corn and soybeans advanced 
the heavy precipitation predicted for thursday night and friday 
in the winter wheat fields of the southern plains would help 
relieve the unusally dry conditions that have prevailed there since 
late autumn 
they are likely to get as much snow today tonight and 
tomorrow as they usually get in january or february said 
katharina zimmer a grainmarket analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
this is the biggest rain event since september she said 
the soybean market was supported by indications that the soviet 
union bought about 150000 metric tons of us soybeans in recent 
days 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 397 a bushel its lowest 
close since sept 28 
corn futures were cent to 1 cents higher with march at 242 
a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with march at 138 a

five major us banks reported mixed 1989 results thursday with 
problem third world debt and a depressed real estate market 
plaguing some while others benefited from expansion and profitable 
financial operations 
bankamerica corp enjoyed the best year in its history but 
precautions taken to cover potentially bad third world debt put 
chemical banking corp in the red and pushed bank of new york cos 
earnings sharply lower for the year 
bank of boston was adversely affected by a depressed real estate 
market in new england but superregional ncnb corp continued to 
plug away at developing new markets and reported a highly 
profitable year 
san franciscobased bankamerica the nations secondlargest 
bank holding concern behind new yorks citicorp said earnings for 
the quarter ended dec 31 totaled 270 million or 121 per share 
a slight increase from the 265 million or 136 per share from 
the yearago period 
earnings for the full year soared 52 percent to 11 billion or 
519 a share the highest annual profit in its history in 1988 
the bank earned 726 million 379 per share 
the performance marks a dramatic comeback for bankamerica 
parent of bank of america that included a nearly 1 billion loss 
in 1987 
chemical banking corp the sixthlargest banking concern said 
fourthquarter earnings fell to 959 million or 104 a share 
down 67 percent from 2885 million or 466 a share in the final 
quarter of 1988 
for the year ended dec 31 chemical reported a net loss of 
4822 million or the equivalent of 829 a share compared with a 
profit of 7536 million or 1202 a share in 1988 
the loss resulted partly from a 600 million increase in 
chemicals reserves for problem loans to less developed countries 
which was taken in the third quarter 
chemical joined a long list of major us banks that moved to 
bolster their reserves to cover possibly bad debt 
no 10ranked bank of new york co bolstered by its acquisition 
of irving trust co reported fourthquarter earnings nearly 
doubled to 1066 million or 143 a share from 547 million or 
110 a share in the final quarter of 1988 
for the full year however a 600 million increase in bank of 
new yorks allowance for loan losses which was recorded in the 
third quarter pushed earnings down 76 percent to 507 million 
or 27 cents a share in 1988 the bank reported earnings of 213 
million or 521 a share 
no 14ranked bank of boston corp was hit by the depressed new 
england real estate market the regions largest bank holding 
company said earnings plummeted 89 percent in the fourth quarter to 
9 million or 8 cents a share from 83 million or 113 a share 
in the final quarter of 1988 
for the full year earnings plunged 78 percent to 70 million 
or 80 cents a share from 322 million or 443 a share a year 
earlier 
bank of boston increased its reserves to cover bad real estate 
loans to 923 million from 690 million a year earlier the 
company said its portfolio of troubled us commercial real estate 
assets had climbed to 11 billion as of dec 31 compared with 
618 million the previous year 
many new england banks have been hurt by the real estate slump 
as developers have had trouble making loan payments on projects 
that were approved during a building boom earlier in the 1980s 
no 16ranked ncnb corp the fastgrowing bank holding company 
based in charlotte nc reported fourthquarter earnings 
catapulted 112 percent to 1362 million or 130 a share from 
643 million or 69 cents a share in the period a year earlier 
for the full year ncnb said earnings rose 77 percent to 4471 
million or 462 a share compared with profits of 2525 million 
or 290 a share in 1988 
bank officials attributed the performance in part to the 
acquisition of ncnb texas which ncnb chairman hugh mccoll noted 
was completed four years ahead of schedule

a japanese legislator who created a firestorm 
with a book attacking america said thursday he is simply trying to 
spur a more honest debate between the worlds two economic 
superpowers 
shintaro ishiharas book entitled the japan that can say 
no is a runaway best seller in japan with 500000 copies 
sold while no authorized version exists in english bootleg copies 
translated by the defense department are creating quite a stir in 
washington 
in the book ishihara argues that japan needs to be more 
assertive in standing up to america in policy disputes he boasts 
about japans technological superiority calls americas military 
shield for japan an illusion and complains that americans behave 
more like mad dogs than watch dogs 
he dismisses american criticism of japan as racially motivated 
and suggests that unless america changes its tune tokyo might stop 
supplying the microchips the pentagon needs for accurate targeting 
of us nuclear missiles and sell them to the soviets instead 
such a decision ishihara speculates in his book would 
instantly change the balance of military power 
in an interview thursday ishihara did not recant any of his 
comments although he contended that the pirated version now in 
circulation in washington leaves out certai clarifying comments 
with japan accounting for almost half of americas 111 billion 
annual trade deficit efforts to stem the flow of japanese imports 
and boost us export sales are a prime topic on capitol hill 
ishiharas book is being cited by critics of japan as a prime 
example of japanese intransigence in dealing with trade problems 
during an interview ishihara said that relations between the 
united states and japan were in a transition phase in which japan 
needed to play a more assertive role 
we have come to a new era where a redefinition of the 
usjapan relationship is called for he said adding that he 
hoped his book would contribute to a franker discussion of the real 
issues between the two countries 
ishihara a member of the japanese parliament and one of the 
frontrunners for prime minister last year disputed contentions 
that his views were out of the mainstream citing the popularity of 
his book as proof that many japanese agree with his thoughts 
ishiharas book comes at a time when public opinion polls in 
both the united states and japan reflect a growing uneasiness 
americans now rank japans economic prowess as a greater threat to 
the united states than the soviets military might while a majority 
of japanese in a recent poll complained that the united states was 
unfairly pressuring japan on trade issues 
during his washington visit ishihara 57 a member of prime 
minister toshiki kaifus conservative liberaldemocratic party was 
meeting with members of congress and journalists promoting the 
idea of debates between japanese and american lawmakers 
he said he hoped to return to the united states after the 
japanese elections in february to hold the first of these debates 
he also plans to bring out the authorized english version of his 
book in april absent the portions in the japanese version written 
by sony corp chairman akio morita 
morita who wrote several less inflamatory chapters of the 
original book has said he regretted his collaboration and is 
refusing to participate in the englishlanguage edition 
rep sander levin dmich was one of the lawmakers who met 
with ishihara during his visit 
after the session levin whose district includes detroit said 
he was not optimistic that there will be any quick resolution to 
the trade problems separating the two countries 
he called ishiharas views a minority point of view but one 
which american policymakers need to take seriously and respond 
to it

about the only bright spot for troubled centrust 
savings bank in recent days has been the spotlights illuminating 
its 47story downtown miami tower 
just one day after announcing a 119 million fiscal year loss 
floridas biggest thrift on wednesday abandoned a proposal to merge 
with ensign bank a financially troubled institution led by cruise 
ship magnate ted arison 
now centrust is left with unbalanced books a 1 billion 
portfolio of highrisk junk bonds and the cost of operating 63 
branches it hopes to sell to a california thrift 
some analysts speculated thursday that federal regulators may be 
close to taking over the institution 
it looks to me that the time is growing nigh for federal 
regulators to take over the show said henry peltz a banking 
analyst at keefe bruyette amp woods in new york 
meanwhile state officials are preparing a hearing to seek the 
ouster of centrust chairman david paul who is blamed for 
encouraging the banks lavish and unorthodox spending which has 
included a 30 million museumquality painting collection a 
company yacht and huge salaries 
terrence mcelroy a spokesman for the florida office of 
comptroller said a hearing date has not been set centrust is 
appealing a dec 20 state order to remove paul who had a 48 
million salary from january 1988 to september 1989 
the proposed merger with new yorkbased ensign announced two 
weeks ago was seen as one of few options left by centrust to avoid 
federal takeover arison estimated to be worth 286 billion by 
forbes magazine was the deep pocket the thrift needed 
miamibased banking consultant kenneth thomas estimated centrust 
would need at least 200 million from arison or from privately held 
hamilton holding co ensigns parent before it could be 
considered solvent under current federal standards 
paul and arison have worked together on several arts projects in 
miami 
but the proposed deal was dropped following a chilly reception 
from federal regulators according to a statement from centrust and 
ensign 
analysts said federal banking regulators are discouraging 
mergers of troubled thrifts 
their theory is putting two troubled institutions together 
doesnt solve problems it just multiplies them said richard 
freeman at kemper financial services inc in chicago 
ensign which has 27 branches in metropolitan new york and 
florida was more than 140 million insolvent according to figures 
by sheshunoff information services in austin texas 
arison majority owner of miamibased carnival cruise lines inc 
and 50 percent of the national basketball associations miami heat 
could not be reached for comment thursday 
paul did not return telephone calls to his miami office but new 
yorkbased centrust spokesman roy winnick said no new plans are 
expected in the immediate future 
thomas said officials from the office of thrift supervision had 
enough evidence to take over centrust in december when regulators 
seized control of first american bank and trust in lake worth and 
city federal savings bank of bedminster nj which had extensive 
florida real estate holdings 
he estimates centrust could be spending more than 100000 a 
week on legal fees to fight the state order to remove paul and 
other federal court action concerning centrust spending 
in addition thomas predicts centrust could take another 100 
million loss this year from defaults and cutrate sales of its junk 
bond holdings 
centrust is seeking federal approval for a 150 million sale of 
63 of its 71 branches to great western bank of beverly hills 
calif but some analysts say it is doubtful regulators will allow 
centrust to lose most of its relatively healthy consumeroriented 
operations 
if centrust is valuable at all it will be whole not in 
pieces said thomas 
moodys investors service in december downgraded centrusts 
bonds and longterm deposits to among its lowest ratings and 
predicted federal intervention 
its a pretty negative situation said moodys analyst mara 
hilderman

the dollar rose sharply thursday against key 
foreign currencies in active trading as the market appeared more 
confident the federal reserve wouldnt cut interest rates any time 
soon 
gold prices declined after gaining overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery closed at 41020 a troy ounce down 230 from wednesday 
republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for gold at 
410880 an ounce off 210 
currency dealers said the dollar was bolstered by a report in 
thursdays wall street journal quoting two fed officials as saying 
they wouldnt support a cut in shortterm interest rates unless 
economic conditions changed 
firm interest rates tend to support the dollar 
both the officials manuel johnson a fed vice chairman and 
wayne angell a fed governor had led a move toward lower interest 
rates in recent months 
those statements were in contrast with sentiment from the white 
house which on thursday broke with its usual practice of not 
commenting on fed policy by suggesting current economic conditions 
justified rate cuts 
still ronald h holzer a vice president at harris trust amp co 
in chicago said with the inflation picture looking as bad as it 
does the market was anticipating that the fed had stopped easing 
these statements by johnson and angell confirmed it and brought 
out good buying for the dollar 
some dealers said the fed had tried to thwart the dollars rise 
thursday by selling dollars for yen but the market ignored that 
intervention 
also boosting dollarbuying interest thursday was the continued 
unrest in the soviet caucasus the dollar is often seen as a safe 
haven in times of political turmoil 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar closed at 14566 japanese yen up from late 
wednesdays 14552 the dollar traded at 14605 yen in london and 
at 14635 yen in new york up from 145395 yen 
the dollar was stronger against the british pound too sterling 
bought 16445 in london down from wednesdays 16525 and 
16435 in new york down from 165235 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late

petroleum futures prices ended mixed in volatile 
trading thursday as crude and heating oil bounced back from 
wednesdays losses 
on the new york mercantile exchange crude oil rallied after 
wednesdays steep declines the february contract for west texas 
intermediate the main grade of us crude oil rose 66 cents to 
2276 a barrel after a 68cent drop on wednesday 
march crude closed 33 cents higher at 2159 a barrel while 
april advanced 27 cents to 2097 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale heating 
oil for february delivery climbed 132 cents to close at 6184 
cents a gallon the contract lost 351 cents wednesday 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in february slipped 
071 cent to 6071 cents a gallon continuing its slide from the 
previous session when it lost 288 cents traders said gasoline 
was under pressure after excessive gains in recent sessions 
heating oil appeared to be stabilizing after recent losses 
analysts said heating oil futures had rallied sharply after 
decembers unseasonably frigid weather that delayed shipments and 
slowed refinery output in normally warmweather areas like texas 
and louisiana prices had receded in recent days as springlike 
temperatures knocked the punch out of the rally 
the warm weather is already built into the market so prices 
have stabilized said richard redoglio energy broker with 
merrill lynch energy futures 
futures prices fell broadly on wednesday largely in response to 
an industry report that showed a sharp rise in stocks of crude oil 
and refined products in the nations storage tanks 
analysts said thursdays rise in crude oil resulted from a 
combination of factors 
it might be motivated by the tight situation on goodquality 
crudes because of delays in brent loadings in the north sea said 
bob baker analyst with prudentialbache securities inc but it 
just might be a followup to the declines earlier this week

inflation increased modestly in 1989 to an 
eightyear high of 46 percent boosted by doubledigit price 
increases for dairy food eggs tobacco and fuel oil the 
government said thursday 
construction of new housing meanwhile plunged 76 percent last 
year to 137 million units the lowest level since the recession 
year of 1982 
in december consumer prices climbed a moderate 04 percent 
despite a sharp rise in fuel oil costs during the holiday cold 
snap the weather also prompted a seasonally adjusted 8 percent 
decline in housing starts from november to december the steepest 
in 10 months 
economists attributed both the relative stability of consumer 
price increases and a weak housing industry to the federal reserve 
boards tight money policy 
although the central bank has eased its grip on credit in recent 
months the bush administration quickly blasted a suggestion from 
federal reserve policymakers that interest rates will not fall 
again anytime soon 
these numbers indicate that inflation has remained very 
steady over the last seven or eight years and that lower interest 
rates are justified white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
in rare public criticism of the central bank 
the administration is counting on strong economic growth to 
bolster tax revenues and help it meet budget deficit targets 
but fed vice chairman manuel johnson and board member wayne 
angell in remarks published in thursday editions of the wall 
street journal suggested little prospect of another interestrate 
cut in the near future 
financial markets which have been spooked in recent weeks by 
inflation fears were mixed in volatile trading bond prices 
plunged while the dow jones industrial average after a 
rollercoaster ride closed at 266638 up 725 traders said the 
market was reacting more to disappointing corporate earnings 
reports and worry over interest rates than to the slightly 
betterthanexpected inflation news 
the 1989 rise in the labor departments consumer price index 
marked a modest acceleration over the 44 percent rates posted in 
1988 and 1987 still it was the steepest increase since 1981 when 
prices shot up 89 percent in a lingering aftershock from the 
doubledigit inflation of 1979 and 1980 
most economists expect inflation to hold steady or decline 
slightly in 1990 the relatively low unemployment rate at 53 
percent in december will keep wages rising and prevent a dramatic 
improvement they said 
what it boils down to ultimately is a political judgment 
said economist sandra shaber of the futures group a washington 
consulting company its a tradeoff between the degree of 
inflation and the degree of unemployment 
the labor department said in another report that americans 
inflationadjusted earnings were unchanged in december after 
falling 06 percent in november average weekly earnings were 
34081 in december up 32 percent from a year earlier but not 
enough to keep up with the rise in prices 
food prices jumped 56 percent in 1989 the steepest in nine 
years december food costs were up a moderate 04 percent 
dairy products rose a sharp 22 percent in december bringing 
the increase for the year to 103 percent the price of meat 
poultry fish and eggs rose 1 percent in december with much of that 
attributed to a 37 percent advance in egg prices which climbed 
354 percent for the year 
energy prices gained 51 percent last year driven up by a 195 
percent rise in fuel oil fuel oil increased 38 percent in 
december and a congressional committee is investigating allegations 
that oil companies used the cold weather as an excuse to grab 
profits 
gasoline prices which soared early in the year fell in six of 
the last seven months of 1989 including a 2 percent drop in 
december for the year they were up 65 percent 
natural gas prices increased 21 percent last month while 
electricity rose 08 percent 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors 
considered by many analysts to be the best indicator of underlying 
inflationary pressures in the economy rose 04 percent in december 
and 44 percent for the year a drop from 47 percent in 1988 
the cost of services the category most heavily influenced by 
wages rose 04 percent in december and 51 percent for the year 
new car prices rose 1 percent in december but for the year were 
up only 23 percent the cost of medical care rose 05 percent last 
month and 85 percent for the year 
clothing costs fell 07 percent in december the result of 
prechristmas reductions for the year they rose only 1 percent 
tobacco prices were up 2 percent last month and 147 percent for 
the year 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1261 in december that meant a hypothetical 
selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 198284 base 
period would have cost 12610 last month up from 12050 a year 
earlier

caterpillar inc thursday announced layoffs 
affecting 1200 workers in two states citing a 34 percent decline 
in fourthquarter profits and a 19 percent decline for the year 
industry analysts said the announcement was not worrisome and 
that caterpillar remains in strong financial condition 
caterpillar competitively is in better shape than its been in 
in the last 15 years said john mackin a machinery analyst for 
morgan stanley amp co in new york 
for the fourth quarter caterpillar reported net earnings of 
107 million or 105 a share down from 163 million or 161 per 
share in the yearearlier period 
the company blamed higher costs and smaller profits among its 
affiliates for the dip in profits 
fourthquarter revenue rose to 276 billion from about 266 
billion a year ago due to higher prices and a 16 million rise in 
its financial subsidiaries revenues the company said 
caterpillar which had difficult times in the early 1980s but 
made a strong comeback in the second half of the decade makes and 
markets large construction and earthmoving machinery 
for the year caterpillars aftertax profit fell to 497 
million from 616 million in 1988 revenue rose 7 percent to 
1113 billion from about 1044 billion 
caterpillar which employs more than 60000 worldwide said it 
would place 200 employees in aurora ill and york pa on 
indefinite layoff 
another 1000 workers at illinois facilities in mapleton and 
mossville would be idled by temporary shutdowns the company said 
twohundred indefinite layoffs is peanuts said alex 
blanton a machinery analyst for merrill lynch capital markets in 
new york frankly they might be laying people off because 
theyre getting more efficient 
caterpillar predicted federal reserve policy would push the 
us economy into a recession which in turn would diminish sales 
of some durable goods and equipment but said it remained positive 
about its outlook 
we remain very optimistic overall about caterpillar 
opportunities in the 90s said caterpillar chairman george 
schaefer 
merrill lynchs blanton said the company has not raised prices 
sufficiently 
the reason they arent raising prices is that they are 
scared to death there is going to be a recession therefore 
they are forecasting profits will remain under considerable 
pressure for the rest of the year 
my feeling is things are going to turn out a lot better than 
they expect blanton said

credit policy

its comfortable to enter the year with record backlogs

general instrument corp on thursday 
introduced an updated descrambling device aimed at helping 
satellite tv programmers protect their signals from pirates while 
giving viewers the chance to receive more channels 
piracy has been a major problem for the backyard satellite dish 
industry general instrument said its unit called videocipher ii 
plus was designed to make it more difficult for electronic tinkers 
to alter descramblers and receive signals from such services as 
home box office espn the disney channel mtv and showtime 
the new descrambler also will make it possible to increase the 
number of satellite channels offered to viewers by raising from 56 
to 256 the number of tier bits the devices can unscramble 
general instrument said tier bits are the encrypted data codes 
programmers use to secure their signals 
the new system also expands to 50 million households the 
potential satellite tv subscriber capacity the company said after 
showing the unit at a news conference in alexandria va 
company spokesman rick griffin said the new unit will not add to 
the cost of satellite dish systems and existing dish owners still 
may use their older descramblers 
but bob phillips chief executive officer of the 
washingtonbased national rural telecommunications cooperative 
said the older models will become obsolete if and when programmers 
decide to go beyond the current 56bit capacity which currently is 
filled with signals 
however phillips added that no programmers have announced plans 
to expand to the higher tierbit capacity 
the unit is a second generation of the videocipher ii 
descrambling system which is virtually the only descrambler 
legally available to the nations 27 million backyard satellite 
dish owners 
the older unit which is being used by 50 satellite programmers 
has been criticized for being easily defeated by video pirates 
there were too many pirates out there that were compromising 
the system griffin said in a telephone interview now we have 
an improved more secure type of scrambling technology 
phillips said general instrument has sold 14 million to 16 
million videocipher ii units but general instrument has activated 
only about 641000 of them the remainder of those sold presumably 
have been altered to steal signals phillips said 
theres a huge discrepancy there he noted 
the federal communications commission under orders from 
congress is considering establishing an universal encryption 
standard that would formally establish one type of descrambling 
device 
phillips said his organization which represents 550 rural 
electric and rural telephone systems thinks the fcc should 
regulate general instruments videocipher technology since it is 
the de facto standard in the industry

pfizer inc said thursday the strength of the 
dollar helped depress its net income by 59 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 despite a 92 percent increase in sales 
for the three months ended dec 31 the pharmaceutical companys 
net income fell to 1333 million or 79 cents a share from 1416 
million or 84 cents a share a year earlier 
fourthquarter sales rose to 149 billion from 137 billion 
the dollars strength against foreign currencies increased 
marketing expenses for new products and continued high research 
spending contributed to an 81 percent decline in net income for 
all of 1989 even though sales increased 53 percent pfizer said 
although these investment expenses will again be high in 1990 
the sales momentum of our new products is increasing chairman 
edmund t pratt jr said in a statement 
pratt said a new extended release version of pfizers procardia 
prescription drug for angina and hypertension tallied 40 million 
in sales in just three months on the us market the company 
expects to win us regulatory approval this year to sell another 
angina and hypertension drug norvasc which it currently sells in 
britain and ireland he said 
the dollars strength reduced sales by two percentage points and 
turned what would have been a modest growth in profits into a 
decline the company said 
a strong dollar makes us products more expensive and 
therefore less attractive overseas 
for the full year net income fell to 7273 million or 431 a 
share from 7913 million or 470 a share 
fullyear sales rose to 567 billion from 539 billion if the 
dollar hadnt risen in value last year sales would have been three 
percentage points higher and the profit decline would have been cut 
in half pfizer said 
the companys sales of pharmaceuticals increased 11 percent in 
the latest year while sales of hospital products rose 3 percent 
consumer products sales rose 12 percent specialty chemicals sales 
gained 6 percent and sales of animal health care products were up 9

a state appellate judge ruled thursday that 
previously confidential material on the merger of two accounting 
firms could be published 
judge george bundy smith invalidated the action earlier in the 
day of state supreme court justice beatrice shainswit who had 
refused to lift her temporary restraining order forbidding bowmans 
accounting report from publishing how ernst amp young partners will 
share profits and on other operations 
shainswit had said she would decide within a couple of days 
whether to allow bowmans to publish lawyers for several media 
immediately went to smiths court and successfully sought repeal of 
the order 
the appellate judges decision permits publication of the 
material and allows other news organizations access to sealed 
material said richard winfield of rogers amp wells representing the 
associated press and other media 
ernst amp young was formed last year after ernst amp whinney merged 
with arthur young to become one of the largest accounting agencies 
in the world the merged company has sought to prevent the release 
of the profit information contending it contained trade secrets 
the new york times published some of the confidential 
information thursday the times said the material shows ernst amp 
whinney partners take home roughly 65 percent of profits earned 
jointly with arthur young for the next three years while arthur 
youngs partners share the rest 
carl liggio lawyer for ernst amp young conceded the cat is out 
of the bag but said the times did not publish all of the 
material so continuing the restraining order was not meaningless 
but winfield and other media lawyers cited the pentagon papers 
case as an example of a decision prohibiting prior restraint on 
publication of a news story 
the times yesterday got a copy and yet there was this anomaly 
of the atlanta newsletter that was enjoined by an absolutely 
invalid order winfield said 
keegan federal a lawyer for bowmans argued earlier in 
shainswits court that such prior restraint is prohibited by the 
first amendment 
liggio admitted that the merger was a newsworthy event that 
should be covered but he said one could glean from the 30odd 
pages of leaked information trade secrets about how the firm 
operates and makes decisions 
the lawyer compared the accounting firms material to cocacola 
cos closely guarded softdrink formula and shainswits personal 
income tax returns he argued that these were things that could be 
restrained prior to publication 
liggio complained that bowmans had started a media feeding 
frenzy by passing word that it had been censored by shainswit on 
jan 8 the judge issued the order without letting bowmans know 
until after she had done it 
liggio asserted that ernst amp young was entitled to recapture 
that material which he said had been prepared for the eyes of 
partners only and which he suggested had been obtained illegally by 
news media 
how are you going to recapture it from the times shainswit 
asked 
liggio acknowledged there was nothing preventing the times from 
publishing the rest of the material which would make the court 
order moot 
federal who also referred to the newsworthiness of the merger 
noted that ernst amp young which has thousands of clients and 
operates worldwide issued numerous press releases containing 
revenue information 
the public has an interest in knowing whether those press 
releases were true or false federal said 
winfield of rogers amp wells submitted briefs and asked shainswit 
to unseal court records in the case 
the news organizations represented before you this morning 
have more than a general interest that there be no order upholding 
prior restraint in new york state winfield said 
shainswit had said she would rule on unsealing the records when 
she rules on the temporary restraining order 
the times account said the confidential documents showed ernst amp 
whinney was by far the stronger of the two firms and its partners 
historically outearned their peers at arthur young 
the times did not explain how it got a copy of the documents 
which also were leaked to accounting today a twicemonthly 
newsletter based in new york bowmans accounting report is barred 
from talking about the case 
editor robert crane of accounting today said wednesday he plans 
to publish the material in its feb 5 edition which is to mailed 
to subscribers jan 30 
the news organizations who joined bowmans in charging that 
shainswits order was an unconstitutional abridgement of press 
freedom include

federal regulators on thursday issued new 
guidelines designed to raise the quality of real estate appraisals 
a factor often cited as one of the causes of the savings and loan 
crisis 
under the sampl law passed last summer states must license and 
certify their appraisers by july 1 1991 if the states do not come 
up with a satisfactory plan their appraisers can be frozen out of 
working on many transactions financed by federally insured banks 
savings institutions and credit unions 
faulty appraisals that overvalued commercial properties are 
viewed as one of the chief contributors to bad loans that caused 
billions of dollars of sampl losses appraisers are supposed to 
independently value a property being sold but can be influenced by 
lenders and real estate agents on whom they depend for business 
critics say 
a subcommittee of the federal financial institutions examination 
council which coordinates standards among five federal regulatory 
agencies issued guidelines effective in 60 days which tell the 
states how to set up their certification process 
the rules encourage states to establish an independent 
regulatory agency answerable to the governor or a cabinetlevel 
officer to regulate appraisals the agency should be insulated 
from the banking and real estate industries which may have 
conflicting interests 
if budget constraints force a state to put appraisal regulation 
in the same office that governs real estate brokers different 
officials should make the decisions on whether to license 
delicense or discipline an appraiser the council said 
appraisers in states that have systems already meeting the new 
standards will not have to undergo recertification but appraisers 
in other states will 
what were trying to do is gain some consistency and integrity 
in the system said kevin blakely a deputy director of the 
office of the comptroller of the currency and chairman of the 
appraisal subcommittee 
norman flynn president of the national association of realtors 
praised the guidelines but said they should have been issued four 
or five months ago he said states will be hardpressed to get 
their systems ready to certify appraisers in time to meet the 
deadline 
were afraid the consumer is going to be standing in long 
lines trying to get an appraisal done thats not good business 
he said 
blakely said the deadline provides quite a bit of leadtime 
and said the law gives regulators power to extend the deadline to 
the end of 1991 if a state is making progress

managed health care joint venture owned by the equitable life 
assurance society of the united states and hospital corporation of 
america 
wilson h taylor chairman and chief executive of

would come from within corporate resources

equicor has a strong group insurance presence and a client list 
which includes a number of large fortune 500type accounts

450000 enrollees in 19 cities combines with cignas 15 million 
enrollees in 31 cities to bring the total to almost two million he 
said ten of the 19 cities covered by equicor are not currently 
served by cigna according to taylor

insurance business the merger of these two companies according to 
taylor will benefit both customers and shareholders 
there will be some reduction in the workforce taylor said

prevent those types of decisions until the deal is closed 
in 1988 cignas employee life and health benefits segment had 
premium and premium equivalents of 8 billion and after tax profits 
of 43 million while equicor had more than 5 billion of premium

assets of 56 billion are worldwide providers of insurance and 
related financial services products including health care

bankruptcy court filings by campeau corps 
retailers threaten pensions worth as much as 10 million for 
retired executives the company says 
the 525 affected executives make up less than 2 percent of the 
25000 retirees from federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp many of them worked for federated before 1953 when 
current pension plans were established 
another 25 signed individual employment agreements according to 
court filings retirees who signed such agreements typically earned 
100000 to 1 million annually 
those things are not protected in a trust because they were 
individually negotiated and payments stop in a chapter 11 said 
carol sanger a spokeswoman for allied and federated 
federated and allied filed for chapter 11 protection in us 
bankruptcy court monday citing 77 billion in debts much of it 
stemming from robert campeaus purchase of the chains 
it seems somehow wrong that people who worked hard for many 
years are now victims of mr campeaus takeover said former 
federated vice president james selonick who said he stands to lose 
tens of thousands of dollars 
our money which is a good many million dollars is being used 
to bail out federated and i think thats unreasonable he said 
ms sanger said other pensions life insurance and medical 
benefits paid by federated are protected in the bankruptcy

index 
the sudden surge of selling had an exaggerated effect on the 
market indices because trading was thin said a dealer at nikko
