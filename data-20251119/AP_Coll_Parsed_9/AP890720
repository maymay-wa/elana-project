the three apollo 11 astronauts had 
another splashdown thursday this time in the form of a party 
with thousands of nasa employees celebrating the 20th anniversary 
of their lunar landing 
astronauts neil armstrong buzz aldrin and michael collins 
arrived from washington where they had lunch with president bush 
twenty years ago i sat in mission control when these guys 
came down and i wouldnt miss this for the world said hans mark 
a former johnson space center director who is now chancellor for 
the university of texas 
the space center party was patterned after the informal 
celebrations that followed each apollo mission a crowd estimated 
at 10000 attended the event 
this is just like the splashdown party 20 years ago except 
then they threw everybody in the pool said cookie leisenring a 
former employee of the national aeronautics and space 
administration who was trying to take pictures of the astronauts 
collins aldrin and armstrong each got loud applause upon 
arrival 
separate outdoor areas were designated for different departments 
such as engineering and development and recovery crew inside a 
band played in a gymsized room decorated with starshaped ballons 
and blue balloons with the us flag on them 
mark said the astronauts were very pleased to return and visit 
with old friends many of those in the crowd wore buttons showing 
armstong on the moon and reading july 20 19691989 we were 
there 
on july 20 1969 armstrong and aldrin planted their footsteps 
on the moon while collins circled above in the spacecraft that 
later carried the three men back to earth the splashdown party is 
one of many events being helz2to commemorate that 
historic flight 
after the party the three former astronauts were to attend a 
private party where they would watch a light display on clear lake 
dubbed thousand points of light 
that celebration was to begin at 956 pm the moment 
armstrong stepped on the moon two decades ago when a group of 
boats simultaneously switch on strings of lights

the senate voted thursday night to open the 
door to supplying military aid to the noncommunist resistance 
forces in cambodia 
by a vote of 5939 it adopted an amendment by sen charles 
robb dva opening the way for president bush to make lethal aid 
available to the resistance forces allied with cambodias prince 
norodom sihanouk in order to stiffen their ability to resist 
the amendment is to a 46 billion state department 
authorization bill 
the senate earlier voted 971 for a more general amendment that 
held out the promise of substantial aid to a new cambodian 
government which is determined to prevent the return to power of 
the khmer rouge 
robb and other supporters of his amendment said it was essential 
to supply lethal aid because the united states has a moral 
imperative to bar the return of the khmer rouge 
that leftwing faction is blamed for the killing of more than 1 
million cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970s 
opponents of the robb amendment said opening the door to aid 
puts the united states on a slippery slope in southeast asia 
similar to the development of its involvement in the vietnam war 
the amendment similar to one already approved by the house 
does not specify the dollar amount of military aid or indicate what 
kinds of weapons would be supplied 
robb said it does not directly authorize military aid but does 
give the president the flexibility to ask authorization for it 
at a later time 
the senates action comes at a time when negotiations are 
opening in paris on the future of cambodia after the announced 
sept 30 withdrawal of the occupying vietnamese army 
the administration in my judgment needs that flexibility 
robb said by aiding the noncommunist resistance we advance the 
prospects for a successful outcome in paris but if we do nothing 
only heighten the prospects for a bloody civil war and the return 
of the khmer rouge 
but sen alan cranston dcalif told the senate military 
aid to the socalled noncommunist resistance would derail a 
fastmoving peace process that promises real hope 
sen robert c byrd dwva appealed in vain for the senate to 
take more time to consider the issue 
the president of the united states has not asked for one 
dollar in military aid he said i may vote for military aid 
when the president makes a request for it when he says this is 
what we need this is why we need it 
i say weve got time to consider this issue byrd said we 
dont have to vote for it at this hour of the night 
i stood on this floor when we slid into the war in vietnam 
byrd said i think we should let history give us some guidance 
before we take sudden action here and write a blank check for the 
president 
other senators disagreed and sen joseph lieberman dnj 
called the robb approach measured involvement 
this is our responsibility lest we be accused of forgetting 
the lessons of the first asian holocaust lieberman said let 
us do what is required to keep a second one from occurring

the house approved a 65 billion spending bill 
for housing space and veterans programs thursday but decided to 
cut funding for a controversial program at the department of 
housing and urban development 
the bill passed by a voice vote provides no new money for a 
hud program currently being investigated by four congressional 
panels and the justice department for fraud and mismanagement 
a hud inspector generals report alleged several former hud 
officials and republican party fundraisers including former 
secretary of interior james watt used political influence to get 
funding for projects on which they were highly paid consultants or 
developers 
we did not want to fund a program which is having such 
difficulty said rep bill green of new york ranking republican 
on the house appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for 
hud the veterans administration and independent agencies 
the bill also would reclassify all deputy assistant secretaries 
administrators and directors at hud and other agencies covered by 
the legislation as career positions persons now in these positions 
are political appointees of the president 
however it was funding for a planned space station on the moon 
and expanded us exploration that dominated debate on the bill on 
thursday the 20th anniversary of mans first lunar landing 
rep charles schumer dny attempted to transfer 714 million 
from the space station to veterans medical services pollution 
control and research and lowincome and elderly housing 
the space station is not the way to go to space it is the b2 
bomber of the space program said schumer 
schumer estimated the space station and a proposal by president 
bush for a manned mission to mars would cost 400 billion 
i am a believer in space technology said schumer but you 
cant have everything 
as we reach for the stars let us not forget those who live 
underneath them he added 
while schumers proposal might save money in the short term 
green warned that decreasing spending for space by small amounts at 
a time would drive the overall costs up 
the one thing that is going to drive the cost of the space 
station through the roof is to nickel and dime it said green 
schumer really saves a penny this year but he will be spending 
pounds and pounds in later years added green 
schumers proposal was defeated by a 291125 vote 
the house appropriations bill earmarks 165 billion of nasas 
122 billion budget for the space station the bill reduces the 
bush administration budget request for nasa by 1 billion 
the bill also provides 
151 billion for hud including 91 billion for assisted 
housing and 456 million to fully fund programs under the stewart 
b mckinney homeless act 
295 billion for the veterans administration including 820 
million for veterans medical care 
355 million for the consumer product safety commission 
54 billion for the environmental protection agency

crash and the 15yearold plane experienced complete hydraulic 
failure federal aviation administration spokesman fred farrar 
said

airport in chicago 
an inspection of the engine later revealed that a turbine blade 
had failed and broken free from the engines platform 
on sept 30 1988 the no 2 engine also reportedly quit 
operating at 16000 feet because of extensive high pressure and 
low pressure turbine damage the report said

the blade root due to an ailing edge crack the report said

a group that wants to improve the image 
of taverns in the states eastern panhandle elected a topless bar 
owner as president and he says his job hasnt been easy 
im not interested in getting publicity about the fact that i 
own a topless bar luckily it hasnt blown up in my face yet 
said cb butch pennington owner of the opequon hill lounge and 
president of the tricounty club and tavern owners association 
the association was created following an april gambling raid on 
33 bars in the panhandle in which police confiscated 70 illegal 
gambling devices including poker machines 
the biggest mistake that people have is that all you go into a 
tavern for is to drink and gamble pennington said thats just 
not so you go in to talk to people its like going into a friends 
house you relax and swap stories 
pennington said the owners were upset by the raid because the 
state supreme court previously ruled that poker machines are legal 
the group plans to lobby state and local government to improve 
business conditions for tavern owners 
we just want to show them that were in a legitimate business 
and like everybody else we deserve a fair shake pennington 
said we know more than just how to mix drinks there are some 
things we can do to help old folks children charities things like 
that

a nude sculpture got a second unveiling here 
when the arkansas arts center heeded a protest from the works owner 
and took down a cloth that had covered the piece 
townsend wolfe the centers director said tuesday the covering 
had been brought down after complaints were raised last week the 
sculpture had been draped on occasion at the request of visitors 
leading groups of children younger than about 12 he said 
foster goldstrom the new yorker who owns the work that is on a 
threeyear tour of the country said earlier this week he thought it 
was smallminded to cover up the sculpture and he planned to write 
the centers board of directors about the matter 
the artist john deandrea of santa cruz calif also had 
expressed his displeasure with the draping 
the work is a selfsculpture of deandrea seated in a chair 
looking at a nude woman 
michael goldstrom 14 son of the art collector and dealer 
called the arkansas gazette monday and said it was disrespectful 
even criminal to drape the sculpture 
who gives them the right to put that cover on the sculpture 
he said the board of directors obviously has no concept of the 
historical and artistic value of this work

a united airlines dc10 carrying 293 
people crashed wednesday in an explosive ball of fire and 
cartwheeled down a runway after the pilot tried to make an emergency 
landing at least 178 survived the crash officials said 
a fire official initially estimated 185 to 195 were killed in the 
crash but officials later backed off the figure we simply dont 
have an estimate we can rely on fire captain terry schmidt said 
at a news conference 
flight 232 from denver to philadelphia via chicago carried 11 
crew members and 282 passengers including three infants on laps 
said united spokesman lawrence nagin he said the three members of 
the cockpit crew survived the crash and were being treated for 
injuries 
dick bohs spokesman for gov terry branstad said 61 bodies were 
found the search for bodies at sioux gateway airport was suspended 
late wednesday due to darkness and was to resume thursday 
nagin said a list of the dead and survivors would be released as 
soon as possible he could not confirm the number of dead 
the plane crashed on an inactive runway at sioux gateway airport 
after circling for about a halfhour while pilots told passengers to 
prepare for a crashlanding survivors said the accident was one of 
the deadliest air disasters in us history 
the 15yearold plane had complete hydraulic failure before 
the crash just after 4 pm federal aviation administration 
spokesman fred farrar said the tail engine failed and this may 
have caused a hydraulic failure said bob raynesford another faa 
spokesman 
nagin said he did not know if hydraulic problems were a factor 
a passenger who rode same dc10 from philadelphia to denver on 
wednesday morning said the plane had been delayed in philadelphia 
because of technical problems 
ruth dinsmore of mount laurel nj said the plane began to 
leave the terminal at philadelphia international airport shortly 
after 10 am when everything sort of shut off 
mrs dinsmore said the pilot came on the pa system and said a 
little gizmo had gone wrong it was 15 minutes before it was 
fixed she said 
late wednesday city manager hank sinda said 185 people were 
taken alive to st lukes medical center and marian health center 
both in sioux city he said seven had died at the hospitals 
the search for bodies was difficult because they were scattered 
in a field of corn 4 feet tall rescuers continued to search the 
corn fields late wednesday 
dr romaine bendixen clinic commander of iowa national guards 
185th tactical fighter group said he was the first doctor on the 
scene about three minutes after the crash he had just landed in 
another plane 
he said the living were scattered among the dead 
in one group of six seats a woman sitting in the middle was 
barely injured her husband beside her was dead and two behind her 
were dead bendixen said 
he said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive 
survivor charles martz of castle pines colo said there was no 
panic after the pilot announced there was engine trouble then just 
before landing the pilot came on and said that this may be more 
than a rough landing so do the best you can to assume the crash 
preparedness position 
suitcases paper mail clothes unfortunately people were 
laying all over the runway said witness ed forst 
still some people walked away from the wreckage 
melanie cincala of toledo ohio a passenger on flight 232 said 
there was a fire on the plane and a fireball flashed past us 
the plane burst into flames after she got off she said 
we could see the plane tumbling down the runway said mark 
smith a witness who said he was working about 1500 yards from the 
site 
he said the plane broke into 15000 different pieces 
maj rick sorensen with the iowa air national guard said he had 
just landed his plane when the jetliner crashed 
shortly before touchdown the right wing began to dip or 
began to roll and the nose began to fall to a position of 
approximately 15 to 25 degrees right bank and possibly 10 degrees 
nose low he told cnn it was very apparent at that moment that 
he could not make a safe landing the only question would have been 
how disastrous a landing would it be it was a very disastrous 
landing 
sorensen said that while he was in the air he heard radio traffic 
from the pilot 
the suggestion was that he could turn only in one direction 
and he was not sure he could make the runway then he turned left 
and headed for the southwest runway and everything appeared to 
be somewhat about normal then the right wing dipped 
the plane bounced twice flipped into the air and we were 
sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke said 
cliff marshall of columbus ohio a passenger returning home from 
denver 
then god opened a hole in the basement and i pushed a little 
girl out i grabbed another kept pulling them out until they didnt 
come no more 
marshall said he thought he helped a halfdozen out and then he 
ran 
asked about a survivor who reported an explosion before the 
crash nagin said he knew nothing beyond the report and that talk 
about sabotage was only speculation 
at ohare international airport in chicago where the plane was 
due people waiting for flight 232 were in a room guarded by airline 
personnel and police a clergyman was in the room 
among the passengers of the plane were the two top officials of 
the continental basketball association a league spokesman said 
commissioner jay ramsdell 25 had not been accounted for early 
wednesday evening but deputy commissioner jerry schemmel was among

lavonne quirin of alta in buena vista county said she and her 
husband found what appeared to be the planes nose cone in a corn 
field at their seed corn business 75 miles from the airport 
the airport has two active runways each 9000 feet long which 
can accommodate a plane the size of a dc10 the area around the 
airport which is seven miles from downtown is crop land in corn 
soybeans and pasture with some trees 
the dc1010 was delivered to united in april 1974 routine 
inspections had been conducted on the plane nagin said 
no unusual weather was reported wind speeds were clocked to 30 
mph 
the nations worst air crash happened 10 years ago and involved a 
dc10

archaeologists have uncovered the bones 
of as many as four people in a mass grave near the reputed site 
where selfproclaimed cannibal alferd packers victims perished the 
scientists said wednesday 
the diggers who found the bodies of at least two men and 
possibly four on tuesday said they also found burlap and a green 
suspender clip holding remnants of brown cloth 
the cloth is most remarkable said archaeologist jim ayres 
it could help us put a date on things 
the scientists are part of an expedition formed by george 
washington university law professor james starrs who is looking for 
clues to the truth about what occurred on the snowpacked mountain 
ridge in 1874 
packer who formed a goldhunting party with five other men said 
the group became stranded on the ridge two miles south of lake city 
during a bitter winter 
packer the lone survivor wandered into what is now lake city in 
april 1874 
he told authorities that shannon bell a member of the group 
killed the other four gold seekers and that he was forced to kill 
bell in selfdefense packer said he consumed the remains of the 
five in order to survive 
he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 40 years in 
prison the case has been a topic of debate ever since 
the archaeologists findings indicated the mens bodies were 
wrapped in burlap and buried in a mass grave said walter birkby 
curator of physical anthropology at arizona state university in 
tucson 
the bones were in a jumbled mass forcing scientists to move 
slowly in uncovering them 
as the scientists worked in the dig site which starrs calls the 
bone zone residents and onlookers kept watch nearby 
ayres said the scientists would test the cloth suspender clip 
and other artifacts to estimate their age 
the scientific expedition began monday

president daniel ortega gave a 
fullfledged campaign speech on the 10th anniversary of the 
sandinista revolution knowing his governments performance in the 
next seven months is more important than all the triumphs and 
failures of the past decade 
ortega whose country has become the western hemispheres 
poorest promised better times ahead and said nicaraguans are better 
off today than before july 19 1979 when sandinista guerrillas 
marched victoriously into managua 
he called on president bush to dismantle the usbacked contra 
rebels most of whom are in neighboring honduras and even praised 
some opposition leaders who joined the sandinistas at the start of 
the revolution then left it feeling betrayed 
about 200000 people gathered at a huge plaza along the shores of 
lake managua on wednesday for a rally the highlight of otherwise 
lackluster 10th anniversary celebrations 
observers who have been at other anniversary celebrations said 
most of those attending the 90minute rally were either party 
loyalists or public employees afraid of losing their jobs if they 
didnt show up 
ortega who estimated the crowd at more than 300000 said the 
large number showed the sandinistas have at least that many votes 
assured for general elections set for feb 25 
the sandinista show of strength at the rally might scare the 
opposition into abstaining from the ballot ortega said 
but lets all be very clear about this they can take or 
leave the elections but there will be elections on feb 25 1990 
he said and they will be clean and honest elections like the 
ones in 1984 
in a 50minute speech ortega said his government is controlling 
inflation which is not smashing us as is happening in other 
countries 
inflation in nicaragua surpassed 20000 percent in 1988 but 
stiff austerity measures brought it down to a monthly rate of 12 
percent in june 
however the cost has been high the government has fired 35000 
public employees and tightened credit restrictions and public 
spending 
foreign aid has decreased a 10country european tour in april 
and may from which ortega hoped to get 250 million for the country 
to survive the year produced just 50 million 
nevertheless at the end of his speech ortega proclaimed today 
the people are better off than before 1979 
better days will come he added 
ortega did not elaborate and left the promises fluttering in the 
cool morning breeze from the lake 
he accused the united states of continuing its imperialist 
aggression against nicaragua by maintaining a commercial blockade 
and blocking credit 
the united states still hasnt decided to be respectful of the 
rights of the nations of the third world and of nicaragua 
if the president of the united states is for peace he 
should stop immediately his policy of war against the people of 
nicaragua and allow the contras to be dismantled from honduran 
territory 
most of the usbacked rebels are known to have moved to jungle 
camps in neighboring honduras after their leaders and the 
sandinistas signed a temporary truce in march 1988 contra bands 
still roam northern and central nicaragua and sporadic skirmishes 
still are reported 
ortega gave guarded praise to three members of the fivemember 
junta that took control after dictator anastasio somoza fled the 
country on july 17 1979 the three later left the junta leaving 
only ortega and current vice president sergio ramirez 
violeta barrios de chamorro a powerful symbol of upperclass 
unity with the sandinistas against somoza and now the leading 
contender for opposition presidential candidate resigned april 19 
1980 
she said the sandinistas goals were incompatible with her hopes 
for a democratic nicaragua 
ortega said wednesday that mrs chamorros decision not to accept 
conditions that the gringos wanted to impose on the junta was 
firm and courageous 
mrs chamorros family owns the opposition newspaper la prensa 
shut down several times during by somoza regime and again by the 
sandinistas it did not publish on wednesday

nineteen cities likely would be given 10 years 
to fix their ozone pollution problems while severely polluted los 
angeles houston and new york would have two decades according to a 
draft of president bushs clean air bill 
the multibilliondollar cleanup plan would set four new 
categories for cities with ozone problems severe serious 
moderate or marginal and require the most polluted communities to 
use the most stringent remedies 
the associated press obtained a draft of the proposal and then 
applied the latest available environmental protection agency air 
monitoring data to determine which cities would fall into the two 
most serious ozone pollution categories 
there could be some changes when new air quality information 
becomes available probably next month but epa officials said the 
number of switches should be small 
ozone is a highly reactive gas that irritates and inflames 
sensitive lung tissues this causes a host of adverse health 
effects including chest pains shortness of breath coughing 
nausea throat irritation and increased susceptibility to 
respiratory infections 
the current epa data would place these areas in the serious 
category for a 10year cleanup chicagogary ind 
cincinnatihamilton ohio hartfordnew britainmiddletown conn 
milwaukeeracine wis philadelphiawilmington deltrenton nj 
providencepawtucket rifall river mass atlanta baltimore 
baton rouge la beaumontport arthur texas el paso texas 
huntington wvaashland ky louisville ky portland maine 
san diego sheboygan wis springfield mass st louis and the 
district of columbia 
epa officials verified both the list of 19 areas that would be 
given 10 years to correct ozone problems and the three cities in the 
severe 20year cleanup category 
william becker executive director of the state and territorial 
air pollution program administrators the organization of state and 
local air pollution officials also said he did not expect many 
changes in the cities classifications 
bush is expected to submit the bill to congress as early as 
friday the top 80 metropolitan areas in the country and about 15 
rural areas are out of compliance with us clean air standards 
under current law 
the bush proposal is only one way of attacking the ozone problem 
and environmentalists and their supporters in congress are expected 
to push for their own proposals 
the epa estimates that nationwide ozone cleanup efforts would 
cost 5 billion to 10 billion a year through the year 2000 and 8 
billion to 12 billion a year afterward 
the bush administration legislation envisions the ozone cleanup 
as being financed largely by industries including petroleum 
automobile paint and ink producers many of the costs would likely 
be passed on to consumers 
the bill would order national measures including new controls on 
motor vehicle emissions hazardous waste facilities and smaller 
sources of pollutants such as consumer solvents oil companies would 
have to tighten volatility requirements for gasolines 
the severe and serious areas also would need to have 
stricter inspection and maintenance programs for motor vehicles 
capture emissions from refueling at the gas pump and epaordered 
controls on seven additional categories of industrial or commercial 
sources of pollution 
these areas would be required to reduce ozone emissions at an 
average rate of 3 percent a year for 20 years in the case of 
severely polluted areas and for 10 years for the serious areas 
the bush plan includes a series of existing and new penalties 
that could be imposed on areas that fail to comply with the law 
these steps which have been applied sparingly by epa include a 
moratorium on construction of anything that would increase 
pollution loss of federal highway funds restrictions on new 
drinking water hookups and withholding money to run clean air 
programs

the energy department faces more criminal 
probes of its nuclear weapons plants and mounting public pressure 
to close them unless it controls their environmental and safety 
problems federal auditors say 
in a report highly critical of department management the 
auditors said urgent action is needed to ensure that environmental 
laws are obeyed and the public is reassured that the government can 
reliably and safely run the weapons plants 
the report dated july 14 was made public wednesday by a house 
panel as a senior energy department official disclosed that a 
special group of experts from outside the department had been 
dispatched to a weapons plant in colorado 
leo duffy a special assistant to energy secretary james d 
watkins said in testimony prepared for a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee that the experts will attempt to verify the origin of a 
manmade radioactive element discovered at the rocky flats plant near 
denver the plant processes plutonium for weapons manufacturing 
scientists of the environmental protection agency have said it is 
possible the radioactive materials strontium and cesium were 
produced by an accidental nuclear reaction even though rocky flats 
operations do not include the splitting of atoms 
duffy said that while earlier energy department reviews of the 
radioactive material gave no evidence that a chain reaction had 
occurred watkins wants an independent study to help alleviate 
public concern regarding safety at this facility 
phil keif a department spokesman said the experts arrived at 
the site last week and are expected to report their findings by 
midseptember he said he had no other details 
duffy also disclosed that the fbi and the environmental 
protection agency have launched an investigation of alleged criminal 
violations of environmental laws at the feed materials production 
center an energy department weapons plant at fernald ohio 
duffys statement provided no details and the fbi and epa said 
they could not comment duffy did not present his remarks in person 
because the subcommittee hearing was interrupted before his turn to 
speak and it was not resumed 
the auditors report from the energy departments office of 
inspector general said the department is unable to ensure that its 
nuclear facilities including 17 major weapons plants in 12 states 
are meeting state or federal environmental standards 
thus it faces the possibility of facility shutdowns criminal 
prosecutions of employees and increased congressional constraints 
over internal operations the report said 
rep thomas luken dohio chairman of the subcommittee said he 
was shocked to learn that the department had no way of determining 
its own compliance with environmental laws he harshly criticized 
john c layton the inspector general for not finding this flaw 
earlier 
youre not a watchdog youre a lap dog luken said 
layton disputed the charge but later acknowledged that in 
hindsight it may have taken too long for his office to take a 
broad look at the environmental problems 
layton told luken he decided to take the unusual step of making 
public a flash preliminary version of the audit because of the 
urgency of the problems it identifies 
among the key findings is that the energy department is unable to 
solve environmental problems at its weapons plants because managers 
and other employees are not properly trained and are not fully 
knowledgeable about environmental law 
the report also said the department had failed to adequately 
oversee the work of the private companies that operate the weapons 
plants under federal contracts

negative political ads from independent 
advocacy groups are leaving voters with a bad taste in their mouths 
says sen ernest f hollings 
the election campaign of last fall hit a new low the south 
carolina democrat said wednesday in pushing for a new law to combat 
the effects of attack ads 
it left an odious trail with hit and run attacks misleading 
claims hidden players and a lack of discussion of the major 
issues he told the senate commerce communications subcommittee 
he noted voter turnout in the 1988 election was the lowest since 
1924 at just more than 50 percent saying the public has been 
turned off by virulent television spots that slash candidates 
without discussing substantive issues 
america knew more about willie horton than it did about either 
presidential candidate hollings said he was referring to ads 
attacking democrat michael dukakis for a massachusetts furlough 
program that freed a convict who later raped a woman 
political analyst curtis gans illustrated the level of political 
rhetoric by showing ads ranging from lyndon johnsons famous 1964 
antibarry goldwater message counting down to a nuclear explosion 
to one against sen james sasser dtenn in which a fidel castro 
lookalike lit a cigar with roll of american foreign aid dollars 
hollings has introduced a bill along with sens daniel inouye 
dhawaii and john danforth rmo to require broadcasters to 
provide free air time to anyone targeted by a negative ad from 
political action committees not connected with a candidate or 
political party 
the bill also would require candidates to personally appear in 
any ad that mentions his or her opponent 
the subcommittee is considering another bill by sens richard 
bryan dnev and bob graham dfla that would require political 
ad sponsors to be clearly identified on the air 
both bills are aimed mainly at pacs which under federal law may 
make direct campaign contributions of 5000 in a primary and 5000 
in the general election 
but special interests may spend unlimited amounts on campaigns as 
long it is done without the knowledge or cooperation of the 
campaigns and candidates that benefit from independent spending 
hollings said his bill would help make the playing field more 
level by giving those attacked the means to respond it in no 
way says to these independent parties that they cannot advertise 
he said 
he said the massive expenditures by the pacs 10 million on 
broadcast ads in 1986 have driven up the costs of campaigns as 
candidates take out their own ads to shoot back 
except at one point when hollings attacked sen mitch mcconnell 
rky for ads depicting bloodhounds searching for an absentee 
opponent the senators wednesday generally steered clear of the 
touchy subject of negative ads carried out by their colleagues 
several witnesses expressed first amendment concerns about the 
hollingsdanforth bill former republican sen charles mcc mathias 
of maryland and american civil liberties union counsel barry lynn 
said the bill would involve the government in content regulation of 
political ads 
sen john mccain rariz said since challengers naturally must 
attack the records of incumbents the hollings bill would 
dramatically restrict the challengers ability to wage a 
campaign

washington the pilots report of complete hydraulic failure 
just before a united airlines dc10 cartwheeled into the ground at 
sioux city iowa signaled he was losing control of the airliner 
officials say 
authorities said the hydraulic failure in the spectacular crash 
wednesday may have been triggered by an uncontained engine failure 
which would mean that engine parts shot out possibly into the 
fuselage 
officials in sioux city initially estimated that 185 to 195 of 
the 293 people aboard flight 232 were killed but officials later 
said they did not have a reliable estimate 
the pilot reported the loss of all of his hydraulic system 
which made it very very difficult to control that aircraft said 
federal aviation administration spokesman john leyden we know he 
had a real problem bringing the aircraft down and lining it up with 
the runway 
leyden said the planes wheels were down but little else is known 
about the amount of control the pilot had in the final minutes after 
he warned passengers to prepare for a crash landing 
we cant speculate on exactly how much control he had or what 
happened up there all we know is he had a very very difficult time 
controlling the aircraft said leyden 
the faa the airline pilots association united airlines and 
manufacturer mcdonnell douglas were all sending teams to assist in 
the crash investigation led by the national transportation safety 
board 
leyden said hydraulic failure would mean a loss of primary 
control over nearly every control surface on the widebodied 
threeengine airliner 
a planes hydraulic system helps push its wheels down opens and 
extends flaps to increase the lift of the wings it also governs 
other control surfaces of the airplane on the wings and tail and 
controls the brakes once the plane is on the ground 
failure of the system does not necessarily mean the pilot has no 
control but it could make it more difficult to stabilize the 
aircraft particularly in landing 
even with a hydraulic failure backup mechanical systems could 
have allowed some control over wheels flaps and other surfaces that 
control flight and landing leyden said but he and other aviation 
experts said manual control can be difficult 
some aviation experts said they doubted the complete system could 
have gone out 
i think we can say that we have a flight control problem but 
we did not have an airplane that was totally out of hydraulics or 
he wouldnt have been flying at all said john nance a pilot and 
aviation writer in seattle 
arthur wolk an aviation attorney and licensed transport jet 
pilot in philadelphia said complete hydraulic failure on a dc10 
should be impossible because of required backup systems 
investigators cited partial hydraulic failure as contributing to 
a may 1979 crash of a dc10 that killed 273 people seconds after 
takeoff from chicagos ohare international airport the engine on 
that plane tore off and somersaulted over the wing doing extensive 
damage to hydraulic fluid lines and electrical cables 
loss of hydraulics also was a factor in a 1974 crash of a turkish 
dc10 in paris that killed 346 people a buckling of the floor 
caused by decompression when a cargo door blew off severed hydraulic 
lines after that the control lines in dc10s were rerouted along 
the ceiling

organization of american states foreign 
ministers tentatively agreed to grant oas mediators an additional 
month to help promote a solution to the political crisis in panama 
but deferred until thursday a decision on other key aspects of a 
formal declaration 
the deliberations adjourned at 102 am edt thursday after 
negotiations that began wednesday morning at the colombian embassy 
a draft proposal calls for a transfer of power in panama on sept 
1 1989 and the holding of free elections in the briefest period 
possible these steps are to be carried out through democratic 
means and in conformity with existing internal panamanian 
procedures 
us and panamanian opposition representatives attending the 
meeting expressed disappointment with the proposal contending that 
it could be interpreted by panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
to his advantage 
their comments indicated that efforts to toughen the language 
would be made at the thursday session to bring additional pressure 
to bear on noriega 
addressing the meeting at oas headquarters in early evening us 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger issued a forceful 
appeal for decisive oas action to ensure the restoration of 
democratic rule in panama 
it is time to end the crisis in panama and the suffering of the 
panamanian people eagleburger said 
oas inaction would invite military leaders elsewhere in the 
hemisphere to oust elected governments he added 
he said that drug traffickers also would be encouraged if the oas 
refuses to meet the challenge in panama 
ecuadoran foreign minister diego cordovez a member of the 
mediating team said he believes two months of efforts by him and 
his colleagues have raised the possibility of a national accord 
leading to a restoration of democratic rule in panama 
he said the basis for his hope was the contacts in recent days 
between government and opposition leaders in panama aimed at 
reaching a solution 
cordovez was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a 
democratic outcome by sept 1 according to panamas constitution a 
new president must be sworn in by that date 
the possibility of a national accord was alluded to in a report 
the mediators submitted to the meeting wednesday the deadline for 
the mediation team 
some delegates felt that the discussions in panama could lead to 
a government of national reconciliation and most foreign ministers 
felt there was no alterative but to extend the deadline 
delegates were expected to extend the mandate of the mediating 
team until late august but there was disagreement over the precise 
date and other aspects of the final declaration 
opposition leaders in panama said wednesday they would not agree 
to any such proposal for a government of national reconciliation 
we are not going to betray the panamanian people we are not 
going to accept that junta even if they give it the name of national 
reconstruction said guillermo endara the opposition presidential 
candidate in may 7 elections 
intense giveandtake behind closed doors delayed the official 
opening of wednesdays meeting by about four hours after a public 
session lasting less than an hour the meeting was recessed as 
delegates continued behindthescenes efforts to reach a compromise 
on the wording of an official declaration 
the crisis was precipitated by the decision of panamas electoral 
authorities to annul the outcome of presidential elections may 7 
independent observers said the candidate opposed to noriega the 
head of the defense forces had won a landslide victory 
the oas on may 17 appointed its mediating team to promote a 
democratic transfer of power in panama it also blamed noriega 
for the grave events that occurred in connection with the 
elections a reference to bloody attacks on opposition candidates 
by government security forces 
there was strong sentiment in the oas particularly among some 
south american governments not to bring too much pressure to bear 
on panama 
the oas charter forbids interference in the internal affairs of 
member countries 
but the bush administration which has been a strong advocate of 
using maximum pressure to force noriega out has been saying the 
charter also lists democracy as the system of government that all 
member states should adhere to 
us opposition to noriega also was based on drug smuggling 
indictments handed down last year against him by two florida grand 
juries 
us officials also argued that oas credibility in the hemisphere 
could be preserved only by a strong stand against noriega 
opposition to noriega led the us senate to state wednesday in 
a provision added to a state department bill that it would not 
accept any nominee for administrator of the panama canal selected by 
him 
the treaty under which the united states will turn over the canal 
to panama calls for a panamanian administrator acceptable to the 
white house to be appointed next year by panama and confirmed by the 
senate

ringers are sounding everywhere in this 
picturesque northern black hills town where the 1989 world horseshoe 
tournament is being held 
iron clangs morning till evening as almost 1500 people from the 
united states and canada compete in the pastime thats enjoying new 
popularity because president bush enjoys it and even plays at the 
white house 
horseshoe contestants sporting colorful lettered shirts similar 
to those bowlers wear are everywhere in this town of about 5000 
people motels are full and many players and their families are 
staying in cities as far as 40 miles away 
the twoweek tournament features 73450 in prize money 
its an oldtimers sport thats having a new revival said 
bob champion publicist for the national horseshoe pitchers 
association 
the 16000member group has grown considerably in the past few 
years he said 
theres a pitcher in every town someplace champion said 
anybody can get into it regardless of how old you are 
horseshoe pitching originated with soldiers in ancient greece who 
used discarded horseshoes for sport imitating discus throwing at 
the olympian games more than 30 million people now pitch horseshoes 
in tournaments or in city parks and backyards according to the 
organization 
although the average age of horseshoe pitchers is about 45 
entrants in the tourney range from 7 to 88 said gene ficek a 
spearfish resident and horseshoe player who helped organize the 
event 
the sport is relaxing and tosses together a good mix of 
camaraderie and competition ficek said but he said horseshoe 
pitching at the tournament level can be physically grueling 
in a tournament youll probably walk 2 miles and throw a ton 
of iron ficek said 
horseshoes weigh either 2 pounds 8 ounces or 2 pounds 10 
ounces ficek said they are tossed 40 feet by men and 30 feet by 
women and those under 17 
ficeks wife yvonne who also throws horseshoes said the 
competition sometimes gets tense especially if you need that last 
ringer to win and they keep topping every horseshoe you put on the 
stake mrs ficek said 
a ringer when the points of a horseshoe encircle a steel stake 
in a clay or sand pit counts as 3 points one point is awarded when 
a horseshoe lands within 6 inches of the stake 
two people compete in a game by throwing two horseshoes each to 
the other end of the court they then walk to the stake and tally 
points before repeating throws to the opposite pit the first to get 
40 points is the winner 
ted traversie 70 said he took up the sport 15 years ago when 
his doctor urged him to get some exercise he said he practices 
three hours daily 
you cant teach nobody how to throw a horseshoe traversie 
said it has to feel natural to you 
traversie said he was disappointed that bush who was invited to 
attend the championship event couldnt make it 
he should have at least showed up and throwed a couple of 
shoes traversie said

william lucas could face more grilling on his 
nomination to be the nations civil rights chief as the senate 
judiciary committee seeks to resolve questions about his fitness for 
the job 
there are a lot of charges against him we need to get to the 
bottom of them sen howell heflin dala said wednesday after 
lucas was questioned for more than three hours about his views his 
qualifications and his character 
lucas defended both his commitment to the drive against 
discrimination and his actions when customs inspectors found 8800 
worth of undeclared goods in his luggage 
afterward sen paul simon dill who chaired the proceeding 
said members reserved the right to recall him for more questioning 
heflin told reporters lucas should be questioned again about a 
number of issues including the fact that the black republican from 
michigan made misstatements on a sworn application to be admitted to 
the new york bar in 1981 
lucas did not disclose on the form that he had once failed the 
district of columbia bar examination when asked if he had taken the 
test in other states 
lucas testified that when he filled out the 1981 form he 
interpreted the question to pertain only to any previous 
applications to the new york bar there was no intent to 
mislead he said 
several democrats on the panel questioned whether lucas a 
lifelong democrat who became a republican in 1985 had the legal 
credentials and commitment to assistant attorney general for civil 
rights 
it remains to be seen whether mr lucas is the right man for 
this important job said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
if a case is brought to me involving a cross burning on the 
lawn of a citizen believe me this is not just cold facts to me 
said lucas 61 who was sheriff and later chief executive of wayne 
county mich which includes detroit 
i have been there i have smelled the smoke lucas said 
lucas defended a series of recent supreme court decisions that 
civil rights lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination 
cases in federal courts 
lucas echoing a pledge by attorney general dick thornburgh said 
he would monitor the impact of those decisions on discrimination 
suits and push for legislation if the rulings thwart civil rights 
enforcement 
but sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he was troubled by 
lucas defense of the recent high court rulings adding ive been 
around long enough to know time slips away 
metzenbaum also questioned lucas about why he was fined 594 by 
the us customs service in 1985 for failing to declare 8884 worth 
of merchandise the lucas family brought back from a trip to the far 
east 
how do you explain concealing receipts and merchandise from the 
customs inspectors metzenbaum said reading from an april 24 
1985 report of the incident at the seattle airport 
the report said there was a deliberate effort by all family 
members to conceal goods and receipts 
lucas explained that customs agents found several pieces of 
undeclared jewelry in a cosmetics case carried by one of his 
daughters who accompanied him on the business trip to south korea 
and japan 
lucas said he reported 4800 worth of merchandise relying on 
what his wife and two daughters told him they had bought 
i reported exactly what i was advised of i did not personally 
examine any of these things lucas said 
lucas said he discussed the incident with fbi agents who 
investigated his background before his nomination by president bush 
as well as with committee staff members 
justice department spokesman david runkel called the customs 
violation pretty minorleague stuff 
our feeling is that he had a very strong appearance today 
answered any and all questions put before him by the committee 
runkel said we are ever more confident that hell be confirmed 
sen orrin hatch rutah calling lucas a takecharge guy who 
gets things done who does whats right vowed to fight hard for 
his senate confirmation

from the tiniest city council chambers to the 
meeting rooms of congress elected officials around the nation have 
discovered a threat to the environment in front of their very noses 
coffee cups 
not just any coffee cups but those made of plastic foam the 
stuff that keeps hot things hot and cold things cold and protects 
those billions of mcdonalds hamburgers 
increasingly local governments are banning the use of such 
products on grounds that they contribute to the nations overflowing 
garbage crisis and contain chemicals that harm the earths ozone 
layer 
such bans are easy and politically popular some experts say they 
also may be misguided and pointless 
the concern for the ozone layer is now largely moot in a quiet 
revolution that has taken place during the past 15 months the 
plastics industry has phased out most of the ozonedepleting 
chlorofluorocarbons that were used to manufacture plastic foam 
the other concern landfill comes closer to the target but 
environmentalists and plastics industry officials argue its 
pointless to ban plastic foam products when they are usually 
replaced by cardboard or plasticcoated paper 
neither are being recycled and both are going to take up the 
same amount of space in landfill said jeanne wirka a spokeswoman 
for the washingtonbased environmental action foundation the 
problem is really a trend toward disposability 
more than a dozen cities and counties have enacted bans on the 
use of disposable foam products made of polystyrene a tough 
flexible plastic in congress a bipartisan group of house members 
has asked for the removal of polystyrene cups from the congressional 
restaurant system 
private companies are getting into the act too pacific 
telephone recently banned use of plastic foam in its company 
cafeterias and the yosemite park and curry co the private 
concessionaire at yosemite national park decided last year to phase 
out plastic foam containers 
the severity of the bans varies widely tempe ariz banned the 
use of foam cups and plates in city offices only while suffolk 
county ny ordered stores throughout the county to stop selling 
food in polystyrene or polyvinyl containers that ban has been held 
up by a court challenge 
in one of the most comprehensive ordinances the city councils of 
minneapolis and st paul minn voted earlier this year to ban 
nondegradable nonreturnable nonrecyclable packaging 
in the latest action the irvine calif city council voted 
tuesday to ban use of all plastic foam made with chlorofluorocarbons 
cfcs as part of a larger ordinance to halt all use of the 
ozonedepleting chemical 
two years ago a ban like irvines would have had a dramatic 
impact but because of changes in technology the plastics portion 
of the ordinance is likely to go unnoticed by food buyers 
under pressure from government and environmentalists the 
plastics industry began producing a new type of plastic foam in 
april 1988 made with a modified version of cfcs most of the new gas 
breaks down in the lower atmosphere sparing the ozone layer in the 
upper atmosphere from about 95 percent of the damage wreaked by cfcs 
by the end of this year all plastic foam food service products 
such as plates cups and egg cartons should be made entirely 
without ozonedamaging cfcs according to spokeswoman nancy sherman 
of the foodservice and packaging institute 
the transformation earned plaudits from the federal government 
and grudging support from environmental groups but the debate over 
disposal continues 
a plastic cup may have a useful life of five minutes but some 
scientists believe it could take as long as 500 years to decompose 
recent research however has shown that while plastic takes 
longer to degrade paper lasts so long in landfill that the 
distinction is meaningless 
one solution is recycling which the plastics industry insists is 
its goal seven plastics manufacturers announced recently a 14 
million program aimed at recycling 25 percent of all disposable 
polystyrene products by 1995 
mcdonalds has begun experimental recycling programs at 
restaurants in the new york city borough of brooklyn and in 
portland ore an initial evaluation of the portland program 
indicated it was effective 
we want to eliminate what goes into the solid waste stream and 
not just substitute one substance with another said mcdonalds 
spokeswoman linda fontana 
these projects encourage some environmentalists to the degree 
that we can turn styrofoam into a truly recyclable material i 
think that will largely alleviate in my mind the concerns 
associated with plastic said richard denison a senior scientist 
with the environmental defense fund

in new jersey 905 farmers collected federal 
1988 drought benefits totaling more than 171 million an average 
of about 18925 each 
eight farmers in arizona got 132836 from the agriculture 
department under last years drought aid program an average of 
about 16600 apiece 
most payments however averaged far less than those examples 
according to financial reports released by the departments 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
nationally a routine ascs report showed recently approximately 
378 billion was paid to 789707 farmers under the disaster 
assistance act of 1988 payments by state were listed but the 
numbers of farmers in each state were not 
the agency provided supplemental information including a 
breakdown of the number of farmers by state at the request of the 
associated press a sampling of state averages including the top 
five states was computed by the ap 
karen kostoff of the agencys information resources management 
division said wednesday the numbers of farmers listed by state would 
not add up to the national total 
that is because if a farmer has property in two states for 
example each will show up in the state figures she said 
nationally however the farms under the same ownership are counted 
as a single unit 
most of the producers nationally 709222 as of june 30 
benefited because of crop losses due to last years drought with 
some also collecting under other provisions of the program such as 
livestock feed benefits 
the national figures showed that more than 33 billion of the 
378 billion paid out so far was for crop losses 
on an overall basis of total benefits north dakota led the 
nation with about 407 million received by 49144 farmers an 
average of 8280 each 
wisconsin was second with nearly 396 million going to 52285 
producers who averaged 7490 each 
third was illinois where 98775 farmers averaged 3830 each for 
a total of 3788 million 
iowa was fourth overall at 3265 million an average of 4520 
to each of 72169 farmers 
minnesota was fifth with more than 311 million averaging 5450 
among 57083 recipients 
in all farmers in the five states collected about 182 billion 
under the 1988 drought program accounting for 48 percent of the 
total 
the state with the smallest number of drought aid recipients was 
alaska where the report showed one farmer collecting 6640 from 
the government rhode island showed two farmers but they got only 
4282 an average of 2141 
california traditionally the leader in terms of agricultural 
sales value got about 208 million in drought assistance an 
average of 7260 among 2864 farmers 
in some of the smaller eastern states where farms often produce 
highvalue specialty crops the averages were relatively high in 
connecticut for example 58 farmers averaged 11453 each for a 
total of 664300 
kansas where winter wheat farmers suffered greatly this year as 
the 1988 drought lingered got 614 million in aid an average of 
1740 for each of the 35255 farmers who got benefits 
here are the 1988 drought payments as of june 30 by state as 
reported by the departments agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service state payment averages however were not 
included 
the first column of figures is the number of producers for each 
state the second column rounded in thousands of dollars is the 
total amount paid hawaii was omitted by the agency

the freedom of information act gives foreign 
competitors unique access to us technology and an energy 
department official suggests restrictions might be needed to stem 
the flow 
the governments role is to make sure that us industry has 
the initial opportunity to develop ussponsored research 
richard h williamson deputy assistant energy secretary for 
international affairs said wednesday 
the freedom of information act has granted foreigners 
unique access to our technology he said 
williamson and kenneth s pedersen of the national aeronautics 
and space administration told the house subcommittee on 
international scientific cooperation they support restricting the 
foi law to limit foreign access to information where it could hurt 
us competitiveness 
the panel was considering how foreign access to us science and 
technology compares to us access to foreign technology 
pedersen and williamson conceded that providing exemptions would 
be difficult 
it is an effort to balance two very important objectives 
pedersen said 
nasa he said wants to continue to provide access without giving 
foreign competitors an edge he proposed giving certain technology 
to us industry for a specified time before making it available for 
general release 
we arent looking for an openended authority pedersen said 
were trying to get a door on the barn before too many horses 
leave 
george p millburn of the defense department which already has 
some foi exemptions told the subcommittee the pentagon supports the 
nasa and doe requests 
deputy secretary of commerce thomas murrin said the united states 
wants to support foster and encourage the exchange of 
scientific and technological information 
but he and others testified that the united states is often 
shortchanged in such exchanges 
many of our scientists and engineers are still subject to what 
is known as the not invented here syndrome which makes those 
afflicted by it undervalue the importance of research performed 
elsewhere murrin said 
the japanese on the other hand eagerly seek new scientific 
and technological knowledge from any source he said

the nations worst aviation disaster occurred 10 
years ago when an american airlines dc10 crashed on takeoff from 
ohare international airport 
on may 25 1979 flight 191 lost an engine banked sideways out 
of control and slammed into a field exploding into an inferno the 
furrow plowed in the field by the jetliners left wing is still 
visible 
the jetliner was reduced to scattered debris all 258 passengers 
and 13 crew members were killed as were two people on the ground 
to this day its something thats hard to comprehend how a 
big plane like that could disintegrate into little pieces said 
ray devito of mokena who had driven his girlfriend to airport to 
catch the illfated los angelesbound flight 
wednesdays crash in sioux city iowa is the first major 
domestic accident involving a dc10 since the chicago disaster a 
decade ago 
the national transportation safety board laid the primary blame 
for the 1979 crash on the airline citing maintenanceinduced 
damage a 10inch crack in the engine mount that caused the 
left engine to tear loose it also criticized mcdonnell douglas 
design as vulnerable to maintenance damage 
the ntsb also said the federal aviation administration had been 
remiss by not learning that a similar crack had recently been 
repaired in a continental airlines dc10 
since the accident the faa has been very specific about what 
has to be reported to us and what doesnt spokesman fred farrar 
said last spring 
elaine bendell a spokeswoman for mcdonnell douglas in long 
beach calif said the only change made in the dc10 pylon design 
was a shift to flathead rather than raisedhead bolts

a house chairman wants defense secretary dick 
cheney to authorize independent tests of special switches used to 
detonate us missiles following reports that the manufacturer 
failed to test the product 
in a letter to cheney released wednesday rep john dingell 
dmich said the company also worked on the switches with equipment 
which had not been inspected calibrated or tested for conformance 
with accepted criteria for up to seven years 
dingell cited the findings of the defense criminal investigative 
service which investigated printed wiring boards also known as 
stator switches manufactured by asher engineering 
the service found that from 1982 to the present the switches were 
not tested in accordance with military guidelines and failed to meet 
specifications dingell said in the letter 
the subcontract awarded to asher engineering was for production 
of stator switches for the phoenix aamram standard sidewinder 
sparrow maverick harpoon and harm missile systems 
without working stator switches these missiles will not 
detonate dingell said 
the chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations called on cheney to authorize spending 
for independent tests of the switches 
the subcommittee is concerned that the devastating impact of 
not continuing to use asher stator switches and the possible recall 
of seven years worth of missile production will create tremendous 
pressure within the system to use the substandard or defective 
components dingell said 
a woman who answered the telephone at asher engineering in 
baldwin park calif said no one at the company could comment on 
the letter 
the pentagons deputy assistant inspector general in an memo 
april 20 said the untested switches could present a serious 
hazard to both the missile system and to national security if found 
to be faulty 
in the memo daniel r foley also said investigators havent 
determined whether the switches were used on other weapons systems 
the navy avionics center performed a quick audit of asher in may 
1989 and concluded it is evident from the samples that the 
manufacturer used different processes on the same type boards and 
had poor process controls 
the navys director of reliability maintainability and quality 
assurance in a july 10 1989 memo said there is not sufficient 
technical justification for using these circuit assemblies in such a 
critical application

former housing secretary samuel pierce will 
testify at least twice more before a congressional panel 
investigating scandals in programs under his stewardship at the 
department of housing and urban development 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the subcommittee said 
wednesday that pierce will return in the fall to discuss 
contradictions between his earlier testimony and witnesses 
statements that he was directly involved in approving questionable 
hud projects 
pierce had already agreed to return to the house government 
operations employment and housing subcommittee aug 3 to answer 
questions about a 15 million north carolina project headed by a 
former law partner of pierces 
pierce told congressional investigators in may he was not 
directly involved in funding decisions in many of huds programs 
which have been criticized for alleged influencepeddling and 
mismanagement during his eightyear tenure 
but shirley mcvay wiseman former assistant for housing 
testified friday that pierce personally ordered her to approve 
funding for the project in durham nc 
lantos said staff members for the panel met with pierce on 
wednesday 
there was no discussion with respect to the substance of his 
statements lantos said that would have been inappropriate 
it was a relaxed lengthy cordial and productive meeting he 
said 
lantos said the panels questions next month would be limited to 
pierces role in funding the north carolina project to convert a 
defunct hosiery mill to housing for the elderly the project was 
pushed by a former pierce law partner 
hud staff members had opposed government funding because the 
project was too expensive and its location on top of a toxic waste 
site made it environmentally unsafe 
because of huds approval developers received more than 113 
million in rent subsidies a 23 million urban development action 
grant and more than 3 million in tax credits 
pierce also agreed to return to discuss a range of issues in 
september or october said lantos 
the chairman said he could not predict when the panels 
investigation would end only that it was certain to continue into 
the fall 
the hud crisis is an ocean without a shore said lantos

a retired pilot who investigated the downing of 
korean air lines flight 007 says the crew of the illfated flight 
radioed false position reports as he 1500 miles into soviet 
airspace before being shot down 
frank houston of seattle told a disbelieving kal attorney 
wednesday that a crew member probably misprogrammed one of the three 
computerized navigation systems aboard the jet before the boeing 747 
took off from anchorage alaska 
the pilot copilot and flight engineer ignored numerous other 
plane instruments and navigational aids on the ground as they flew 
300 miles off their assigned course houston testified in the second 
day of the civil trial 
all three of them disregarded all those instruments asked 
marshall turner an attorney representing the airline 
thats about what im telling you yes replied houston who 
worked with an international team that investigated the sept 1 
1983 shootdown that killed all 269 people aboard 
the families of the passengers are trying to prove willful 
misconduct by kal alleging the planes crew knowingly continued off 
course because they would have had to turn back and face 
disciplinary action to correct the problem 
turner noting improperly set instruments would have told the 
crew they were 300 miles from the airport while they were still on 
the ground asked whether the crew then reported false position 
reports during the flight 
i am sure of it replied houston 
turner then asked the question that has been central to the 
flight 007 mystery since a soviet fighter jet shot the plane out of 
the night sky why didnt the crew merely turn left and get out of 
soviet territory 
thats what boggles our mind why didnt they said houston 
turner said houstons conclusion that plane spent its last three 
hours in soviet territory sheer speculation 
but the available radar data for the initial part of the flight 
and information provided by the soviets and japanese governments 
shows that airplane was well right of course said houston 
there is mountains of evidence and its irrefutable 
the crew thought they could sneak through russia asked us 
district court judge aubrey robinson 
houston said the pilot probably concluded i think ill take a 
shot at it 
the pilot may have believed he could get away with it and he 
damn near did said houston

a teenager who won a nevada beauty contest 
lost her court bid to compete in the miss teen usa pageant after she 
was disqualified for competing in two states 
us district court judge roger foley said wednesday that miss 
nevada teen heather anne mcleod should have realized that 
competing in preliminary teen pageants in nevada and california 
could disqualify her 
she should have known the rules foley said 
the 5foot8 greeneyed blonde said she was disappointed but glad 
to have had her day in court which was attended by about 10 high 
schoolage boys 
i respect the judges decision and we knew it was a gamble from 
the beginning miss mcleod said you win some you lose some 
life goes on 
i just hope this doesnt happen to another girl because the 
rules just arent clear i was doing everything honestly 
she and her attorneys havent decided yet whether to pursue 
200000 in damages against miss universe inc 
miss mcleod 18 who lives in reno with her parents but had 
attended college in california contended she didnt have a copy of 
the rules forbidding competing in two state contests the same year 
she also said she was encouraged by operators of both state 
pageants owned by miss universe inc to enter affidavits from the 
operators show they did encourage her to compete and werent aware 
she could be disqualified 
stacey bentley 18 of las vegas who was the first runnerup in 
the miss nevada teen contest will continue to represent nevada in 
the national pageant in san bernardino calif the finals are 
tuesday 
following an anonymous telephone tip miss mcleod was 
disqualified from the miss teen usa pageant june 30 eight days 
after winning the nevada pageant in las vegas she lost the 
california contest in april 
no testimony was allowed in the case but miss mcleod said in an 
affidavit she didnt understand that competing in two states was 
prohbitited 
she said the california pageant application didnt bar competing 
in more than one state and the nevada application was vague just 
asking whether she had participated in another state contest 
her attorney carvel sims of baton rouge la said miss mcleod 
never said she was a current resident of california but only that 
she had attended the university of california at san diego 
sims said miss mcleod moved to reno with her family in august 
1988 when she was still 17 and considers nevada her home state 
the judge agreed with kristina pickering the attorney for miss 
universe inc who argued it was apparent from the applications that 
miss mcleod knew she must be a resident of each state to compete 
she wrote her own ticket into this mess and now shes asking 
this court to bail her out ms pickering said

children await her with bunches of 
flowers crowds follow her slavishly shout her name and seek 
handshakes scores of undercover police officers trail her 
protectively as she traverses the campaign trail 
takako doi the charismatic leader of japans once lightly 
regarded socialists is getting something that few politicians from 
her party have had superstar treatment 
to be honest i never imagined she would become this popular 
three years ago said sukio iwatare a party official and veteran 
lawmaker as ms doi spoke wednesday to a crowd in kohriyama in the 
northern fukushima prefecture 
i think it is nothing but her lovable personality that led to 
this doi fever it is amazing that she can easily draw thousands of 
people everywhere she goes 
pollsters and analysts say a new sales tax and an 
influencepeddling scandal have turned voters against the liberal 
democratic party the conservative group that has dominated japanese 
politicans for 34 years 
womens groups also have criticized new prime minister sousuke 
uno after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses 
ms dois popularity is expected to make the socialists the main 
beneficiaries of voters ire in sundays elections for half the 252 
seats in the upper house of parliament 
her party the largest opposition group in parliament hopes to 
increase its representation in the chamber from 43 to at least 65 
pollsters say the liberal democrats likely will fall from 142 seats 
to fewer than 120 
three years ago ms doi became the first woman to head a major 
japanese political party her predecessor had resigned over the 
laborbacked partys defeat in japans last national elections 
since then the 61yearold ms doi has moved the party away from 
doctrinaire leftist ideas 
on wednesday about 3000 people packed the parking lots in front 
of kohriyamas railway station as ms doi campaigned for the partys 
local candidate some watched from balconies of nearby department 
stores 
it is time to bring changes in politics ms doi called out 
from the top of a campaign truck 
after a pause for cheers she added give us a chance to run 
the government we can do it we can make tomorrows japan better 
together 
the candidate choei aita a 60yearold former labor union 
official challenging two ruling party incumbents said ms doi 
talks about specific policies but she makes it so easy to 
understand for ordinary people 
he added that her speech gave him a very good feeling about 
winning sunday 
if the opposition were to win control of parliaments more 
powerful lower house in elections that dont have to be held before 
next year ms doi could become japans first woman prime minister 
though there are many more hurdles to be cleared the 
opposition camp never had such a golden opportunity to take over the 
government before said takayoshi miyagawa president and noted 
political analyst at seiji koho center a prominent research firm 
and if the opposition actually takes over the government the 
head of the largest party in the opposition camp would naturally 
become prime minister he added 
the opposition however has been criticized for concentrating on 
criticism rather than presenting alternative policy proposals 
doi emphasizes that her party would not bring make drastic 
changes if it gained power 
continuity is important in politics she told a news 
conference after her speech it is wrong to think we were trying 
to bring drastic changes to this country 
the liberal democrats say the socialists would take such steps as 
scrapping the usjapan security treaty ms doi said her party 
would not unilaterally abandon the pact

the house ways and means committee badly split 
by disagreements over catastrophic health insurance and capital 
gains is having no trouble boosting federal aid to lowincome 
working parents with children 
a bill whose chief goal is cutting the federal deficit has been 
fattened to include 16 billion in direct credits and 
stateadministered grants to help parents pay expenses of child care 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the committee hailed 
the child care package as a giant step forward noting the bush 
administration disagrees with some of the provisions he called on 
the administration to commit itself to its campaign promise and do 
something for children 
the child care plan was added to the bill on a 2610 vote 
wednesday after the panel was unable to settle disputes over capital 
gains and catastrophic insurance for older americans 
bush has called for a cut in the capital gains tax which applies 
to profits from the sale of stock and other assets on grounds it 
would spur the economy and increase revenues 
many democrats concede a oneyear revenue gain but say a cut 
would lose revenues after that besides they note most of the tax 
benefits from a reduction in the capital gains tax would go to those 
with incomes over 100000 a year 
the fight over catastrophic illness also includes an element of 
richvspoor higherincome retirees are complaining loudly because 
they must pay a larger share of the cost so the benefits can be 
available to those with little or no income those with higher 
incomes want all taxpayers to share the cost of catastrophic 
coverage 
because of the complaints congress members have shown widespread 
support for delaying the surtax of up to 800 that the higherincome 
retirees must pay but since members of the ways and means committee 
cannot agree on that the panel may simply decide to repeal the 
entire program 
the split over approving the child care amendments has had a more 
partisan tone all democrats and three republicans voted for the 
package seven republicans favoring a less costly approach 
recommended by bush voted no 
the ways and means child care plan which would take effect in 
1991 is closer to a version passed by the senate than to the 
presidents proposal the committee provisions would benefit 
families in which both spouses work outside the home as well as 
those families in which one spouse stays at home to care for the 
children 
it would expand the existing earnedincome credit which is worth 
up to 910 a year in tax cuts or in cash if there is no tax 
liability for working families with children and incomes up to 
about 18000 
the committee voted to raise the maximum credit to 1217 for a 
family with one child 1540 if there are two children and 1790 
if a family has two or more children under current law the credit 
is the same regardless of the number of children 
the plan would create a new credit for families with one or more 
children under age 6 this credit which would be in addition to the 
earnedincome credit would be for 6 percent of the families first 
6500 of earned income with a top credit of 430 in 1991 
a third part of the committees package would authorize 155 
billion worth of federal grants for social services with 80 percent 
of the money earmarked for improving child care services

ciari a candidate in sundays parliamentary elections became a 
japanese citizen a decade later so his two children would be 
japanese nationals 
ill try hard to defend social justice and protect those who 
are less privileged and not part of the japanese success story 
ciari said 
koreans naturalized japanese have been elected to parliament or 
state legislatures in past elections but that is a rare occurrence 
in this traditionally closed society 
it will be a good chance for the people to show to the world 
that they are making themselves international by electing a 
frenchjapanese said ciari a native of nice 
ciari 45 a successful guitarist composer animator and actor 
is running for the 252seat house of councillors under the banner of

the federal government would face the same 
penalties as private polluters for cleaning up thousands of 
hazardous waste sites under legislation headed for the senate with 
overwhelming approval from the house 
the house by a 38039 vote wednesday approved the measure 
allowing states fine federal agencies that violate environmental 
laws 
rep dennis eckart dohio said the legislation was necessary 
to end the hypocrisy that has taxpayers paying to create federal 
pollution 
the lopsided house vote improves its chances in the senate and 
demonstrates to toplevel decisionmakers that lawmakers are 
determined to get quick action on the decadesold problem of 
governmentcaused pollution eckart said 
eckart the bills sponsor and rep thomas luken dohio whose 
district includes a highly contaminated uraniumprocessing complex 
led a successful drive to persuade the house not to weaken the 
proposal 
rep richard ray dga wanted to ban state and local 
governments from using fines and penalties to force the federal 
government to clean up existing sites 
ray said the measure as approved would end up diverting limited 
funds away from cleanup into state coffers and lawyers pockets 
he and others also warned cleanup decisions could be moved out of 
the hands of the federal government and into state offices where 
parochial interests would outweigh the national interest 
this bill conveys power to the states but not responsibility 
said rep norman lent rny 
the bush administration opposes the measure on similar grounds 
an administration statement issued this week said the bill would 
allow states to fine polluting federal facilities without 
considering whether there was money in the budget to do the demanded 
cleanups 
but rep john dingell dmich and chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee said the measure may be the impetus needed 
to clean up serious contamination problems at government facilities 
if the bill puts pressure on the pentagon and other government 
polluters perhaps that is good because the people of this country 
want this mess cleaned up he said 
eckart said senate leaders have indicated theyll move on their 
version of the bill after the labor day recess 
the administration should stop dragging its heels and digging 
in and start digging up the pollution theyve created all across 
this country he said

the treasury department is moving to avoid 
exceeding the national debt limit next month even while urging 
congress to extend the ceiling before lawmakers leave for a 
monthlong august recess 
it is virtually certain absent such action that treasury will 
run out of cash and default on its obligations on aug 15 
undersecretary robert r glauber told senate finance taxation and 
debt management subcommittee wednesday 
i urge you to seek the cooperation of your colleagues and to 
act quickly on the debt limit in order to prevent unnecessary 
problems in treasury financing operations and default on the 
governments obligations he said 
the government is seeking a 300 billion increase in the current 
28 trillion longterm debt ceiling without an increase treasury 
officials say the government would have problems issuing paychecks 
and social security payments in september 
the house already has passed such legislation 
shortly before glauber appeared on capitol hill the treasury 
department announced it was suspending indefinitely the sale of 
special securities for state and local governments such action has 
been taken before when congress was unable to agree on legislation 
raising the debt limit 
state and local governments buy the special treasury securities 
as a temporary investment vehicle for money they raise in the bond 
market if the securities are not available it could force 
cancellation of bond sales by state and local governments leading 
to confusion and turmoil in the municipal bond market 
glauber did not mention the suspension in his testimony on 
capitol hill but he did warn of the other effects of congressional 
inaction on the debt limit increase 
without an increase in the debt limit by aug 1 full 
investment of the social security trust funds may not be possible 
he said 
the treasury is required by law to invest the trust fund assets 
in interestbearing government securities which are a form of 
government debt and are counted with other government bonds and 
notes against the debt limit 
while congress normally appropriates money to cover any interest 
lost to the trust funds during a period when they cannot be 
invested this action has raised complaints from interest groups 
representing the elderly 
glauber also warned that congressional inaction into september 
would prevent the treasury from paying the government payroll for 
september including payroll and pension checks exceeding 23 
billion

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan backpedaling on his support for local needleexchange 
programs says there is no valid scientific evidence that such 
programs curb the spread of aids 
sullivan in testimony to a house subcommittee wednesday also 
said the bush administration is strongly opposed to programs to 
give clean needles to drug addicts because they can be viewed as 
sanctioning drug abuse 
however pressed by rep henry waxman dcalif subcommittee 
chairman the secretary agreed to convene an expert panel to 
recommend how such programs could be studied scientifically he said 
the panel could report back to the subcommittee in several weeks 
sullivan had said in a march interview with the associated press 
that he did not believe needle exchanges condone drug abuse and the 
federal government would be very supportive of communities 
experimenting with such programs 
many experts believe the deadly aids virus has been spread 
through the population partly by the use of previouslyused needles 
by drug addicts 
sullivans statements marked the second issue on which he has 
backpedaled after straying from the bush administration line 
earlier his statements that he supported the supreme court decision 
legalizing a womans right to abortion nearly derailed his 
nomination later he said he opposed abortion except in cases of 
rape incest and danger to the mothers life 
at wednesdays hearing before the house energy and commerce 
health subcommittee he did not answer directly when asked if his 
views had changed since march 
but he said what has occurred is that i have had extensive 
discussions with aids and drug abuse experts as well as members of 
congress about the issue 
sullivans earlier statements alarmed some in the bush 
administration including drug czar william bennett at the time 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush is opposed to 
exchangeable needles under any condition 
in march sullivan said as someone who is concerned about 
health if this is a strategy that shows promise of helping to 
arrest the spread of aids i think this is something that does 
deserve a chance for an appropriate trial 
however asked wednesday if he would support needle exchanges if 
they were shown scientifically to be effective he said he still 
would want to consult with the other members of the cabinet 
bennett and others to look at this thoroughly 
we want to gather all the information that we can about these 
programs and because of the fact that there has not been evidence 
clear evidence that these programs are effective we are not 
prepared to advocate or come forth with programs he said 
sullivan said his department planned no efforts to conduct its 
own evaluation of the effect of cleanneedle programs but he said 
the national institute on drug abuse which is part of hhs would 
consider applications for research grants for others 
needleexchange programs are underway in several us cities 
including new york tacoma wash and boulder colo abroad 
england australia sweden and the netherlands have such programs 
sullivan said studies evaluating the effectiveness of some of 
these programs are not convincing because none has compared a 
group of addicts receiving clean needles with a group that is not 
also it is not clear whether findings that show decreased needle 
sharing and no increase in drug abuse are resulting from other 
factors he said

the house plans to vote friday on a 1435 
billion foreign aid bill that puts 15 million behind president 
bushs promise to encourage economic reform in hungary and poland 
bush announced the programs last week during visits to eastern 
europe pledging a 100 million fund to support private business 
initiatives in poland and 25 million to encourage enterprises in 
hungary 
the measure passed by the house appropriations committee on 
wednesday provides economic military and development aid for 
friendly countries around the world it goes before the full house 
on friday 
rep david obey dwis chairman of the panels foreign 
operations subcommittee said the 15 million figure was an informal 
estimate of the cost of beginning to meet bushs pledges in fiscal 
1990 which begins oct 1 the administration has so far made no 
formal request to congress for the aid he said 
of that amount 10 million is for poland and 5 million for 
hungary 
in its report the appropriations committee called polands june 
elections and other developments encouraging and reasons to 
believe that real progress can take place and can be sustained over 
a period of time 
rep mickey edwards rokla said republicans and the bush 
administration will support the foreign aid bill in the house but 
will work in the senate to shift more money to military aid and make 
a series of other changes 
the bill also included 
160 million for a new multilateral assistance initiative for 
the philippines 40 million less than the administration has 
requested i dont think given the philippine track record of 
poor management we ought to be putting in a dime obey said but 
he said the 160 million represented a compromise with the 
administration which sees the program as a key to bolstering the 
fledgling democracy led by corazon aquino 
a maximum of 85 million in military aid to the government of el 
salvador in a gesture of support to newly elected president alfredo 
cristiani of the rightwing arena party the committee declined to 
attach strings to the aid some liberal lawmakers had sought to 
release the aid in two increments depending on the new governments 
performance in suppressing the activities of rightwing death squads 
a total of 410 million for migration and refugee assistance 
40 million more than the administration asked the committee noted 
increased emigration of soviet jews as well as growing refugee needs 
in africa and along the thaicambodian border 
105 million for the african development fund which provides 
lowinterest loans for development programs in the poorest 
countries 144 million to the african development bank which makes 
marketrate loans for agriculture and public works projects 515 
million for development aid to subsaharan africa and 50 million 
in development money for countries bordering south africa the bill 
also recommends 2 million be set aside for protection of african 
elephants 
mild restrictions on the 958 million allocation to the 
international development association as an indication of 
displeasure over loans to china whose crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators has provoked outrage on capitol hill 
as usual israel and egypt receive the lions share of us aid 
money israel would get 3 billion in combined military and economic 
aid and egypt would receive 2 billion 
the bill also provides 20 million for a program to promote peace 
in northern ireland 230 million in military aid to pakistan 12 
million for the west bank and gaza strip for education health and 
agriculture programs 270 million as part of various drug control 
programs and 65 million for the united nations childrens fund

the senate is demanding increased cooperation 
from mexico in the war on drugs in a move described by opponents as 
a direct rebuke to that countrys new president carlos salinas de 
gortari 
senators added the provision wednesday to a 46 billion state 
department authorization bill for next year along with dabbling in 
dozens of other world issues from fidel castros right to hold power 
in cuba to bare grocery shelves in romania 
but senators were unable to resolve a dispute over an amendment 
proposed by sen jesse helms rnc barring official us talks 
with representatives of the palestine liberation organization who 
have been involved in terrorism against americans 
in one provision senators said they would not accept any nominee 
for administrator of the panama canal who is selected by panamas 
current ruler gen manuel noriega 
the treaty under which the united states will turn over the canal 
to panama calls for a panamanian administrator acceptable to the 
white house to be appointed next year by panama and confirmed by the 
senate 
helms also sponsored the provision dealing with mexico arguing 
the united states southern neighbor remains the primary source of 
heroin and marijuana and a leading transit point for usbound 
cocaine 
despite antidrug rhetoric from the salinas government mexico 
still has not granted us requests for the right to fly drug 
surveillance flights over the country to pursue drug smugglers into 
mexico or to grant access to bank records sought by us drug 
investigators said helms a perennial critic of mexico 
the nonbinding amendment expressed the sense of congress 
that mexico should negotiate with the united states on those and 
other drug issues 
helms said the amendment was intended to support salinas 
antidrug statements and to send a signal as to how we will 
measure their cooperation next year when it comes time to certify 
whether mexico is eligible for continued us trade preferences and 
other aid 
but sen john mccain rariz said the move would damage us 
relations with the new mexican government calling it a 
counterproductive and failed attempt to engage in another round of 
mexico bashing 
in a flurry of other foreignpolicy pronouncements the senate 
approved a provision intended to slow down an emerging 
uskorean deal for coproduction of a military fighter plane the 
provision calls for a study on how such a deal would affect us 
industrial capacity and longterm competitiveness 
voted 990 to call on cuban president fidel castro to hold a 
national plebiscite on whether he should continue in power and if a 
majority does not support him to step down 
approved a provision to rename a small park across the street 
from the chinese embassy in washington as tiananmen square park 
in honor of prodemocracy demonstrators killed in beijings 
crackdown last month 
called on the administration to bar the import of romanian meat 
and wine until such time as the romanian government ceases to

the b2 stealth bomber once one of the 
pentagons most closelyguarded secret weapons systems is becoming 
more public each day 
the latest pentagon step in its highprofile campaign to surmount 
congressional opposition to the expensive bomber is the 
declassification of a list of 156 contractors in 26 states and the 
district of columbia involved in the program 
the us air forces b2 program is supported nationwide by 
tens of thousands of men and women at prime contractor northrop 
corp key subcontractors boeing ltv general electric and hughes 
and other suppliers and subcontractors in 46 states northrop said 
in a fivepage memorandum received wednesday 
the memo which includes the recentlydeclassified list of 
contractors was sent to members of congress this week 
the b2 program has been shrouded in secrecy for nearly 10 years 
but as opposition to the expensive aircraft has grown in congress 
the air force has been more forthcoming with information 
last week air force secretary donald rice and chief of staff 
larry welch briefed members of the house armed services committee in 
an open session that included a colorslide presentation on the 
plane 
on monday the aircraft took off on its maiden twohour test 
flight with a huge bank of television cameras trained on it as it 
flew over the mojave desert 
asked about the change in public access to the bomber at the test 
flight pentagon spokesman pete williams said tuesday its a 
wonderful country isnt it 
the publicity campaign contrasts sharply with another weapon the 
supersecret f117a stealth fighter which remains under wraps 
id urge you not to mix different planes and different missions 
williams said 
despite the successful flight congressional opposition remains 
to the radarevading aircraft that at 530 million a copy is the 
most expensive in history 
the pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about 70 
billion 
one republican rep john kasich of ohio said of the northrop 
memo the company has now fallen back to selling the b2 as a jobs 
program but i doubt congress will be blinded by the smoke screen 
that northrop is trying to throw over us 
in fiscal 1990 the defense department has proposed spending 47 
billion for the b2 but last month the house armed services panel 
cut 800 million from the budget money for the b2 is expected to 
be the most controversial item next week when the house and senate 
consider the defense bill

the murder of actress rebecca schaeffer and the 
fiery assault on lorimar studios this week dramatize the increased 
perils of living in the glare of hollywoods bright lights 
entertainers have long employed security if only to fend off the 
paparazzi but a string of recent incidents including threats and 
attacks involving actors such as michael j fox and michael landon 
have prompted some stars to take greater safety measures 
gavin de becker hollywoods leading security consultant said 
the killing of miss schaeffer bore similarities to the knife attack 
seven years ago of his client raging bull actress theresa 
saldana 
this was not victoria principal or madonna de becker said 
wednesday this was somebody with a far smaller audience there is 
a dynamic that says whitney houston is for everyone but youre 
for me 
there are more kooks in the world said ron wells business 
manager of the american federation of guards here a union 
overseeing the 300 guards who protect studio gates 
robert john bardo 19 of tucson ariz was an obsessive fan of 
miss schaeffer police said wednesday as bardo was charged with 
murder in the shooting death of the 21yearold costar of the 
198688 cbs sitcom my sister sam 
investigators looking into another violent attack on tuesday 
believe edward phillips jr 43 of corydon ind was angered by a 
business dispute with dallas star ken kercheval over a popcorn 
company 
phillips crashed a truck through the gate at lorimar where 
dallas is filmed fired a burst of shotgun blasts set his 
vehicle afire and then killed himself 
de becker said he is in constant demand because of an exponential 
growth in the volume of fan nuisance letters in recent years he has 
expanded into providing security for celebrity weddings and handled 
last years nuptials between fox and actress tracy pollan 
in an unusual departure eddie murphy has set up a separate 
security post at the offices of his new production company even 
though it sits on the paramount studios lot itself protected by a 
squadron of guards 
when murphy appears publicly he is surrounded by a squadron of 
guards and friends 
record producer phil spector is legendary for not making a move 
without a security guard present even though few people would 
recognize him prince rarely appears without bodyguard accompaniment 
elizabeth taylor and other stars have installed elaborate 
security systems around their homes often including cameras and 
fence enclosures local tabloid reporters single out olivia newton 
john sylvester stallone and johnny carson for having the most 
sophisticated protection 
but despite the security few celebrities may be completely 
beyond the publics reach 
the access is there if somebody wants to get to a celebrity 
said barry levine west coast bureau chief for the tabloid star 
itself an expert at gatecrashing the stars can have security 
guards and security systems more sensitive than a banks but people 
can still buy a star map for 2 and haunt these people 
there really seems to be a rash of these things we seem to do 
more stories about obsessed fans than anything else 
this week 26yearold tina marieledbetter pleaded innocent in 
los angeles superior court to sending thousands of threatening 
letters and rabbit droppings to fox star of the former hit series 
family ties she was ordered to remain without bail at the sybil 
brand institute for women 
two guards were shot and killed at universal studios last 
december by a man who demanded to see landon star of highway to 
heaven nathan trupp 44 of new mexico has pleaded innocent to 
the charges 
a deranged fan of miss saldana may be released early next year 
after serving half of a 12year sentence for a knife attack against 
the actress arthur jackson a 53yearold scottish drifter 
attacked the actress in 1982 stabbing her 10 times with a kitchen 
knife 
im trying not to allow it to bring back bad memories for me 
miss saldana said wednesday of miss schaeffers murder i really 
had a hard time with it this morning 
in true hollywood fashion celebrity stalking has been in the 
news so much in recent years that the practice has sparked two 
movies 1981s the fan starring lauren bacall and 1982s the

a man who drove a truck through a 
studio gate set it afire and then committed suicide had claimed he 
was the victim of a rotten stinking deal involving dallas 
star ken kercheval 
edward phillips jr 43 of corydon ind was voted out of his 
management position at old capital popcorn in april 1988 by his then 
wife linda and kercheval who had bought the company from the 
couple 
phillips fired 12gauge shotgun blasts at the outside walls of a 
sound stage where dallas is filmed before shooting himself in 
the chest on tuesday 
an article detailing the corydonbased popcorn makers financial 
woes published in april by the courierjournal of louisville ky 
was among items phillips handed to a studio guard at the beginning 
of his rampage police said wednesday 
phillips a former farmimplement dealer purchased old capital 
popcorn with his exwife in 1983 
kercheval liked the popcorn so much he invested 998800 in the 
company in 1985 acquiring a onethird interest in april 1988 he 
bought out the remainder of the company 
in a statement issued through his publicist kercheval said he 
was shocked and astonished by the suicide 
the 54yearold actor said that after he bought the company 
phillips on several occasions exhibited irrational behavior that 
frightened my family and associates 
kercheval plays oil tycoon cliff barnes on the cbs series which 
is produced by lorimartelepictures corp 
late tuesday afternoon phillips drove an 18foot truck to a gate 
at the lorimar lot 10 miles east of downtown los angeles with the

the crash of a dc10 in iowa comes just as 
mcdonnell douglas prepares to deliver the last of the workhorse 
airliners plagued by some of historys worst air disasters 
the widebodied threeengine aircraft used by 51 world airlines 
and built by mcdonnell douglas has had cargo door problems been 
accused of design flaws and was once grounded for more than a month 
by the federal aviation administration 
the dc10s have been the workhorse of many airlines carrying 
from 250 to 380 passengers depending upon how their interior is 
configured 
a dc10 was involved in historys worst us air disaster that 
killed 273 people in chicago in 1979 and in one of the worst 
singleplane disasters in the world the 1974 crash of a turkish 
airliner in paris that killed 346 people 
wednesdays crash of united airlines flight 232 on its way from 
denver to chicago during an emergency landing attempt in iowa had 
the potential of eclipsing the 1979 crash but more than half the 
293 people aboard survived after the plane cartwheeled into the 
ground in a ball of flames 
the pilot had radioed complete hydraulic failure prior to the 
crash landing faa officials in washington said 
failure of the hydraulics system which is the main means of 
controlling wing flaps and other mechanisms that guide the aircraft 
also has figured in other dc10 crashes although the primary cause 
has varied 
the turkish airlines crash was blamed on faulty cargo door 
design which was later altered after nonfatal incidents of doors 
popping off other dc10s in the united states and canada the loss 
of the door led to decompression that buckled the floor which in 
turn severed hydraulic lines essential to taking off steering and 
landing an airliner 
floors in widebodied jets were strengthened and hydraulic lines 
rerouted after the incidents 
in the chicago american airlines crash hydraulic lines along the 
wings were severed when one of the planes engines came loose and 
somersaulted over the wing 
the faa grounded all us dc10s but allowed them to fly 37 days 
later the national transportation board determined erroneous 
maintenance procedures by american airlines caused the engine 
supports to crack the board also said some systems in the plane 
were vulnerable to damage 
jim reed spokesman for mcdonnell douglas in st louis said 445 
dc10s have been built since 1969 including military models dubbed 
kc10s 
plagued by financial losses following the chicago crash and heavy 
competition from other widebody airliners the companys douglas 
aircraft unit announced in 1983 it was ending production of the 
model except for military tanker versions that were on order 
two passenger planes remained unsold and the last one of those 
is to be delivered to nigeria airlines in a few weeks reed said 
in 1980 a retired american airlines pilot fred g johnson told 
a news conference he had refused to fly the dc10 during his last 
six months as a captain because it was unsafe 
he said although the plane has several hydraulic systems they 
are interconnected through pumps so that failure of one system 
jeopardizes the others 
mcdonnell douglas officials have consistently defended the 
aircraft as safe blaming bad publicity for a decline in orders 
the big trijets also have been involved in several crashes that 
were blamed on pilot error or problems not related to design or 
maintenance 
in addition to the chicago crash two other dc10s crashed in 
1979 an air new zealand model hit the rocky slopes of a volcano at 
the edge of antarctica killing all 257 people aboard and 74 people 
died when the pilot of a western airlines dc10 landed on a mexico 
city runway that was closed for repairs

a labor dispute that began 3 months ago as 
a small walkout at one company has mushroomed into a battle between 
the united mine workers and the coal industry and turned 
southwestern virginias mountains into a tinderbox of violence 
the strike against pittston coal group inc spread for a time 
through wildcat strikes to every coalproducing state in the east 
and led to shooting rock throwing and thousands of arrests 
us district judge glenn williams has imposed more than 4 
million in fines on the union for violating an order against civil 
disobedience by blocking mine entrances and coalhauling roads 
today the two sides appear as far apart as ever although a judge 
has persuaded them to resume talks and most of the wildcat strikes 
have subsided 
pittston coal has headquarters in lebanon va and 30 coal 
operations including 20 mines in three states it is a 
subsidiary of the greenwich connbased pittston co 
the strike initially involved 1700 umw members in virginia and 
west virginia in june 200 kentucky miners joined the walkout 
all had been working for 14 months without a contract after 
pittston refused to sign a national agreement reached last year with 
the bituminous coal operators association 
pittston president michael odom said the association agreement 
threatened his companys economic stability he sought concessions 
in work rules and benefits rather than wages that he claimed would 
save the company 5 or more in labor costs per ton of coal 
umw president richard trumka fearing that one successful holdout 
would lead to other companies to reject the national contract 
accused pittston of trying to break the union 
pittston has hired replacement workers but saw production cut to 
a third of normal levels during the first two months of the strike 
the strike began spreading june 12 after federally mediated 
negotiations broke down and williams imposed fines and temporarily 
jailed three union leaders in an effort to stop disruptions of coal 
traffic 
wildcat sympathy walkouts eventually involved as many as 46000 
miners in 10 eastern states most workers returned to their jobs 
this week heeding union orders but thousands of miners remained 
off the job in west virginia 
pay is not a big issue in the pittston dispute miners will earn 
a maximum 1677 an hour over three years under terms the company 
put into effect on its own june 10 
a major issue that sparked harsh words at wednesdays resumption 
of talks concerns health and retirement benefits for miners 
pittston wants to pull out of a national retirement fund and 
replace it with a plan only for its 560 retirees covered by the 
plan trumka says that would jeopardize medical benefits for 6000 
pensioners pittstons share of the 130000 pensioners covered by 
the national fund 
pittston also wants the right to require overtime and sunday 
work the union further accuses pittston of threatening job security 
by seeking permission to hire outside contractors to perform jobs 
that have been handled by umw members 
the company contends it needs a sevenday work week and other 
flexibility to meet competition from nonunion and foreign coal 
producers pittston is the nations 15th largest coal producer but 
its largest exporter 
job security is a touchy issue because of the increasing 
mechanization of mining that has seen umw membership drop to 85000 
from 144000 in 1980 and a peak of 400000 during world war ii 
union miners produce only a little more than a third of the nations 
coal down from 70 percent in 1970 the umw represents about 45 
percent of us coal miners 
although the judge succeeded in getting trumka and odom to resume 
talks wednesday the agreement to resume negotiations showed how far 
apart and bitterly divided the two sides remain 
pittston was allowed to continue claiming that talks are at an 
impasse which keeps its selfimposed contract terms in effect the 
union was allowed to preserve its claim that pittston failed to 
bargain in good faith holding open the possibility that strikers 
will get their jobs back once the dispute ends 
the dispute marks the second time in as many bcoa contracts that 
the union has fought a coal company to sign a labor agreement 
in december 1985 the umw ended a 15month strike against the 
at massey coal co that started when the richmondbased massey 
left to its subsidiaries whether to sign the pact the umw insisted 
that massey as the parent sign for its holdings 
at its peak the walkout involved 2000 union miners in kentucky 
and virginia most massey subsidiaries eventually reached a contract 
with the union after obtaining limited concessions

the infant mortality rate in the nations 
capital jumped to more than twice the national average last year 
largely due to an increase in drug abuse among pregnant women city 
officials say 
the district of columbia saw 232 infant deaths per 1000 births 
in 1988 the highest level since 1980 and more than double the 
national average of 99 deaths per 1000 births the city reported 
wednesday the new statistics represented a substantial increase 
over the 1987 rate of 196 deaths per 1000 births 
its as if weve been hit by a hurricane that government 
cant control said patricia a tompkins chief of the office of 
maternal and child health theres a tremendous amount of drug 
abuse among women of childbearing age 
tomkins said the city expected an increase but not one so 
dramatic it was kind of a shock she said 
the districts rise in infant mortality followed several years of 
modest success in curbing what has long been identified as one of 
the districts biggest health problems until 1988 the infant 
mortality rate had been relatively stable for four years and had 
declined slightly in 1987 
dc mayor marion barry has made infant mortality a major part of 
its health care agenda but the citys efforts have been overwhelmed 
by the crack cocaine epidemic which has swamped hospitals with the 
babies of drug addicts women who use drugs often give birth to 
infants with low birth weights who have an increased likelihood of 
dying before they reach their first birthdays

new taxes are needed to pay for programs to 
improve education public health and technology economists told a 
congressional panel 
nobel prizewinning economist james tobin said lawmakers intent 
on debating the federal deficit are ignoring the basic need for 
investment in people 
tobin joined 326 other economists in signing a statement 
wednesday saying that failure to increase investment in such things 
as education public health transportation and technology will 
have a crippling effect on americas future competitiveness 
the increased investment must be paid for through cuts in 
military and agriculture subsidy spending as well as with revenue 
from new taxes according to the statement by the economic policy 
institute a washingtonbased think tank 
we need sooner or later preferably sooner to break the 
political taboo on raising federal revenues tobin said 
princeton university economist alan s blinder also testifying 
wednesday before the congressional joint economic committee said 
the governments unending obsession with the deficit will 
adversely affect future productivity and standards of living 
blinder said the government must invest more in such things as 
programs to aid disadvantaged children and to improve roads bridges 
and sewer facilities

defense secretary dick cheney says hes 
concerned that the administrations decision to allow the sale of 
personal computers to soviet bloc nations gives them computers 
with military applications 
cheney commented on the issue wednesday in an effort to clarify a 
washington post story that said he had been persuaded by 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher to support the decision 
i do not support that decision cheney said appearing 
clearly irritated 
the secretary said he opposed the move because it would give the 
soviets significant capabilities they do not now possess 
cheneys comments revealed the fierce debate waged inside 
president bushs cabinet over the decision which marks a major 
shift in policy from the previous administration 
conservative members of that administration had sought to retain 
tight control of hightech exports to the soviets but this 
administrations shift appears to have been influenced by the more 
open attitude between the superpowers fostered by soviet president

capitalizing on israeli frustration over the 
palestinian uprising ariel sharon has moved into a strong position 
in the rightwing likud bloc and challenged prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
six years ago sharon was disgraced and forced to resign as 
defense minister for failing to prevent the massacre of more than 
800 palestinians by lebanese christians who were allowed into 
israeliencircled refugee camps in beirut 
but sharon 61 has fought his way out of the political 
wilderness assuring israelis he knows how to crush the 19month 
palestinian uprising which has claimed 570 arab and 37 israeli 
lives 
speaking in the israeliannexed golan heights this week sharon 
suggested one way to improve the situation was to liquidate plo 
chief yasser arafat and other plo officials 
the comment was criticized by the us state department as 
unhelpful to peace efforts but at home his tough talk is 
increasingly welcomed by israelis frustrated by the violence 
we are at a historic crossroads and in the absence of a 
national consensus about which road to take the extremists gain the 
upper hand said yehoshua saguy a likud member of parliament 
if the situation continues getting worse the people will grow 
more extremist and feel they are in a time of national emergency in 
emergency conditions there is no room for realpolitik said saguy 
a former head of military intelligence who like sharon was forced to 
resign after the 1982 massacre 
sharon minister of trade and industry in the coalition cabinet 
demonstrated his power at a party convention earlier this month in 
which he forced shamir to tack hardline conditions onto his peace 
initiative 
sharons restraints angered palestinians and drew expressions of 
concern from us officials worried that shamirs ability to 
compromise had been curtailed 
the conditions included a demand that the uprising be halted 
before shamirs plan for palestinian elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip is implemented and a stipulation that jewish 
settlements would continue to be built in the territories 
the move almost triggered the breakup of the 8monthold 
coalition with vice premier shimon peres of the labor party 
threatening to quit unless the conditions were abandoned 
sharon the most charismatic and controversial figure in likud 
has made no secret of the fact that he wants the party leadership 
some analysts are now viewing him as a serious contender for the 
first time 
suddenly sharon looks strong and shamir weak said nahum 
barnea a political columnist for the yediot ahronot daily and 
former editor of the leftwing koteret rashit magazine 
theres no doubt that he sharon is now dictating the partys 
policy 
sharons comeback has generated tension between the two men 
their dispute broke into the open today with two major israeli 
newspapers yediot ahronot and haaretz reporting that shamir was 
considering firing sharon 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir declined direct comment on the 
reports 
he suggested the premier was seeking to avoid splits in his party 
and at the same time deter internal threats to his peace plan 
the prime minister is concerned about the unity of the likud 
he has a high tolerance threshold and tries to see things in their 
broadest sense ahimeir said he intends to continue advancing 
the peace process sharon is only one of 11 likud ministers 
according to the two newpapers sharon complained at a meeting 
wednesday of likud leaders meeting that shamir had not advised him 
about the latest contacts between ministers and palestinians 
i cannot tell you anything you leak everything you get your 
hands on shamir replied and also accused sharon of sowing bad 
blood and hatred among us 
i can only laugh at your words sharon was quoted as saying 
to which shamir reportedly responded 
he who laughs last laughs best and i dont want to speak to 
you 
no personal attacks or threats to fire me will keep me from 
demanding an end to the murder of jews in the land of israel 
sharon said afterward in a fiery interview on army radio 
he accused the government of devoting too little time to 
discussing the uprising and world pressure on israel to speak to 
the plo 
in the us senate there is a tough ongoing debate on this 
subject and there they arent being murdered ever day and here 
just anything goes sharon said 
despite his irascible style sharon has strong public confidence 
a poll of 1206 israelis conducted in may by the independent 
modiin ezrachi agency showed 444 percent had more confidence in 
sharons ability to quell the uprising than in any other leader 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor won only 254 percent 
support in the poll 
i wouldnt necessarily use tougher measures only different 
ones sharon told a reporter recently 
although he declined to go into detail sharon pointed to his 
record as a guerrilla fighter he formed israels first commando 
squad known as unit 101 and led the force on raids into jordan in 
the 1950s

a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
today confirmed that the premier received a letter from president 
bush condemning jewish settlement building in the occupied lands as 
an obstacle to peace 
the spokesman yossi ahimeir also said that shamir had sent a 
written response rejecting bushs contention and saying he believed 
that the settlements should have nothing to do with peace efforts 
but ahimeir denied a report that bush had urged israel in the 
letter of last month to abandon hopes of a greater israel 
the report carried by national public radio from washington on 
tuesday said bush urged israel to halt settlement building in the 
west bank and gaza strip israel radio also carried the report 
npr also quoted bush as reiterating a remark secretary of state 
james a baker iii made to proisraeli lobbyists on may 22 that 
israel give up ideas of annexing the disputed territories 
in washington white house spokesman robert hall declined direct 
comment on bushs letter that all sounds like us policy 
ahimeir interviewed by telephone confirmed that bush had 
written shamir at the end of june 
he declined to quote directly from bushs letter but described 
its contents as friendly most positive and supportive of 
israels peace initiative 
in the letter he said nothing on the subject of a greater land 
of israel ahimeir said he made no mention of it the letter 
which we received about a month ago is friendly and supports the 
israeli peace initiative and the governments peace efforts 
bush however did reiterate longstanding us objections to 
israels construction of jewish towns and villages in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip ahimeir said 
since seizing the disputed lands in the 1967 middle east war 
israel has built more than 130 of these enclaves which are home to 
about 70000 israelis us officials maintain the settlements run 
counter to the usbacked formula for israel to give up occupied 
land in exchange for peace 
bushs letter said these settlements are an obstacle to the 
peace process ahimeir summarized it as saying 
paraphrasing shamirs response ahimeir said shamir totally 
rejects this view and so he replied he shamir believes that 
settlements have nothing whatsoever to do with his peace 
initiative

a panel instructed by congress to name 
hollywoods 25 greatest movies went behind closed doors to debate 
the merits of films such as the grapes of wrath and citizen 
kane 
wednesdays meeting was closed to the public over the protests of 
reporters from the new york times the los angeles times and daily 
variety an observer said 
erich schwartz an attorney for the librarian of congress charged 
with overseeing the selections said the meeting was conducted 
secretly to dispel public confusion about the panels work and to 
promote spirited discussion 
there was nothing machiavellian in the decision to close the 
meeting said schwartz 
my personal feeling is that they didnt want to hurt any 
filmmakers feelings while discussing the merits of one picture over 
another said jane galbraith a film reviewer and reporter for 
daily variety they didnt want to be associated with critical 
comments about people that they work with 
the meeting had been billed as a public discussion of 
recommendations the board would make to the librarian of congress 
for the first 25 films to be protected under the national film 
preservation act of 1988 
the act drafted in response to outcries about the practice of 
coloring old blackandwhite movies stipulates that a panel of 
experts select 25 titles each year for a national film register 
selected films can still be colored but the act requires that 
theyre labelled as having been altered without the participation of 
the original makers of the film 
the national film preservation board composed of representatives 
of 13 film groups began meeting in a public session at the 
university of california los angeles 
chairwoman fay kanin a representative of the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences moved to close the meeting to the public 
after almost 1 hours 
schwartz said the board had already satisfied requirements under 
the act to hold two public meetings and was under no legal 
obligation to continue meeting in public session 
instead of reaching agreement on a list wednesday schwartz said 
each board member would compose his or her own personal list and 
submit it to the librarian of congress james billington then 
billington will make the final decision announcing the choices in 
september he said 
the move to a secret session was especially perplexing as board 
members had discussed the nominations publicly prior to the meeting 
in preliminary polling 57 movies were nominated by at least two 
of 13 members of the preservation board the leader was the grapes 
of wrath with eight votes casablanca and its a wonderful 
life each drew seven votes the best years of our lives 
citizen kane and on the waterfront all received six votes 
they just made this decision at their luncheon today and they 
didnt tell anybody about it said mary tokita a spokeswoman for 
the ucla college of fine arts who had volunteered to handle 
publicity for the board

police claimed a victory today as the huge 
yamaguchigumi organized crime syndicate abandoned plans for an 
elaborate inauguration for its new boss opting instead for a quiet 
gathering at its headquarters 
our pressure and hard work paid off said a police official 
in kobe a port city in western japan where the 21000member gang 
is based 
he said police around the country had requested hotels and large 
banquet halls not to accept reservations from the gang which with 
no where else to go finally had to hold the ceremony in a large 
room on the second floor of its headquarters building 
the official who requested anonymity said about 300 police 
officers surrounded the building located on a hill in an expensive 
residential area as 105 gangsters attended the twohour fete 
he said there were no arrests 
when new boss yoshinori watanabes predecessor masahisa 
takenaka was inauguarated in naruto on the southern island of 
shikoku in july 1984 about 1000 police were mobilized 
more than 300 gangsters many dressed in black suits or kimono 
attended although no incidents were reported 
in 1985 takenaka was killed in a leadership dispute that divided 
the gang into two rival camps more than two dozen deaths and 315 
shootings made the ensuing conflict the bloodiest ever in japans 
underworld 
during todays ceremony watanabe is believed to have received 
three treasures symbolic of his post a tradition mocking the 
three sacred treasures that have been passed down from emperor to 
emperor for centuries 
we dont expect anything to change under watanabe the 
officer said and we will keep up our pressure on the gang 
watanabe 48 heads the powerful yamaken gang based in kobe 
the gang is the largest within the yamaguchigumi and claims a 
membership of 3000 
police estimate there are nearly 90000 gangsters or yakuza in 
japan and say nearly half are associated with the three biggest 
syndicates the yamaguchigumi sumiyoshi rengo and the inagawakai 
leaders of the inagawakai based in the tokyo area attended 
todays ceremony demonstrating their close relationship with the 
yamaguchigumi 
watanabe is the fifth boss of the gang which was founded by 
harukichi yamaguchi in 1915 when the gang was founded it had only 
50 members 
underworld syndicates often keep a high profile by posting signs 
outside their offices and the yamaguchigumi headquarters is a 
wellknown kobe landmark 
syndicates are involved in extortion illicit gambling and the 
drug and sex trades they also commonly operate in construction 
real estate money laundering and entertainment 
their activities are mainly limited to japan but they are known 
to buy guns and drugs from the philippines thailand and taiwan for 
sale here 
police estimate the total underworld income at 15 billion 
annually 
gang members have complex family relations cemented by 
rituals often patterned on japans indigenous shinto religion 
where rice wine is sipped to seal vows of fidelity 
watanabe on may 18 completed his winesipping ceremony with the 
gangs top leaders later that month he was convicted of assault 
and given a 10month suspended sentence

the public broadcasting service is trying to 
balance the proarab point of view of a documentary to be aired 
during a special about the palestinian uprising the new york times 
reported today 
pbs is spending 150000 in additional documentary material and 
analysis to accompany days of rage the young palestinians the 
times said the film which cost 180000 to make last summer has 
stirred protest for being propalestinian 
many journalists and critics who have seen days of rage say 
it is onesided but provides a perspective unusual for american 
television 
the 90minute film about the uprising known as the intifada has 
been shown in several screenings across the country after one 
postponement it is scheduled for nationwide viewing sept 6 during 
a pbs special called intifada the palestinians and israel 
two other minidocumentaries one on the israeli presence in 
the occupied territories and the other on human rights abuses will 
be broadcast during the 2hour special 
jo franklintrout the films producer and director called the 
decision to develop additional footage intellectually dishonest 
but she said a meeting wednesday with john sharnik who is producing 
the extra programming was cordial 
abraham h foxman national director of the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith said after seeing the film this week that it 
is an inaccurate biased documentary which lacks historical or 
present perspective 
he said pbs is acting irresponsibly in showing it 
stella giamassi a spokeswoman for public television station 
wnet said about 70 percent of the 2500 letters the station has 
received protested the planned broadcast

north korea demanded today that south 
korea not arrest a seoul college student who violated a ban on 
visits to the communist north and now wants to return home 
officials said today 
north korea insisted that south korean prime minister kang 
younghoon give a public assurance that 20yearold im sukyong may 
return home as a free citizen through the border village of 
panmunjom officials said 
if she is arrested and persecuted northsouth relations will 
be further aggravated creating a grave obstacle in the road to 
peaceful unification the message from north korea said 
south korea said the message was relayed in a telephone call to 
south korean unification minister lee hongkoo 
it was not immediately known whether south korea would allow miss 
im to cross the border there have been few mutually acceptable 
crossings between the enemy nations since they were divided at the 
end of world war ii 
park jyunkyu chairman of south koreas governing democratic 
justice party has warned that any north korean attempt to send the 
student back to seoul through panmunjom will raise havoc on the 
present military status quo at the demarcation line 
the demilitarized zone runs through the middle of the truce 
village 
also today north korean red cross chief son songpil sent a 
telephone message to his south korean counterpart requesting 
immediate steps to guarantee personal safety for miss im 
the seoul government has announced that miss im a radical 
student leader attending seouls hankuk university of foreign 
studies would be arrested when she returned from the north and 
charged with violating national security law 
she defied the governments ban on unauthorized travel to north 
korea and traveled by air via tokyo and east germany to attend the 
july 18 world festival for youth and students in the norths 
capital of pyongyang 
at a news conference in pyongyang she said she wanted to return 
home through the border to symbolize a unified korea and planned to 
do so on july 27 the anniversary of the ceasefire that ended the 
195053 korean war 
that is also the last day of a planned july 2027 peace march 
aimed at drawing national and international support for unification 
of the peninsula 
organizers said in washington on july 6 that the march would 
include about 100 foreigners and would be held simultaneously in 
both countries with the two groups meeting at the border in 
panmunjom 
south korea regards the march as a procommunist vehicle to stir 
up unrest and tightened immigration proceedures at all ports of 
entry to block foreigners who might try to participate south korea 
prohibits foreigners from engaging in political activity 
riot police were deployed today at mount halla on the southern 
island of cheju where the march was scheduled to begin according to 
yonhap the south korean news agency only journalists and tourists 
showed up the agency said

ultraconservative style lifted his talk show from a new jersey 
studio to nationwide syndication announced he has harangued his

a court today ended deliberations in the 
trial of a man accused of the 1986 killing of prime minister olof 
palme and ordered the defendant held in custody until the verdict is 
published next week 
the announcement was a strong indication that christer pettersson 
had been found guilty of shooting palme had the verdict been 
innocent he would have been ordered released immediately 
the district courts announcement however did not necessarily 
mean he would be sentenced on the charge of firstdegree murder 
if judged to be the killer pettersson could be sent for 
psychiatric examination with the possibility of committal in a 
closed mental institution 
pettersson was tried by a panel of two judges and six lay jurors 
all with an equal say in determining the defendants innocence or 
guilt 
the deliberations are over said court spokesman bertil 
hagberg the defendant shall remain in custody 
pettersson a 42yearold with a history of drug and alcohol 
abuse denied shooting palme and claimed he was 17 miles away at 
the time of the feb 28 1986 shooting 
the verdict will be published on july 27 the court said the 
jurys final session lasted more than two hours it was their fourth 
meeting since the fourweek trial concluded july 10 
a simple majority of the eightmember panel would be enough for a 
guilty verdict a tie vote would mean acquittal 
prosecutor anders helin cautioned against drawing a firm 
conclusion about the verdict from the courts announcement but said 
normally this would point to a guilty verdict 
helin said he assumed pettersson would appeal a guilty verdict to 
the superior court 
defense attorney arne liljeros said his client was very 
disappointed 
pettersson was arrested last dec 14 nearly three years after 
palme was shot in the back from close range after leaving a movie 
with his wife lisbeth 
mrs palme identified pettersson in court as the man she saw 
standing a few feet away immediately after he husband fell with a 
fatal gunshot wound 
though she saw no weapon other witnesses testified that no one 
else was near enough to have fired the shot 
the defense challenged mrs palmes reliability more than three 
years after the event and noted the lack of a motive murder weapon 
or other forensic evidence to link pettersson with the shooting

a rembrandt drawing stolen 10 years ago from a 
dutch museum is on its way back to amsterdam today after being 
identified by an art expert at christies auction house 
the unsigned artwork came to the auction house from a european 
dealer christies spokeswoman starr collins said wednesday the 
drawing was consigned to the dealer by a client who bought it for an 
undisclosed sum several years ago as a good anonymous drawing 
she said 
the auction house routinely tries to attribute all the unsigned 
works it receives for auction beverly jacoby who heads christies 
old masters department got this one on june 16 
i knew right away it had a very good shot at being a 
rembrandt she said i felt the drawing on stylistic grounds was 
very rembrandtesque and also very high quality 
research quickly confirmed her hunch 
after my initial elation that it was a rembrandt i read 
through the catalog entry to the bottom line where it said 
current ownership amsterdam rembrandt house that sent alarm 
bells ringing and i called our counsel before i did anything else 
said jacoby 
we contacted them to inquire and they informed us the drawing 
was stolen 10 years ago i think they were very surprised and very 
pleased 
the rembrandt removed from its original frame was mounted on 
two pieces of glass with tape around the edges 
the 3by5 inch doublesided drawing is in pen and ink on 
handmade paper one side depicts a child believed to be rembrandts 
son rombartus the other a sleeping woman thought to be his wife 
saskia 
a drawing of such personal and biographical interest has added 
appeal and could have fetched more than 100000 at auction said 
jacoby 
the drawing which was stolen in may 1979 has been handed over 
to us customs and is on its way to the amsterdam museum said ms 
collins

howitzer shells and rockets rained on 
beiruts moslem and christian sectors today in one of the fiercest 
overnight duels between syrian and christian army gunners in 18 
weeks of fighting 
police said four people were killed and 49 wounded 
the shells hit residential buildings on both sides of beiruts 
dividing green line starting hundreds of fires and covering the 
city with a blanket of rubble and glass shards 
streets were full of cars reduced to smoldering piles of metal 
tongues of flame shot up in the sky and smoke billowed from 
blasted buildings fire brigades were unable to combat blazes due to 
a shortage of water caused by a power failure 
ambulances their sirens wailing sped through the streets to 
evacuate the latest casualties which raised the overall toll to 424 
killed and 1741 wounded since the current round of fighting broke 
out march 8 
several syrian artillery positions in west beiruts seafront ein 
mreisseh boulevard took direct hits and a police spokesman said many 
syrian soldiers were killed or wounded 
we dont have a breakdown because the syrian command does not 
report its losses to us said the spokesman who cannot be named 
under standing regulations 
at least eight syrian army trucks loaded with rocket ammunition 
and gasoline were gutted according to a lebanese eyewitness 
one 155mm howitzer shell crashed at a road intersection across 
the street from the italian embassy in west beiruts wardieh 
district wrecking a cluster of chic boutiques and the citys most 
fashionable florist florelle 
the barrage according to police reached an intensity of about 
30 shells per minute at times police said at least 700 buildings 
and shops were hit in the deadly barrage which also inflicted 
damage on more than 5000 cars 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet 
vying for power with the christian cabinet pleaded with the leaders 
of saudi arabia morocco and algeria to speed up efforts aimed at 
resolving lebanons crisis 
in a cable hoss said beirut and its surroundings witnessed a 
horrible night of barbaric random shelling 
on behalf of the innocent people of lebanon its children 
women and elderly i plead with you to speed up your humanitarian 
mission he said 
the three heads of state were assigned by an arab summit in may 
to find a settlement their ceasefire calls have been ignored by 
the warring factions

walls and pushed the furniture out of the apartment 
i stretched a hand to open the door but there was no door 
left he said his eyes brimming with tears weve nothing left 
except the night dresses we are wearing 
residents throughout the city rushed to basements shortly after 
the shelling duel broke out late wednesday night 
there is no district in beirut and the surrounding mountains 
that wasnt targeted by the shelling said a police spokesman who 
cannot be named in line with standing regulations 
the current round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
began this spring two days after christian army commander gen 
michel aoun blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias 
south of beirut 
aoun took the measure to salvage about 100 million in lost 
customs dues annually the syrians and their allies retaliated by 
blockading the 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut 
a spokesman for aouns command speaking on condition of 
anonymity accused the syrians of starting the latest barrage by 
shelling the coastline north of beirut to prevent three 
vegetableladen ships from docking at christian ports 
the syrians have been shelling the christiancontrolled coast 
north of beirut almost daily for more than a month to prevent aoun 
from receiving war material from iraq 
iraq syrias main arab rival has declared support to aouns 
war of liberation against the 40000 syrian troops deployed in 
predominantly moslem lebanese provinces under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing to 
achieve their mandate by siding with moslems against christians in 
lebanons 14yearold civil war

the foreign ministry called in the us ambassador 
today and accused congress of deliberately trying to undermine 
relations with china by approving new trade sanctions 
the official xinhua news agency said liu huaqiu an assistant to 
foreign minister qian qichen expressed chinas indignation and 
delivered a strong protest to ambassador james lilley 
the foreign affairs committee of the national peoples congress 
chinas legislature issued a separate protest charging that 
congress willfully distorted the facts about chinas efforts to 
put an end to turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
in beijing 
the protests were the latest in a series of recriminations 
reflecting us outrage over the chinese armys crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters and chinese outrage over any foreign 
comment on its domestic politics relations have deteriorated to 
their lowest level since the two countries established diplomatic 
ties in 1979 
both the house of representatives and the senate separately 
approved legislative amendments calling for a range of sanctions in 
addition to president bushs previous halt to military sales and 
highlevel exchanges 
among other things both houses called for suspending the use of 
us funds to support trade with china the senate also called for 
suspending satellite exports that would be launched by china and for 
suspending nuclear cooperation 
the amendments have yet to be signed into law 
the two amendments slandered and attacked the chinese 
government in a groundless manner xinhua quoted liu as telling 
lilley the us embassy refused comment on lilleys response 
a separate foreign ministry statement read to reporters accused 
congress of pursuing power politics in a deliberate attempt to 
harm chineseus relations 
in washington 42 republican senators signed a letter delivered 
to the chinese embassy that predicted tremendous damage to 
bilateral relations should your government continue on the course 
of statesponsored violence and intimidation on which you are 
embarked 
but despite both sides talk of damaged relations an american 
diplomat in beijing said neither side wanted to end the relationship 
altogether 
there are some chinese people a small group of people who 
think the united states is a bad influence and want to see the 
influence limited said the diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
on the american side he said there was a sense of 
disillusionment because in the past there was a kind of culture 
that said the relationship was special 
at the foreign ministrys weekly news conference spokeswoman li 
jinhua denied that china plans to cut economic ties with the united 
states and other countries that have criticized its crackdown 
ms li also said chinese soldiers were acting according to 
their orders and performing their normal tasks in searching 
foreign diplomats cars at checkpoints in beijing and sometimes 
sticking guns in their faces 
foreigners should abide by the orders issued by the martial law 
enforcement troops she said when asked if such searches were 
legal 
military checkpoints go up around beijing after midnight and 
several diplomats have reported that soldiers searched their cars in 
apparent violation of international agreements on diplomatic 
immunity 
ms li also maintained that china has not banned sales of all 
foreign newspapers and magazines in beijing although she said she 
could not name any foreign publications still allowed officials 
went to hotels and stores in beijing last week and took foreign 
papers and magazines from newstands none has been allowed on sale 
since 
we do not refuse all foreign books and magazines and 
newspapers the spokeswoman said but we do not alow those 
foreign magazines and newspapers whose content interferes in chinas 
internal affairs and hurts the national feelings of the chinese 
people to spread unchecked on chinese soil this is quite natural 
she refused to comment on the number of people arrested since the 
crackdown on the protests began or on persistent reports that 
fugitive student leader wang dan has been arrested

grenada today established relations with 
taiwan becoming the first nation to have relations with both the 
nationalist government in taipei and the communist government in 
china 
the move was seen as a defeat for communist chinese foreign 
policy because it followed beijings crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrations and because china asks countries that recognize it to 
break relations with taiwan 
grenada the tiny island nation in the carribean established 
relations with the communist government in china in 1985 
there was no immediate reaction from beijing to grenadas move 
today 
taiwan also used to demand that countries break relations with 
china before establishing ties with taipei but in a break with the 
past vice foreign minister charles king said taiwan did not ask 
grenada to sever ties with china as a condition because this is 
not necessary 
king said grenada decided to recognize taiwan after the 
communists began their crackdown 
they reviewed their china policy and they believed the 
establishment of official ties with us can help promote world peace 
and freedom king told a news conference 
the international standing of the nationalists has waned since 
they lost a civil war to communist forces on the chinese mainland in 
1949 the us rapprochement with china in the 1970s dealt a further 
blow to taiwans status 
the number of countries with formal ties to the nationalist 
government has dropped from more than 50 in 1949 to 23 while 135 
countries recognize china grenada would be the 24th country to 
recognize taiwan 
but since communist chinese troops launched a crackdown in 
beijing taiwan has taken steps to take advantage of beijings loss 
of international support 
grenada with a population of 11000 is a member of the british 
commonwealth and relies on agricultural exports and tourism 
in 1983 us marines and rangers and small force from six 
carribean nations invaded the island deposing a marxist regime

leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest today after a day of 
unrest in that countrys capital according to a western embassy 
report 
the arrest came after police beat protesters wednesday during a 
holiday marking national independence state radio said 44 other 
people were reported arrested during the protests 
troops of the military government of gen saw maung surrounded 
ms suu kyis house in a suburb of the capital rangoon and kept 
her there said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity he got 
his information from a report of a western embassy in rangoon that 
he would not identify further

refused and they forced her back inside said the source

national league for democracy went to see her but they were turned

telephone and telex lines to rangoon from bangkok were out of order 
today 
the source said the reason for the arrest of ms suu kyi the 
daughter of a celebrated independence leader was unclear 
he said the government may have used the violence during 
wednesdays martyrs day ceremonies as a pretext to move against her

of her party authorities accused the three of bombing a government 
oil refinery earlier this month in an attack that killed three 
people 
ms suu kyi is the most vocal critic of the authoritarian 
government that has ruled under martial law since army commander saw

ms suu kyi 44 had vowed to lead thousands of people on a march 
wednesday to mark the day her father aung san and other burmese 
independence leaders were assassinated in 1947 she canceled the 
rally however to avoid bloodshed as troops flooded the streets of 
the capital and erected barricades 
the soldiers blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a 
killing field for the people said ms suu kyi in a telephone 
interview from bangkok wednesday before her reported arrest 
witnesses said troops scattered hundreds of student demonstrators 
who defied martial law staterun radio reported 44 arrests 
ms suu kyi said soldiers used sticks to beat some of the 3000 
student protesters in the capitals swegondine district

soldiers chase a group of students down a side street drag some of 
them out and hit them with sticks before putting 15 to 20 of them 
into a truck

at seven areas of the city despite martial law it said they 
chanted carried antigovernment banners and distributed protest

the white house says president bush has 
exchanged letters with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
reemphasized the us desire to continue the peace process in 
the middle east 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bushs letter sent 
before the president went to europe on july 9 strongly endorsed 
secretary of state james a baker iiis statements on the peace 
process 
baker has urged israel to accept territorial compromise and to 
stop further jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
fitzwater confirmed wednesday that bush had written shamir 
saying the letter reemphasized our general position and our 
desire to continue the peace process 
he said bush received a reply from shamir but he refused to 
characterize it 
baker in a may 22 speech cautioned israel that the united 
states does not support annexation or permanent israeli control of 
the west bank and gaza and also opposes the creation of an 
independent palestinian state 
asked by reporters if the bush letter was a defense of baker 
fitzwater said the us position was wellrepresented by secretary 
baker in all of his public discussions 
we think secretary bakers many discussions on this issue have 
been in the interest of the peace process we have welcomed the 
elections proposal of prime minister shamir as a concept that could 
lead to broader peace efforts and we would like to see that 
process move forward fitzwater said 
shamir under pressure from political rivals in his likud party 
recently supported a hardline party plan to restrict arab residents 
of east jerusalem from voting in proposed elections in the occupied 
territories 
shamir proposed elections in april 
us officials have said both the likudbacked restrictions and 
palestinian preconditions could undermine the elections

strikes by tens of thousands of 
miners in this siberian coal region spread to four more of the 
soviet unions coal fields tass reported today 
the official news agency said coal miners in vorkuta in the far 
north the don river city of rostov in southwestern russia and the 
ukrainian industrial center of dnepropetrovsk walked out wednesday 
miners in the karaganda region in soviet central asia today 
refused to work tass said by evening 14 mines in the region home 
of the countrys thirdlargest coal fields were reported at a 
standstill 
tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners 
in the donetsk and kuznetsk coal basins who are seeking greater 
local control over their industries and better wages and living 
conditions 
kuznetsk in western siberia and donetsk in the ukraine are 
the countrys two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the 
countrys worst labor unrest since the 1920s novokuznetsk is a 
major city in the kuznetsk region where the strikes began 10 days 
ago 
the government has acknowledged that living and working 
conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made 
general pledges of improvements 
tass reported wednesday that some miners in siberia had returned 
to work after the government made pay concessions 
the government also has promised to send extra meat butter 
sugar tea leather shoes furniture and cars to relieve shortages 
in the region the communist youth league newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda said today 
but the newspaper and tass reported more disturbances in the 
ukraine komsomolskaya pravda quoted a communist official in the 
donetsk city of makeyevka as saying the scale of the strike is 
growing practically all the coal enterprises of the city have 
stopped work 
miners in vorkuta rostov and dnepropetrovsk all walked off the 
job on wednesday tass said 
in vorkuta strikers sent a letter to the kremlin asking for an 
urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the 
coal sector and also specific problems of workers of the far 
north tass said 
in rostov miners economic demands included extra pay for 
evening and night shifts longer vacations and an increase in the 
price of coal to world market prices the news agency reported 
in dnepropetrovsk which is 150 miles from donetsk workers 
demands mirrored those of donetsk and kuznetsk miners 
in karaganda strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete 
news accounts of miners demands in the kuznetsk strikes according 
to tass 
president mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday the strikes could 
imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers 
being urged to strike 
he said that if labor trouble spreads we may have to take such 
extreme measures that it will hurt what weve been doing to 
overhaul the economy through greater attention to freemarket 
mechanisms 
he did not elaborate 
strikes are rare in the soviet union and were ended by force 
before gorbachev gained power in march 1985 
tass today said that the kuznetsk strike had reached a turning 
point with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work 
it was not known how many more employees were back on the job 
today on wednesday tass said that 24000 strikers in kuznetsk were 
back at work and 150000 remained on strike 
state television said wednesday that the strike in the donetsk 
basin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines more than triple the 
previous number and that mine construction workers had joined 
in a report from the donetsk city of yenakiyevo television said 
steel and cokechemical plants were on the verge of a stoppage 
for lack of coal 
earlier reports in the official press had said operations at 
steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and 
coke 
gorbachev told the national legislature wednesday that the 
strikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal 
the government has agreed to most miner demands including those 
on pensions and overtime gorbachev said but he said that settling 
some longerterm issues would take up to a month 
tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to 
night shifts and for men using jackhammers 
strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of 
consumer goods and food and the government has made general pledges 
of improvements in those areas

benjamin tammuz a prominent russianborn 
israeli author sculptor and proponent of jewisharab coexistence 
has died at age 70 
israeli news reports said his death wednesday was caused by 
cancer and that he had kept his illness secret from most of his 
friends

books contained humorous and introspective portrayals of israels 
pioneer generation 
he published dozens of books short stories and satirical columns 
in the prestigious haaretz daily among the most popular is a 
humorous sketch of pioneer days called the life of elyakum 
he was also among the leaders of the defunct canaanite movement 
which leftwing poets and artists began before israels founding in 
1948 the movement sought a way of forging jewisharab cooperation 
the canaanites wanted to build a new hebrew nation as 
opposed to a jewish one to circumvent conflict with the arabs 
the biblical name came from ancient canaan the promised land of 
the israelites who subjugated it after their flight from egypt 
the movement never gained support in israel and is now mostly 
credited for its important role in transforming biblical hebrew into 
a modern language

an opposition newspaper said today that 
gen wojciech jaruzelski would have lost the presidency in a popular 
election but opposition lawmakers said jaruzelskis leadership is 
necessary to continue reforms 
elected to the newly powerful presidency by the slimmest margin 
possible jaruzelski now faces the challenge of trying to salvage a 
crippled economy 
his task was exacerbated by strikes in the southern province of 
katowice the strikes eased today with the signing of a new pay 
agreement but many workers reportedly rejected it and stayed off 
the job 
jaruzelskis communist coalition controls 300 seats in the 
560seat parliament but because some in the coalition voted against 
him a boycott by some opposition legislators may have been the key 
to jaruzelskis win 
jaruzelski the communist party chief needed 270 votes to win 
the final tally was 270to233 with 34 abstentions 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and a spokesman for 
president bush sent congratulatory messages today to jaruzelski 
wojciech jaruzelski is deeply respected in the soviet union as 
the initiator of the policy of national accord and socialist 
renovation said gorbachevs message transmitted by the soviet 
news agency tass 
in washington bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said in 
congratulating jaruzelski our only concern is to see the 
political and economic reform process go forward 
a commentary in the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
attributed jaruzelskis win to what it called a symbolic single vote 
cast by lech walesa last week when he said the president should 
come from the communist coalition 
it said in a popular vote walesa the leader of the solidarity 
trade union movement would have been the winner 
what then is the result of this election for ordinary people in 
poland those who stand in lines and with horror think about the 
landslide of rising prices nothing read the commentary 
but these people will submit their bill to the deputies and 
senators to the generals and ministers and to the president if 
the process of rescuing the country from ruin is not started 
the general who has has led the country eight years and promises 
to oversee a transition to democracy was the only candidate 
wednesday 
some solidarity lawmakers displayed their paper ballots to tv 
cameras as they voted to show they were against jaruzelski many of 
them had been imprisoned during jaruzelskis 1981 martial law 
crackdown on the union 
opposition lawmakers who did not vote said they could not openly 
endorse jaruzelski but they said defeating him could undermine 
reforms 
it is a great relief said opposition sen karol modzelewski 
of wroclaw we would have been in real trouble if he did not make 
it 
as president jaruzelski now constitutionally controls the 
military and foreign relations and must nominate a prime minister to 
assemble a new government with parliamentary approval it is a 
sixyear term 
the government will have to contend with a deteriorating economy 
inflation is heading for 160 percent and food shortages are 
worsening 
polands staterun pap news agency said a twoday strike by 
11000 transit workers in the southern province of katowice ended 
today with the signing of a new pay agreement that raised hourly pay 
but the solidarity information service in warsaw said workers in 
10 out of 17 bus depots rejected the agreement and were continuing 
their strikes 
in the baltic port of gdynia a strike by shipyard workers ended 
late wednesday after one day 
an ocean of problems is ahead of us jaruzelski told 
parliament in a brief restrained speech moments after taking the 
oath of office material conditions must dictate the 
priorities of action they are more important and urgent than 
anything else 
jaruzelski said a new government must be organized as soon as 
possible 
the cabinet of prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski already has 
submitted its resignation and it is conceivable the next government 
could be drawn at least partly from the opposition 
the election of a president was the last step in meeting accords 
that communist authorities forged with solidarity in april after 
labor unrest prompted them to seek the cooperation of the opposition 
in the course of three months of talks solidarity regained its 
legal status after a sevenyear ban the countrys freest elections 
in 40 years were held and the opposition won all but one of the 
parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest 
immediately after the election walesa sent a letter of 
congratulations to the general emphasizing that the opposition 
expects him to continue with democratic reform 
my wish for you is that the time you are given to perform this 
office will be a stage in the history of our homeland effectively 
leading to freedom and democracy and to regaining polands proper 
position in europe the message said 
jaruzelski promised solidarity lawmakers before the election that 
he would give up the post of communist party first secretary if 
elected president 
it was unclear if he intended to resign immediately or to hold 
both posts temporarily

a former civilian worker for the army was 
convicted today of conspiring with a us soldier to sell american 
military secrets to east german and soviet agents 
the guilty verdict against huseyin yildirim 61 was returned by 
a us district court jury after about six hours of deliberations 
over two days 
yildirim a turkishborn naturalized us citizen was charged 
with conspiring with warrant officer james william hall iii to sell 
classified information to eastern bloc agents between 1983 and 1988 
when hall was stationed in germany and new jersey 
yildirim was working as a civilian mechanic at an army auto shop 
in germany at the time 
the trial was held in savannah because hall was stationed at 
nearby fort stewart at the time of his arrest last december 
hall pleaded guilty at a courtmartial in march and was sentenced 
to 40 years in prison 
in closing arguments wednesday defense lawyer lamar walter 
argued that hall was solely to blame for the espionage 
the evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him hall but 
not my man walter said mr hall is very definitely a guilty 
man the man is not capable of being believed 
walter called no witnesses after assistant us attorney fred 
kramer rested the governments case wednesday morning 
defense experts say the espionage scheme damaged us 
intelligence efforts in europe hall worked as an analyst of 
intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages 
kramer in his closing argument contended that the evidence 
showed overwhelmingly that yildirim was halls contact that he 
carried documents to the soviets and east germans and that he 
returned with money 
before resting his case kramer elicited testimony from fbi 
espionage expert nicholas j walsh that a dear friend letter 
found among yildirims property in berlin included a shopping list 
a list of things they would like you would probably be paid 
the most for it 
testimony said yildirims fingerprint was found on the unsigned 
letter fbi agents testified tuesday that yildirims fingerprints 
also were on two 50 bills found in halls truck 
fbi agents seized the bills a phony passport and military 
intelligence documents at halls home and from his truck in richmond 
hill ga when he was arrested dec 20 evidence showed 
other incriminating evidence was taken from yildirims home in 
belleair beach fla later the same morning fbi agents said 
hall appeared in the courtroom during the trial which began 
monday but did not testify in person 
in a videotape played for the jury tuesday hall told fbi agent 
dimitry droujinsky he was lured into the spy game by money 
i wasnt terribly short of money hall told the agent who 
was posing as a soviet agent named vladimir i just decided i 
didnt ever want to worry where my next dollar was coming from 
what i wanted to be able to do was to afford some of the things i 
wanted 
investigators began probing halls affairs when evidence showed 
he was living above his income of 20200

three federal judges have ordered louisiana to 
replace four governing boards with one in a package of sweeping 
reforms to desegregate the states 17 public colleges and 
universities 
the present scheme for governing education in louisiana three 
operating boards and one coordinating board has perpetuated 
illegal segregation in louisianas higher education the judges 
said wednesday 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed 15 years ago by the us 
justice department it closely followed recommendations made in may 
by paul verkuil president of the college of william amp mary who was 
appointed by the judges to conduct hearings and write a 
desegregation plan 
the fiveyear plan would create of a single board to govern 
higher education restrict admissions at some universities limit 
degree programs most can offer and establish a community college 
system 
currently one board governs the louisiana state university 
system another governs the mostly black southern university system 
and a third governs the others all three boards answer to the state 
board of regents for higher education 
the court gave the state 30 days to replace the four governing 
boards with a new 17member board the governor will appoint the 
members pending senate confirmation the court declined to set a 
ratio of whitetoblack members 
the southern university board of supervisors will meet july 29 in 
baton rouge to discuss an appeal to the us supreme court which 
could delay the plans implementation 
the plan was recommended by gov buddy roemer when he took office 
in 1988 
the state has won the people have won i believe we have buddy 
roemer and three judges to thank said john kennedy roemers 
lawyer in the case 
the order would designate louisiana state university in baton 
rouge as the unified systems flagship university with the greatest 
number of graduate and research programs 
it also calls for creation of an intermediate level of 
institutions which includes southern offering significant 
doctoral and other graduate programs and for gradually merging the 
lsu law school and the southern university law school both in baton 
rouge 
the states remaining fouryear colleges would be designated 
comprehensive universities with limited graduate or research 
missions and lessselective or open admissions 
the order was written by 5th us circuit court judge john m 
wisdom us district judge charles schwartz and district judge 
veronica wicker 
reaction to the order varied 
i would think that the merger of southern law school is a 
real big problem for the board and for the black community its a 
matter that needs to be modified said state sen william 
jefferson a black new orleans lawyer who represents the southern 
university system 
kennedy said the plan has great potential to desegregate i 
think a single system and a selective admissions policy in some 
schools to move students around will help desegregate 
john mckeithen who left the lsu board last year and was the 
first governor to champion desegregation was skeptical 
i dont think its going to work for the life of me i dont 
know any way to make a white go to grambling or a black go to 
louisiana tech mckeithen said referring to two state colleges

once among the worlds richest men khashoggi was said to be the 
middleman in the irancontra deal 
the former fugitive handcuffed and wearing a green walking suit 
did not talk with reporters before leaving kennedy international 
airport with fbi agents but in a statement released by his lawyer 
khashoggi said he intends to contest the charges and is confident 
that my innocence will be clearly established 
khashoggis attorney robert morvillo had asked that bail be set 
no higher than the 5 million bond granted mrs marcos 
khashoggis assets have dwindled recently as various holdings 
have been sold i read in the newspapers like everyone else that 
hes a very rich man but i dont know that the judge said 
i think your honor can assume that hes an enormously wealthy 
man morvillo said 
instead of jail morvillo suggested that khashoggi be put under 
house arrest at his luxury apartment on fifth avenue he said 
khashoggi could pay for private security guards deputized by the 
court to watch him 
keenan laughed at the idea but said he would keep in mind 
morvillos arguments in favor of bail 
us assistant attorney charles labella opposed bail and house 
arrest saying he had learned that creditors were about to foreclose 
on the apartment 
in october a federal grand jury in new york indicted khashoggi 
the marcoses five other people and the california overseas bank in 
los angeles 
the marcoses were charged with stealing millions from the 
philippines to buy real estate and art in new york khashoggi 
allegedly posed as the owner of some of the assets as a cover 
khashoggi 53 had been jailed in switzerland since his april 18 
arrest at a luxury hotel in bern but swiss officials denied 
extradition for racketeering and conspiracy charges because theyre 
not recognized under swiss law he was arraigned wednesday on mail 
fraud and obstruction of justice 
he faces up to five years in jail and a 250000 fine 
khashoggi who once traveled the globe in his private yacht and 
plane spent the last three months in a 30squarefoot prison cell 
fighting extradition 
he is said to have been a major financier and middleman of the 
irancontra affair in which proceeds of secret us arms sales to 
iran were channeled to rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government he has acknowledged a role in the deal and 
said he lost 10 million on it 
khashoggi also has been named in several kickback scandals and 
has had financial problems that led one of his companies to file for 
protection under bankruptcy law his arrest in switzerland marked 
the first time that he was ever jailed 
a us diplomatic note asking that khashoggi be arrested cited 
four buildings in manhattan and a collection of paintings that 
disappeared from a manila museum swiss authorities said 
khashoggis lawyers two weeks ago announced they planned to 
appeal the extradition but the swiss justice ministry statement 
said khashoggi changed his mind at a recent hearing his lawyers 
gave no explanation for the change of heart

today the panel was not ready to decide whether to launch an 
investigation of republican whip newt gingrich 
chairman julian dixon dcalif said the committee was taking no 
action on anything on the calendar today but added there was 
a strong likelihood the panel could meet next week 
the panels first step in an investigation of gingrich rga 
who engineered a controversial book deal would be to order a 
preliminary inquiry 
the committees ranking republican rep john t myers of 
indiana said before the panels closeddoor meeting i dont

concerning rep gus savage dill

state department letter was an assertion of what they believe to 
be the facts 
gingrich filed the complaint that led to the investigation of 
former house speaker jim wright who resigned in june after the 
committee charged him with 69 rules violations 
the committee was also considering whether to hire an outside 
lawyer for the gingrich probe as it did in the former speakers case 
chicago attorney richard j phelan who handled the wright case 
said this week he has discussed with the panel the possibility of 
performing a similar role if an investigation of gingrich is 
approved 
a complaint by rep bill alexander dark filed last april 
alleged that gingrich the secondranking house republican may have 
violated campaign finance laws and house rules on outside income and 
receipt of gifts 
the complaint focused on a partnership in which 21 investors put 
up 5000 each to promote window of opportunity a book 
authored by gingrich his wife and a third writer 
the ethics committee also received in june a request from house 
republicans for an investigation of rep donald buz lukens 
rohio he is appealing his conviction on a charge of contributing

the committee officially the committee on standards of official 
conduct this week has a new member in rep fred grandy riowa 
replacing rep hank brown rcolo who resigned from the panel

the fact that hes a republican leader adds a little bit of 
political heat to it he gets no more or no less justice than any 
other member of congress

delta air lines took responsibility for the crash 
of a boeing 727 saying crew error led to the tragedy that killed 14 
people at dallasfort worth international airport last summer 
the flight crew failed to set the aircrafts flaps and slats in 
the proper takeoff configuration as required by established delta 
practices and procedures the airline said in a statement from its 
atlanta headquarters wednesday 
flight 1141 carrying 108 people rolled from side to side and 
got no more than 30 feet off the runway before crashing aug 31 on 
takeoff in a grassy field near the runway 
the airline said wednesday that the members of the flight crew 
are no longer flying with delta 
the crew members were fired tuesday after being called to the 
delta chief pilots office in dallas said capt jim gray spokesman 
for the air line pilots association 
larry davis the pilot and steven judd the flight engineer had 
no comment wednesday on deltas announcement said women answering 
telephones at their dallasarea homes no phone listing was found 
for copilot carey wilson kirkland jr 
delta spokesman jim lundy said the airlines investigation was 
conducted separately from a national transportation safety board 
probe of the crash he said delta expects the ntsb to release its 
conclusions in late summer or early fall 
in ntsb hearings in november the three crew members admitted 
certain technical violations of delta regulations had occurred as 
they prepared for takeoff but said they made all necessary 
preflight preparations 
attorneys for crash victims said they were glad delta accepted 
blame for the crash but added that doesnt mean their clients legal 
action is finished 
it will certainly expedite the cases said windle turley a 
dallas lawyer representing at least eight passengers who were aboard 
delta flight 1141 if a case was going to take 18 months maybe now 
it will be done in a year

archaeologists trying to piece together a 
story of cannibalism by a gold prospecting party in 1874 have found 
the remains of four bodies in a mass grave 
the working hypothesis today tomorrow i may change my mind 
is that we have a minimum of four individuals represented walter 
birkby physical anthropology curator at arizona state museum in 
tucson said at the excavation site 
he is one of a team examining the expedition whose organizer and 
sole survivor alferd packer admitted eating his five colleagues 
but said he killed only one of them and in selfdefense 
analysis of the bones for evidence of cannibalism will take some 
time in a laboratory after the excavation is completed 
found with the bones were quantities of burlap and a green 
suspender clip holding remnants of brown cloth two hard rubber 
buttons and two badly corroded metal buttons the scientists said 
birkby said scientists decided that four bodies were represented 
based on duplicate bones discovered and the arrangement of some 
bones that were uncovered such as arm bones arranged adjacent to a 
shoulder bone 
the cloth is most remarkable archaeologist jim ayres said 
it could help us put a date on things 
birkby said wednesdays findings suggest the bodies of the men 
were wrapped in burlap and buried in a mass grave 
packer who formed a goldhunting party of five other men said 
the group became stranded on a snowpacked mountain ridge two miles 
south of lake city he claimed shannon bell a member of the party 
killed the other four goldseekers and that he was forced to kill 
bell in selfdefense packer also admitted to consuming the remains 
of the five men in order to survive 
he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to serve 40 years 
in prison 
george washington university law professor james starrs organized 
the archaeologists search for the truth about what occurred

a vermont supreme court justice ordered to 
retire because he turned 70 can remain on the bench under federal 
law prohibiting age discrimination a federal judge said in a ruling 
released today 
the vermont constitution requires all judges to retire at the end 
of the year in which they turn 70 
but justice louis peck who turned 70 in december refused to 
retire saying federal law superseded the state constitutional 
provision the state attorney generals office agreed with peck 
the state filed suit to force peck off the bench but us 
district judge lee gagliardi said peck can remain on the job 
peck said today he was extremely pleased by the decision but 
added thats the battle it is not the war 
it is very likely there will be an appeal said peck i 
expect the state will appeal and we will have to wait for that 
william gray a burlington lawyer who represented the state in 
the case said he had just received the decision and was not 
prepared to comment 
previously gray and lawyers for peck had said an appeal to the 
2nd us circuit court of appeals was probable no matter which way 
gagliardi decided 
the lawyers have said the issue is not likely to be settled until 
the us supreme court rules on the question the 1st us circuit 
court of appeals which has no jurisdiction over vermont ruled 
against a justice in a massachusetts case last year 
the federal age discrimination in employment act which prohibits 
mandatory retirement provisions contains exceptions elected 
officers the personal staff of elected officers and policymaking 
appointees 
the 1st circuit ruling in the massachusetts case found that 
judges are policymakers 
but gagliardi specifically disagreed with that ruling 
a judges principal activity is to decide cases between 
litigants he said 
gagliardi is himself 70 he is one of roughly 300 federal judges 
on senior status they are semiretired determine their own 
workload and handle about 15 percent of federal cases 
peck is one of five justices on the state supreme court 
vermonts highest court and only appeals court he was appointed to 
the court in 1981 and has three more years in his term and would 
then have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court 
he has said he might consider retiring before his term is up but 
only if the age issue was settled

a former exxon computer operator who 
destroyed records on the exxon valdez oil spill has sued the 
company accusing it of wrongfully firing and slandering him 
the lawsuit was filed wednesday in state district court in 
houston on behalf of kenneth a davis his attorney david berg said 
in a telephone interview the amount of damages sought by 
houstonbased exxon co usa was not specified 
berg said davis will give alaska officials a sworn statement 
explaining how the computerized records were erased only if a judge 
is present to protect his client from harassment by exxon lawyers 
davis 33 has acknowledged that on june 57 he and three other 
employees recorded over computer files containing information on the 
march 24 grounding of the exxon valdez 
the lawsuit charges that exxon fired davis to make him a 
scapegoat for the companys violation of court orders to perserve 
documents on the tankers spill of nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil 
the lawsuit says the destroyed records were the only complete 
file exxon had on the spill and that there is no way to verify 
whether the oil company has other copies 
exxon attorneys in a memorandum filed wednesday in anchorage 
superior court say the erased files were backup copies that it was 
not required to preserve 
davis says in the lawsuit that he erased the first tapes april 24 
on the orders of supervisor randall parrott even after davis 
indicated to parrott that the tapes contained records from the day 
of the spill 
davis was fired june 9 for insubordination he says in the 
lawsuit that he had received dozens of memos praising his work 
exxons memorandum describes davis as a disgruntled worker who 
after his firing took unfounded allegations to a reporter 
exxon attorney douglas serdahely in anchorage said late wednesday 
that he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it 
the crippled tanker has been moved to within seven to 10 miles of 
san clemente island about 60 miles southwest of san diego where it 
is scheduled to undergo 25 million in repairs lawyers for exxon 
shipping co and state agencies were negotiating over conditions for

as namibias last political prisoners and hundreds of cheering 
supporters escorted them back to their hometown in this south 
africanruled territory 
their group the southwest african peoples organization or 
swapo said it had unearthed 27 bodies in a mass grave swapo fought 
the south africans in a 23year bush war and it is now favored in 
elections expected in november 
territorial authorities acknowledged burying 11 guerrillas but 
dismissed the report of 27 bodies 
the released prisoners were placed in a bus that took them back 
to the katatura black township on the edge of windhoek the bus was 
surrounded by a crowd of up to 300 cheering jogging supporters as 
it crawled the two miles from windhoek central prison to the 
township 
territorial administrator louis pienaar announced wednesday he 
would free the 24 men whom he called the last political prisoners in 
namibia also known as southwest africa however he said eight 
others held in connection with political violence would remain in 
prison 
pienaar previously linked the release of political prisoners to 
freedom for people he say swapo holds in angolan zambian and 
tanzanian camps pienaar said he changed his mind when un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar assured him the united 
nations would seek the return to namibia of all swapo detainees 
perez de cuellar is in the territory for talks on a 
unmonitored independence process that south africa approved in 
december the transition began in april 
swapo has said it released all of its 201 detainees but 
relatives and the freed detainees themselves said nearly 2000 more 
detainees are in swapo camps 
when the 24 prisoners held by authorities returned home today 
swapos information secretary hidipo hamutenya announced on a 
loudspeaker that on saturday the group had dug up 27 bodies from a 
mass grave where they were dumped last week by territorial police in 
ovamboland in northern namibia 
hamutenya said un forces were present during the unearthing he 
gave no further details 
senior un officials could not be reached because they flew to 
the north early today with perez de cuellar to inspect security 
there 
gerhard roux a spokesman for pienaar questioned whether un 
officials were present at such an unearthing he said they did not 
mention it when de cuellar met with pienaar on wednesday 
inspector kerrie du rand of the southwest african police said 
police had buried in the bush 11 bodies of swapo guerrillas on 
friday he said the guerrillas were killed during battles in april 
that nearly derailed the independence process 
du rand said the bodies had been kept in a refrigerator at the 
oshakati morgue but had been unclaimed he called the figure of 27 
bodies blatant propaganda

a natural gas line beneath a rocket fuel 
plant destroyed in an explosion last year was under too much 
pressure but didnt cause the blast state regulators have concluded 
the state public service commission investigative report into the 
pacific engineering and production co explosion in may 1988 also 
cited inadequate recordkeeping and inspections by the gas supplier 
southwest gas corp 
but the three probable noncompliances identified during the 
course of the investigation were not responsible for the pepcon fire 
and explosions the commissions staff reported wednesday 
the explosion killed two people injured 326 and caused 73 
million in damage pepcon sued southwest for 30 million claiming 
the utilitys pipeline was primarily responsible and has since 
relocated its plant in utah 
the reports finding runs counter to theories that a huge gas 
leak triggered the blast or that a small gas leak over a 2week 
period before the explosion had saturated the ground and caused a 
fire that led to the explosion 
a county fire department report has said the explosion was 
touched off by a welders torch that ignited large quantities of 
ammonium perchlorate a component used in solid rocket fuel 
the state report released on the condition that it not be used 
for any litigation said commission engineers determined that 
southwest was generally operating within federal pipeline safety 
rules 
however at the time of the explosion southwests 16inch gas 
supply line buried beneath the pepcon plant was under 308 to 310 
pounds per square inch of pressure slightly above the 300pound 
maximum the report states 
the report said the pressure was not considered by staff to be 
detrimental to the serviceability of the pipeline 
the report also says southwest was over the 15month time limit 
for a pipe station inspection but there was no evidence of a leak 
in the line 
southwest hadnt opposed release of the commission report saying 
it would vindicate the utility

scientists have discovered that a simple kind of 
yeast creates excellent specimens of a new kind of matter 
semiconducting crystals so small they behave somewhat like 
individual atoms or molecules 
the yeast organisms produce the tiny crystals when exposed to 
cadmium a highly toxic metal in a process that apparently 
detoxifies the metal 
semiconducting crystals are the basis of chips that are used for 
all kinds of electronic devices studying the tiny yeastgenerated 
crystals should help researchers understand how small transistors 
can be shrunk before they begin to take on the quantum properties of 
atoms and molecules losing their normal semiconducting properties 
a paper on the findings was published in the april 13 issue of 
the journal nature by physicists at atampt bell laboratories in murray 
hill nj and biochemists at the university of utah medical school 
in salt lake city 
it was not until the utah researchers contacted the bell labs 
scientists that the two groups realized the yeast had created the 
first biological specimens of the kind of particles the physicists 
were probing

rep gus savage dill faces a house ethics 
committee investigation into allegations he sexually assaulted a 
peace corps volunteer while on an official trip to africa 
obviously we believe people should be innocent until proven 
guilty said rep patricia schroeder dcolo one of three 
democrats who formally requested an investigation by the house 
ethics committee the panel must inquire when such a request is made 
but the behavior is fairly shocking if it proves to be true 
schroeder said theres just no excuse we cannot let power go 
to peoples heads 
the peace corps worker claims savage while on an official trip 
fondled her for more than two hours in the back of a 
chauffeurdriven embassy car in kinshasa the capital of zaire on 
march 19 according to several government officials 
savage denied the charge 
i did nothing thats what i did the black congressman told 
television reporters outside the capitol this lie was leaked by 
the state department for political reasons 
they tried to destroy dr martin luther king with a lie im 
in very good company savage said 
in calling for an ethics investigation schroeder was joined by 
democratic reps barney frank of massachusetts and matthew mchugh of 
new york 
we write to ask the ethics committee to inquire into the 
assertion that our colleague from illinois mr savage behaved 
improperly towards a federal employee while on a congressional 
tour said the letter sent to ethics committee chairman rep 
julian c dixon dcalif 
the letter noted that the lawmakers had no independent knowledge 
of the incident but added we believe that the accusation is 
sufficiently serious to justify your looking into it 
the state department has sent a separate confidential letter to 
the committee noting the allegations said jill gross of the 
agencys inspector generals office 
outside the committee room today dixon said the state department 
material was an assertion of what they believed to be the facts 
the committee met privately for 90 minutes today and dixon said 
afterward he had no announcements to make on the savage case or any 
other issues facing the panel 
the incident allegedly occurred while savage was on a visit to 
zaire and had dinner one night at the residence of us ambassador 
william harrop 
those attending the dinner included the peace corps volunteer 
who was scheduled to brief the congressman a few days later on 
agency activities there said a peace corps official who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity 
after dinner savage insisted the woman ride alone with him in an 
embassy limousine while the congressman members of his staff and 
others visited area bars the official said 
he tried to force me to have sex with him he kept touching 
me after i told him to stop many times loudly she was quoted 
as saying in wednesdays editions of the washington post 
savage offered reporters a different version 
we were in a caravan of four or five cars he said we made 
four or five brief stops and got out of the car and got back in if 
there were any kind of abuse then why would she keep getting back 
into the same car 
the woman left her post in zaire for six weeks of counseling and 
medical treatment at a washington hospital and is awaiting another 
peace corps assignment the agency official said 
but the 28yearold worker whose name has not been disclosed 
had declined to file a formal complaint against savage believing it 
would hurt the peace corps the official said 
savage 63 has encountered criticism before for absenteeism in 
congress and globetrotting appearances for questionable causes 
accused by government agencies of failing to disclose sources of 
funds and investigated for personnel practices 
but he remains popular in his chicago district winning 
reelection last november with 83 percent of the vote 
savage was first elected to congress in 1980 and the chicago 
suntimes said that during his first year he participated in only 51 
percent of the recorded votes 
the following january savage showed up at a demonstration in 
lisbon portugal leading 50000 demonstrators against american 
policy who were described as mainly communist trade unionists

the nations top immigration appeals official 
took part three ago in a secret committee that shaped plans to 
apprehend and deport alien terrorists according to government 
documents 
it was a clear conflict of interest for david milhollan to 
serve on a policymaking panel while he supervised the immigration 
courts said marc van der hout attorney for eight los angelesarea 
immigrants fighting deportation 
van der hout said milhollans dual functions prejudiced a 
government case against the immigrants seven palestinians and a 
kenyan 
in a legal brief justice department lawyers argued that van der 
houts allegations have no relevance to his clients case 
because the immigration and naturalization service not milhollan 
filed the charges 
milhollan is director of the executive office for immigration 
review in falls church va which oversees the nations two dozen 
immigration courts and all immigration appeals 
the alien border control committee on which milhollan served 
sought to expeditiously remove terrorist aliens found within the 
united states and deport alien activists who are not in 
conformity with their immigration status according to the 
documents obtained under the freedom of information act 
also on the panel were the director of the justice departments 
office of immigration litigation which is prosecuting van der 
horns clients and representatives of the fbi the cia and the 
state department 
its outrageous that a government official supposed to be 
sitting in a judicial capacity would be meeting with the 
prosecutorial arm of the agency whose cases hes reviewing van 
der hout said 
its like a federal judge meeting with prosecutors in advance 
of trying a case he said 
van der hout and other lawyers for the immigrants have petitioned 
us district judge stephen v wilson to summon milhollan to testify 
about his role 
the eight immigrants were arrested in january 1987 and jailed for 
almost two weeks on charges that they belonged to a palestinian 
group with a history of terrorism the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine 
in december wilson overturned several key provisions of the 
mccarranwalter act which authorized the deportation of aliens who 
advocate communism totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful 
destruction of property 
the government has appealed that decision

a us offer to pay 30 million to 
families of those killed when an iranian jetliner was shot down by 
the uss vincennes demonstrated washingtons low regard for iranian 
lives a tehran newspaper said thursday 
the kayhan international newspaper said the us compensation 
offer was an attempt to counter an iranian lawsuit against 
washington at the world court 
the state department said monday it would pay up to 250000 for 
each fulltime wage earner and up to 100000 for others killed when 
the iran air jetliner was shot down july 3 last year 
the us offer followed the filing of claims in a washington 
court on behalf of more than 200 heirs seeking a total of 1455 
million in compensation for their dead relatives 
kayhan said that the us offer of 100000 for nonwage earners 
was not even a respectable illegal kickback in washington these 
days 
each life at 100000 equals the price tag for four oliver 
north speeches three speeches by nancy reagan and two by ronald 
reagan that is cheap the islamic republic news agency quoted the 
newspaper as saying 
there were 250 iranians and 40 citizens of other countries aboard 
the iran air jet when it was shot down by the vincennes all 290 
were killed 
a us military inquiry determined that radar operators aboard 
the vincennes which had earlier clashed with iranian gunboats had 
mistaken the jetliner for an f14 fighter on an attack course 
kayhan said washingtons compensation offer was far lower than 
what american families were paid by iraq for 37 crewmen killed in an 
iraqi air attack on the us frigate stark in may 1987 iraq said 
the pilot mistook the stark for an iranian warship 
iraq paid about 740000 to each of the slain mens families 
the stark settlement totaled about 27 million for 37 crewmen 
killed in the attack while the us offer amounted to 30 million 
for 290 lives irna quoted kayhan as saying

soviet tv viewers finally got a chance thursday to 
see what the rest of the world saw 20 years ago the first steps by 
a man on the moon 
staterun tv featured a lengthy documentary on the apollo 11 
lunar landing by astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin 
including interviews with us scientists 
on july 20 1969 soviet television ignored the historic landing 
that millions around the world witnessed live and instead broadcast 
a musical variety show 
thursdays 20th anniversary documentary showed footage from the 
moonwalk by armstrong and aldrin with the astronauts gathering 
samples of moon rocks the american flag was clearly visible 
the narrator of the documentary former soviet cosmonaut vitaly 
sevastyanov translated armstrongs famous first words on the moon 
into russian eto malyenky shag cheloveka i bolshoi skochok 
vsyevo chelovechestva thats one small step for a man one 
giant leap for mankind 
thursdays broadcast shown on a weekday morning that hardly 
guaranteed a wide audience followed a july 10 article in ogonyok 
magazine that said it was wrong to hide the moon landing from the 
soviet people the article also gave a detailed description of the 
lunar landing 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness soviet media have reported on many topics they 
once did not cover 
soviet tv carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the us 
apollo and soviet soyez capsules in 1975 but largely ignored the 
american program to land a man on the moon

a former aide to ptl founder jim bakker 
testified in court today that the evangelist gave him the authority 
to take large cash advances and use ministry credit cards 
david taggart and his brother james are charged with evading 
525000 in federal income taxes while associated with ptl 
under questioning by defense lawyer ben cotten david taggart 
said that as a vice president of the ministry he had direct 
authority from bakker to take large cash advances sign ptl checks 
use ptl credit cards and authorize bonuses for ptl employees 
taggart said he gained the authority when bakker and his wife 
tammy lured him back to the ministry after a brief absence he 
attributed to exhaustion 
the cash advances taggart said were used primarily for trips by 
the bakkers on ministry business he claimed that money used for 
personal expenses was reimbursed but said i always have been lax 
about documentation its never been a priority 
taggarts testimony came a day after bakker invoked his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination in refusing to answer 
questions by defense and prosecuting attorneys bakkers 10minute 
appearance in the federal courtroom was without the presence of the 
jury 
when his trial comes about there will be no taking of the 
fifth amendment and no refusal to answer any questions that the 
government cares to ask and to go into the entire matter in depth 
said bakker attorney george t davis 
bakker and former top ptl aide richard dortch are scheduled to go 
on trial for conspiracy and wire and mail fraud on aug 28 
after bakker refused to answer questions judge robert potter 
released the witness saying this court will not force him to 
testify 
cotten said he is barred from mentioning to the jury that bakker 
ever appeared in court 
james taggart took the stand wednesday and described his 
association with bakker 
both taggarts were fired when jerry falwell took over at the 
television ministry following bakkers resignation in march 1987 
following revelations of the jessica hahn sexandmoney scandal

over objections by consumer and environmental 
groups the senate on thursday approved legislation designed to 
revitalize the governments moneylosing uranium enrichment 
operations which make fuel used in nuclear reactors 
the vote was 7326 a similar bill in the house has not been 
voted out of committee 
the senate measure would convert the energy departments uranium 
enrichment operations to a government corporation a move that some 
consumer and environmental groups claim would amount to a 9 billion 
bailout of the nuclear industry 
this is just another attempt by the nuclear industry to raid 
the treasury said daniel borson an nuclear specialist for the 
environmental group public citizen his group had lobbied senate 
members to defeat the measure 
the bill would do nothing to prevent the uranium enrichment 
program from incurring more debt and eating up more taxpayer money 
in the future borson added 
the legislation is sponsored by sen wendell ford dky whose 
state is host to one of the two energy department enrichment 
facilities the other is in ohio 
the proposal has strong backing by the bush administration and 
the nuclear industry 
the american nuclear energy council representing utilities and 
others in the nuclear business called the senate vote a major 
step toward increasing the competitiveness of the enrichment 
enterprise that nuclear utilities are dependent upon 
the government is the only domestic supplier of enriched uranium 
which is the fuel used in nuclear reactors the departments plants 
increase or enrich uranium235 atoms beyond their natural 
concentration 
electricity consumers will benefit because competitively priced 
enrichment services will keep nuclear fuel costs low said edward 
m davis president of the nuclear council 
the proposed new corporation would be independent of the federal 
bureaucracy and could make financing and operating decisions without 
prior approval from congress 
the administration says this conversion would make the enrichment 
operation more sound and capable of competing against foreign 
suppliers of enrichment services including the soviet union which 
now supplies some us nuclear utilities 
the plants also enrich uranium for use in government reactors 
that make materials for nuclear warheads 
environmentalists and some other citizen groups contend that 
since the utilities benefit from operation of plants built decades 
ago with taxpayers money the industry should be held responsible 
for the debt incurred by the plants 
the energy department says the industry should not be held 
accountable because the plants operation benefit the whole country 
it also says there is 3 billion in outstanding debt not the 9 
billion claimed by public citizen

the us attorney in miami has received 
fbi files on lawyerpilot thomas root and is looking into 
contradictions in his account of his 800mile autopilot flight a 
spokeswoman confirmed today 
a source close to the investigation told the associated press 
that it would probably examine filing of false information about a 
flight and liability for expenses of search and rescue after root 
ditched in bahamian waters 
diane cossins executive assistant to us attorney dexter 
lehtinen confirmed that the office is looking into the case adding 
we will not discuss any matters concerning an ongoing 
investigation 
she said however that the fbi had turned over material at 
lehtinens request including details of interrogation of root by 
fbi agents at the hospital 
todd root said today that his brother has no explanation for 
reports by pilots who intercepted the flight a week ago that they 
saw roots head move when he said he was flying unconscious he said 
thomas root would stay in the hospital for another week for testing 
we hope the medical tests will finally end this mystery and put 
this all to rest he said noting that the battery of tests might 
include psychological testing 
various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the 
right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted 
from the left his head would move to the left andrew alston a 
national transportation safety board investigator said wednesday 
he said the planes sun visor was moved at least three times 
during the flight too 
still alston who interviewed the 36yearold washington 
communications attorney again wednesday at hollywoods memorial 
hospital refused to secondguess the pilot 
he was there you werent i wasnt alston said 
alston wouldnt say whether root could face charges for 
misleading ntsb investigators 
fbi spokesman paul miller said his agency also is continuing to 
investigate the case adding 
we anticipate that once all our facts are developed we will 
again discuss the matter with the us attorneys office in miami 
results of roots blood test for carbon monoxide were negative 
ruling out that explanation for his claimed loss of consciousness 
authorities said wednesday results of drug and alcohol tests are 
expected later this week 
the pilot says he was on a routine business flight passed out 
and must have been shot when his handgun accidentally went off 
before he regained consciousness in bahamian waters 
root who remained in stable condition with a gunshot wound in 
his stomach maintains the 32caliber smith amp wesson revolver he 
kept in the planes glove compartment must have discharged during 
the crash 
but smith amp wesson officials said the guns safety features make 
such accidental misfirings impossible and police and doctors said 
medical evidence indicates root must have been shot several hours 
before his small plane went down 
roots plane lies beneath several thousand feet of water off the 
bahamian island of eleuthera miller said a decision on whether the 
plane should be raised for evidence would probably be made in 
washington 
also wednesday root was sued in federal court in washington by a 
georgia company that accused him of breach of contract and 
unlawfully converting money to his own use 
root is accused by sonrise management services inc of columbus 
ga of failing to perform work he had agreed to do in representing 
investors before the federal communications commission it also 
accused him of double billing sonrise resulting in overpayments of 
nearly 100000 
since march 1986 sonrise has paid root 19 million as an 
advance against legal fees and expenses and to reimburse him for fcc 
filing and hearing fees the suit said 
on july 3 a separate suit in federal court in macon ga 
accused root of legal malpractice breach of contract and fraud in 
handling a 75000 transaction for dr kenneth bazemore of byron ga 
bazemores suit contends root sent the money meant as an 
initial payment for two broadcast companies to ralph savage 
chairman of sonrise without permission

a massive electronic network linking more than 
60000 computers remains vulnerable to potentially crippling attack 
by computer viruses the general accounting office said thursday 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said the white house 
science adviser should oversee efforts to help protect the network 
internet from sabotage 
in a report the agency said lax security procedures on internet 
contributed to the severity of problems that resulted when a 
software virus infected the system last november crippling 
thousands of computers 
internet the main computer network used by the us research 
community comprises more than 500 national regional and local 
networks nationwide and overseas handling unclassified information 
two of the largest component networks are sponsored by the 
pentagons defense advanced research projects agency and the 
national science foundation 
the gao report was released at a hearing of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance 
jack l brock jr director of the gaos government information 
and financial management division told the panel that since the 
virus attack last fall security has been strengthened on many 
computers connected to internet 
however we still feel that the lack of central control over 
security remains a problem he testified 
rep edward j markey j markey dmass chairman of the 
subcommittee asked brock whether internet was still vulnerable to 
computer viruses and other types of software sabotage 
the gao official responded sure no open system can ever be 
completely secure 
computer viruses are generally small strings of computer codes 
that can infiltrate software programs and replicate themselves 
thousands of times causing computer systems to crash in some 
cases they can surreptitiously alter or destroy computer data 
also testifying at the hearing was john landry appearing on 
behalf of adapso the computer software and services industry 
association 
he noted that virus attacks can be lifethreatening recently a 
computer used in realtime control of a medical experiment was 
attacked if the attack had not been detected a patient might have 
been injured or worse 
the risk of loss of life resulting from infections of airline 
traffic control or nuclear plant monitoring systems is easily 
imaginable said landry executive vice president of cullinet 
software inc westwood mass 
the gao report noted that currently there is no lead agency or 
organization responsible for internetwide management 
responsiblility for computer security rests largely with the host 
sites that own and operate the computers 
to help ensure needed security improvements the gao recommended 
that the presidents science adviser through the white house office 
of science and technology policy coordinate the establishment of 
an interagency group to serve as the internet security focal 
point 
it said this group should 
provide internetwide security policy direction and 
coordination 
support continuing efforts to enhance internet security 
obtain the involvement of internet users software vendors 
technical advisory groups and federal agencies regarding security 
issues 
become an integral part of the structure that emerges to manage 
a highspeed national research network planned for the 1990s

the naacp called on civil rights leaders 
thursday to join a silent march to protest what they described as 
illogical irrational and unexplainable supreme court decisions 
we cannot stand by and let four men and one woman in black 
robes halt our longdelayed march to freedom any more than we 
allowed people in white robes to do so said benjamin l hooks 
executive director of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people 
hooks called on thought leaders of the minority community in 
the united states to gather in washington on aug 26 for a silent 
march to protest the recent court decisions 
it is illogical irrational and unexplainable he said 
in particular hooks cited recent decisions overturning a 
richmond va plan that set aside some city contracts for minority 
businesses permitting a reverse discrimination lawsuit by white 
firefighters in birmingham ala and weakening protection for people 
seeking to prove racial discrimination in jobs and contracts 
this present supreme court is more dangerous to the legitimate 
hopes and aspirations of black people in this nation than any 
george wallace proclaiming segregation forever or any ross barnett 
standing in the schoolhouse door saying they shall not pass 
hooks told a news conference 
hooks a former memphis tenn judge said he still respects the 
institution of the supreme court but termed the recent rulings 
berserk and tragic 
hooks explained that a decision to hold a silent march recalled 
1917 when several thousand blacks marched silently in the streets 
of new york to protect recent race riots in waco memphis and st 
louis participants in the upcoming march will be asked to dress the 
same as they did then men in black women in white 
the plan is not for a massive march and there is no desire to 
disrupt city life on aug 26 said hooks 
we are not trying to mobilize large numbers we are trying to 
mobilize the leaders said hooks frankly if we have 1000 to 
2000 people ill be happy provided they represent the scope and 
depth of the people 
he said that organization of the effort is just beginning that 
that while he is inviting all people of conscience to 
participate he has not yet contacted other groups about joining the 
effort 
other organizations such as the urban league national council of 
negro women leadership conference on civil rights and league of 
united latin american citizens had no immediate reaction to hooks 
plan

an obsessed fan of actress rebecca schaeffer 
wrote her a rambling love letter kept videos of her tv show my 
sister sam and stalked her before shooting her to death police 
alleged after arresting the man 
robert john bardo 19 was being held in arizona today while los 
angeles authorities pursued extradition tucson police picked him up 
wednesday as he was dodging cars on a freeway there 
bardo appeared before a tucson magistrate this morning via 
closedcircuit television from the pima county jail magistrate 
clifford hofmann entered a plea of innocent for bardo on a 
misdemeanor count of obstructing a street or highway 
he remained in jail pending a court appearance later today in the 
murder case 
los angeles investigators flew to tucson where bardo gave police 
statements related to the murder of rebecca schaeffer los 
angeles police detective dan andrews said 
i dont want to say he confessed but he implicated himself 
for sure the detective said 
the unemployed fastfood worker from tucson was an obsessive fan 
of miss schaeffer said deputy district attorney robert e savitt 
who filed a complaint charging him with murder 
the 21yearold costar of the old television sitcom my sister 
sam and the current film scenes from the class struggle in 
beverly hills was shot once in the chest tuesday morning at the 
door of her apartment building 
a female friend of bardos living in tennessee called police 
headquarters early wednesday to tell police of his obsession 
andrews said 
he expressed a fixation with miss schaeffer he appeared to be 
very fond of her andrews said 
according to the woman bardo said he had a video collection of 
my sister sam shows and an autographed publicity photo of miss 
schaeffer andrews said about a year ago bardo had sent a letter 
to the actress but there is no indication she had ever seen it 
andrews said 
i wouldnt call it a threatening letter i would call it an 
affectionate letter but a bit rambling andrews said 
he also expressed to his friend that he was going to harm miss 
schaeffer but it was unclear to investigators why he might want 
to andrews said 
the guys real passive with everybody hes being passive and 
polite with everybody tucson police spokesman sgt paul hallums 
said after the arrest 
the gun in the killing apparently was discarded and has not been 
found police believe bardo returned to tucson where he lives with 
his parents late tuesday aboard a greyhound bus bardo apparently 
had visited california several times during the past year andrews 
said 
there is an indication that there was an ongoing attempt to 
contact her andrews said adding that bardo had called miss 
schaeffers agency several times 
apparently bardo called his friend in tennessee shortly before 
he arrived at miss schaeffers home telling her he was nearing her 
residence 
witnesses identified bardo from a photograph police allege that 
the suspect loitered near miss schaeffers apartment for about four 
hours 
police found no indication that miss schaeffer was being harassed 
she didnt have an enemy in the world said her agent 
jonathan howard she was a very successful young actress on the 
ascent getting job after job i cant believe this has happened 
miss schaeffer appeared on my sister sam on cbs with pam 
dawber from 1986 to 1988 playing patti russell the younger sister 
of miss dawbers character sam 
the killing was chillingly reminiscent of other attacks by fans 
on celebrities including the one suffered by raging bull 
actress theresa saldana in 1982 when a deluded fan stabbed her 
repeatedly with a hunting knife outside her home 
miss saldana survived the attack for which a drifter received a 
12year prison sentence a prison psychiatrist has said the man was 
diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic 
on wednesday miss saldana said i feel overwhelming sadness 
for rebecca being a fellow actress and at this time for her family 
who must be devastated 
this is a very sad day for me and others in the business

a supreme court judge ruled 
thursday in favor of cbs news saying police cannot confiscate news 
footage merely on the suspicion it might contain evidence of a 
violation of emergency regulations 
judge jeff levison order the law and order ministry to pay court 
costs and return the original news tape that had been seized feb 9 
from a freelance cameraman working for cbs 
police had allowed cbs to make a copy of the tape showing a 
lawyers meeting in a church during the national hunger strike by 
people detained without charge under the threeyear national state 
of emergency 
levisons ruling reviewed the statements made by police capt 
gls van huyssteen and former cbs producer brenda goldblatt 
indicating the officer had given several reasons at different times 
for confiscating the film 
van huyssteen said he had noticed azhar cachalia a prominent 
antiapartheid activist and attorney talking to a journalist at the 
lawyers meeting and suspected he might have violated emergency 
restrictions that prohibit him from addressing a public meeting or 
giving news interviews 
levison said van huyssteen realized that the tape could contain 
proof of the breach of the conditions and resolved that it would be 
necessary to have a video version of the proceedings in order to 
have evidence of cachalias offense he therefore instructed his 
policemen to send for the police video team 
later there was doubt as to whether the police camera was 
working properly so he resolved to seize the video film of one of 
the journalists present the judge said 
the policeman didnt know what cachalia was talking to the 
journalist about and even if he had breached his restrictions the 
discussion could not possibly lead to a danger to the public 
safety levison said 
the emergency regulations require a policeman to form an opinion 
that an action endangers the public safety before it can be stopped 
or evidence seized levison said 
all this decision really does is underline that as wide as 
police powers are in terms of emergency regulations they still do 
have to apply their minds and there are certain parameters said 
lauren jacobson the attorney who filed the cbs suit they cant 
simply walk in and take a tape on the vague expectation that it 
might contain something

officials already are making plans for the 1990 
census getting a sixmonth jump on most of the rest of the country 
because the us census bureau chose it as the model city 
phoenix will share the results of its extensive planning with 
cities throughout the country said norris nordvold the citys 
liaison with the census bureau 
we have about 140 people serving on 11 subcommittees putting 
together plans to make sure everyone is counted nordvold said 
that includes detailed plans to count homeless people 
although most cities wont start planning for the census until 
about november the phoenix effort has been under way since march 
nordvold said he said a cookbook of recommendations will be 
prepared to help other cities 
the census bureau chose phoenix because of mayor terry 
goddards enthusiasm for the project the citys mixture of 
minorities and its growth rate over the last decade according to 
a newsletter published by the bureaus regional office in lakewood 
colo 
an accurate count is important to local governments because state 
and federal funds are distributed on the basis of population 
nordvold said 
that comes to about 175 per person in phoenix he said if 
youre not counted we miss that much 
in addition nordvold said arizona possibly could gain two 
congressional seats if we do a good job and count everyone 
ellen dumm spokeswoman for the lakewood census bureau office 
said special efforts would be made to count minorities and the 
homeless 
minorities were undercounted by an estimated 5 percent to 7 
percent in 1980 but the 1987 immigration reform and control act 
which granted amnesty to many aliens who had been in the country 
illegally should make the count somewhat easier this time nordvold 
said 
were getting a lot more cooperation from hispanic groups 
because there isnt the fear this year of someone wearing a badge 
and coming around saying hes representing the federal government 
he said 
ms dumm said census takers would spend the night of march 20 
counting homeless people the first time that there has been an 
organized effort to count the homeless 
from 6 pm to midnight they will visit shelters soup kitchens 
and other places frequented by homeless people she said from 
midnight to 4 am they will count homeless people on the streets 
and from 4 am to 6 am they will count people leaving buildings 
where homeless people are known to sleep she said

contacts but the amendments would also stop us funds from 
supporting trade with china and suspend satellite exports and 
nuclear cooperation 
the two houses have yet to reconcile the differences in their 
bills 
in a separate protest a chinese legislative committee said the 
amendments willfully distorted the facts about the armys june 
34 attack in beijing on the studentled protesters for a freer 
society 
the foreign affairs committee of the national peoples congress 
accused us legislators of having unspecified ulterior motives 
and warned that efforts to pressure china like lifting a rock 
only to drop it on ones own feet will ultimately hurt the 
interests of the united states itself 
china has strongly objected to all foreign criticism of the army 
attack and subsequent arrests and executions but the united states 
viewed by many of the protesters as a model of democracy has been 
most heavily attacked in a blitz of broadcast and newspaper 
commentaries 
china has protested the us embassy giving refuge to dissidents 
fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian while the united states has 
protested an attack by chinese soldiers on foreign diplomats 
uschina relations have been strained before over trade taiwan 
and chinas policy in tibet but never since ties were restored in 
1979 have emotions on both sides run so high 
there are some people a small group of people who think the 
united states is a bad influence and want to see the influence 
limited said a us diplomat on condition of anonymity but he 
said he did not expect the quarrel to lead to a break in ties 
ms li meanwhile said chinese soldiers were acting according 
to their orders and performing their normal tasks in searching 
foreign diplomats cars at checkpoints in beijing and sometimes 
sticking guns in their faces 
military checkpoints go up around beijing after midnight and 
several diplomats have reported soldiers searched their cars in 
apparent violation of diplomatic immunity 
she also defended the governments seizure of foreign newspapers 
and magazines at stores and hotels in beijing last week 
we do not refuse all foreign books and magazines and 
newspapers she said although she could not name any not banned 
but we do not allow those foreign magazines and newspapers whose 
content interferes in chinas internal affairs to spread 
unchecked on chinese soil this is quite natural 
in paris student leader wuer kaixi and four other men who have 
fled china called on all people in the world blessed with a moral 
conscience to come to our aid and help us put an end immediately to 
these atrocious acts of repression 
they said a confidential report in china reported more than 
120000 arrests in the suppression of the democracy movement since 
early june and more than 100 secret executions in beijing 
wuer said they had received confirmation earlier in the day that 
top student leader wang dan had been captured after more than a 
month in hiding

meeting deficit reduction targets in fiscal 
1991 without a tax increase or a cutback in social security benefits 
would require a 10 percent acrosstheboard cut in federal spending 
the congressional budget office said tuesday 
the 74 billion to 88 billion in spending cuts needed to meet 
the fiscal 1991 defict tartget of 64 billion without raising taxes 
would likely force the economy into a recession unless the federal 
reserve board further loosens its reins on inflation substantially 
the house budget committee was told 
the central bank would have to permit faster money growth and a 
substantial decline in interest rates to offset the direct 
depressing effect of actions taken to reduce the deficit cbo 
director robert d reischauer told the panel 
fed chairman alan greenspan told the house banking committee that 
he is willing to push interest rates lower to avoid a recession but 
warned it is a difficult balancing act 
some day some event will end the extraordinary sting of 
economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982 he said 
reischauer put the chances of the economy slipping into a 
recession during the next nine months in the 15 percent to 40 
percent range 
retail sales have been disappointing in recent months but 
the weakness is at least partly offset by continued growth in 
personal income he said the stock market which has always 
fallen before in previous recessions continues to rise and the 
recent decline in interest rates is likely eventually to help 
housing and spending on durable goods 
but like the fed the cbo is forecasting a more modest 24 
percent rate of economic growth this year slowing to 2 percent in 
1990 the administration has predicted the economy will grow by 27 
percent this year and 26 percent next after adjustments for 
inflation 
the congressional forecasters also think inflation interest 
rates and unemployment for all of this year and 1990 will higher 
than what the administration has forecast but only slightly 
with the economy slowing it also predicts that civilian 
unemployment will rise from its current 53 percent to average 55 
percent in 1990 
the house committees chairman rep leon panetta dcalif said 
the cbos economic growth projections have consistently been less 
optimistic and more accurate that those of the administration 
despite the soft landing projected by both cbo and the 
administration panetta said it will be impossible to meet 
199193 deficit reductions targets of 64 billion 28 billion and 
zero without a tax increase or cuts in nonmeanstested 
entitlements such as social security 
reischauer said the cbo has reduced its estimate for the deficit 
for the current fiscal year that ends on sept 30 from 159 billion 
forecast last february to 150 billion 
although the 1989 deficit is almost certain to exceed the 
balanced budget act target of 136 billion it may not exceed the 
target by much more than 10 billion allowed in the law he said 
although the congressional auditors have not yet incorporated 
their economic projections into budget estimates reischauer said 
the deficit outlook for 1990 is unlikely to change substantially 
from cbos forecast of 1168 billion to 1401 billion 
the difference in those figues is whether congress includes the 
immediate 50 billion cost of the savings and loan bailout in the 
deficit as democrats want or finances it through 30year private 
bonds as advocated by president bush 
bushs sampl bailout plan would actually reduce the deficit by 3 
billion next year because the money collected through the bonds 
would count as revenues to the government

president bush said today the united states and 
israel would be the big losers if the senate seeks to bar us 
contacts with officials of the palestine liberation organization 
linked to terrorist attacks on americans 
in a letter to senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
bush said adoption of such a ban would interfere significantly 
with if not destroy us ability to promote peace in the middle 
east 
after six months of talks between us ambassador robert 
pelletreau and plo officials in tunisia the discussions are at a 
promising diplomatic juncture bush wrote this is not the 
time to take away from the executive a key tool of our diplomacy 
pelletreau is the designated us contact with the plo in the 
talks designed to encourage eventual discussions between israel and 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
mitchell signaled that he would seek to kill the move pressed by 
sen jesse helms rnc and offer instead compromise language that 
would give the administration greater flexibility to continue the 
current talks 
helms insisted that bush be required to certify that the united 
states was not dealing with plo officials who were in any way 
connected with terrorist acts against americans the compromise 
expected to be voted on later in the day would prohibit the 
contacts only if the president knows and advises congress that the 
officials directly participated in terrorism 
bush said the helms language would significantly and possibly 
decisively undermine the tunis talks and the peace process the 
big losers would be israel and ourselves i am sure that you and 
your colleagues would not want to assume such a responsibility he 
said 
but helms and other senators held out for requiring the president 
to make a certification to congress which the white house 
considered an infringement on its authority 
bush and his two principal foreign policy advisers secretary of 
state james a baker iii and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft had worked throughout the day on wednesday to kill the 
amendment by helms and sen john f kerry dmass barring talks 
with any plo official ever linked to the death injury or kidnapping 
of americans 
baker appearing on the macneillehrer newshour said the helms 
amendment would terminate the dialogue thats been established 
between united states and the plo 
we think its important that we maintain this dialogue if 
were going to make progress toward peace in the middle east 
baker added 
congressional sources said sens charles grassley riowa and 
daniel k inouye dhawaii also were among the holdouts 
bush who invited democratic and republican leaders of congress 
to the white house on wednesday for a report on his justcompleted 
trip to europe used the occasion to lobby against the amendment 
sen bob packwood rore said bush told the lawmakers that if 
you pass this amendment and shut down any negotiations with anybody 
thats ever even breathed on the plo thats a step backward not 
a step forward 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush told the 
lawmakers that at this point in the peace process fragile as it 
may be that these kinds of limitations would not be helpful 
the united states opened talks with the plo in december after 
arafat publicly renounced terrorism and accepted israels right to 
exist pelletreau has met periodically with plo officials without 
evidence of headway toward settling the arabisraeli dispute 
after it was disclosed he had held two unannounced meetings with 
saleh khalaf the security chief of the plo and arafats principal 
deputy supporters of israel led by helms and kerry developed their 
legislation to limit the contacts 
khalaf also known as abu iyad was the founder and leader of 
black september which carried out a massacre of israeli athletes at 
the olympic games in munich in 1972 he was also a suspect in the 
murder of cleo a noel jr the us ambassador to the sudan in 1973 
the proposed compromise has the effect of barring talks with 
organizers such as khalaf or the actual perpetrators of terrorism 
but not limiting talks with officials whose direct involvement was 
not clear 
the lawmakers voiced praise for bushs performance on his 10day 
fournation trip to europe and gave an early signal of strong 
support for his promise of 125 million to spur free enterprise in 
poland and hungary

investigators and rescue crews conducted 
an inchbyinch sweep today of the cornfield where a united 
dc10 crashed cartwheeling in a ball of flame and splitting apart 
at least 74 people were killed 
the airline said 186 of the 293 people aboard survived after the 
plane crippled by a loss of hydraulic power crashed during an 
emergency landing earlier the number of survivors had been put at 
176 
we feel pretty confident about that number russell mack a 
united spokesman said at an afternoon briefing but he added that 
the airline had not quite completed a list of passengers 
the plane hit the sioux gateway airport runway wednesday and 
cartwheeled in a ball of fire into the field but many survivors 
walked away from the crash 
today rescuers looked through the wreckage for victims if there 
were 74 dead and 186 survivors that would leave 33 people 
unaccountedfor 
its tragic what happened but amazing and delightful that so 
many survived rachel halterman national transportation safety 
board spokeswoman said today from the agencys makeshift command 
center in the sioux city convention center 
even the investigators cant say why so many people survived 
she added and there hasnt been time for speculation 
the idea is to form teams and start pulling together the clues 
it will be an inchbyinch thing ms halterman said the flight 
recorder will be going back to washington sometime today and well 
start interviewing the crew and the survivors eyewitnesses and 
everybody we can who has firsthand knowledge of the accident were 
also collecting maintenance records on the plane 
national guardsmen began working at daybreak collecting pieces 
of the wreckage which were strewn over an area the length of three 
football fields ambulances and refrigerated trailers for the 
storage of remains were parked along the runway where the plane hit 
before skidding into a field 
we swept the area four times last night for survivors if they 
were fatalities they just covered them up and went on said an 
official of the woodbury county civil defense and disaster agency 
who asked not to be identified today weve started removing 
bodies and everything else 
a flight attendant who survived the crash by crawling out of an 
opening in the burning wreckage was quoted by her parents as saying 
the lord opened up that hole to allow her to escape 
cnn reported that emergency officials believed most of the 
missing were in the fuselage and were fairly confident that anyone 
still in the wreckage was dead 
the 15yearold jumbo jet experienced complete hydraulic 
failure before the crash federal aviation administration 
spokesman fred farrar said parts of the plane were found 50 miles 
away 
flight attendant virginia jane murray 35 phoned her parents in 
chester sc to say she was all right 
she said she was tumbling said her father don murray the 
walls were coming in she said a hole opened up and the sunlight 
came in and she climbed out the hole she said she knew the lord 
opened up that hole 
murray said he did not know the extent of his daughters injuries 
except that she was not burned 
i thought i was going to die said 8yearold ben radtke of 
prairie view ill who was carried out of the fractured fuselage by 
a passenger the boy shaking but unhurt clutched a united airlines 
button and a pair of plastic pilots wings as he spoke 
flight 232 from denver to philadelphia via chicago carried 11 
crew members and 282 passengers including three infants said 
united spokesman lawrence nagin the plane has a capacity of 287 
passengers 
most of the survivors were sitting in the middle of the plane in 
rows 9 to 19 said dr david greco director of the emergency 
department and helicopter services for the marian health center 
where many of the injured were taken 
there was nothing left of the rear half of the aircraft first 
class was devastated greco said except for the midsection the 
rest of the aircraft was in tiny little debris 
the seattlebased cockpit crew was being treated for injuries at 
a hospital nagin said he identified the crew as capt ac haynes 
a 33year united veteran first officer wr records and second 
officer dj dvorak 
hydraulic systems provide power steering that allows pilots to 
manipulate the wing and tail controls of the jumbo jet without it 
aviation officials say the plane would be uncontrollable 
the tail engine failed and this may have caused a hydraulic

nearly half the american astronauts who flew in 
space shared a day of memories thursday with the president it was 
one small ceremony for man recalling one giant leap for mankind 
its hard to believe that 20 years have passed said 
president bush of mans first landing on the moon three days and 
three nights they journeyed it was a perilous unprecedented 
breathtaking voyage and each of us remember the night 
they were the men of apollo 11 which set down on the sea of 
tranquillity on july 20 1969 neil armstrong edwin buzz aldrin 
and michael collins 
on that day they were the only human beings away from their 
world on thursday they bathed in the glow of reminiscence outside 
the national air and space museum only a few feet from the command 
module columbia which carried them to the moon and into the history 
books 
behind them at the ceremony were models of the 36story rocket 
that lifted them from earth and the spindly legged lander that took 
armstrong and aldrin to the airless moon 
eagle the lander still is on the moon a souvenir of the brief 
visit that will remain for all eternity along with the american 
flag they planted and the footprints they left 
armstrong the first of 12 americans who walked the moon said 
the space effort in the 1960s had a nobility of purpose not to 
conquer enemies but to conquer ignorance 
buzz aldrin no 2 on the moon and now a strong advocate of 
proceeding onward to mars said the time for seizing the initiative 
in space is upon us 
and michael collins who orbited overhead as a lonely lifeguard 
while armstrong and aldrin pirouetted on the moon said we have 
rested on our apollo laurels long enough its time to get moving 
again 
the president had words for america 
for those old enough to remember that historic night 20 years 
ago step outside tonight with your children or your grandchildren 
lift your eyes skyward and tell them of the flag the american 
flag that still flies proudly in the ancient lunar soil 
project apollo the first men on the moon some called it 
quixotic impossible had never been done but america dreamed it 
and america did it 
among the 700 guests at the ceremony were 66 of the 126 americans 
who have gone into space including 21 of the 30 who flew on apollo 
they went for the most part unrecognized pete conrad and alan 
bean second on the moon on apollo 12 jim lovell and fred haise 
who were going there but didnt make it because of an explosion 
the third man on their apollo 13 voyage john swigert has died 
there were also eugene cernan and harrison schmitt the last on 
the moon more than 16 years ago 
in the crowd was thomas paine the nasa administrator then and 
more recently the architect of the plans for americas future in 
space that bush enunciated thursday 
that was first rate he said of the presidents speech a 
good beginning 
john young who made two apollo flights called it a great speech 
and said he wasnt disturbed that bush was not specific about time 
and costs for the program he envisioned nobody knows what it will 
cost said young who also has flown the space shuttle four times 
if anybody tells you the cost today dont believe it 
rusty schweickart who was on apollo 9 a moon flight rehearsal 
said part of the problem of apollo was it had a single 
wonderful goal but nothing to sustain the momentum 
richard truly twice a shuttle astronaut and now head of the 
space agency saw bushs speech as dynamite a clear road map 
in his speech bush said he is asking my right hand man vice 
president quayle chairman of the national space council to 
develop realistic timetables and milestones for future exploration 
and to report back 
quayle who has been out making prospace speeches said that 
when americans set their minds to acomplish something we always 
exceed our expectations 
he addressed the crowd as my fellow astronauts

as president bush announced us plans thursday for 
a manned outpost on the moon and sending astronauts to mars the 
soviet union is trying to come to grips with financial and political 
problems in its space program 
the soviets like the americans have considered a manned mission 
to mars and have laid the groundwork with longduration space 
station missions designed to test whether cosmonauts could withstand 
a long journey to the planet 
but as bush marked the 20th anniversary of the apollo 11 landing 
moscow is trying to decide whether it can afford expensive missions 
that once were routine those included the launches of the first 
satellite sputnik in 1957 and the first man in space yuri gagarin 
in 1961 
once touted as proof of the superiority of socialism a source of 
national pride and a sacred cow the soviet space program has now 
been criticized under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness 
with chronic shortages of everything from toothpaste to housing 
soviets are wondering whether the 238 billion spent on the manned 
space program since 1986 is worthwhile 
already soviet legislators looking for ways to cut a 162 
billion budget deficit have suggested slashing space spending 
in part for economic reasons the orbital platform mir the 
showcase of the soviet space program designed as the first building 
block of a permanently manned space station has been without a 
crew since april cosmonauts are not scheduled to reenter the 
station until late august 
adding fuel to the controversy were the november launch of the 
space shuttle buran whose development cost 10 billion the loss in 
september and march of two unmanned mars probes phobos i and ii at 
a cost of a halfbillion dollars and embarrassing delays caused by 
technical problems and human error in the landings of two crews from 
mir last year 
opposition also grew when soviet space officials hungry for 
foreign currency chose a japanese tv reporter and not a soviet who 
could only pay rubles for the first commercial trip to mir 
after 15 free flights with international crews the soviets are 
starting to charge foreign crews that want to travel to mir at a 
cost of 10 million to 12 million a shot 
the soviet space agency glavkomos also is seeking foreign 
customers for satellite launching and hopes to sell crystals grown 
in mirs zerogravity for use in electronics it also hopes to sell 
medicines manufactured on the space station 
the japanese mission and a flight by an austrian cosmonaut are 
scheduled for 1990 or 1991 in an entirely privately financed trip 
the first briton in space is to accompany two cosmonats to mir in 
1991 
as for the buran officials have not announced when it will fly 
again 
state tvs nightly news program vremya marked the apollo 11 
anniversary with a report repeating the traditional soviet charge 
that the united states is militarizing space 
correspondent boris kolyagin reported from washington that the 
united states had considered setting up a base on the moon before 
but that gradually other space programs plans for star wars 
pushed out the peaceful beginnings 
the report featured interviews with the three apollo 11 
astronauts but did not mention bushs speech which drew only a 
brief mention by the tass news agency 
earlier in the day soviet tv broadcast a lenghty documentary on 
the apollo 11 mission showing its viewers for the first time some 
of the footage from the historic july 20 1969 moon landing

burmas military government put the main 
opposition leader under house arrest thursday and soldiers sealed 
off her home in a rangoon suburb according to diplomatic reports 
from the burmese capital 
hundreds of students had defied martial law with antigovernment 
protests wednesday even though the opposition leader aung san suu 
kyi canceled a planned rally to avoid clashes with the large number 
of soldiers in the streets burmas official radio reported 44 
arrests 
a source in bangkok citing a report from a western embassy in 
the burmese capital said ms suu kyis compound was surrounded by 
troops and she tried to surrender herself to the military but 
they refused and they forced her back inside 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said a diplomat 
and tin oo coleader of ms suu kyis national league for 
democracy were turned away when they tried to see her 
no other details were available telephone and telex lines to 
rangoon from bangkok and other asian cities were out of order 
thursday 
in washington the state department confirmed ms suu kyi 44 
was under house arrest and that soldiers were blocking access to her 
home it said the arrest of opposition activists cast serious 
doubts on the governments stated intention of holding free 
elections next year 
rangoon radio did not mention ms suu kyi on thursday but said 
diplomats were being summoned to a meeting friday with the 
governments information committee 
it announced an amnesty for people tried on or before sept 18 
1988 gen saw maung the army commander seized power on that day 
and his soldiers killed hundreds of people demonstrating peacefully 
for democracy 
saw maung signed the amnesty order which commutes death 
sentences to life imprisonment reduces life terms to 10 years and 
cuts other sentences by onethird 
prisoners with two years or less to serve will be released and 
criminal cases still being heard will be closed with the exceptions 
of those involving high treason or violation of martial law the 
order said 
the bangkok source said the reason for ms suu kyis arrest was 
not clear but the government may have used violence during 
wednesdays martyrs day ceremonies as a pretext to move against her 
he said her arrest also might be linked to those of three members 
of her party accused of bombing a government oil refinery earlier 
this month three people were killed 
ms suu kyi whose father was an independence leader is the 
military governments most vocal critic western diplomats say the 
authorities have been concerned about the growing popularity that 
attracts thousands of people to her rallies 
aung san suu kyi has been looking for a confrontation the 
source in bangkok said now its happened 
ms suu kyi had planned to lead thousands in a march wednesday 
the anniversary of the day her father aung san and other burmese 
independence leaders were assassinated in 1947 burma became 
independent of britain in january 1948 
on wednesday ms suu kyi said she canceled the march because 
soldiers blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a 
killing field for the people 
in a telephone interview from rangoon she also said soldiers had 
beaten some of about 3000 students in the capitals swegondine 
district 
a western diplomat also reached by telephone said he saw 
soldiers pursue students down a side street drag some out and hit 
them with clubs then put 15 or 20 into a truck

republican congressman today sprayed with water 
an effigy of a texas flagburner and veterans groups urged 
lawmakers to undo the supreme court ruling that allows flag burning 
rep curt weldon rpa led more than a dozen gop house members 
armed with fire extinguishers and a bucket of water to the steps of 
the supreme court where television cameras were gathered to record 
a rumored flagburning by gregory lee johnson 
youre not going to come to capitol hill and burn the united 
states flag warned rep larkin smith rmiss 
the flag burning never occurred so the lawmakers sprayed and 
doused with water a stuffed dummy they called johnson that was held 
aloft by some antiflagburning protesters 
johnson whose 1984 flagburning conviction was thrown out by the 
supreme court last month held a news conference across the street 
and said he never intended to burn a flag today 
im not going to like fall into this silly trap he said 
earlier today veterans groups testified in support of 
congressional action to restore penalties for desecrating the flag 
two of the groups said a constitutional amendment was the only 
course of action but one said it could also support regular 
legislation if that would work 
choose whatever course of action is best for our nation and our 
flag and you will have the support of the disabled american 
veterans said john heilman the davs national legislative 
director 
heilmans openness to a regular statute to address the court 
ruling was at odds with representatives of the american legion and 
the veterans of foreign wars who told a house judiciary 
subcommittee that nothing less than amendment to the constitution 
would be satisfactory 
we must rally round our flag and pursue a constitutional 
amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of that flag said 
hf sparky gierke the legions national commander a poll 
commissioned by the legion found 75 percent of american believe such 
an amendment would not impinge on their constitutional rights he 
said 
freedom of expression can and should coexist with a sense of 
reverence for the flag and all that it means to americans james 
magill national legislative director of the vfw told the civil and 
constitutional rights subcommittee 
after four days of hearings including two days of testimony from 
legal scholars the house panel remained divided over how to 
overcome a supreme court decision on flag burning 
the liberal democrats on the panel remain adamantly opposed to a 
constitutional amendment and the republicans vow to push it through 
the idea of a constitutional amendment has been damaged 
severely in these hearings so far subcommittee chairman don 
edwards dcalif said wednesday 
he and other democrats said they were convinced by the experts to 
seek a regular statute over any amendment 
but senior committee republican jim sensenbrenner of wisconsin 
said how can we enact a statute to ban such flag burnings 
which does not relate to the suppression of free expression its a 
puzzle to me how you can get around that 
an unexpected argument against the political tide to reverse the 
high court ruling came wednesday from harvard university law 
professor charles fried who as president reagans solicitor general 
was the administrations chief advocate before the supreme court 
when the texas flagburning case came up before the court fried 
declined to advance an administration position a decision some say 
may have made the difference in the courts 54 ruling 
fried had been expected to tell the subcommittee that he didnt 
file then because he thought the texas law and the federal code were 
defective and could be fixed 
but fried agreed with other witnesses including rejected supreme 
court nominee robert bork that the arguments against a statute were 
devastating at the same time he called on congress to do 
nothing enact no statute no constitutional amendment 
whatever the technicalities the evident purpose of such a 
statute would still be to punish acts of expression he said 
america its traditions and values and its flag are important 
but foremost among those values is the principle that no one shall 
be punished for his political expressions no matter how offensive 
or bizarre he said recalling his own childhood flight from 
oppression in czechoslovakia 
i hope and urge and pray that we will not act that no statute 
be passed and of course that the constitution not be amended he 
said 
democrats told him that was no longer a viable political position 
the choice was only between a statute and an amendment 
but fried told the lawmakers there are times when you can earn 
your rather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing 
its called leadership 
edwards told reporters he still planned to send to the full house 
before the august recess a proposed statute crafted based on the 
expert testimony 
sensenbrenner urged edwards to send both the statute and a 
constitutional amendment to the floor an approach already adopted 
by senate leaders 
it is the right thing to do he said

the platte river in colorado and nebraska and 
the klamath river in oregon topped a list of the 10 most endangered 
rivers released by a national conservation group thursday 
other rivers included the american in california the penobscot 
in maine the payette in idaho the james river in virginia the 
little bighorn in wyoming the illinois bayou in arkansas the new 
river in north carolina and the animas in colorado 
these rivers are national treasures because of their free 
flowing nature ecological qualities and recreational values 
said w kent olson president of american rivers yet these 
outstanding rivers and often their scenic landscapes face 
imminent major threats from uneeded dams water projects or 
adverse land development 
olson said his group released its annual list to call 
attention to the fact that they are in danger but are not dead 
yet 
the rivers were selected based on their national or regional 
significance and the degree and imminence of the threats they 
face 
olson said that six of the rivers on the list were threatened by 
hydroelectric projects and the others threatened by flood control 
and water supply projects and nearby land development 
the group said the platte faces two major problems the two 
forks water storage dam proposed on the south platte near denver 
and the operation of upstream dams along a 200mile stretch known 
as big bend in nebraska 
the 500 million salt caves dam project threatens a 19mile 
stretch of the upper klamath in southern oregon the group said 
five of the rivers on the list the platte klamath american 
animas and little big horn were holdovers from last years list 
while the platte and the klamath topped this years list the 
other were not ranked in any particular order 
here is a rundown on each of the other rivers 
the american threatened by a us army corps of engineers 
proposal to build a dry dam at the auburn dam site for flood 
control 
the penobscot threatened by a proposed hydrdoelectric known as 
the basin mills project e payette threatened by proposed dams on 
the north and south forks near boise 
the james threatened by several hydroelectric projects 
the little bighorn threatened by a large pumpedstorage 
hydroelectric generating plant and a water storage project 
the illinois bayou threatened by a newly proposed dam near 
russelville 
the new threatened by nearby land development 
the animas threatened by the animas la plata irrigation 
project 
other rivers that didnt make the groups top 10 list but were 
considered endangered included the greenbrier in west virginia 
the smith in california the yampa in colorado the lower kern in 
california the oswegatchie in new york the allegheny in

twenty years after mans first step on the 
moon president bush said thursday americans must commit to the 
permanent settlement of space first returning to the moon and then 
embarking on a journey into tomorrow a manned mission to 
distant mars 
the president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program 
that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars but said it would be 
worth the cost because it is humanitys destiny to strive to 
seek to find and because it is americas destiny to lead 
his proposal was made in a ceremony on the steps of the national 
air and space museum marking the historic moment july 20 1969 
when american astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin stepped on 
the moons sea of tranquility to fulfill a pledge made eight years 
earlier by president kennedy 
the two moonwalkers stood with bush friday along with mike 
collins the third apollo 11 crewman who said we have rested on 
our apollo laurels long enough its time to get moving again 
bushs proposal to establish a us moon base early in the next 
century and then mount a manned mars mission likely will ignite a 
long national debate both in a budgetminded congress and among 
those who believe federal dollars should not be spent on costly 
space endeavors but on solving more earthly problems 
at a time of huge budget deficits congress already is balking at 
the startup costs for nasas 30 billion space station which bush 
said was a first and necessary step for sustained manned 
exploration 
congress he said is where the future of the space station 
and our future as a spacefaring nation will be decided 
bush offered few details beyond his broad goals and said he was 
leaving it to vice president dan quayle as head of the national 
space council and to nasa to come up with realistic timetables 
putting the space station in orbit has been scheduled for after 1995 
the president chose to look beyond the budget debate over the 
space station budget 
we must commit ourselves anew to the permanent settlement 
of space he said we must commit ourselves to a future where 
americans and citizens of all nations will live and work in space 
richard truly the nasa administrator hailed bushs initiative as 
dynamite and said that if the program is approved nasa will be 
ready to establish a moon base in the dawn of the new century 
truly said cuts in the nasa budget in recent years have weakened 
the agency so that in its present structure it could not carry out 
such visionary plans 
truly said he had no estimate on how much bushs program would 
cost but he noted that during the heyday of the apollo program 
nasas funding represented more than 4 percent of the national 
budget compared with about 1 percent now 
he said the job could be done with less than 4 percent 
other observers have estimated that if bushs proposal were 
adopted nasas present budget request of 133 billion would have 
to more than double within a few years and that the whole package 
eventually could cost as much as 800 billion to 900 billion 
bush will need to forge an alliance with democratic leaders to 
win the funding for serious space exploration and initial skeptical 
reaction came from rep richard gephardt dmo the house majority 
leader 
the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can 
marshal the words but the resources to restore americas preeminence 
in space gephardt said in sum mr president theres no such 
thing as a free launch 
the proposal also drew opposition from a key member of the house 
committee that oversees nasa appropriations 
given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands i dont 
see how we can afford expensive manned programs in space in the near 
future said rep bill green of new york 
rep dennis eckart dohio said bush was calling for one great 
leap for mankind but not even providing the money for one small 
step using a takeoff of armstrongs first words from the lunar 
surface 
sen albert gore dtenn a member of the senate committee 
charged with the space agency budget said by proposing a return 
to the moon and a manned base on mars with no money no timetable 
and no plan bush offers the country not a challenge to inspire us 
but a daydream to briefly entertain us 
meanwhile the full house handily defeated an attempt by rep 
charles schumer dny to transfer 714 million from the proposed 
fiscal 1990 budget for the space station to programs for veterans 
medical care pollution control and lowincome and elderly housing 
bushs ceremony with the astronauts blended his glimpse into the 
future with reminiscences of the apollo program 
he unveiled a new postage stamp commemorating the first moon 
landing then signed a proclamation marking space exploration day 
he invited the astronauts and their families back to the white house 
for a picnic lunch 
bush recalled the first moon landing two decades ago saying 
some called it quixotic impossible but america did it now 
he said it is time for the nation to head back to the moon back 
to the future and this time back to stay 
under nasa scenarios outlined last year a permanently manned 
base on the front side of the moon would require astronaut crews to 
construct an antarctictype facility mixing mineralrich lunar soil 
with water to form a kind of cement 
oxygen extracted from moon rocks could be mixed with hydrogen 
brought from earth to fuel expeditions to mars and elsewhere 
to explore mars one nasa option would use humans the other a 
robot to move around the surface a third would place men on the 
mars moon phobos to guide the rover on mars

big bear and the st paul human rights department contend the 
rule discriminated against him on the basis of sex 
a city attorney will urge that big bear be awarded 3325 in 
damages at a hearing scheduled for monday 
we are saying why are they enforcing it only for male 
members said dulce de leon supervisor of investigations for 
the citys human rights department if it is for safety reasons 
it should be for both sexes 
amateur bowlers tour has resisted efforts to settle the case 
prompting the city to set the hearing before a threemember panel 
of its human rights commission de leon said 
scott miller director of the twin cities division of the 
amateur bowlers tour said the rule was established to provide a 
professional appearance for participants miller said 
the rule states hair must be trimmed and combed and will not 
be permitted below the bottom of the normal collar for male

permitted for male members

one hundred reels of microfilm copies of us 
patents have disappeared from the library at georgie tech and 
library officials say it appears to be part of a nationwide theft 
a library worker noticed about three weeks ago that sections of 
the microfilm seemed to be missing miriam drake dean and director 
of libraries at georgia tech said tuesday an inventory indicated 
100 cartridges were gone 
we discovered it and then we heard very quickly that the same 
thing had happened at the university of massachusetts the patent 
office notified us immediately that this was going on ms drake 
said 
in addition 10 other universities that are depositories for 
copies of patent records have reported thefts she said 
ms drake said that because it appears different blocks of the 
patent records from the past 20 years were taken from each 
university it appears they are amassing a 20year run of 
patents 
they didnt take everything in one year ms drake said 
the dates they took from us were from 1971 to 1974 and 1977 to 
1978 but in the 1971 period they took 42 cartridges and only 10 
of 1978 
william o craig a spokesman for the us patent and trademark 
office based in the washington suburb of arlington va said 
wednesday the matter is under investigation 
the loss of the microfilms will not have any impact on the 
patents themselves because the patent office maintains permanent 
records craig said 
ms drake estimated the replacement cost of the reels at 
10000 but she said the real issue is why anybody would want to 
steal these 
were not talking about secrets or anything like that 
somebody can come here or go to the us patent office in 
washington or the university of massachusetts and use them 
the richmond va news leader reported tuesday that the fbi was 
investigating the thefts 
joe hardy fbi spokesman in atlanta said he was unaware of an 
investigation into the thefts 
ms drake said no suspicious incidents regarding the microfilm 
had been reported before the discovery of the theft 
she said the microfilm is stored in open library stacks but 
there always is an employee in that area when the library is open 
she said the library soon will close the patent records 
meaning permission will be required to use them 
she said other schools that have reported thefts of microfilmed 
patents are virginia commonwealth university ohio state 
university rice university texas aampm and the universities of 
idaho maryland michigan new mexico texas and utah

dick fitzsimmons doesnt how hell react 
when he sees vladimir kutz of the soviet union for the first time 
in more than 44 years 
but he knows the reunion tuesday with the man he knew as a 
skinny teenager he helped save from a nazi concentration camp will 
be a happy one 
i never expected to see him again and when i do i probably 
wont be able to say a word fitzsimmons said it all just 
doesnt seem real

never met the young prisoner returned the favor of his freedom by 
warning the americans of a german ambush 
the americans were ready and fought right through them 
fitzsimmons remembers 
the reunion was arranged by john barr vice president of the

chapter on a january 1988 trip to the soviet union he was met at 
the airport by kurtzs son yuri who read about his visit in a 
newspaper 
the young kurtz retold his fathers story of being saved by men 
of the 4th division and provided a few names and hometowns written 
on a scrap of paper his father had saved since the war 
barr and members of his organization managed to track down the 
four old soldiers who got choked up remembering willie 
vladimir became willie to the americans because we 
couldnt pronounce his first name and didnt have time to learn 
fitzsimmons said 
fitzsimmons has vivid memories of his soviet friend 
he was a kind of small rawboned kid he said they didnt 
feed him very well 
after the ambush willie tagged along and was adopted by the 
division 
we dressed him and fed him and put him to work as a 
machinegunner for two months fitzsimmons recalled 
though he spoke no english and no americans spoke his native 
ukrainian the men were able to communicate in sign language 
fitzsimmons said 
when it was time for him to go home willie went in style 
fitzsimmons said 
some men commandeered a german staff car and we taught willie 
how to drive it he said we gave him the car and sent him on 
his way toward moscow 
barr said this is willies first visit to the united states and 
that it will coincide with a reunion of 4th division veterans in 
cherry hill nj in august

atiqullah 7 was caught in a cross 
fire and his wounds became infected he would have died like 
countless others but foreign volunteers found him and took him 
away for treatment in europe 
tens of thousands of children are among the estimated 13 
million victims of the civil war that has ravaged afghanistan for 
11 years 
fighting has disrupted access to much of the mountainous nation 
moslem guerrillas control most of the countryside and the communist 
governments army has the cities 
the united nations says fewer than 30 percent of afghanistans 
10 million people have access to medical treatment and three of 10 
children die before their fifth birthday the highest infant 
mortality rate in the world 
at least one in 10 afghan children suffers from disease or 
injuries related to the war 
atiqullahs wounds could have been treated after he was shot 
seven months ago but they remained open and became infected 
because of a shortage of surgeons and antibiotics in the 
deteriorating healthcare system 
ultimately however atiqullah was among the lucky ones on 
monday he boarded an airplane for the first time in his life to 
begin a journey that may see him fully recovered and back home in a 
year 
he was one of 20 children who arrived in frankfurt on thursday 
for advanced medical treatment arranged by a west german volunteer 
organization 
if he is left here he is going to die in four weeks said 
dr eberhard thoma of friedensdorf peace village international 
he is in a devastating state 
what we see in kabul makes us sick said ronald 
gegenfurtner president of friedensdorf international imagine 
what is happening in the countryside 
we are shocked to see the large number of innocent afghan 
children who are suffering from a war aided by socalled civilized 
countries and superpowers 
the kabul government is sponsored by the soviet union and the 
united states supports the moslem guerrillas who have fought it 
since a communist coup in april 1978 
friedensdorf international came to afghanistan in december and 
has helped treat at least 88 children wounded in the war about 25 
of them have returned home 
wolfgang martens a friedensdorf spokesman in west germany said 
the latest group flew out of kabul on monday during rocket attacks 
three girls and 17 boys aged 512 were in the group thoma said 
at least seven had bone marrow infections and to get them cured 
we will have to operate several times 
there is no way you can perform these operations in kabul 
he said the hospitals here just dont have the facilities 
in some hospitals they dont have bandages they use ordinary 
cloth sometimes torn from the garments of victims to tie up 
wounds 
gegenfurtner said members of friedensdorf international would 
return in three months to pick up another group of children

army as a mechanic was convicted thursday of conspiring with a 
soldier to sell american military secrets to the soviet union and 
east germany 
a us district court jury deliberated about 6 hours wednesday 
afternoon and thursday before finding huseyin yildirim 61 guilty 
of one count of conspiracy to commit espionage 
he could be sentenced to 30 years and life in prison for his 
part in a scheme to steal secrets from the supersecret national 
security agencys field station berlin from 1983 to 1988 experts 
have said the plot did significant damage to american intelligence 
efforts because eastern bloc nations got access to information on 
us electronic eavesdropping capability 
defense attorney lamar walter said he would move for a new trial 
within a week 
us district judge b avant edenfield said he would schedule 
sentencing after a presentence investigation is conducted 
yildirim who worked for the army as a civilian mechanic in west 
berlin was accused of conspiring with warrant officer james 
william hall iii to sell classified information to eastern bloc 
hall was an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic 
and coded messages yildirim worked for the army as a civilian 
mechanic in germany 
the trial was held in savannah because hall was stationed at 
nearby fort stewart at the time of his arrest last december 
yildirim now lives in belleair beach fla 
hall pleaded guilty at a courtmartial in march he was 
sentenced to 40 years in prison and dishonorably discharged from 
the service 
hall did not testify in the trial although the jury saw him in 
a secretly made videotape which implicated yildirim as his contact 
with east german agents 
yildirim wasnt called to testify and the defense presented no 
evidence 
walter told the jury in his closing statement that hall was 
solely to blame for the espionage 
the evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him hall 
but not my man walter told the jury mr hall is very 
definitely a guilty man the man is not capable of being believed 
according to prosecution witnesses yildirim carried documents 
to the soviets and east germans and then returned with money for 
hall 
incriminating evidence including a letter described as a 
shopping list of us military information was seized by 
authorities at the homes of hall and yildirim

coal miners walked off their jobs 
in five more regions but the siberian strikers who started the 
soviet unions worst labor unrest in decades were told thursday to 
return to work by dawn friday 
we have agreed to interrupt the strike not to end it said 
vyacheslav g akulov a strike committee member in prokopyevsk in 
siberias kuznetsk coal basin 
the strike committee asked the estimated 150000 strikers in the 
region to return to the pits at dawn friday after a government and 
communist party commission agreed to give them greater control over 
their industry akulov said the commission also agreed to improve 
the miners food housing and working conditions 
president mikhail s gorbachev has said the concessions granted 
the miners in the kuznetsk region will apply to all miners 
nationwide staterun tv repeated that promise thursday night in an 
apparent effort to end the countrys worst labor unrest since the 
1920s 
some siberian miners have already returned to work tass said 
nine out of 11 mining centers were operating and prokopyevsks 
central victory square was empty thursday night after nearly two 
weeks of rallies and demonstrations by thousands of strikers 
but the strike spread in other areas as miners raised demands 
similar to those of the kuznetsk strikers who began the walkout 10 
days ago 
miners in the northern town of vorkuta the don river city of 
rostov and the ukrainian industrial center of dnepropetrovsk 
walked out wednesday with demands similar to those of the strike 
instigators in kuznetsk tass reported dnepropetrovsk is in the 
donetsk coal basin the nations leading coal region 
on thursday more than 16000 miners in soviet central asias 
karaganda region the countrys thirdlargest coal field refused 
to go down into the pits and were massing by the thousands for 
rallies tass and the government newspaper izvestia reported 
miners at three shafts in chervonograd in the western ukraine 
joined the walkout thursday night said anatoly m dotsenko a 
spokesman for the ukrainian helsinki watch group 
official news reports did not say how many miners were on strike 
nationwide the coal industry employs more than 1 million workers 
vorkuta workers striking at nine of the citys 13 mines asked 
the kremlin for an urgent resolution of the sharp economic and 
social problems of the coal sector and also specific problems of 
workers of the far north tass said 
miners in rostov demanded extra pay for evening and night 
shifts longer vacations and an increase in the price of coal to 
world market prices the news agency reported 
workers striking at 11 mines in dnepropetrovsk made 24 demands 
similar to those of the kuznetsk miners reports said 
karaganda strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete 
news accounts of miners demands in the kuznetsk strikes according 
to tass 
the government compromised on most of the 39 demands made by the 
kuznetsk miners who walked off the job july 11 one of the biggest 
demands was for economic independence 
akulov said that starting jan 1 the kuznetzk coal basin will 
become economically autonomous 
the coal mining ministry will continue to run the mines but 
the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels 
and allocating the profits said akulov one of two 
representatives on the regional strike committee from the town of 
anzherosudzhensk the northernmost coal settlement in kuznetsk 
television quoted coal minister mikhail i shchadov as saying 
all soviet coal operations would become economically independent 
akulov whose weathered gaunt face is typical of the miners in 
the region said the kuznetsk miners would hold the government to 
its word 
if the government doesnt keep its promises we will go back 
on strike thats in the agreement he said 
he and other strike leaders described the settlement 
negotiations as open and very constructive 
our politics have gotten freer under perestroika said 
akulov referring to gorbachevs economic reform program but our 
living conditions have not improved 
another strike committee member alexander s kukaletov said 
housing conditions remain poor and there were severe shortages of 
sugar other foods and consumer goods 
prokopyevsks small wooden huts cling to the rolling hills and 
expansive birch forests of siberia some houses most of which are 
heated by coalburning stoves during the long winter sit next to 
piles of slag and other mine debris 
the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said the government has 
promised to send extra meat butter sugar tea leather footwear 
furniture and cars to relieve shortages in the region

chairman alan greenspan said thursday the 
federal reserve has shifted its emphasis from fighting inflation to 
avoiding a recession a signal that the central bank likely will 
continue to cautiously push down interest rates 
recent developments suggest that the balance of risks may have 
shifted somewhat away from greater inflation greenspan told the 
house banking subcommittee on domestic monetary policy what 
we seek to avoid is an unnecessary and destructive recession 
greenspan in his semiannual report to congress confirmed that 
after a yearlong campaign of trying to curb inflationary pressures 
by nudging up interest rates the central bank has reversed course 
in response to widespread evidence of economic softness 
he said he did not see signs of a recession at the moment 
but conceded that some day some event will end the extraordinary 
string of economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982 
he added that he did not want a mistake by the federal reserve to 
be the cause 
the central bank chairman would not respond directly when asked 
by panel members whether interest rates would continue to decline 
but he indicated he did not soon forsee another shift in policy 
it is not desirable to do too many wiggles he said 
greenspan said the fed loosened its grip on credit twice once 
in early june and again early in july and that the stimulating 
effects of lower interest rates were just now beginning to be felt 
private economists interpreted the central bank chairmans 
remarks as a clear sign that monetary policymakers with caution 
would continue to allow interest rates to fall as a stimulant to 
economic activity 
my feeling is hes willing to ease further particularly 
if theres further sign of softness in the industrial sector 
said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york 
elsewhere on capitol hill michael boskin president bushs 
chief economic adviser praised the feds recent action to lower 
interest rates but declined to say what he thought the central 
banks next move should be 
i dont like to preach to the fed in public he told the 
joint economic committee 
however earlier this year when the fed was pushing interest 
rates higher both bush and treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
didnt hesitate to say they thought greenspan and his colleagues 
were overly concerned with inflation 
greenspan said the fed was gratified by the governments two 
most recent inflation reports for june showing a modest 02 
percent rise in the consumer price index and a small 01 percent 
decline in wholesale prices 
but he cautioned its clearly premature with one months 
data to suggest that inflation pressures are behind us certainly 
they are not 
and he said inflation remains high clearly above our 
objective 
economist david wyss of data resources inc a lexington mass 
forecasting firm said greenspans testimony indicates monetary 
policy makers will not move precipitously 
theyre not quite sure that inflation is as dead as it looks 
now as long as theyre not theyre going to move as slowly as 
they can get away with he said 
in setting preliminary monetary growth targets greenspan said 
the fed had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for this 
year and next year as well 
for m2 the measure of the money supply which includes currency 
in circulation and interestbearing checking accounts the fed said 
it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent 
both this year and in 1990 
greenspan also released a revised economic forecast which showed 
that the central bank still hopes to achieve a socalled soft 
landing in which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary 
pressures but not decline so much that the country is thrown into a 
recession 
the fed predicted modest economic growth as measured by the 
gross national product of between 2 percent and 25 percent this 
year slowing to 15 percent to 2 percent in 1990 that compares 
with the bush administrations more optimistic projection of 27 
percent in 1989 and 26 percent in 1990 
the congressional budget office on thursday forecast a 24 
percent rate of growth this year slowing to 2 percent in 1990 
the central bank forecast that consumer prices would rise by 
between 5 percent and 55 percent this year up from last years 
44 percent increase and slowing to between 45 percent and 5 
percent in 1990 
the administration meanwhile is looking for a 5 percent rise 
in consumer prices this year and 41 percent next year the cbo is 
looking for inflation a half point higher than the administration 
in the upper range of the feds 1989 projection

principle thursday to form a panafrican military force to help 
black states resist incursions by south africa 
the organization of african unitys council of ministers adopted 
a recommendation calling for a joint defense force but put off its 
creation pending a study on how it would be funded 
the 50member oau has been plagued by financial problems 
throughout its 26year history many members are badly behind on 
their annual dues 
the organization has considered assembling a similar force in 
the past but the idea has never passed the conceptual stage 
sylvestre nganzimana an oau assistant secretary said the 
proposed force would be made up of military units from members 
nations which could be called up as a unified force 
what is envisioned is a force that would assist the frontline 
states which have suffered incursions and destabilization by south 
africa he said it would also work closely with national 
liberation organizations and act as a peacekeeping and observer 
force 
the financial study was not due to be completed until next year 
the oaus defense commission which brought the recommendation 
to the council noted in its report that the united nations 
estimates the cost of keeping one of its typical peacekeeping 
forces in the field for six months at about 150 million 
the frontline states comprise angola botswana mozambique 
tanzania zambia and zimbabwe 
the foreign ministers were meeting in ethiopias capital city 
this week to draw up an agenda for a conference of oau heads of 
state the meeting opens monday

the world court on thursday said 
the united states has no right to compensation from the italian 
government for italys seizure of an americanowned plant 21 years 
ago 
the fivejudge panel ruled 41 that italy did not breach the 
1948 treaty of friendship commerce and navigation as alleged by 
washington when it seized the elettronica sicula or elsi plant 
in palermo in 1968 it also voted 41 to deny compensation to the 
united states 
stephen m schwebel the courts only us judge opposed the 
decision 
elsi was a cathoderay tube factory wholly owned by raytheon 
corp a major defense contractor and by another american company 
machlett laboratories inc 
italy contended the mayor of palermo seized the company to 
safeguard the jobs of about 900 factory workers after the owners 
announced plans to liquidate the firm 
according to the us complaint the company was then sold to a 
subsidiary of a conglomerate owned by the italian government at a 
price far less than market value and raytheon was never 
compensated 
no specific compensation amounts were demanded in court but 
us sources have claimed privately that american damages in the 
case were more than 6 million 
the court officially known as the international court of 
justice is the legal arm of the united nations it has no 
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its 
decisions 
in court the united states complained that a ruling on the case 
by an italian court was delayed 16 months after the seizure until 
elsi was sold 
the judges said elsi was on a course to bankruptcy even 
before it was seized 
what really deprived raytheon and machlett as shareholders of 
their right to dispose of elsis property was not the 
requisition but the precarious financial state of elsi ultimately 
leading inescapably to bankruptcy they said 
voting in favor were the courts argentinian president jose 
maria ruda as well as judges roberto ago of italy shigeru oda of 
japan and sir robert jennings of britain 
schwebel said in a separate document attached to the ruling that 
elsis seizure was an unreasonable and capricious measure that 
deprived raytheon of its right to control and manage and hence 
liquidate elsi 
the elsi case was filed in february 1987 after years of 
diplomatic bargaining failed to resolve the issue 
in 1986 the world court denounced ussponsored military 
action against nicaragua and us support for the antisandinista 
forces known as contras 
earlier that year in an apparent anticipation of the adverse 
decision washington withdrew its recognition of the unlimited 
jurisdiction of the court but said it would continue to accept 
jurisdiction in some cases such as the one involving elettronica 
sicula

testified thursday in his federal tax evasion trial he didnt have 
any way to prove that cash advances he took while at the ptl

whether sums of money he drew from ptl accounts were taxable or not

is in a different position and im willing to pay you 100000 a 
year taggart said 
taggart said he recalled telling bakker i want access to the 
same resources that you have but i also want to control my money 
i dont want a house or a car to be given to me

cash advances which he said were used primarily for trips by the 
bakkers on ministry business he said he needed large amounts of 
cash on hand at all times 
many times on a trip i would advance tammy bakker some cash 
and she would reimburse it he said that was true of dozens of 
other members of the bakkers entourage he said 
taggarts brother james testified wednesday that as ptls 
interior designer he was an artist who left the business dealings 
to his brother

newspapers and should be repealed the editor of a michigan weekly 
told a house panel thursday 
it has encouraged concentration of newspaper ownership 
peculiar competitive practices and lessened the vigor and quality 
of newspapering michigan editor w edward wendover told the 
judiciary committee panel 
however jerry friedheim president of the american newspaper 
publishers association testified that the act helped the 
marketplace evolve and prosper 
rep jack brooks dtexas called the hearing 19 years after 
congress approved the newspaper preservation act which allows 
newspapers in the same city to merge business operations when one 
of the papers is in danger of failing newsgathering operations 
remain separate 
in 1970 the act was hailed as a necessary means of preventing 
daily newspapers from falling victim to fierce market forces 
brooks said yet since passage of the act some estimate that 
over 200 papers have ceased operation 
wendover editor and publisher of the weekly the community crier 
in plymouthcanton mich testified on behalf of michigan citizens 
for an independent press that group made up of 1400 readers 
advertisers and employees of the detroit news and detroit free 
press filed a lawsuit in august to block a joa between the two 
papers 
gannett co inc which owns the news and knightridder inc 
owner of the free press say the joa is needed to allow the free 
press to survive 
the us supreme court will hear arguments on the case this 
fall there are 18 active joas in the united states 
the principle of a free press cannot be maintained when the 
biggest newspaper chains enjoy unregulated monopoly status 
wendover said calling on congress to repeal the act 
harsh criticism came from bruce b brugmann editor and 
publisher of the 70000 circulation weekly san francisco bay 
guardian brugmann also testified against the act when it was being 
considered in 1969 
never have so many given so much to so few for no good reason 
at all brugmann said charging that the only people to benefit 
from joas are publishers 
the joa between the two san francisco dailies the examiner and 
the chronicle brugmann said has led to less competitive 
journalism 
also critical of the act was louis mleczko a reporter for the 
detroit news and president of local 22 of the newspaper guild of 
detroit mleczko who is opposed to the proposed detroit joa said 
congress should repeal the act and force giant chains to compete 
newspapers are more than just businesses only concerned with 
the bottom line they are a public trust mleczko said the 
robber barons live its time for congress to break up the trusts 
again 
brooks said his economic and commercial law subcommittee would 
study the testimony and decide whether further hearings are needed

by mander was with the departments food safety and inspection 
service and the agricultural marketing service

grading services if mander fails to sell or close the plants such 
withdrawal effectively bars a company from selling meat across

nevadas income growth driven by the states 
tourism and mining industries outpaced other states during the 
year ending last march while income growth in wyoming trailed the 
rest of the country the government reported thursday 
the commerce department said said that nonfarm incomes rose 94 
percent nationally in the 12 months ending march 30 but the 
national average masked disparities among states and regions of the 
country 
nevada paced the country with a nonfarm income increase of 15 
percent the department said 
nevadas income growth was fueld by the hotel and resort 
construction demands of its tourism industry and a healthy mining 
industry according to department analyst rudolph e depass 
nevada was followed by florida whose nonfarm income was up 121 
percent california up 107 percent vermont up 105 percent and 
virginia up 105 percent 
with inflation rising at an annual rate of 59 percent the 
figures showed those states stayed well ahead of the increase in 
prices 
other states did not fare so well 
lastranked wyoming saw nonfarm income growth rise only 57 
percent pulled down by declining construction and services 
industry depass said 
other states at the bottomend of the rankings were west 
virginia up 63 percent north dakota up 64 percent oklahoma 
up 69 percent and alaska up 72 percent 
by region the far west led the nation with an overall income 
growth of 105 percent followed by the southeast 99 percent and 
new england 96 percent 
other regions and their income growth rates were great lakes 9 
percent mideast 89 percent plains 88 percent southwest 86 
percent and rocky mountains 82 percent 
depass said differences in nonfarm income growth between 
coastal and interior regions continued to grow smaller from the 
first quarter of 1988 to the first quarter of 1989 although 
coastal growth continued to outpace the inland areas 
the commerce department focuses on changes in nonfarm income as 
a better indication of a regions prosperity because of the often 
erratic nature of farm incomes

if ernest hemingway that aficionado of big 
guns feisty bulls lusty reds and really short sentences were 
alive today the pugnacious papa would be spoiling for a fight 
the object of his disaffection would be the best of bad 
hemingway harcourt brace jovanovich 795 a compilation of 
the best entries to a nowdefunct annual competition of hemingway 
parodies the ersatz ernest contest was sponsored by harrys bar amp 
american grill whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous 
hemingway connection deserves induction into the publicists hall 
of fame 
hemingway who would have been 90 on july 21 was no stranger to 
parody his second novel the torrents of spring was a cruel 
mimickry of sherwood anderson an early mentor hemingway thought 
was washed up but when his own prose became well enough known to 
be parodied hemingway was hardly a sport 
the parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer he 
said after eb white spoofed him with a piece called across the 
street and into the grill the greater the work of literature 
the easier the parody the step up from writing parodies is writing 
on the wall above the urinal 
all of the erniewannabees in this collection are long on puns 
and short on commas among the titles the snooze of 
kilimanjaro in another contra hills like white 
heffalumps the old man and the seal a clean wellsighted 
ace a lean welltighted space and a clean welllighted 
race 
when author george plimpton who wrote the introduction to the 
book was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry 
he mentioned daniel hardys the last good martini which 
mangles more than a halfdozen hemingway titles in its few short 
paragraphs 
do you want to order dinner said nick they still serve 
the big twoparted liver 
and later do you remember george tell 
yes said francis he was a swell bowler for whom does 
tell bowl now 
plimpton also mentioned the parody by lee ewing the question 
hung in the air 
he knew what they must do on this day it was a month with no 
r 
come he said it is the day of the running of the 
oysters 
plimpton explains in his introduction that the parody contest 
was dreamed up in 1978 by an advertising man named paul keye for 
harrys bar amp american grill in century city calif near beverly 
hills 
the american harrys was a replica of harrys bar in florence 
italy keye knew hemingway never went to the harrys in florence 
but was a devotee of the original harrys bar in venice and often 
featured it in his stories 
his copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they 
would have to face the white bull that is paper with no words on 
it all entries had to be limited to one typewritten page and 
had to mention harrys bar favorably the winner was flown to 
florence for dinner at the other harrys lodging was not included 
the thousands of entries that poured in took the contest 
organizers by surprise and the contest grew bigger every year 
with celebrity judges such as plimpton novelist joseph wambaugh 
science fiction writer ray bradbury and jack hemingway the 
authors son television crews gathered for the reading of the 
winning entry harrys decided to end the competition after a 
decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its 
restaurants 
plimpton was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries 
it has to be funny it has to echo the style of author i 
think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust then 
the imagination in developing the idea he said by telephone from 
his office at the paris review of which he is editor 
in later years the entries were prescreened and the judges read 
only the best entries 
the best of bad hemingway is rounded out by spoofs of the 
author by wellknown writers including f scott fitzgerald 
raymond chandler and plimpton himself whose the snows of 
studiofiftyfour is a skillful mutation of hemingways writing 
style and a truman capoteesque sensibility 
gary piepenbrink who edited the collection for harcourt brace 
jovanovich said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided 
between those who parodied hemingway because they loved him and 
those who did it because they reviled him 
hemingway who was awarded the nobel prize in literature in 
1954 put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in 1961 
hes a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with 
somehow said piepenbrink in a telephone interview from his san 
diego office his stature is not to be challenged his place is 
secure in modern literature 
i dont think the collection diminishes hemingway said 
piepenbrink who reveres the author some of the parodies are 
pretty cruel but he can take it a lesser writer couldnt endure 
all these punches

getting a tan in order to improve your looks 
raises your risk of skin cancer wrinkles eye damage and changes 
in the skins immune system a new report says 
no health benefits are known from cosmetic tanning except that 
tanned skin may have positive psychological value by creating an 
enhanced image of personal worth said the report by the american 
medical association 
the price can be high premature wrinkles dryness and leathery 
skin a heightened risk of skin cancer damage to the eyes and 
genetic changes that may compromise the skins ability to fight 
invaders the report said 
despite the hazards many people cannot be dissuaded from 
sunbathing or using artificial tanning devices said the report 
written by the chicagobased amas council on scientific affairs 
and published in fridays journal of the american medical 
association 
the council recommended these guidelines for people who insist 
on tanning 
minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation the component of 
sunlight that causes tanning and burning by staying out of the sun 
between 10 am and 2 pm and wearing a hat and protective clothing 
beware of surfaces such as sand snow ice and concrete that 
reflect sunlight and can intensify the effects of the suns rays by 
10 percent to 50 percent 
use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at least 15 
for skin that burns easily or tans only gradually or higher at 
greater elevations or for other intensive exposures a person 
wearing a sunscreen with a protection factor of 15 would get the 
same amount of radiation exposure after 15 hours in the sun as he 
would in one hour if he were wearing no sunscreen 
keep babies out of the sun as much as possible and apply 
sunscreen to older youngsters who are to be outdoors for long 
periods 
avoid tanning machines exposure to their radiation may 
increase the risk of skin cancer even though most modern machines 
use the safer form of ultraviolet light called uva rather 
than the more dangerous form uvb 
people with extremely fair skin or severe reactions to sunlight 
should never use such booths it said 
if tanning equipment is used people who tan moderately well 
should limit their exposures to 30 to 50 halfhour sessions per 
year or less use a properly calibrated device with a timer keep a 
record of exposures wear protective goggles and make sure an 
attendant is nearby in case of an emergency the report said 
becca essman executive director of the suntanning association 
for education an industry group reacted to the report by saying 
that tanning parlor operators have already responded to medical 
concerns about radiation 
tanning is a part of life that probably will never go away 
she said in a telephone interview from the associations 
headquarters in frederick md and we think indoor tanning 
facilities give people in general an opportunity to not burn to 
avoid the overexposure 
the associations 1500 member facilities make up about 
onequarter of the us indoor tanning industry ms essman said 
the group has drafted a code of ethics developed a training 
program for parlor operators and promotes safety measures she said 
the council on scientific affairs is a 15member panel of 
doctors and other health specialists whose job is to compile the 
latest scientific information on topics of interest to the ama

suicide is the secondleading cause of death 
among maryland prison inmates according to federal researchers who 
suggest that convicts be examined for mental health problems before 
incarceration 
scientists from the national center for health services research 
in rockville md found that mentally disturbed inmates were at 
the highest risk of committing suicide 
white male prisoners ages 15 to 34 had a greater risk of 
killing themselves than the general prison population the 
researchers said in fridays edition of the journal of the american 
medical association 
prisoners in that age group also tended to kill themselves twice 
as often as people of the same age in marylands general 
population the researchers wrote 
i think the situation of prisoners in maryland is the same as 
that in many states said greg shipley a spokesman for the 
maryland division for correction they are faced with long prison 
sentences and a loss of hope that puts them in a very depressed 
state 
dr marcel salive from the center and fellow scientists studied 
206 deaths of male convicts in maryland state prisons between 1979 
to 1987 and found 37 were by suicide second only to heart disease 
which killed 48 inmates 
the researchers noted that their results could not be applied to 
the nations prison population estimated at about 500000 because 
suicide rates vary from prison to prison and the type of prison 
population 
salive said the absence of suicides among women inmates might be 
explained by the fact that women make up only 35 percent of the 
maryland prison population 
the researchers said psychotic or psychiatrically disturbed 
inmates are at the highest risk 
the researchers suggested that convicts be evaluated for mental 
health problems before incarceration 
in addition we should train the staff to be more watchful of 
presuicidal behavior such as people who get depressed or isolate 
themselves or have attempted it in the past salive said in a 
telephone interview 
of the prison suicides 32 inmates hanged themselves two 
slashed themselves two overdosed on drugs and one fell to his 
death 
white prisoners are twice as likely as blacks to commit suicide 
the researchers said they also confirmed previous studies that 
found inmates who serve a life sentence are more likely to commit 
suicide than other prisoners 
most studies of inmate suicides have been done in local jails 
which house newly arrested people as well as convicts the authors 
said prisons hold only those convicted and sentenced 
suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and is nine times 
more common in jail populations than in the general population 
said lindsay hayes an assistant director for the national center 
on institutes and alternatives a private alexandria vabased 
group seeking better jail conditions 
suicides are less common in prisons than jails hayes said 
because only convicted felons are sent to prison theyve been 
through the crisis of jail and they are hardened more experienced 
and less fearful of the unknown he said 
shipley said maryland prison officials are trying to fight the 
suicide problem by installing in some cells collapsible clothing 
racks that will not support the weight of a body 
in addition to removing pipes and clothes and towel racks or 
making them collapsible corrections systems can help prevent 
inmate suicide by making tearable prison clothing sheets and 
blankets that cannot support a body hayes said 
i dont like gimmicks though hayes said i prefer 
counseling and increased monitoring suicides are best prevented by 
other human beings

prime minister chatichai choonhavan and 
other top officials tried to rally support thursday for their 
proposal to declare a truce in the cambodia war 
they were reacting to vietnams praise of the idea wednesday 
foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam said he agreed with the 
proposal by chatichai this year for a truce before vietnams 
pullout 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in december 1978 and installed 
the current government has said it will pull its 60000 to 70000 
forces out by sept 30 it said it will do so even without a 
settlement 
however thach said on official radio hanoi the cambodian 
issue cannot be solved peacefully without a ceasefire 
therefore vietnam fully supports the thai prime ministers 
proposal that the cambodian parties sign a ceasefire agreement in 
bangkok and considers this as part of a political solution to the 
cambodian issue he said the broadcast was monitored in bangkok 
asked for his reaction thursday chatichai said he had not yet 
received the report but he added that if the four cambodian 
parties agree it would be great 
the cambodian government has been battling a coalition of three 
guerrilla groups including the communist khmer rouge the 
communist group ruled cambodia for almost four years killing 
hundreds of thousands until they were driven out by the vietnamese 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila of thailand told reporters the 
truce issue should be raised at an international conference on 
cambodia starting sunday in paris 
he said a truce could be signed there but he added that he 
thinks it will be impossible to get the cambodian factions to agree 
on it 
cambodian government leader hun sen and prince norodom sihanouk 
chief of the threeparty guerrilla coalition in may agreed in 
principle to a ceasefire but the khmer rouge the largest and 
most hardline guerrilla force rejected a truce unless vietnamese 
forces first withdraw under international supervision 
another radio hanoi broadcast thursday said hun sen stopped in 
hanoi the day before en route to the paris talks and conferred with 
prime minister do muoi and thach 
the radio said the two sides agreed that the basis for a 
solution lay in what they said was the consensus reached at two 
rounds of talks in indonesia the past year the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops and elimination of the khmer rouge 
sihanouk has demanded a government joining the hun sen 
administration and all three guerrilla groups but hun sen has 
rejected khmer rouge participation because he says it would ignite 
more war 
hun sen apparently plans no major concessions the official 
cambodian news agency spk said he told a australian official 
visiting phnom penh monday that he was prepared for more fighting 
if need be

two congresswomen saying they want to reclaim 
the middle ground in the abortion debate thursday introduced a 
bill to fund birth control and fertility research 
reps patricia schroeder dcolo and olympia snowe rmaine 
said they are trying to broaden the abortionrights base and seize 
control of the debate from abortion foes by attracting people from 
both sides of the issue as well as the undecided 
this is a comfort zone for people who dont want to line up 
for or against abortion schroeder said 
were not going to sidetrack the debate on abortion snow 
said but the congresswomen want to broaden it to address the 
conditions that lead to the need for abortion 
the supreme courts ruling earlier this month giving the states 
broader authority to limit womens rights to terminate their 
pregnancies has thrown the abortion debate into the state 
legislatures and governors offices abortionrights advocates and 
opponents have been bracing to steer the issue in their states 
weve got to start reclaiming that middle ground to broaden 
the prochoice base and reach out to people who may be 
uncomfortable in either camp on abortion but who support the need 
for better contraception schroeder said 
with more than 3 million unintended pregnancies in the united 
states each year more attention has to be focused on preventing 
pregnancies they said additionally one out of six us couples 
is infertile or cannot conceive within one year of deciding to have 
a child they said 
clearly we need to encourage birth control and fertility 
research schroeder said 
currently the federal government is spending about 9 million 
annually on contraceptive research she said 
the bill would fund three birth control research centers and two 
fertility research centers that would do clinical research and 
development as well as develop education programs and distribute 
medical information 
the centers would receive 20 million in fiscal year 1990 the 
same amount in 1991 12 million in fiscal 1992 125 million in 
fiscal 1993 and 13 million for fiscal 1994 
the bill would also authorize a loan repayment program for 
graduate students or health professionals who conduct birth control 
or fertility research

the states transportation board on thursday 
approved plans for a private toll highway that the builder said 
would be the first in the country in 30 years 
the commonwealth transportation board voted unanimously to 
approve the toll road corp of virginias proposal to build a 
15mile 155 million extension of the dulles toll road in 
trafficclogged northern virginia 
the vote came after intense negotiations between the state and 
the corporation which is headed by ralph l stanley former chief 
of the federal urban mass transportation administration 
weve got a lot to be proud of said byron e waldman 
northern virginias representative on the board were willing to 
look at creative and new ways to meet our states needs 
the company still must seek approval from the state corporation 
commission which will regulate the amount of tolls the company 
has said tolls would start at 150 
stanley said he hopes the scc will act as soon as possible and 
construction can begin by december he said the highway should be 
finished by the end of 1991 about 15 months ahead of when the 
state could complete the project 
we couldnt be more pleased particularly with a unanimous 
vote stanley said 
i dont minimize the historic nature of it he said i 
think its a whole new era of funding for not just highway projects 
but infrastructure through the state 
bill woodwell a representative of the toll road corp said 
land for the project is largely being donated by developers and 
other landowners on the assumption the road will increase the value 
of land near it the company is still negotiating with some small 
individual owners and may have to buy some parcels 
the land donations are one of the main reasons the company will 
be able to build the road so much faster than the state woodwell 
said 
stanley said the road would be the first private toll highway 
built in the country in more than 30 years 
there are i would say at least 30 states i know who are 
going to be very interested in what happened here today he said 
the virginia general assembly passed legislation in 1988 
allowing private companies to fund and build roads in the state 
stanley said he could foresee more private funding of roads 
bridges and wastewater treatment plants particularly in small 
communities 
state transportation officials acknowledged that the private 
company could build the road faster and at a lower initial cost 
but they said it would cost far more in the long run because the 
company must pay higher interest rates than the state that would 
increase tolls they said 
ray d pethtel the boards commissioner said the publics 
overwhelming support for the private road outweighed such concerns

an emotional dispute has broken out in west 
germany over whether imprisoned german soldiers who spread 
propaganda for their soviet captors during world war ii were 
traitors or heroes 
many people consider these people traitors but thats not the 
case they were opponents of the nazi regime said peter 
steinbach 
steinbach a passau university historian arranged an exhibit 
called resistance to national socialism that has generated 
controversy 
the failed july 20 1944 attempt by german generals to kill 
hitler is included in the berlin exhibit as are the wartime calls 
for antinazi actions by a group of university students known as 
the white rose 
in both cases those brave enough to oppose hitler were tortured 
and executed 
but along with documents and photographs showing such widely 
recognized attempts to disrupt the third reich is a controversial 
display about thousands of captured german soldiers in soviet 
prisons who opposed the third reich and wanted the war to end 
some members of the national committee for a free germany did 
propaganda work for the soviets during the war using loudspeakers 
at the front to urge german soldiers to quit fighting 
that part of the exhibit has angered germans who do not believe 
the soldiers deserve the same place of honor as people like claus 
von stauffenberg who was executed for planting the 1944 bomb meant 
to kill hitler 
hartmut von hoesslin brother of another german officer involved 
in the 1944 plot maj roland von hoesslin was at the exhibits 
opening on wednesday 
hartmut von hoesslin said the display on imprisoned german 
soldiers insulted all resistancefighters 
a protest letter presented by hartmut von hoesslin to the 
exhibits organizers said propaganda by the imprisoned soldiers 
amounted to psychoterror against fellow german troops 
but steinbach said members of the national committee for a free 
germany deserve a place in the exhibit and argued they saw 
themselves not as opportunists who wanted to placate soviet 
captors but as authentic opponents of hitlers rule 
they felt they were representatives of the allied cause to 
stop the war steinbach said 
the dispute has its roots in a longstanding german dilemma 
what kind of honor to bestow on german soldiers who died during the 
war and whether those who deserted are also deserving of praise 
german peace activists have been behind numerous moves to erect 
monuments to world war ii deserters often angering people who feel 
it is an affront to those who died fighting 
there is heated controversy in bockhorn where citizens are 
embroiled in discussion over the communitys memorial to soldiers 
who fell during both world wars 
an open letter from peace activists questioned whether every 
fallen soldier deserves to be treated like a hero 
the letter said they the fallen soldiers had participated 
in one of the greatest crimes of modern times meaning the 
tragedies and terror begun by nazi germany when it started world 
war ii 
kark friedrich schinkel an officer in the west german navy 
said in the respected newspaper die zeit that such disputes 
underscore the difficulties some germans still have in coming to 
terms with their homelands nazi past 
he said such controversies raise the question 50 years after 
the german invasion of poland whether the concept of individual 
heroism can be applied against the backdrop of mass murder

mars and the moon are lousy neighborhoods with 
wretched climates but the moons closer and people have been there 
before so if you want to survive on mars first go to the moon and 
learn how to live there 
thats the guiding idea behind president bushs longrange space 
challenge to the nation 
of several options prepared by nasa and presented to the white 
house the moonthenmars plan is the most expensive and complex 
but ultimately it could be the most rewarding 
in contrast to the apollo project which bush celebrated in his 
speech on thursday the new approach calls for a permanent presence 
on the moon instead of visiting the lunar surface like apollo 
tourists americans would establish a base with a fulltime 
longterm staff 
the nasa strategy calls for frequent flights to the moon and 
construction there of living quarters laboratories and power 
stations the lunar soil would be mined to extract oxygen which 
then could be turned into rocket fuel 
for astronomers the moons surface would offer an observatory 
site that is unparalleled on earth the moon has no atmosphere to 
obscure the view of the universe and it has only onesixth the 
gravity of earth which means much larger reflector telescopes 
could be built 
for engineers a moon base would be a laboratory for a voyage to 
mars the lunar center would enable the engineers to test concepts 
for building permanent quarters for humans in other worlds that 
have no air or water for instance a closed loop system where 
oxygen and water is processed and used over and over could be 
developed 
a lunar base also would enable engineers to use the moon as a 
starting point for a trip to mars 
some experts have suggested that a mars voyager could be built 
in lunar orbit either from components built on the moon or 
ferried there from earth propellant for the craft could be 
processed from moon soil 
the vehicle could then start its trip to mars by first firing 
out of lunar orbit circling the earth to pick up a boost from the 
planets gravity and then streaking outward on an eightmonth 
excursion 
once in the vicinity of mars the craft could put equipment on 
the surface and then land personnel to build a base using the 
lessons learned from the moon 
a base on mars would be much more difficult than a lunar center 
the red planet is blasted by massive storms in its unbreathable 
atmosphere of carbon dioxide nitrogen argon and oxygen 
but mars may have water vital for human existence and its 
surface may be more earthlike than any of the other solar system 
planets 
another base could be built on phobos a moon of mars and soil 
there mined to produce oxygen and hydrogen a combination that 
makes a powerful rocket propellant 
such an enterprise would not be of limited duration as was the 
apollo adventure it would be permanent the first step toward 
humankinds colonizing the universe beyond the earth 
the cost would be hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars 
and it would create an industry employing hundreds of thousands of 
people on earth and scores on the moon and mars 
why do it the only sure benefit is new knowledge and experts 
believe that the effort would cause a great leap in technology 
just as apollo boosted technology in the 1960s 
beyond that theres national prestige somebodys going to do 
it and the president wants it to be the united states 
bush spoke with pride thursday about the first footprint and the 
first flag on the moon being american 
hed like the first words spoken on mars to also be american

woman screamed from the 11story kaaki building in west beirut 
whose top three floors were burning 
telephone lines are down a man answered from a nearby 
building have faith in god were coming to help you 
two 107mm rockets hit fawzi ridas apartment on the 10th floor 
before dawn i stretched a hand to open the door but there was 
no door he said we have nothing left but the night clothes we 
are wearing 
police said 433 people have been killed and 1780 wounded in the 
18 weeks of artillery warfare between gen michel aouns christian 
army units and an alliance of syrian soldiers and moslem militias 
thursdays shelling was some of the heaviest in the long battle 
tongues of flame shot into the sky over beirut blasted 
buildings burned out of control a police spokesman said damage in 
moslem west beirut was much worse than in the christian eastern 
sector 
he reported a heavy flow of civilians from both sides of the 
city toward safer areas in south lebanon the bekaa valley in the 
east and the mountains northeast of beirut 
thousands of cars packed with families headed south from west 
beirut the spokesman said 
the evacuees used a lull in shelling at midday thursday to leave 
the city carrying whatever personal effects and household items 
they could save he said 
associated press photo editor zouheir saade said shells fell 
near his fifthfloor apartment in west beiruts seaside raouche 
district 
our building doesnt have a bomb shelter he said the 
only precautionary measure i could take was to distribute my four 
sons each in a different room i thought that was the only possible 
way to keep some of them alive in case the apartment was hit 
firefighters were hampered because a power blackout caused a 
water shortage a source at the fire department said two fire 
engines used sea water to extinguish some fires overnight 
the police spokesman said several syrian soldiers were killed 
when aouns artillery pounded their bases and artillery 
emplacements in west beirut but police said they had no precise 
information because the syrians do not report their losses to 
lebanese authorities

league peacekeeping mandate granted in 1976 a year after lebanons 
sectarian civil war began aoun calls them an army of occupation

a prochoice group charged thursday that two 
major newspapers censored advertisements the group wanted to use to 
promote this weeks television broadcast of its film about abortion 
the fund for the feminist majority whose film abortion for 
survival was to air thursday and this weekend on turner 
broadcastings superstation tbs said the washington post and the 
los angeles times refused to carry the advertisement unless a 
picture in it was cropped 
the picture from the opening scene of the film in which a woman 
undergoes an abortion shows a woman lying on a table with legs 
bent and a nurse standing beside her the womans torso is covered 
with a sheet and her bent knees are in the foreground 
the newspapers said the picture would have to be cropped to show 
only the womans head said tamar raphael a spokeswoman for the 
group 
the group refused and the ads did not run she said 
virginia rodriguez public relations director at the post said 
we do try to allow the advertiser the widest possible latitude 
but we do reserve the right to ask people to make certain 
adjustments if we feel they need to be made she declined further 
comment 
laura morgan public information supervisor for the los angeles 
times said the times is a family newspaper and objected to the 
ad because the photo showed a woman with her knees apart and 
uncovered we simply asked that they crop the lower portion of the 
ad 
she said that kind of request is not at all unusual because 
we sometimes ask advertisers to modify their ads somewhat its 
always a question of context and we review ads one at a time 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority 
said the action amounted to censorship and reveals a serious 
double standard for women 
when these papers are selling commercial products like 
movies underwear or bathing suits they have no problem showing 
womens bodies in suggestive positions yet in our ad when a 
serious public health issue is at stake we cannot show a womans 
exposed kneecaps while she is lying on an examination table 
smeal said 
she said the post told the group it wouldnt print the ad as the 
group proposed because it is a family newspaper 
however she said the post has run in the same section their ad 
was to run a picture of a woman practically naked in a bathing 
suit also the times printed in thursdays paper in the same 
section as the ad was to run a photograph of a woman in both 
erotic and suggestive position as part of a movie ad she said 
this silly hypocritical standard doesnt make sense and it 
limits everyones ability to advertise serious subjects she said 
the two newspapers were the only two daily papers the group 
sought to run their ad raphael said

the director of the national park service said 
thursday he opposes legislation being considered by the house that 
would speed the return of wolves to the yellowstone park area 
james ridenour newly appointed parks director called a bill 
introduced by rep wayne owens dutah clearly premature 
sponsors believe the administration is moving too slowly to 
restore the only indigenous species still missing from the 
yellowstone area 
but the measure has other members growling 
rep ron marlenee rmont called the bill blatantly 
antisportsman because wolves kill elk sought by hunters 
this is a meddlesome bill an effort to extend the borders 
of yellowstone rep don young ralaska told fellow members of 
the national parks subcommittee of the house interior committee 
young called wolf proponents romantic and said they should 
see the wolf for what it is without any doubt second to man in 
his ability as a predator against the clovefooted animal 
rep larry craig ridaho said livestock owners will kill the 
wolves in defense of their animals and i would support that 
ridenour said the park service goal is to return the area to its 
natural state as far as possible he said the interior department 
of which the park service is a part is conducting studies to 
determine 
if the wolf population can be controlled once it is returned 
the effects of the wolves on prey within the park and big game 
hunting outside it 
the effect on grizzly bears 
he said the studies would probably be finished by early in the 
next fiscal year which begins oct 1 and no environmental impact 
statement should be prepared before then 
owens bill calls for an environmental impact statement and 
action by the interior secretary after the statement is complete 
ridenour said the wording of the bill would make it difficult 
for the secretary to make any decision other than returning the 
wolves to the park 
ridenour urged the subcommittee chairman rep bruce vento 
dminn to let the scientists do their studies let the wildlife 
advocates ranchers park visitors state and local officials and 
members of congress comment on the findings and then let us make a 
policy which is driven by our stewardship responsibility 
vento asked can you give me assurances that there will be no 
attempt to short circuit the process he said the administration 
already has delayed planned reintroduction of wolves by two years 
ridenour said he was trying to avoid a headlong rush and 
said he had an open mind on the subject 
dr david mech a worldrenowned wolf expert with the fish and 
wildlife service told the subcommittee each wolf eats the 
equivalent of three adult elk cows a year which should not 
endanger the population of about 35000 elk in the yellowstone area 
mech said the elk that died last year of bad weather would have 
been the likely prey of wolves 
if 10 breeding pairs of wolves were established in yellowstone 
about 500 could be living there by the turn of the century he said 
enough prey including animals other than elk exists in the region 
to support the wolves without disrupting the ecosystem 
while admitting that wolves sometimes venture out of the forest 
to prey on domestic livestock he said it was unusual

the navys report on its investigation into 
the explosion aboard the battleship iowa is expected to take 
several more weeks to complete navy sources said thursday 
a board of inquiry has drafted a report into the april 19 
incident which killed 47 sailors 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said the report is in norfolk 
va on the desk of vice adm joseph s donnell iii the commander 
of the naval surface forces 
he disputed a report that discord within the navy has held it 
up and that the service is having difficulty finding senior 
officers to sign it 
i wouldnt describe it as hung up its under review 
williams said 
the spokesman said the report must go up the chain of command 
for review and that it will next be seen by the commander in chief 
of the atlantic fleet adm powell f carter jr in norfolk 
adm carlisle a h trost the chief of naval operations will 
see the report before passing it to the secretary of the navy h 
lawrence garrett who will then refer it to defense secretary dick 
cheney williams said 
the senior officer and only the senior officer at each of 
those eschelons of command in the review process will sign the 
forwarding endorsement williams said 
the spokesman added that at each point the signatore has the 
option of forwarding the report without comment sending the report 
back to the investigating officer for additional work or 
forwarding it as is and express his disagreement with some or 
all of the material 
im not implying that anyone has done any of those things 
yet williams said 
a navy source who spoke on condition he not be identified said 
it is expected that each level of command will take about a week to 
go over the report 
it wont get here before august said the source

house armed services committee chairman les 
aspin said thursday he wants a cold turkey freeze on funds for 
the stealth bomber and president bush stepped up his lobbying 
effort for the radarevading plane and other defense systems 
aspin dwis said congress needs more information on the 
costly stealth bomber as the b2 plane is known 
the problem this year is we dont really know what we 
got he told reporters 
aspin said he wants to give opponents of the plane at 530 
million a copy the most expensive aircraft ever produced a chance 
to kill the program but if congress doesnt want to do that it 
needs more information about the program before moving forward he 
added 
bush on thursday called aspin and other members of the house 
armed services and appropriations committees to the white house he 
pressed them to back his budget proposals for the b2 as well as 
the strategic defense initiative the mx missile and the midgetman 
missile 
the house and senate are scheduled to vote next week on those 
programs and a package of pentagon cuts the administration proposed 
to meet the 10 billion reduction agreed on by congressional 
negotiators and the white house for the 1990 defense authorization 
bills 
bush told the group he is fully committed to that package and 
the weapons systems as essential to the nations deterrent 
capability and to the us strategy at the arms reduction talks 
ongoing in geneva according to press secretary marlin fitzwater 
given the amount of congressional hesitation especially 
regarding the administrations insistence on not cutting the b2 
program bush wanted to reemphasize his policy reasons for those 
programs fitzwater said 
bush was to host another meeting friday to lobby those committee 
members who could not make the thursday session 
bush is emphatic that the plane represents the future of 
bomber aviation and is needed despite its expense the spokesman 
said 
aspin told reporters after the meeting that he could not predict 
which way congress would go on the pentagon spending bill next week 
at the pentagon a spokesman for defense secretary dick cheney 
said aspins b2 plan would not meet with his approval any delay 
in the program will only make it more expensive said pete 
williams hed be opposed to such a scenario 
cheney reiterated the importance of the b2 bomber in a meeting 
with house republicans who are divided on the issue 
supporters of the plane were cheered when it made its first test 
flight monday 
the pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about 70 
billion 
in fiscal 1990 the defense department has proposed spending 
47 billion for the b2 but last month the house armed services 
panel cut 800 million from the budget 
money for the plane is expected to be the most controversial 
item next week when the house and senate consider the pentagon 
budget bill 
reps ron dellums dcalif john kasich rohio and john 
rowland rconn have proposed stopping production after the 13 
planes now in the pipeline are completed 
if their effort fails aspin said he intends to propose funding 
production of only two bombers in 1990 and 1991 when the 
administration wants eight bombers his amendment would meet the 
full request for research and development work over that period 
i say give the opponents of the b2 an upordown vote if 
the congress is willing to step up to this issue this year i say 
lets do it aspin said 
he called his amendment a cold turkey fence of the procurement 
money until congress acts again 
aspin said his plan shuts down the program but it gives the 
administration a chance to come up with another program thats 
politically more acceptable financially 
he said he could not predict how his colleagues will vote on the 
issue because there has never been a public debate on the 
oncesecret program 
aspin added he wants the air force to come up with a cheaper 
program by seeking fewer planes i dont know anybody who 
thinks theyre going to get 132 planes aspin said

the chief of the us militarys southern 
command gen frederick f woerner is retiring pentagon officials 
said thursday sources said the outspoken officer was forced out by 
defense secretary dick cheney 
woerner has been critical of bush administration policy in 
panama and has clashed in the past with the pentagon and state 
department over policy in the region 
in a speech earlier this year to a panama city group the 
general criticized what he called an absence of united states 
policy toward panama 
woerner has served as the commander in chief of the panamabased 
us forces since june 1987 he will retire after 34 years of 
service on oct 1 and will be replaced by gen maxwell r thurman 
the pentagon said in a statement 
pentagon spokesman pete williams who released a letter from 
cheney praising woerner for his dedicated service denied that 
the change in command had anything to do with the political 
situation in panama 
one defense department source familiar with the situation said 
woerner was forced into retirement 
he was canned said the official who spoke on condition he 
not be identified by name another government official made a 
similar comment saying woerner was being forced out because of 
unhappiness with his outspokenness 
over the past months woerners troops have been the object of 
harassment and intimidation at the hands of panamas defense forces 
this follows a us campaign begun under the reagan 
administration to oust panamanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega who has remained in power despite the administrations 
attempt to remove him following an indictment on drug trafficking 
charges in florida 
williams noted that thurman who had put in for retirement 
himself was asked to stay on and accept the command 
the spokesman said cheney has known thurman who is presently 
assigned to the us army training and doctrine command in fort 
monroe va for years and has great confidence in him

solidarity legislators argued thursday 
over their role in electing communist party leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski president and debated whether to join the new government 
jaruzelski was elected to the powerful presidency wednesday by 
the national assembly with 270 out of 537 votes 
solidaritys unofficial figures showed that one legislator who 
is a member of the independent union movement voted for jaruzelski 
who tried to crush solidarity when he imposed martial law in 1981 
union spokesmen identified the lawmaker as sen stanislaw 
bernatowicz of suwalki 
eighteen more members of the solidarity caucus helped jaruzelski 
by not voting or by casting invalid ballots thereby lowering the 
number of votes required for election union figures showed 
to win jaruzelski needed 50 percent of the valid votes plus one 
solidarity also said 11 of the 300 communist coalition lawmakers 
voted against jaruzelski and 16 abstained one communist marian 
czerwinski of debica said before the vote that he could not 
support jaruzelski 
militants complained during a sevenhour meeting of solidarity 
lawmakers that they could easily have blocked jaruzelskis 
election deputy ryszard brzuzy of belchatow said he was quitting 
the caucus to protest but later retracted the decision 
i dont think we should have given jaruzelski something for 
free we should have gotten something in exchange for him being 
elected president said deputy jan bielicki 
sen andrzej wielowieyski of katowice defended the votes that 
helped jaruzelski 
solidarity has decided not to prolong the leadership 
crisis said the senior opposition senator he said he cast an 
invalid ballot 
those ballots seemed to be cast mainly by senior opposition 
negotiators who did not want to endanger the political bargain 
reached with communists during talks in april at the time it was 
tacitly accepted that jaruzelski would be president 
deputy jacek kuron a veteran activist who voted against 
jaruzelski said lawmakers who followed their consciences should be 
respected no matter how they voted 
kuron said he favored electing jaruzelski for the sake of 
political stability but felt pressure from followers to vote 
against the man who tried to destroy solidarity 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said a meeting of the 
sejm the lower house of the parliament was tentatively set for 
july 27 the session would give jaruzelski his first opportunity to 
nominate a prime minister who would form the government subject to 
legislative approval 
communist authorities since june have urged solidarity to join 
them in a coalition government 
onyszkiewicz told state tv after the legislators meeting that 
the majority still believe the opposition should not join the 
government 
he added however that no decisions have been made and the 
debate will be continued at the next meeting

aung san suu kyi who was placed under 
house arrest by burmese military authorities thursday appeared on 
the political stage less than a year ago to become burmas leading 
voice for democracy 
the daughter of burmas assassinated independence hero aung 
san she returned to rangoon burmas capital from her home in 
britain in april 1988 to care for her ailing mother she found 
herself in the midst of an unprecedented nationwide campaign to end 
authoritarianism 
she sided with student protesters and stayed with them after the 
september military coup in which troops of army commander gen saw 
maung crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people 
her campaign rallies commonly draw thousands of people and 
western diplomats say authorities are concerned she could win a 
general election scheduled for early next year 
the slight frame of ms suu kyi 44 belies a steely political 
will that brushes off military intimidation and veiled threats 
against her life she had no political experience before last year 
many burmese attribute her widespread support to her 
unprecedented denunciation of the military and strongman ne win 
whom she charges is still pulling the strings although he 
officially retired last year after 26 years of autocratic rule

a feud between prime minister yitzhak shamir 
and ariel sharon became public thursday and newspapers said shamir 
might fire the hardline former defense minister from the cabinet 
sharon now trade minister has been challenging shamirs 
leadership of the rightwing likud bloc he renewed attacks 
thursday on the prime ministers peace plan demanding the cabinet 
focus on crushing the 19monthold palestinian rebellion instead of 
debating the language of peace proposals 
the former general said on army radio no personal attacks or 
threats to fire me will keep me from demanding an end to the murder 
of jews in the land of israel 
arab reporters said israeli soldiers fatally shot tarik hussein 
imram 17 in the neck during a confrontation in burin village near 
nablus in the west bank they said a 20yearold palestinian was 
wounded in the leg

began dec 8 1987 in the west bank and gaza strip which israel 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war thirtyseven 
israelis have been slain 
palestinians stayed home from work thursday and closed their 
shops as part of a general strike to express rejection of shamirs 
proposal for elections in the territories for palestinian delegates 
to talk peace with israel 
about 250 palestinian lawyers in the west bank began a 
monthlong boycott of israeli military courts to protest what they 
describe as the armys failure to notify family members and lawyers 
promptly about arrests 
brig gen amnon strauschnow acknowledged in a recent interview 
there had been some delays which he attributed the bureaucracy 
but said the army had doubled its legal staff to clear up a case

arab houses in halhoul three weeks ago the radio said 
yossi ahimeir spokesman for shamir confirmed the prime 
minister had received a letter from president bush condemning the 
building of jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza where 
70000 settlers live among 17 million palestinians 
he described the letter as friendly most positive however 
and said it expressed support for the peace initiative 
ahimeir would not comment on reports in two major newspapers 
the liberal haaretz and the independent yediot ahronot that shamir 
was considering dismissing sharon 
shamirs anger erupted in a closed meeting wednesday of likud 
ministers where sharon criticized the premier for not disclosing 
details of his talks with palestinians about election arrangements 
newspapers quoted this exchange 
i cannot tell you anything you leak everything you get your 
hands on shamir responded and accused sharon of sowing bad 
blood and hatred among us 
sharon said i can only laugh at your words i have contempt 
for what you say and shamir replied he who laughs last laughs 
best and i dont want to speak to you 
several newspapers interpreted shamirs words as a threat to 
fire sharon yediot ahronot said the prime ministers allies in 
likud were urging him to do so 
ahimeir suggested however that shamir wanted to avoid a split 
the prime minister is concerned about the unity of the 
likud the spokesman said he has a high tolerance threshold 
and tries to see things in their broadest sense 
sharon who won fame as an antiguerrilla fighter and the 
general who saved israel from defeat in the 1973 middle east war 
favors tougher measures against the palestinian uprising 
his popularity has grown because of such events as the july 6 
bus crash when a palestinian forced an israeli bus off a highway 
into a ravine killing 16 jews and injuring 25 others 
sharons most convincing show of power came at a meeting of the 
likuds governing committee july 5 when he succeeded in getting 
harsh conditions attached to the peace plan 
the conditions demand that the uprising end before elections are 
held provide for continued buiding of settlements prohibit 
residents of arab east jerusalem from voting in the elections and 
reject palestinian statehood 
likuds acceptance of the conditions prompted a threat from the 
labor party to leave the coalition government and force early 
elections labors governing committee is scheduled to meet on the 
issue aug 9

the irancontra criminal case against a former 
cia station chief is imperiled because of the danger of disclosing 
certain government secrets sources familiar with the matter said 
thursday 
the justice department is considering intervening in the case of 
joseph fernandez about to be put on trial by a special prosecutor 
said government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
asked about the fernandez case justice department spokesman 
david runkel said there are various options that are being 
debated 
asked if the options include a move by the department that would 
scuttle the case runkel said thats not a decision that we 
would ever make 
there are very serious matters being discussed with respect to 
the fernandez case and the discussions are ongoing said mary 
belcher a spokeswoman for the office of the special prosecutor 
independent counsel lawrence walsh 
the difficulties revolve around the cias fears that too much 
information about the agencys activities that is now classified is 
being sought for public use in fernandez trial 
fernandez the costa rica station chief who secretly assisted 
former white house aide oliver norths contra resupply network in 
1985 and 1986 is accused of two counts of obstruction and two 
counts of making false statements to irancontra investigators 
the government was notified of a new emphasis in the cias 
position regarding certain classified information which may 
substantially complicate the trial walshs office said in a 
court filing earlier this week which provided the first indication 
that the fernandez case might be in trouble 
in that filing walsh suggested that instead of the trial 
starting monday as scheduled a hearing be held that day on matters 
concerning classified information 
on hursday runkel said he did not know whether exercising any 
of the options the department has would put walsh in the position 
of having to seek dismissal of the charges against fernandez 
if classified information is too sensitive to declassify but is 
needed for a criminal trial the justice department may move that a 
summary of the secret information be presented in court instead 
if the court denies the motijon the attorney general may file 
an affidavit objecting to disclosure of the classified information 
the court must then order that the information not be disclosed a 
step which can lead to dismissal of the criminal case 
fernandez was questioned by the tower commission and the cia 
inspector generals office in 1987 which led to charges against 
him 
the indictment says that he falsely told the cia inspector 
generals office that a secret airstrip construction project that 
was to be part of the contra supply network was initiated by the 
costa rican government 
in congressional tetsimony which cannot be used against him at 
his trial fernandez admitted that north and the us government 
initiated the project 
fernandez falsely told the tower commission that he did not know 
for a fact that north was assisting the contra resupply operation 
according to the indictment 
fernandez is accused in a bill of particulars filed by 
prosecutors of making 19 additional statements that were so 
misleading that they obstructed the tower commission and cia 
inspector general offices inquiries into the irancontra scandal

the congressman who introduced william lucas 
at a senate hearing on lucas nomination to be the governments 
chief civil rights enforcer abruptly took back his support thursday 
and the chairman of the committee in charge said he might vote 
against lucas 
rep john conyers dmich returning to the senate judiciary 
committee hearing room where he had strongly urged lucas 
confirmation a day earlier said it is with a slightly heavy 
heart i come to withdraw my endorsement of bill lucas 
conyers said he made the decision after being frankly 
astounded when lucas told the panel that a series of recent 
supreme court decisions on civil rights did not undermine 
enforcement of antidiscrimination laws 
we are in a crisis in the civil rights movement said 
conyers who like lucas is black 
if you cant figure out these cases are seriously cutting back 
very modest progress that we made then there is no point waiting 
for you to become the assistant attorney general of the civil 
rights division for me to argue it with you then conyers said 
he stopped short of urging the panel to reject the nomination 
suggesting the committee should give lucas the benefit of the doubt 
and perhaps a chance for onthejob training 
the committee chairman sen joseph biden ddel said at the 
hearing i was inclined to vote for him until yesterday 
but now im inclined to vote against him 
my doubt about this man doesnt relate to his lack of 
experience biden said 
he expressed concern about whether youre going to have 
somebody as assistant attorney general for civil rights who is 
going to fight for civil rights he testimony from lucas on 
wednesday failed to satisfy him 
when i asked him whether we were moving in the right direction 
or the wrong way on civil rights he didnt have an opinion biden 
said 
on wednesday conyers had predicted that bill lucas will go on 
to greatness as assistant attorney general for civil rights if 
he doesnt conyers added i will be the first one calling for 
his head on a pike 
reacting to conyers withdrawal of support sen paul simon 
dill who has been serving as chairman of the hearings said that 
it obviously hurts the lucas candidacy how much i cant 
quantify 
in all my 15 years on capitol hill ive never seen anything 
like it simon said he said the vote on the committee is 
close 
it may hurt him some sen strom thurmond rsc ranking 
republican on the judiciary committee said of conyers new stand 
but i hope that it wont mean much 
he did say that he believed that the nominee is committed to 
civil rights thurmond said 
civil rights groups contend that lucas 61 a republican who 
served as sheriff and later chief executive of wayne county mich 
lacks professional qualifications for the justice department job 
such criticism has been echoed by some members of the senate 
panel lucas has never tried a court case and has practiced law 
only since he left public office in 1986 
conyers spirited speech in support of the lucas nomination was 
repeatedly commended to the attention of reporters wednesday by 
supporters while lucas was being grilled by senators about 
questions relating to his honesty and character 
conyers had agreed to introduce lucas after the states 
democratic senators carl levin and donald riegle jr broke with 
senate custom and declined to accompany lucas to the committee 
hearing the senators said they were withholding judgment on the 
nomination 
in his testimony thursday conyers said he was disturbed to 
learn that lucas had told the committee that he could live with 
these cases 
i cannot live with these cases conyers said of the recent 
high court decisions that civil rights lawyers say will make it 
harder to win discrimination suits in court 
weve got some problems conyers said were not going to 
wait to get them cleared up they are going to get cleared up with 
me and lucas today or they are not going to get cleared up at all 
lucas adhering closely to the bush administrations policy 
said on wednesday that he did not regard the decisions as hurting 
civil rights enforcement 
he promised like attorney general dick thornburgh had already 
done to closely monitor the impact of the decisions on court cases 
to determine if legislation is needed to overturn the rulings 
conyers telephoned lucas thursday morning to say that he thought 
lucas position on the supreme court decisions was diametrically 
opposed to his own said julian epstein a spokesman for conyers 
lucas testimony had put him in a very difficult position 
epstein said of conyers who is supporting legislation being 
drafted in the house to overturn the effect of several high court 
rulings 
epstein said conyers and lucas had discussed the nominees views 
on civil rights over the past two or three months mr conyers 
was led to believe the positions were very much closer than that 
epstein said 
david runkel a spokesman for attorney general thornburgh 
discounted the significance of conyers withdrawal of support 
saying i still expect mr lucas to be confirmed by the senate 
of conyers criticism runkel said it is unrealistic for 
anybody to expect the nominee of the president for this position 
would go before a congressional committee and disown a position 
taken by the president and by the attorney general

senegal thursday accused mauritania of 
deporting 26000 of its black nationals following racial violence 
that left between 250 and 400 dead in the two countries 
it is to be feared that not a single black mauritanian will be 
unaffected by the measures senegals acting foreign minister 
said in letter to the un security council 
kane kharass from mauritanias un mission said there is no 
such policy in my country 
tensions between the black senegalese and the fairerskinned 
arab and berber mauritanians have long historical and racial roots 
but a confrontation in april and may began as a minor border 
incident tens of thousands of mauritanians and senegalese were 
repatriated in a unsponsored airlift 
to reduce tensions both nations sent home workers from the 
other country after the violent clashes which left between 250 and 
400 people dead kharass said he denied mauritania was expelling 
any of its own citizens 
but medoune fall senegals acting foreign minister said 
beginning in midmay the mauritanian government took steps to 
expel its black nationals belonging to ethnic groups also found in 
senegal 
in just a few weeks the operation has affected 26000 
individuals who have been driven from their own country solely by 
reason of their ethnic origin fall said 
those deported to senegal were arriving completely stripped of 
property he said between july 16 and 18 alone 2000 blacks were 
deported fall said 
fall said the deportations would increase tensions between the 
two countries 
mauritania was the last nation in the world to officially 
abolish slavery in 1980 most slaves were black while the traders 
and owners were usually arabs or berbers 
hard economic times have worsened ethnic tensions between the 
two nations as hundreds of thousands of people have crossed the 
border seeking work in the other country 
senegal estimates that up to 50000 senegalese mainly seasonal 
workers lived in mauritania before the latest clashes broke out 
about 500000 mauritanians most of them tradesmen live in senegal

the senate agriculture committee failed to 
reach agreement thursday on a democratic plan to provide 1 billion 
in relief for farmers who are losing crops to this summers drought 
and flooding 
committee chairman patrick leahy dvt postponed a vote on the 
package until next week after republican senators argued the 
measure covers too many crops and costs too much 
leahy said he did not want to risk a vote on the senate floor 
without bipartisan support 
drought and disaster isnt a partisan issue and relief 
shouldnt be either leahy said 
the bush administration has threatened to veto a droughtrelief 
bill passed by the house last month that is estimated to cost 13 
billion and cover more than 500 crops from corn to cherries 
senate democrats agreeing the house measure is too expensive 
proposed to scale it back by 300 million by reducing the payments 
to farmers and tightening qualifications for the program 
the administration wants to limit the bill to 870 million but 
democrats say the government can afford an additional 200 million 
if some of the payments to farmers come from this years budget 
instead of next years 
the deep division within the committee became evident earlier in 
the day when the panel voted 109 along party lines to kill an 800 
million republican proposal that would have targeted a greater 
share of the drought assistance to crops that are in the 
governments price support program wheat corn rice and cotton 
where money is limited we must set priorities said indiana 
sen richard lugar the committees ranking republican 
sen thad cochran a mississippi republican whose states rice 
and cotton crops have been devastated by flooding said the 
democratic plan would spread the aid so thin theres going to be 
precious little benefit to anybody 
senate republican leader robert dole of kansas where the winter 
wheat crop was cut back sharply by drought said the gop plan would 
mean an extra 15 cents a bushel for wheat and an additional 21 
cents a bushel for corn 
dole argues that winterwheat farmers should get first crack at 
drought relief since much of the savings in the farm program that 
is being used to pay for drought relief is the result of a smaller 
wheat crop 
where does the money come from it comes from program crops 
dole said if were going to cover nonprogram crops we should 
find the money elsewhere 
the republican plan would have provided relief to wheat corn 
rice and cotton on the same basis as the house bill and the 1988 
drought legislation other crops could have received assistance if 
the money was available in the federal budget 
dole acknowledged for the first time today that losses have 
occurred in at least one other crop namely spring wheat in north 
dakota where droughtrelated crop losses already are estimated at 
660 million 
sen kent conrad dnd who is concerned about getting relief 
for sunflowers and other nonprogram crops in his state said the 
democratic proposal was modest and more fair nobodys going to 
get a windfall out of this he said 
an act of god said sen david pryor dark doesnt 
distinguish between program and nonprogram crops

the senate judiciary committee going against 
heavy pressure from gun owners organizations thursday narrowly 
approved a threeyear ban on sales of nine militarystyle assault 
weapons 
its designed to deny drug dealers the use of these types of 
weapons said sen dennis deconcini dariz following 76 
approval at a hectic session ending with a gun lobbyist complaining 
about a senators decision not to vote 
the measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault 
weapons five already covered by the bush administrations import 
ban and four others produced domestically 
the bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additional 
prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms the 
measure would automatically go off the books in three years under a 
sunset provision 
critics of the measure called it too restrictive although it 
was modest in comparison with a flurry of bills that went into the 
hopper in february following a mass slaying in a california 
schoolyard with a semiautomatic assault rifle 
i think it does a great deal of damage to the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms sen orrin hatch rutah told the 
committee sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said the bill headed 
in the right direction but should be stronger in banning assault 
weapons 
frankly it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups in 
america metzenbaum said 
at the start of the meeting sen arlen specter rpa told the 
committee he would not be able to attend because he was tied down 
with evidence hearings in the impeachment trial of us district 
judge alcee l hastings of miami accused of plotting to obtain a 
150000 bribe he then left 
when it came time to vote an hour later however there was a 
question as to whether the committee should wait for specter the 
hastings hearing was taking place in a room about a threeminute 
walk away 
the problem is hes on the hastings matter and i know he takes 
that very very seriously hatch said 
because of the razorthin margin senators held open the roll 
call for 10 minutes or more in case specter might want to vote a 
minute after the vote was announced the pennsylvania senator 
arrived but told judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
he would need time to study any changes made in the legislation 
biden banged the gavel and adjourned the meeting the chairman 
and specter were both quickly out the door but sen charles 
grassley riowa told reporters that as a matter of courtesy 
they could have given him five or six minutes to study the bill 
national rifle association lobbyist wayne lapierre however 
told reporters he had been with specter at the hastings hearing 
in the back of the room urging him to come to the judiciary 
committee meeting to vote against deconcinis bill 
basically lapierre said specter just decided to be 
absent 
the lobbyist said he still expected the pennsylvania senator to 
be on the side of gunowner groups when the measure comes to the 
floor 
earlier sen strom thurmond rsc and republican followers 
sought to substitute the bush administrations omnibus crime 
control bill for the gun measure but that effort failed 85 
thurmond warned that strong anticrime measures are needed and 
cited the case of a south carolina man convicted of murder a decade 
ago he hasnt been electrocuted yet thurmond said people 
are are losing respect for criminal justice procedures 
biden said crimecontrol measures are needed but not before 
president bush implements broad powers granted him in last years 
drug bill he said the administration has been authorized to hire 
225 new fbi agents but has not done so 
i dont doubt the presidents sincerity biden said i 
just dont think hes tough enough

a senate appropriations subcommittee voted 
thursday to spend 225 million to begin construction of the super 
collider particle accelerator 
the chairman called the collider project the most important 
scientific effort in the nation 
but the chairman sen bennett johnston dla said an 
amendment may be introduced in the full appropriations committee 
that would hold up the 44 billion project until foreign 
governments agree to participate 
johnston head of the appropriations committees energy and 
water development subcommittee and also of the senate energy and 
natural resources committee said he would oppose such a condition 
theres sentiment in our committee to adopt report language 
which will in effect say dont give away the great technological 
contracts to the japanese or to any other participant johnston 
said 
committee reports are not binding but the reports are very 
influential in guiding administration decisions 
explaining his support of the collider planned for a site 30 
miles south of dallas johnston said it unlocks the secret of 
what were made of what the universe is made of what energy and 
matter and all of the basic stuff of the universe is made of and 
its exciting 
he said he has limited enthusiasm for enlisting other 
countries to share the cost i think this research is so 
important we ought to do it in this country if we can and not farm 
it out to have somebody else build the most important technological 
parts of it 
while president bush had sought 250 million for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 johnston said budget constraints forced him to 
settle on 225 million the house has voted 200 million and if 
the project survives the two houses will have to agree on an 
amount

the fourth annual anarchists convention 
got off to an orderly start thursday as participants signed up for 
workshops including fighting against the war on drugs and 
slaying christ 
more than 1000 people are attending the sixday event 
my vision is to live where we can remove ourselves more from 
the world and be selfsufficient said karry koon a nursery 
school teacher from mcveytown pa 
very few of the people i work with know that im an 
anarchist she added 
attendees were greeted by a sign reading bring your own bowl 
spoon cup they included poets musicians teachers drifters 
clerks parents scholars and children 
when asked who organized the meeting the answer over and over 
again was no one and everyone 
everything is consensus said yng tom a musician who works 
at the bound together anarchist bookstore in san franciscos 
haightashbury neighborhood 
anarchists generally believe that every form of regulation or 
government is immoral and restraint of one person by another is 
evil 
despite that tenet the mainstream media were banned by the 
anarchists who discussed the issue during a general assembly 
before the convention got under way 
we decided you guys just arent going to give us a fair shake 
so were not going to let any of you in said one young woman 
who appeared to be guarding the entrance to the auditorium where 
the conference was held 
she and a companion refused to identify themselves and were 
unswayed by arguments that a selectivemedia policy contradicts the 
principles of anarchy 
other contradictions to a classical definition of anarchy were 
admitted without embarrassment 
bill somers a clarinet player in a symphony brought a 
10yearold boy to the event 
were definitely against a lot of authoritarian trips said 
somers adding as he pointed at the child he doesnt go to 
school and no sugar 
as for the sugar mandate somers added he wouldnt impose 
authority on anyone except for kids 
for those not steeped in this particular brand of anarchy there 
was a anarchy 101 workshop one of 16 seminars on thursday 
a written guide described it this way with anarchist 
punctuation just what is this anarchy stuff anyway are you the 
guys with black pointy hats who shoot people and blow things up if 
we had anarchy who would pick up the garbage 
a workshop on the animal liberation movement read woof woof 
woof baaaaa neigh chirp chirp squeek squeek meow mooo 
discussions on veganism vivisection fur and leather ecological 
connections and more 
among seminars on spirituality was slaying christ which 
discussed methods of ridding the world of socalled patriarchal 
religions 
anarchist ideals were summed up by a poem posted on the wall by 
activist dave whitaker 
take what you need give what you can when you can however 
you can in other words lend a hand

a twinengine plane caught fire shortly 
after takeoff wednesday and slammed into a house near an airport as 
the pilot attempted an emergency landing killing the man and a 
6monthold baby inside the home 
the babys parents and their other four children escaped from the 
house with minor injuries a hospital spokeswoman said 
the beechcraft 18 cargo plane appeared to be trying to turn back 
to baltimorewashington international airport when it plowed into 
the house said al dickinson of the national transportation safety 
board 
the home in this baltimore suburb was reduced to blackened 
rubble and flames destroyed all evidence aboard the plane 
dickinson said 
however he said the planes 2100pound load was at least 500 
pounds under the federal limit and weather did not appear to be a 
factor 
the plane crashed into the home of ralph h beam iii 33 and his 
wife janice 31 about a mile from the airport around 720 am 
anne arundel county fire officials said 
the body of the baby paul beam was found in the rubble about 
three hours later 
as the house burned people were standing around because they 
couldnt get in to help said a neighbor who identified herself 
only as ellen i saw the mother and father come out of the side of 
the house by the kitchen and she laid screaming my babies my 
babies 
another neighbor barry majerowicz 28 said neighbors had to 
restrain beam from returning to the blazing house in what would have 
been a dangerous and probably vain effort rescue the baby 
centre airlines operations director henry garbrick whose 
reedsville pa company owned the aircraft identified the pilot as 
benjamin s vitalini 50 of le roy ny 
the airplane left the airport at 715 am on a routine run 
carrying packages for united parcel service to winchester pa said 
federal aviation administration spokesman duncan pardue in new york 
two minutes later vitalini radioed that the plane was on fire 
and that he was returning to the airport but he crashed moments 
later pardue said the pilot was alone 
thick white smoke still poured from the ruins of the house more 
than two hours after the crash neighbors wept as they watched 
firefighters cut through the debris and pull chunks of the plane 
from the rubble charred toys and clothing littered the yard 
the beams and their other three children were treated at north 
arundel hospital and released said a supervisor who gave her name 
only as mrs pasquale 
witness phil farney said he saw flames shooting from the cockpit 
moments before the crash but authorities said they couldnt confirm 
that 
no flight recorder was recovered and the 34yearold aircraft 
was not required to carry one investigators said 
there are garbled control tower tape recordings but 
investigators said they had not listened to them yet dickinson said 
neighbors who feared such an accident have been fighting airport 
officials for years to change flight paths away from the heavily 
populated area 
in this area the planes come by so close they rattle the 
dishes and you can wave to the people in the planes said 
neighbor karen stallings

a group of republicans congressman on thursday 
drenched an effigy of a flagburner with water as a medal of honor 
winner and a former pow were urging congress to resist amending the 
constitution to ban flag burning 
when rumors of an impending flag burning swept the capitol more 
than a dozen gop lawmakers armed with fire extinguishers and a 
bucket of water marched to the scene 
two fire trucks were already waiting as were the television 
cameras 
the flag burning never happened and the lawmakers were forced 
to make do with throwing their water at a stuffedclothing dummy on 
the steps of the supreme court 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif said the congressman were 
setting an example for americans who witness flag burnings 
if they dont have a bucket of water i hope they take care of 
business however they can he told the crowd of colleagues and 
others protesting the supreme courts decision that allows flag 
burning as a form of political expression 
youre not going to come to capitol hill and burn the united 
states flag warned rep larkin smith rmiss 
the object of thursdays scorn was gregory lee johnson whose 
conviction for burning of the american flag at the 1984 republican 
national convention in dallas led to the courts 54 decision 
johnson held a news conference in a building across the street 
to protest congress decision not to invite him to testify he said 
he never intended to burn a flag on thursday 
im not going to like fall into this silly trap he said 
major veterans groups meanwhile told the house judiciary 
committees constitutional law subcommittee that congress should 
take action to ban flag burnings 
two of the groups the american legion and the veterans of 
foreign wars said a constitutional amendment was the only course 
of action the disabled american veterans said it could also 
support support a new statute if one could be drawn that would 
pass the courts muster 
subcommittee chairman don edwards dcalif has said his panel 
hopes to produce a statute for house approval before congress 
august recess edwards and others who fear a constitutional 
amendment would weaken the bill of rights are hoping a statute will 
calm the political uproar 
james warner a marine flight officer who was shot down and 
spent 5 years in a north vietnamese prison camp testified that a 
constitutional amendment would put american freedoms at risk 
if this amendment be issued by this house and ratified by 
this nation there will come a deluge against the bill of rights 
said warner an attorney 
our bill of rights has served as a legal restraint upon our 
government for 200 years he said if these restraints be 
removed we shall not survive as a free nation 
gordon roberts who won the medal of honor in vietnam battle 
recalled how he would think of the flags given to relatives of 
brothers in arms of mine as a last token of gratitude for the 
ultimate sacrifice 
but he said that men do not serve this country for the flag 
alone he said an amendment to the constitution might spark a 
competition among politicians for who could put the toughest 
penalty for flag burning 
each of us that has worn the uniform of this country are fully 
aware that the pledge of allegiance ends in the words and justice 
for all he said 
on a recent visit to the vietnam veterans memorial roberts said 
he saw the flag reflected on the granite face etched with the names 
of the dead 
they were as much a part of the flag as the cloth and 
stitching he said

capital citiesabc inc and a union representing 
more than 2000 broadcast employees tentatively agreed thursday to 
a new fouryear contract after the union offered to compromise on 
job security issues 
the compromise became possible when the national association of 
broadcast employees and technicians suggested to the company that 
the companys fouryear job guarantee to nabet was less significant 
to the union than the issue of seniority the company said in 
a letter to its employees 
the company had offered to make the job guarantee four years 
instead of three but it came with so many escape clauses that it 
was like a swiss cheese full of holes said nabet spokesman 
john krieger 
the company withdrew the jobguarantee proposal and substituted 
the seniority list compromise 
the new rules call for employees on local and network television 
seniority lists who were hired before thursday to have a higher 
priority than those hired after thursday who will be put on a new 
separate seniority list 
that new list will be the basis of last hired first fired 
terminations should layoffs occur 
a separate seniority list for radio employees will be maintained 
as the company originally proposed 
the unions members 2700 according to the union 2150 
according to the company will vote on the agreement aug 11 
nabet also represents publicists wardrobe people and 
newswriters in certain cities among other workers

elected to the newly powerful presidency by 
a single vote in parliament gen wojciech jaruzelski now faces the 
daunting challenge of trying to salvage a crippled economy as new 
strikes break out 
because some lawmakers in his ruling communist coalition voted 
against jaruzelski a boycott of wednesdays balloting by a number 
of solidarity legislators may have made the difference 
the ruling coalition commands a 54 percent majority in the 
twochamber parliament where a simple majority was needed for 
election but some hardline communists are resisting jaruzelskis 
road of compromise 
most if not all solidarity deputies and senators who participated 
apparently denied jaruzelski their votes

nineteen cities likely would be given 10 years 
to fix their ozone pollution problems while severely polluted los 
angeles houston and new york would have two decades according to a 
draft of president bushs clean air bill 
the multibilliondollar cleanup plan would set four new 
categories for cities with ozone problems severe serious 
moderate or marginal and require the most polluted communities to 
use the most stringent remedies 
the associated press obtained a draft of the proposal and then 
applied the latest available environmental protection agency air 
monitoring data to determine which cities would fall into the two 
most serious ozone pollution categories 
there could be some changes when new air quality information 
becomes available probably next month but epa officials said the 
number of switches should be small

the energy department faces more criminal 
probes of its nuclear weapons plants and mounting public pressure 
to close them unless it controls their environmental and safety 
problems federal auditors say 
in a report highly critical of department management the 
auditors said urgent action is needed to ensure that environmental 
laws are obeyed and the public is reassured that the government can 
reliably and safely run the weapons plants 
the report dated july 14 was made public wednesday by a house 
panel as a senior energy department official disclosed that a 
special group of experts from outside the department had been 
dispatched to a weapons plant in colorado 
leo duffy a special assistant to energy secretary james d 
watkins said in testimony prepared for a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee that the experts will attempt to verify the origin of a 
manmade radioactive element discovered at the rocky flats plant near 
denver the plant processes plutonium for weapons manufacturing

the white house and key senators are working on 
a compromise that would restrict us contacts with officials of the 
palestine liberation organization directly linked to terrorist 
attacks on americans 
but they were unable wednesday to persuade hardline critics of 
the us dialogue with yasser arafats organization to give up their 
attempt to impose even tighter restrictions 
at this point its a wideopen ball game a congressional 
source said 
sen jesse helms rnc a key sponsor of curbs was insisting 
that president bush be required to certify that the united states 
was not dealing with masterminds and perpetrators of terrorist acts 
several other senators lined up with him

they call warrant officer youssef bitar 
formerly of the french foreign legion the bomb magician he 
calls himself a bomb charmer 
either name fits for he has defused more than 2000 terrorist 
bombs in lebanons 14yearold civil war probably more than any 
other demolitions specialist 
bitar who also fought the germans with gen charles de gaulles 
free french forces in world war ii has survived three assassination 
attempts by terrorists whose actions he has thwarted been shot 
twice and blown up by a mine all for the equivalent of 200 a 
month and free gasoline 
if all the bombs hes defused had gone off the death toll of 
the civil war would have more than doubled said a police colonel 
who spoke on condition of anonymity bitar is indispensable 
more than 150000 people have been killed in the civil war 
hundreds of them in car bombings 
when car bombs explode before he can get to them bitar can 
usually tell after examining the blast scene how much explosive was 
used sometimes even the type 
bitar 61 has defused 300 car bombs outside hospitals airline 
offices newspaper buildings embassies government ministries 
movie theaters churches and mosques 
most of the others were time bombs planted in jetliners 
supermarkets banks schools universities and gasoline stations 
bitar estimates the total explosive weight of the bombs he had 
defused since 1975 at more than 100 tons enough to blow up new 
york 
bitar is a greek catholic but he defies lebanons 
christianmoslem sectarian barriers and regularly races across 
beiruts dividing green line to the moslem sector dodging shells and 
sniper fire to defuse bombs 
the biggest bomb he has dismantled was in the bir hassan district 
of west beirut in 1983 it contained 1320 pounds of tnt with four 
katyusha rockets attached to it enough to pulverize a city block 
bitar said it was apparently planted by the israelis before they 
withdrew from west beirut after their 1982 invasion 
that was probably the worst disaster ive prevented he said 
in an interview in his elegant penthouse apartment in the sad 
elboushrieh district of christian east beirut 
the stocky bitar sat stroking his siamese cat rambo on his lap as 
he talked dispassionately about his spinechilling exploits 
gesticulating with hands missing three fingertips 
he lost one fingertip on his right hand when he grabbed a 
detonator taken from a bomb he had defused that a police officer 
was playing with it exploded in bitars hand 
he lost two fingertips on his other hand in 1982 when he stepped 
on a mine after he had defused a bomb in a palestinian guerrilla 
base in the mountains overlooking beirut he was also wounded in the 
chest and feet 
that cost me three months in hospital bitar said 
talking of his nervewracking exploits seemed somehow incongruous 
amid the comfortable domesticity of persian carpets brass ornaments 
and exotic oriental decor in his marblefloored lounge 
bitar joined the foreign legion as a teenager when lebanon was 
still ruled by france and served with special forces and demolition 
teams in north africa and europe 
i was with de gaulles free french forces in algeria when i 
heard about the american atom bomb dropped on hiroshima aug 6 
1945 he recalled it sort of kindled my interest in 
explosives 
after joining the lebanese army in 1946 bitar became lebanons 
top explosives expert but he really came into his own when the 
civil war erupted in 1975 and the car bombings started 
i operate with great faith in god bitar said but i rely 
mainly on intuition and a little bit of luck 
i can tell the kind of bomb ive got to tackle the moment i see 
it i try to disconnect it as quickly as possible i feel as if its 
placed under the bed of one of my children he said 
i never panic from the moment i see the bomb i know what has 
to be done 
the bombs dont frighten me but im always afraid of the 
people who planted them 
bitar said the first assassination attempt against him came as he 
was defusing a car bomb in the barbir neighborhood of moslem west 
beirut on sept 19 1975 
two bullets hit my neck and chest but i managed to finish 
dismantling the bomb before i collapsed i stayed two months in a 
hospital that time 
gunmen shot at him and missed three years later as he was 
defusing a bomb near the entrance to a movie house in the moslem 
sector 
the third assassination attempt was in 1985 while he was visiting 
the helou police station in west beirut 
someone tossed a hand grenade into the room he said i 
threw myself to the floor to grab it and threw it out the window 
into the parking lot no one was hurt 
bitar was retired from the army in 1980 but was immediately 
hired by the defense ministry 
i dont think of quitting he said when i look in the eyes 
of people when i arrive to tackle a bomb i see their faith in me 
ill fight the bombers as long as i live

childcare became an important employee benefit 
when a bulge of youngsters worked its way through the population it 
still is but now americans are growing older and eldercare is on 
the way 
it is coming not simply because of demographic dictate business 
efficiency might have even more to do with the development 
whatever a growing number of companies concerned with their own 
future are considering it 
basic to their thinking is the realization that nearly onefourth 
of a typical employers workforce already provides adult caregiving 
services for a parent grandparent or spouse 
generally such services are provided directly and personally at 
home many of the corporate employees who provide these services 
hold critical positions and as a result their work performance is 
sometimes less than efficient 
their inability to meet the highest standards often is related to 
the strain of their dual reponsibilities the problem therefore 
becomes a concern of corporate management 
janice stanger who holds a doctorate in gerontology recently 
completed a study for william m mercer meidinger hansen an 
international adviser on employee benefits she found sound reasons 
for considering eldercare 
she observes that with more and more women entering the 
workforce the number of employees with athome responsibilities is 
hardly likely to decline these employees often are in their 30s and 
40s which means that not only do they have valuable experience but 
also years of further service to offer 
already she suggests there is evidence that the homework 
conflict may interfere with their performance it shows up she 
says in such behavior as missing work turning down overtime and 
training and even quitting 
the corporations role she says has two aspects longterm care 
insurance to pay for medical and associated support services and 
special assistance to those workers with responsibilities for an 
older adult 
her definition of eldercare refers primarily to the second 
aspect and has as its goal to improve the productivity and the 
health and quality of life of employed caregivers and you might 
add the company too 
the benefit helps the worker cope with three things that make 
taking care of elders difficult 
first she points out the frail elderly often have interrelated 
needs that involve medicine finance and social and psychological 
factors 
next the care of the elderly often involves conflicting opinions 
and wishes of a number of individuals the patient spouse 
siblings children most of the caregivers can use help in 
resolving these conflicts 
finally existing community resources consist of a maze of 
federal state and local public programs private nonprofit 
agencies and forprofit providers the red tape can be overwhelming 
the eldercare program as she envisions it can be indirect and 
direct the indirect programs involve personnel policies or benefits 
which are potentially of value to all employees such as flextime 
personal leaves and job sharing 
direct programs include information including printed materials 
lectures and other sources and referral programs to specific 
agencies nursing homes and other resources 
in addition they might include support groups and counseling 
and even access to an adult daycare center for the older relative 
reimbursement programs also might be used to subsidize the cost of 
respite care 
all this sounds expensive as most benefits are not just in 
themselves but as a growing percentage of business costs but 
according to the report the cost of an eldercare program is 
usually modest and clearly defined 
at a time when employers are resisting additional benefits and 
even taking away some benefits granted earlier stanger believes 
they have something to gain with eldercare because it addresses so 
specific a need 
she calls it an opportunity for them

treasures even greater than those in king 
tuts tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of egypt 
when im asked if theres another tuts tomb out there i 
always answer at least one maybe more said zahi hawass director 
of the giza pyramids area outside cairo and the huge ancient 
cemetery of sakkara 11 miles to the south 
my guess is weve found no more than 30 percent of whats 
buried after all egypt is 97 percent desert we cant begin to 
imagine what the sands have hidden 
the tomb of pharaoh tutankhamun king tut was found almost 
intact in 1922 by the british archaeologist howard carter 
it took carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold 
semiprecious stones furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the 
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern egypts valley of the 
kings 
but tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb 
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied 
ancient egypts great monarchs into the afterlife 
some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists 
and their modern successors 
mummies and relics of pharaoh cheops whose pyramid on giza 
plateau is among the worlds bestknown monuments 
the tomb of the architect imhotep at sakkara where more than 
4600 years ago he built for pharaoh zozer a step pyramid an 
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid 
generations of later egyptians worshipped imhotep as a god 
at least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the new 
kingdom the era of tutankhamun and the ramses line 
the tomb of alexander the great the young macedonian conqueror 
who died at the age of 33 in 323 bc records say he wanted to be 
buried in egypts siwa oasis near libya but finally was encased in 
a gold coffin in alexandria the mediterranean city he founded 
the 50000man army of persian conqueror cambyses which 
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 bc while en route to siwa to punish 
the powerful priests of the temple of the siwan oracle 
egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those 
finds would entail but the mammoth job of preserving what is said 
already to be the worlds greatest national storehouse of 
antiquities has halted treasure hunts 
im trying to keep whats standing standing said sayed 
tawfik chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization what 
id like to do is to keep whats buried buried until we can deal 
with it its usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to 
modern pollutants 
as egypts population rapidly expands however roadways gas 
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just 
beneath the ground often excavations are rescue missions 
archaeological work in egypt generally is restricted to the 
cooler winter months and last seasons work was filled with 
surprises giza director hawass said the results give a glimpse of 
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in september 
in january five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest 
artwork the ancient egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit 
beneath the touristtrampled courtyard of luxor temple seventeen 
more statues many broken later were discovered in the cache 
in march a mummy of a young woman her mona lisa smile frozen in 
a gypsum mask was found on giza plateau a few feet from a roadway 
through the pyramids 
other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses some found on 
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey now accessible by 
paved roads 
one area to be surveyed in the fall is giza plateaus east 
cemetery a pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside 
cheops pyramid 
im sure were going to find an intact burial of a prince or 
official because the area never has been excavated properly 
hawass said 
in sakkara where we know imhotep is buried you dont even 
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs you can just use your 
hands dig in the sand theyre there 
modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests 
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically 
troubled times hawass said these caches which may explain the 
luxor temple statues give clues to what may still be hidden 
he believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache 
from the reign of old kingdom pharaoh cheops whose relics include 
the worlds largest pyramid a fullsized boat and an ivory statue 
so small it can be held between two fingers 
i think out there is cheops mummy maybe statues maybe 
personal items hawass said 
four priests were in charge of their safety but in the next 
dynasty after cheops his memory soured there was a revolt his 
monuments were damaged perhaps because he made himself a god 
hawass believes that like the luxor find the cheops discovery 
will be accidental 
we have magnificent statues of his successors and delicate 
funerary items of cheops mother so we know such things did 
exist he said 
one day youll be digging a power line or cleaning and there 
theyll be 
hawass thinks chance also may locate the longsought tomb of 
alexander the great in alexandria 
we have early descriptions of his tomb but alexandria has gone 
through many changes he said 
were not going to find the tomb if it even still exists by 
going after it well find it by accident when somebodys digging a 
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines 
hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries 
remain to be found arent dealing in fantasy 
weve got too much evidence he said kings without tombs 
places we know existed but never were found

they look like a rather unexceptional 
bunch of middleaged men some have receding hairlines some have 
slight paunches 
they are a former prosecutor from washington state a hollywood 
movie producer a businessman from upstate new york a washington 
dc psychoanalyst and a banker from nebraska like most men in 
their 40s they have been struggling through that period of 
selfexamination 
what sets them apart is that these five have dared to expose the 
torments of their midlife crises to the glare of television lights 
the result a 90minute documentary that will air on public 
television stations across the country beginning wednesday is a 
series of candid discussions of marriage divorce homosexuality 
infidelity and virility 
what we wanted to do was take a microscope and look at some 
real people and hopefully enable the audience to take a look at 
themselves said executive producer david keller who began the 
project as a tribute to fellow members of the yale class of 1963 for 
their 25th reunion 
what emerged is not simply the nostalgic lookback he envisioned 
men are somehow in this culture supposed to be strong and 
hold their feelings inside and never crack said robert knight 
who like the others profiled graduated from yale in 63 the film 
is very worthwhile because it shows people can sit down and 
discuss some very sensitive issues and people will listen said 
knight the banker from alliance neb 
richard snodgrass the psychotherapist says in the film life 
for me now is very different from when i was graduating in 1963 
i thought i would have a colonial 1story with a green lawn and 
maybe a picket fence and a wife who would meet me in pearls and high 
heels with a cocktail at 515 
snodgrass left his wife of 14 years and his two children to live 
with another man what youre left with are memories of your 
children looking through the venetian blinds as you drive away he 
says 
michael redman the former prosecutor from olympia wash who 
now works as a lobbyist tells of resigning from his post when he 
found himself plotting to kill a man who had escaped punishment for 
burning down a friends house the man was later convicted of the 
crime 
redmans forehead glistens with perspiration as he describes the 
destruction of his marriage one day out of the blue redman says

it he says

one of the popular participant sports of economic 
and financial researchers is terrorizing homeowners with tales about 
a coming price collapse 
some reports arise out of wall street which tends to think of 
housing as a competitor of stocks and bonds for the investors 
dollar some originate in academe some in the popular press and in 
publishing houses 
a few years ago a well publicized book forecast an imminent 
collapse in housing prices it didnt happen at least to an extent 
discernible in the usual statistics but even after the dread time 
had passed the book sold 
the reason is obvious the biggest investment of most people is 
the home in which they live it is a roof over their head a symbol 
of participation in economic growth a savings account a treasure 
a pension it is to be guarded 
the latest assault on the senses of homeowners the baby boom 
the baby bust and the housing market carries the imprimatur of 
the national bureau of economic research in cambridge mass highly 
esteemed by economists 
authors greg mankiw and david weil conclude that the real price 
of housing inflation excluded could decline by 3 percent a year 
over the next 20 years for a total decline of as much as 47 percent 
by the year 2007 
they reason that demand will be falling off sharply leaving a 
relative oversupply a reversal of the more customary situation in 
which there is growing demand and sometimes insufficient supply 
why should demand fall 
because the baby boomers born after world war ii 43 million 
babies were born at the peak in 1957 will be replaced by the baby 
busters at the trough of the baby bust in 1973 only 314 million 
babies were born 
first came the birth bulge followed in the late 1970s by rising 
housing sales now say the authors the birth bust will undermine 
housing demand in the 1990s and into the next century the 
supplydemand ratio will be changed 
will it happen obviously the authors believe so in the housing 
industry however it is being accepted as but another in a long 
series of threats most of which have never developed full profiles 
a 47 percent decline in housing prices points out critic isaac 
megbolugbe would produce what many would consider a dubious 
possibility if not an absurdity that is a market of houses priced 
below the cost of production 
megbolugbe senior housing policy analyst for housing economics 
a national association of home builders publication wouldnt deny 
that prices might fall for a time in some markets but he and 
colleagues foresee no plunge 
gopal ahluwalia research director for the publication points 
out that in some markets as in houston earlier in this decade 
housing prices can fall when the entire economy falters it happened 
in the midwest too in the rust belt days of the 1970s but 
housing prices there have largely recovered 
housing people like to say that housing prices are protected to 
some immeasurable extent because land cannot be reproduced on a 
large scale in some communities in fact land is assessed higher 
than the houses on it 
there might be slow periods says ahluwalia in fact there have 
always been slow periods in housing followed and preceded by active 
periods price increases of the magnitude that occurred in the past 
15 years arent likely as the home builders see it but they view a 
collapse as far less likely 
a home of your own says ahluwalia is still the very best hedge 
you can have against inflation

the children who swing their hips bob 
their heads and fling their knees and elbows up and out to throbbing 
drumbeats have left crowds wideeyed from kansas city to the 
nations capital and beyond 
the marching cobras an awardwinning drill team also leave a 
mark on the members many of them from poor innercity homes with 
one parent 
for one you get a chance to travel and do all sorts of things 
and another it keeps you out of trouble said aaron byrd 15 a 
cobra for five years i think i might be on the street and in 
trouble if i wasnt in the group there are no down sides to 
being in the cobras 
ive made a lot of friends in the cobras said ayanna 
gilmore 14 who has been in the drill team three years and it 
makes you learn independence and responsibility for your uniform 
your performance and everything 
willie smith drillmaster for 20 years said its virtually 
impossible to understand what the cobras are without seeing their 
flashy uniforms and intricate routines elbows and knees pumping 1 
times for every drumbeat 
as much a part of kansas city as its fountains the cobras 
average 300 invitations a year and accept 100 to 200 they performed 
117 times last year including what smith called a dream come 
true for president reagan 
he kind of pepped up when we started smith said i really 
wanted to go grab him and get him to dance but the security men we 
couldnt go past this line or that line but he would have liked 
it 
the cobras made their first overseas trip in february to nice 
france where they competed in the city of carnivals festival they 
won awards in three categories including best international drill 
team 
we saw monte carlo cannes stayed in the best hotels ate the 
best meals smith said id never get to do that by myself and 
here are these kids going to a place they never even heard of 
for the members being in the cobras is their big chance he 
said when we went to france we found out that some of the kids 
have never been to the airport theyve never been to the country 
club plaza an affluent kansas city restaurant and shopping area 
the cobras began in 1969 when smith coached a group of 
seventhgrade boys to dance in a talent show that group evolved 
into a drill team and eventually became the kansas city marching 
cobras so named after a school librarian watching from a 
thirdfloor window said it looked like a snake 
whites arent excluded but all the members who range in age from 
8 to 18 are black smith said i dont think theres too many 
whites who want to come to the inner city to practice 
money problems nearly ended the cobras in 1986 but the team 
affiliated with the boys and girls club in kansas city which eased 
the money crunch smith said until we came to the boys and girls 
clubs we raised the money ourselves bake sales car washes 
raffles 
but in some ways we were happier when we were scuffing it the 
kids now are getting spoiled they know they get the uniform so 
they dont take care of it like they did before if the parents paid 
70 or 80 for it it would be taken care of 
the glitzy uniforms cost 150175 each so only 85 cobras can be 
in uniform at any time the colors vary each year 
also each year two cobras are honored as the mascot and senior 
imperial the mascot wears a rubber cobra headpiece and leads the 
group 
the person who wears the cobra headpiece is the most 
outstanding member smith said they have to compete for it an 
11yearold dreams of wearing the mascot head its prestigious and 
its an honor 
the cobras are based at the boys and girls club the windowless 
brown brick building squats in the inner city clusters of children 
lounging outside cars stop on the street disgorging more children 
practice is three times a week 
smiths office exhibits honors from past performances plaques 
trophies photographs and letters cover the walls a box of awards 
sits in a corner 
after 20 years smith is more than drillmaster and many members 
call him dad they knock on his door to tell him of problems or 
ask advice being on the team keeps them off the street which has 
always been his goal 
children have changed the kids arent as interested in 
extracurricular activities we need to spend even more time with 
them now than before because they spend more time on the streets 
now and the streets are worse

the idea of merging the caribbeans 
smallest englishspeaking islands into a single nation or federation 
has been around for half a century with little ever coming of it 
but now that a major trading partner western europe is moving 
toward economic integration the fervor of unity advocates has 
increased 
prime minister james mitchell of st vincent and the grenadines 
a leader of the most promising attempt at political union since the 
west indies federation collapsed nearly 30 years ago maintains the 
eastern caribbean faces economic disaster if it doesnt unite by the 
time the 12 nations of the european economic community form a single 
market by the end of 1992 
mostly at stake are caribbean bananas 
mitchell attending a recent regional meeting on grenada said 
that without political unity individual islands wont have the 
political power to protect their banana sales in england after the 
european trade barriers fall 
who will respect you when you go to europe representing a 
ministate how much time will they have for you mitchell said in 
a recent interview we dont need unity to survive we need it to 
get our voice heard in the international community 
im bonetired of trying to convince people he added i 
think weve lost the momentum in spite of how urgently its needed 
vaughn lewis secretarygeneral of the organization of eastern 
caribbean states said if you go to europe and say you represent 
a chain of islands the impact is greater than if you say you 
represent one 
the caribbean benefits today from preferential trade access for 
its agricultural products into the eec 
under current agreements caribbean bananas are protected in 
britain which does not import bananas from other regions caribbean 
bananas grow on small farms and are more expensive than those 
massproduced in central and south america 
with the dismantling of eec trade barriers caribbean bananas 
will have to compete in an open market british consumers then could 
be expected to buy the cheaper central and south american bananas 
and the caribbeans 175 million annual market would collapse 
the west indies federation was founded in 1958 as the first 
attempt at political integration but disintegrated four years later 
when jamaica withdrew 
mitchell supported by prime minister john compton of st lucia 
renewed the unity drive at the 1987 summit meeting of the 
organization of eastern caribbean states a regional subgrouping 
within the caribbean community and common market 
the idea of creating a single country or a regional federation of 
states by mid1989 out of the eastern caribbean islands of antigua 
st kittsnevis montserrat dominica grenada st lucia and st 
vincent was approved in principle 
but antigua withdrew almost immediately and was followed later by 
montserrat and st kittsnevis 
mitchell and compton still favor political union of the remaining 
four known as the windward islands 
the eastern caribbean islands share a central bank common 
currency and high court 
all are small and relatively undeveloped with a combined 
englishspeaking population of 400000 in land mass the largest is 
dominica with 289 square miles and the smallest is montserrat the 
only remaining british colony of the group with just 39 square 
miles 
geographically they resemble a 450mile kite tail stretching 
from puerto rico in the north to trinidad in the south their 
populations range from 12000 in montserrat to 119000 in st lucia 
detractors say a political marriage is unrealistic each island 
is as unique as any nation regardless of size they say economic 
integration not political is what is needed 
we go to the united nations and the world bank and fight 
toothandnail to portray small island states as having special 
characteristics and requiring special treatment we cannot ignore 
this reality in our forums prime minister kenneth simmonds of st 
kittsnevis said in an interview 
we already go to europe as a team speaking for the region he 
said the eec is not a national front its a regional front the 
process should be the same for us 
the windwards export 220000 tons of bananas a year to britain 
accounting for twothirds of the bananas consumed in england 
the four islands plan to hold a political union referendum after 
parliamentary elections still unscheduled are held in grenada and 
dominica 
the caribbean community an organization of 13 englishspeaking 
states that includes the windwards and leewards already has taken 
steps to form a common market 
at present there is little immediate prospect for political 
unity prime minister herbert blaize of grenada said in welcoming 
heads of government to a recent meeting here but we continue to 
knock at the door for closer cooperation and cry fervently for 
economic integration 
caribbean leaders say economic unity is imperative if they are to 
survive the trading blocs being formed around the world including 
the recent us and canada trade agreement 
prime minister michael manley of jamaica has called it the only 
way a group of small countries can survive

the woman might look out of place aboard a boat in a western 
harbor but yachting clothes are practically unknown in the soviet

last year the securityconscious city permits few tourists and has 
not yet adapted to its new status

while much is made of the navys multiethnic makeup vladivostok 
looks as russian as moscow in a city of more than 600000 in the

the sponsorship of the soviet foreign ministry those who paid upon 
arrival were charged 1875 to 2350 for a threenight stay

thousands of miles from moscow the 
name andrei sakharov kindles fire in the hearts of young men still 
smarting from the wounds of the soviet adventure in afghanistan 
in a riverside square in this centuryold siberian city a 
platoon of afghanistan veterans staged a bit of street theater one 
evening recently to demonstrate their reserve groups combat 
training play some popular songs and take a swipe at the nobel 
peace laureate regarded as the founder of the soviet human rights 
movement 
between numbers played by a military band in fatigue uniforms an 
announcer told the few hundred people in the audience we all 
remember how academician sakharov insulted us at the congress of 
peoples deputies 
sakharov was heckled during the parliamentary session in june and 
lambasted by a parade of speakers who accused him of blaspheming the 
military in an interview in canada earlier in the year in which he 
was quoted as saying soviet pilots killed soldiers they could not 
save from being captured by afghan rebels 
the 68yearold physicist and now a congress deputy endured 
almost seven years in exile in the closed city of gorky for his 
outspoken opposition to the soviet military intervention that began 
in december 1979 he told the congress he would not retract his 
charge pending the outcome of an investigation by soviet 
authorities 
the emotional nationally broadcast attack on sakharov 
reverberated weeks later in this far eastern city built on the banks 
of the great amur river to protect against chinese invasion 4400 
miles from moscow 
the reservists loaded their assault rifles and machine guns with 
blanks and climbed atop an armored personnel carrier that bore a red 
banner proclaiming afghanistan in my heart forever 
with police motioning the crowd to make way a squad of troops 
ambled up the street and was gunned down by mock mujahadeen rebels 
lying in ambush by the side of the road 
guns blazing the armored personnel carrier sped to the rescue 
and the wounded red army soldiers were hastily loaded into an 
ambulance truck that escaped in a hail of fire its driver nearly 
grazing the crowd in a hairraising demonstration of evasive driving 
tactics 
the chatter of machine guns and earsplitting roar of artillery 
rocked the night as first the truck was halted by fire then the 
personnel carrier was captured by rebels and recaptured by the 
soviets 
the red army men risked their lives over and over until they 
finally succeeded in hauling their wounded to safety 
the last soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan on feb 15 after 
more than nine years of fighting but as the street drama in 
khabarovsk illustrated the withdrawal was no instant cure for what 
president mikhail s gorbachev once called his nations bleeding

patrick sheehy has spent his entire professional 
life with bat industries plc and as chairman of the tobacco giant 
hes led a 72 billion takeover spree into businesses ranging from 
insurance to department stores 
now the 58yearold chairman is finding out what its like on the 
receiving end of a bid an unsolicited 21 billion debtfinanced 
takeover offer from a trio led by swashbuckling investor sir james 
goldsmith 
i suppose its definitely ironic sheehy said my reaction 
to the bid was one of surprise initially not that we thought that 
we were invulnerable but i mean i certainly thought that this type 
of raid was unlikely 
the goldsmith offer financed largely with borrowed money would 
be the second biggest ever if successful after the record 25 
billion rjr nabisco inc takeover by the new york investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
in an interview sheehy described goldsmith and partners as 
avaricious financiers whose plan to break up bat and sell pieces to 
help pay for a takeover is just naked asset stripping 
in contrast sheehy said bats acquisitions of other companies 
have been friendly with the notable exception of a 52 billion 
takeover of farmers insurance group inc of los angeles earlier this 
year even in that case sheehy said the takeover was a strategic 
longterm investment 
sheehy is a large man with graying hair blue eyes and florid 
face who began working for bat nearly 40 years ago when it was 
still known as british american tobacco co he became chairman in 
1982 
the bat battle may boil down to a struggle between goldsmith 
renowned for profitable forays for other companies and sheehy a 
modest but intensely determined onecompany man who knows how a 
takeover strategist thinks 
sheehys defense so far has been to raise the alarms and to hope 
that the takeover bid will get stuck in a regulatory quagmire 
bat will ask britains office of fair trading to refer the matter 
to the monopolies and mergers commission to decide whether the bid 
violates the public interest sheehy said 
we are certainly using our political friends to try and bring 
pressure to bear he said 
sheehy also predicted the governments of other countries where 
bat operates will raise concern about goldsmiths bid particularly 
in the united states where regulatory authorities will want 
detailed plans on how a takeover would affect farmers one of the 
nations biggest insurers 
goldsmith and his two partners british banker jacob rothschild 
and australian entrepreneur kerry packer have attacked sheehys 
strategy of diversifying into financial services and retailing 
the trios newly formed firm hoylake investments plc which 
announced the takeover offer july 11 said it intends to sell 
everything except bats tobacco business 
we are clearly fighting it on our record sheehy said our 
record quite contrary to what hoylake claims has been we think 
outstanding 
since sheehy took bats helm earnings per share have grown 185 
percent per year compared with a british company average of 115 
percent he said 
put another way the chairman said 160 invested in the company 
in april 1981 today are worth 1829 
bats earnings rose 21 percent to 15 billion last year on a 3 
percent revenue gain to 28 billion 
the company owns a range of wellknown products and services 
including benson and hedges kent and kool cigarettes saks fifth 
avenue marshall fields and argos stores eagle star insurance 
products allied dunbar financial services and appleton and wiggins 
teape paper 
sheehy son of a colonial civil servant was born in burma in 
1930 he was sent to school in australia during world war ii 
attended ampleforth college a boys boarding school in yorkshire in 
northeast england and then served in the irish guards rising to 
second lieutenant 
skipping a university education sheehy joined british american 
tobacco in 1950 at age 20 as a management trainee he was posted to 
nigeria ghana ethiopia and finally to the west indies where he 
was general manager in 1962 he returned to bats london 
headquarters as a marketing adviser but five years later he was off 
again this time as general manager in the netherlands 
some postings were better than others 
i had three and a half years in ethiopia it was a time i often 
was wondering whether i was going to spend all my life there and 
didnt want to he said 
living half his life abroad made me fairly adaptable fairly 
resilient fairly selfreliant with a wide range of interests 
sheehy said 
although he has never worked for any company except bat he said 
id like to think i havent had one career but ive had several 
careers in different countries in different businesses 
sheehy rose through bats management hierarchy quickly joining 
the board of directors at age 39 his salary as chairman is low by 
us standards at about 720000 a year 
asked to describe his style sheehy said i like to think that 
i listen to other people and then take a decision and try and get 
involved in ensuring that its implemented not by telling people 
exactly what to do but by encouraging them and guiding them 
what does he think his 310000 employee worldwide say about him 
probably things unprintable sheehy said i used to say 
that about my bosses 
married and the father of two sheehy lives in west london owns 
an english country home and admits an addiction to golf his 
handicap is somewhere between 10 and 20 he says adding depends 
who im playing 
in this latest boardroom game sheehy has a lot at stake 
personally although he insists he isnt acting to protect his own 
job 
i havent actually got much more than a couple of years before 
i retire so its not as devastating a thing as if i was 40 or 
something like that he said i can say goodbye

tucked beneath the ridge of 
rattlesnakeinfested sybille canyon a barbedwire fence and burglar 
alarms guard a growing colony of blackfooted ferrets once viewed 
as the rarest mammal on earth 
lowlight tv cameras feed the ferrets nocturnal frolicking and 
mating to 14 monitors and video recorders nearby an enclosed 
prairie dog town is ready for the day humans teach the ferrets how 
to kill their natural prey 
if all goes well the weasellike animals will be returned to the 
wild in 1991 starting with recolonization of the prairie dog 
community near meeteetse where ferrets were found in 1981 after 
having been thought extinct 
success would be the payoff to a gamble begun by the wyoming game 
and fish department in 1985 despite the failure of other breeding 
programs thirtyfour births last year let state veterinarians tom 
thorne and don kwiatkowski set up colonies in virginia and wyoming 
more than 60 kits have been born this year 
counting the animals from this year theres 100 in the 
world said kwiatkowski any other species people would still 
be highly concerned over their survival but most people figure 
theyre on their way to recovery and thats it no big thing 
anymore but there can be a setback at any time 
were still pretty precarious tenuous whatever you want to 
say said thorne the other colonies are life insurance if you 
want to call it 
the ferrets didnt always need such insurance they once roamed 
the west from southern canada to mexico inhabiting colonies of 
tunneling prairie dogs as ranchers poisoned the prairies to kill 
predators prairie dog populations fluctuated and the ferrets became 
more susceptible to disease 
in 1982 just 61 ferrets were thought to be in the meeteetse 
colony in northcentral wyoming the population hit 129 by 1984 but 
tailed off to less than two dozen in 1985 when the decision to breed 
the animals was made 
the breeding program started dismally six ferrets brought in 
from meeteetse the first year died of canine distemper prompting a 
1986 decision to capture the colonys remaining 18 ferrets those 
included scarface and becky a father and daughter who in june 1987 
gave their species a fighting chance with a litter of six kits here 
their offspring and those of other founders are dominant as 
thorne and kwiatkowski try to diversify the gene pool 
we have what we think were eight founder animals because they 
were brought in from geographically different areas and they were 
observed in the wild before being caught so we know they arent at 
least full sibs and some of them havent been related for a 
couple generations said kwiatkowski 
we follow a genetic plan each season for breeding which makes 
it a little more difficult you cant just put the female in heat 
with the best male you have so far the 1989 pairings have been 
between unrelated ferrets 
last year was just about the same only the first year we had a 
father and daughter breeding because those were the only animals 
that would mate he said we should end up with an animal for 
release thats much more diverse than was ever in the population 
at meeteetse 
the work is conducted in relative seclusion at the complex here 
the innocuous green building sits behind barbed wire and has a 
sophisticated alarm system prompted by a 10000 reward offered by 
the new york zoological society for information leading to the 
discovery of a wild ferret colony thats enough stimulus for some 
folks to try something said kwiatkowski 
access to the building is limited to assigned personnel and 
visitors approved by thorne only the veterinarians and assistants 
are allowed into the ferrets area and then only after a 
disinfectant shower fear of disaster has produced an evacuation 
system enabling one biologist to remove all ferrets from the 
8000squarefoot building within 10 minutes 
nearby an enclosed prairie dog community built by humans stands 
ready for use in teaching the captive ferrets how to kill their 
natural prey 
to keep the ferrets healthy and prepare them for release the vets 
feed them hamsters prairie dogs and commercial mink feed as the 
kits mature their menu changes from a gruellike mixture to chunks 
of hamsters live hamsters and live prairie dogs the vets raise 
their own hamsters and isolate captured prairie dogs before feeding 
them to the ferrets to ensure a diseasefree meal 
while thorne and kwiatkowski work on recovering the species the 
departments nongame coordinator bob oakleaf concentrates on 
finding areas to reintroduce ferrets and following up leads to any 
wild colonies 
this fall officials will review other sites in wyoming and other 
states where the ferrets once roamed what is required are tracts of 
at least 6000 acres a requirement that could make finding new 
homes difficult because of the pressures already existing on public 
lands oakleaf acknowledged 
those returned to the wilds will be somewhat protected from 
canine distempter the deadly disease common in domestic and wild 
animals university of wyoming veterinary researchers have developed 
a vaccine specially suited to ferrets that is good for three or four 
months and not only kills the virus but stimulates the ferrets 
immune systems work is under way on a vaccine that would protect 
them for a year or more after that theyre on their own 
nobody is talking about any continuous catchandrelease 
vaccination of these wild animals to protect them once you get 
populations in the wild youll be able to let the disease run its 
course kwiatkowski said 
as for the possibility of other wild colonies oakleaf is not 
optimistic 
theres always the potential that theres a population 
somewhere that we missed he said but if you look at what 
history tells us its pretty evident that ferrets have been 
declining for a long time 
sure there could be one or two populations out there that we 
havent found but if we dont find them fairly quickly you can 
count on them going extinct

high in exotic appeal and low in 
cholesterol the water buffalo is hitting healthfood shelves and 
hautecuisine menus 
to fatherandson ranchers oley and tom olson the smelly 
unsightly oxlike animals are gentle giants with the potential to 
alleviate world hunger 
to mitch niayesh vice president polarica game usa bubalus 
bubalis is pleasure for pampered palates at up to 17 a pound 
i always have a freezer full of it said hugh popenoe 
director of the university of florida center for tropical 
agriculture popenoe who is studying expansion of the breed also 
has acquired a taste for rich mozzarella made from water buffalo 
milk and the people whove eaten the hamburger say its much 
better than beef burgers because they dont shrink he said 
a lot of people say the hamburgers are outstanding 
there are hurdles however to water buffalo reaching an 
important place in the american diet first theres the small 
supply there are only about 3000 of the homely critters in the 
united states and regulations make it costly and timeconsuming to 
import animals from asia australia and other sources 
nonetheless polarica a san francisco gourmet food wholesaler 
managed to sell about 20000 pounds last year niayesh said when 
domestic sources ran short he brought the darkcolored lightly 
marbled goods from australia 
his customers ranged from golf and country clubs to swank 
restaurants and hotels he sent 30 pounds to a los angeles bash 
honoring the king of sweden 
these are middle to higherincome people first they wanted 
to have something different then they realized its a good meat 
now theyre using it where they used to use beef he said he now 
sells about 400 pounds a week of water buffalo tenderloin the most 
preferred cut 
the 21 club in new york has served water buffalo on special 
occasions for regular customers although it isnt a regular 
offering said don krindler senior vice president of the posh 
restaurant 
as people become aware that they have got to watch their 
cholesterol they are going to turn to an alternative he said 
if it can be marketed or prepared right who knows 
maybe well have water buffalo burgers grilled as opposed to 
fried 
during blind taste tests popenoe said it comes out tasting 
about the same as beef or people cant tell the difference 
the olsons who tend 19 say there are many differences between 
buffalo on the hoof and the herefords on their ranch near the 
arkansastexas border 
the water buffalo have 50 percent less cholesterol 25 percent 
less fat but we think a lot more intellect said oley 67 who 
retired to the ranch from a chicago lumber business 
tom 30 said its easy to think of the water buffaloes as pets 
since the family has concentrated on breeding to build the herd and 
not slaughtering 
theyd come right in the house and watch tv they are dirty and 
scruffy but so gentle docile theyre just a fabulous animal 
said oley 
they seem to grow about twice as fast as our cattle said tom 
they also cost about twice as much 1500 for a water buffalo 
bull vs about 700 for a hereford bull a pregnant water buffalo 
brings about 3500 
offsetting the purchase price the olsons say is low maintenance 
theyve never been sick because theyre so sturdy and they eat 
about anything leaves weeds any kind of grass whatever but 
its just a drain right now we arent making anything from 
them he said 
it could be a big moneymaker some day popenoe said there 
is a sizable population that would be interested in meat with lower 
cholesterol the largestgrowing segment of the us food market is 
exotic and ethnic and this would fit nicely

women who trade sex for a brief high on crack 
are being blamed for a 697 percent increase in syphilis in rural 
georgia 
the geographics of this increase are very significant said 
jane carr director of the state office of infectious disease 
were seeing syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases 
where weve never seen them before 
they used to be reported only in the larger metro areas now 
its the rural areas that are reporting the majority of the 
increase 
georgia reported 2614 cases of syphilis in 1986 2656 in 1987 
and 4436 last year the increase has been 125 percent for black 
women and 53 percent for black men compared with a 37 percent 
increase for white women and a 7 percent decline among white men 
officials attribute the decrease to aids education 
in the albany health district syphilis cases have more than 
doubled from 232 in 1987 when crack cocaine arrived to almost 500 
this year 
ray shierling one of six state epidemiologists who interview 
syphilis victims in 14 southwestern counties said there are 
little girls out on the street every night having sex numerous 
times just for cocaine 
a lot of times girls dont have money so they use the next 
best thing they trade their bodies for drugs said lt ben 
morris head of the moultriecolquitt county drug squad 
shierling who interviews infected people and tries to contact 
their sex partners said that where three to four contacts in six 
months once was normal investigators now are lucky to get two names 
because clients have had too many to remember or are reluctant to 
discuss matters that involve illegal drugs 
we have very little success in interviewing the street girls 
he said 
women ranging from their teens to their 30s may have sex with 
five or six men to buy one 20 rock of crack said an 
albanydougherty county drug unit investigator who spoke on 
condition of anonymity its one of the highest highs that most of 
these junkies have ever had but its over very quickly then they 
immediately need more so its a vicious cycle 
ted holloway health director for the waycross district said his 
16 counties had 50 to 60 cases of syphilis a year through 1984 but 
in 1987 201 cases were reported and last year there were 255 
officials agree that increased use of cocaine seems to be a major 
factor and the department of human resources division of public 
health has begun a threemonth study in the waycross valdosta 
brunswick and atlanta areas to substantiate the link between 
syphilis and drugs 
people who test positive for syphilis also will be tested 
anonymously for the aids virus and for drug use blood samples will 
be sent to the georgia bureau of investigations crime lab for 
testing 
theres a definite system to it holloway said whether in 
waycross or atlanta drug dealers settle in lowincome housing 
projects where they get young females hooked on crack or coke 
to support their habits these women may sell or trade sex with 
as many as 20 partners a day without ever knowing who they are 
when they cant remember the names of these sexual contacts 
epidemiologists cant find the contacts so they go untreated and 
more likely than not infect someone else 
untreated sexually transmitted diseases increase the risk of 
infection with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus which 
can enter the body through breaks in the skin such as the chancres 
that can form on the penis vagina tongue and lips of those 
infected with syphilis 
the current emphasis on aids testing and education has created 
a drain on staff and funds ms carr said yet it is extremely 
important that we do so because syphilis is known to increase the 
risk of contracting the aids virus threefold

five to 10 times more people may be allergic to 
insect stings than previously thought according to a new study 
its amazing how many people have suffered from this and never 
told their doctors about it said david golden of johns hopkins 
university one of the researchers who tested 269 people and studied 
their medical histories 
past studies showed that only about one in 200 people have a 
history of dangerous or fatal allergic reactions to stings but the 
new study showed the figure is closer to three or four in 100 said 
lawrence lichtenstein who led the research published in the journal 
of the american medical association 
at least 50 americans a year die from severe allergic reactions 
to insect stings and their death is the first sign of their 
allergy he said 
typically people stung by bees wasps or ants will have a local 
reaction a small swelling a more severe case would be a large 
local reaction swelling a patch of skin but a systemic 
allergic reaction affects the entire body it can mean either 
swelling all over the body shortness of breath or a drop in blood 
pressure or all three and can result in serious illness or death 
in the study 269 factory workers were given skin tests with bee 
and yellow jacket venom and filled out questionnaires on their 
allergic histories 
fifteen percent of those who reported no history of allergic 
reactions reacted positively to the skin test that is of special 
interest since most fatal sting reactions occur in individuals who 
had never experienced an allergic sting reaction the researchers 
wrote 
the researchers also took blood to check for allergycausing 
antibodies more than 26 percent of the workers showed the potential 
to develop a systemic allergy each of those 70 had a 20 percent 
chance of developing a dangerous or fatal systemic reaction to an 
insect bit lichtenstein said 
he urged people who have had severe reactions to enter venom 
immunotherapy in which small doses of venom are injected into the 
bloodstream to build up the patients immunity the treatment is 
almost 100 percent effective golden said 
nine out of 10 patients who suffer from systemic reactions do not 
realize they are in lifethreatening danger he said they get up 
from a serious reaction and think its a fluke and that it will never 
happen again

the world bank says it met its goal of a 
billiondollar profit in its latest fiscal year allowing it to cut 
a loan fee and resume a suspended aid program for the worlds 
poorest countries 
a top bank official also repeated wednesday that mexico is first 
in line for a new world bank debtreduction program followed by 
venezuela costa rica and the philippines 
debt reduction for those nations depends on their reaching 
agreements with commercial bank creditors said ernest stern the 
world banks senior vice president for finance 
thats more or less a complete list that doesnt mean others 
will not follow in the next six months he said at a new york 
press conference 
borrowers will save about 200 million a year under a cut 
announced wednesday in the world banks commitment fee which is 
charged to borrowers on the portion of authorized loans they have 
not yet received stern said 
the bank will resume contributing 100 million of its profit to a 
program that makes soft loans to the very poorest countries 
which are generally not able to make interest payments spokesman 
sheldon rappaport said 
in a switch this years contribution will go for debt reduction 
the bank said the annual contribution was suspended last year when 
the world bank needed to devote its profit to building up the 
reserves backing its loans 
loans to the poorest countries through the banks international 
development association are stretched out over 40 years and carry an 
interest rate of less than 1 percent most of the idas roughly 5 
billion in annual lending comes from government contributions 
the washingtonbased world bank said its profit in the fiscal 
year ended june 30 totaled 1094 billion up from 1004 billion a 
year earlier 
the world bank has made a profit of 1 billion a year each of the 
last five years it plows the money back into further lending the 
organization was founded in 1945 to make loans to developing 
countries and has 151 member countries 
after several years of being low on reserves the bank built its 
reservetoloan ratio to 102 percent last year within its target 
range of 10 percent to 11 percent 
the bank revealed wednesday that its board had adopted a 
financial management system in february that will reduce the risk 
from wide swings in currency exchange rates 
by the end of june 1990 borrowers will be required to make loan 
payments with a fixed combination of currencies about evenly split 
between dollars japanese yen and west german marks the fixed ratio 
will make it easier for borrowers to plan their repayments the bank 
said 
stern said the bank will try to match the mix of currencies in 
its loan portfolio with the mix of currencies in its reserves in 
the last few years the dollars decline shrank the size of its 
reserves in comparison to its loans which were heavy in other 
currencies 
in its annual income statement the bank said its return on 
assets came to 109 percent up from 098 percent the year before 
the bank said it borrowed 93 billion in 17 currencies last 
year at an average cost of 773 percent and an average life of 78 
years 
although governmentsupported the world bank gets about 90 
percent of its funding for loans from private investors

zeniths minisport unveiled wednesday is the first computer to 
use a 2inchwide diskette the smallest yet for storing data most 
computers still use 5inch diskettes although the 3inch format 
is increasingly popular 
packaged software is not available on the japanesemade 2inch 
diskettes but users will be able to load programs into the portable 
by hooking it up to another computer or a device that handles bigger 
diskettes 
zenith spokesman matthew mirapaul said the glenview illbased 
company is not counting on the tiny diskettes to become a new 
industry standard although that may happen because they hold as 
much information in less space 
portable computers are getting steadily smaller zeniths is 
heavier than nec corps 44pound ultralite which was announced 
last year but it is also cheaper starting at 1999 vs 2999 for 
the ultralite 
zenith claims a battery life of more than three hours for the 
minisport compared to about two hours for the the ultralite necs 
machine has an internal modem a device that permits communication 
over phone lines something that the minisport lacks

scientists say they have created the worlds 
smallest lasers and packed 2 million of them onto a chip the size of 
a fingernail 
the work was done by researchers at atampt bell laboratories and 
bellcore and announced tuesday at a conference in kobe japan 
the lasers could eventually be used for sending signals between 
computer chips researchers said they take up just 1 percent of the 
space taken by conventional semiconductor lasers and draw less 
power light comes out of them from the top instead of the side as 
with most lasers 
about half the lasers on the experimental chip actually function 
researchers said it would be several years before devices using such 
small lasers go on sale 
bell labs and bellcore said they have applied for a joint patent 
on the process for making the lasers which is similar to the 
process for making standard computer chips 
bellcore does research for the seven regional telephone holding 
companies that were split off from american telephone amp telegraph 
co in 1984 it used to be part of bell labs

lawmakers intent on debating the federal 
deficit are ignoring the basic need for investment in people nobel 
prizewinning economist james tobin told a congressional panel 
tobin joined 326 other economists wednesday in signing a 
statement saying that failure to increase investment in such things 
as education public health transportation and technology will 
have a crippling effect on americas future competitiveness 
the increased investment must be paid for through cuts in 
military and agriculture subsidy spending as well as with revenue 
from new taxes according to the statement written by the economic 
policy institute a washingtonbased think tank 
princeton university economist alan s blinder also testifying 
before the congressional joint economic committee said the

a bipartisan group of senators has introduced 
legislation to allow disabled americans receiving social security 
disability benefits to return to the workforce without losing their 
medical coverage 
chief sponsor sen donald riegle dmich said wednesday that 
many recipients of social security disability insurance currently 
avoid returning to work because they lose their benefits including 
medicare coverage if they earn more than 300 a month after a trial 
work period 
under the legislation disabled people who returned to work would 
remain eligible for medicare and some would pay for the coverage on 
a sliding fee scale linked to their earnings currently medicare is 
unavailable to these individuals at any price 
those people who want to work should have the opportunity to do 
so riegle said a disabled person should not be punished by 
taking away much needed medical benefits 
the legislation whose chief cosponsor is senate minority leader 
bob dole of kansas would cover about 4 million disabled workers 
nationwide a similar bill has been introduced in the house by rep 
steve bartlett rtexas 
costs of the senate legislation have been estimated at 120 
million over five years but that does not take into effect the 
contributions to the economy that would be made by those who went 
back to work 
the bill is a followup to legislation enacted last session that 
extended similar work incentives to recipients of supplemental 
security income a separate program that provides a minimal income 
floor to the nations aged disabled and blind

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said he 
expects to have specific proposals for the 1990 farm bill to 
congress by the end of the year 
he indicated wednesday that his proposals would have a strong 
emphasis on international concerns and would continue the 
marketoriented concepts of the reagan and bush administrations 
as we develop this legislation we must do so realizing that we 
are operating in a global marketplace yeutter told the house 
agriculture committee which is in the beginning stages of hearings 
toward formulating a new farm bill 
the legislation will set us agricultural policy for several 
years it will also include a vast array of programs ranging from 
dairy price supports to crop programs for wheat feed grains rice 
soybeans cotton and sugar 
besides the bigticket commodity programs the 1990 bill will 
include other features that were built into the food security act of 
1985 which will expire next year 
the law also includes credit programs operated by the farmers 
home administration rural development extension and research the 
bill also will include provisions for operating usdas food stamp 
program which serves more than 20 million americans annually and a 
number of other child and nutrition programs 
yeutter lauded provisios of the 1985 law that enabled usda to 
reduce the relatively high price support levels of previous years 
that had the effect of lowering us crop prices and make them more 
competitive on the world market 
when asked by rep dan glickman dkan when he would present 
his proposals to congress yeutter said he didnt know but added 
probably before the end of the year 
in his opening statement yeutter said government policy makers 
have to be responsive to changing supply demands and marketing 
opportunities 
he said current policies toward soybean and oat production 
indicate we are not committed to competing 
he said consumer demand for oat bran as a preventative against 
heart disease and other ailments has created a market for oats both 
domestically and internationally that government policy has not 
caught up with 
we could be producing oats for the american market and 
exporting them if we had anything to sell he said 
he also said the government has never thought globally about 
dairy products 
its a new world out there he said 
he called for a budget commitment to research and development 
saying the united states would not be on the leading edge of world 
agriculture otherwise 
he pointed out a potential demand for agricultural products for 
uses other than food saying the debate over clean air could lead to 
a call for ethanolpowered vehicles the government should prepare 
farmers for that demand by developing appropriate farm programs he 
said 
yeutter who was the us trade representative under president 
reagan reemphasized his frequently voiced concern about 
international trade negotiations and their effect on the farm bill 
it would be foolish indeed if we wrote our farm bill oblivious 
to what is happening in other countries he said the united 
states is trying to get other countries to drop or seriously reduce 
their subsidies on exports but those talks known as the uruguay 
round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade will not be 
complete before the 1990 farm bill is written

the justice department cannot adequately enforce 
federal antitrust laws because of budget cuts that have reduced 
funding and staffing an american bar association panel said in a 
report 
the 15member panels report released wednesday also called on 
bush administration officials to end rhetoric that some existing 
antitrust laws are outdated and shouldnt be enforced 
the task force members uniformly believe that the antitrust 
divisions core mission to preserve competitive markets cannot 
be carried out at the current reduced levels of staffing and 
resources says the 59page report 
the report was submitted to the bar associations antitrust 
section and was not considered as representing the position of the 
section or the association it was released in new york by irving 
scher chairman of the bar associations antitrust section which 
monitors and recommends changes in antitrust law 
scher said copies of the report were sent to attorney general 
dick thornburgh and the recently appointed antitrust division head 
james f rill the aba antitrust section was likely to approve the 
report and refer it to the full association scher said 
asked for his reaction to the report rill said on balance 
its positive 
it confirms the enforcement priorities of the division 
criminal enforcement and merger enforcement rill said 
he said the report makes some useful suggestions regarding 
structural and competition analysis that can be brought into play in 
deregulation and still somewhat regulated industries 
while rill said the report probably is a bit off the mark in 
suggesting that the merger guidelines have not been fully 
enforced he said it does represent a public perception that 
the antitrust division has not enforced those guidelines 
noting his brief tenure rill said he has not made any final 
assessment as to whether the division has enough manpower and money 
to do its job the division has about 500 people he said including 
230 attorneys and 40 economists 
under 1982 and 1984 modifications in federal antitrust laws many 
constraints against mergers in a range of industries were eased as 
the reagan administration endorsed allowing market forces to 
regulate competition 
although it was important to highlight the excesses of prior 
enforcement policies and substantive antitrust doctrines the task 
force believes that further reliance on this rhetoric will undermine 
selfpolicing and voluntary compliance with the law the panel 
stated 
it added that diminished support for antitrust enforcement has 
allowed the talent and other resources of the division to shrink as 
its mission was lost in the nonaction enforcement rhetoric of the 
times 
panel member paul j mcgrath a former assistant attorney general 
for antitrust disagreed with the contention that criticism of 
exisiting laws had undercut enforcement policies he and various 
other panel members also dissented from several key criticisms 
contained in the report 
the panel said that under the reagan administrations 
deregulatory philosophy enforcement of actions other than 
bidrigging and pricefixing have become extremely rare 
it said that during the 1980s when merger activity skyrocketed 
antitrust division resources devoted to merger enforcement actions 
declined and the justice department allowed a significant number of 
mergers it did not statistically define as competitive 
while supporting overall changes in antitrust laws the panel 
recommended a more vigorous and visible merger enforcement 
program and said antitrust laws should not be relaxed further it 
also called for more criminal pricefixing investigations 
in pressing for increased funding the group said the antitrust 
division staff had been reduced by 50 percent in the last eight 
years and many of its most experienced lawyers had left it said 
support for antitrust division lawyers appeared to be at an 
alltime low 
the panel included three former assistant attorneys general in 
charge of the antitrust division former senior staff members 
private antitrust attorneys scholars and economists 
rill said some of the reports criticism is misdirected the 
suggestion that the division is using some set of standards other 
than the merger guidelines simply isnt the case 
rill rejected the reports contention that criminal enforcement 
of antitrust laws had been aimed mostly at small companies instead 
of regional or national ones

the glittering comingout party for mirabella 
the new womens fashion magazine is history the upbeat reviews 
have been written and the gossip columnists have turned their 
attention elsewhere 
now begins the waiting game will the upscale fashion and 
lifestyle guide for the welleducated woman be a lasting hit or 
will it join the heap of new magazines that fold after only a few 
years 
its going very well i think wonderfully well grace 
mirabella the monthlys editor and namesake said wednesday all 
600000 copies of the premier issue in june sold out she said 
but this veteran of the competitive crowded world of magazines 
knows success can be fleeting im anxietyridden she says 
and the sales figures for the july issue 70 to 75 percent of 
600000 copies are expected to sell could be interpreted as 
cautionary but julie lewitnirenberg the magazines publisher 
noted that summer is traditionally a slow time in the magazine 
business and that the first issue sold for 1 compared to the hefty 
295 that the buyer must now fork out 
she also said the number of advertising pages dropped from 123 in 
june to 85 in july and 50 in august but the picture is rosy for the 
september issue which just closed for printing with 149 advertising 
pages she added 
ms mirabella described the pitfalls to avoid if the magazine is 
to succeed 
we have to keep our eye on the reader we think we have where 
her head is and how she sees us the reader we have is an 
intelligent reader selective in her view and selective in her eye 
by targeting a narrowly defined audience of welleducated older 
and affluent women mirabella has a chance of surviving in the 
crowded fashion magazine market said joseph ostrow worldwide media 
director of foote cone and belding a new york ad agency 
but a good six months will have to pass before any meaningful 
judgment can be made on the publication said nancy smith senior 
vice president of media services at young amp rubicam inc another 
new york ad agency 
grace mirabella is a wellknown personality and the launching 
of the magazine was very gossiping and jetsetting she noted 
once that dies out then you are going to see what you are dealing 
with its still too early to tell 
ms smith said the money and backing of communications magnate 
rupert murdoch bode well for mirabella as does the fact that ms 
mirabella is the creative force behind it 
she is an extremely talented woman who has demonstrated her 
strength before i would be very optimistic about the longterm 
success 
ms mirabella was editor in chief of vogue for 17 years before 
she was abruptly dismissed in june 1988 by si newhouse jr the 
head of magazine publisher conde nast in november murdoch 
approached her about presiding over a monthly bearing her name 
in six months ms mirabella not only assembled a staff but 
produced a new magazine 
despite its goals the glossy oversized publication has some 
features that can hardly be considered intelligent reading material 
one article in the june issue lists the favorite lipstick color of 
actress joan collins designer caroline herrera and jewelry designer 
paloma picasso 
but its tone is more subtle than many other fashion magazines 
both in its fashion coverage and its features and ms mirabella and 
her staff pride themselves on the fact that the monthly is almost 
half text 
its a smart and intelligent magazine for women interested in 
style and fashion but like a little more protein in reading matter 
not just a sugar high ms lewitnirenberg said

texas air corps plans to order up to 100 new 
jets in a 28 billion deal signifies its ailing carriers 
continental airlines and eastern airlines expect improved financial 
conditions analysts say 
analysts said wednesday the deal was an important one for 
eastern now in the midst of bankruptcy reorganiztion and a 
lingering strike but said both texas air subsidiaries probably are 
speculating on better times before the start of deliveries in 1992 
each of them along with a couple of other carriers in the 
industry have been facing some financial difficulty said george 
james president of washingtonbased airline economics inc an 
aviation consulting firm 
but with the first delivery in 1992 they could be betting on 
the fact that they will have improved significantly in their 
financial performance by that time and be able to arrange some good 
financing james said 
sixty of the boeing co jets are earmarked for continental and 40 
for eastern 
houstonbased texas air also announced wednesday that continental 
soon would purchase 11 widebody airbus a300 jets and spare parts 
from eastern for 3035 million in addition continental plans to 
lease two mcdonnell douglas dc10s from eastern and in return lease 
34 of its jets to its sister carrier 
i think this is an important step in continentals return to 
profitability and confidence in the future of the airline said d 
joseph corr continentals chairman and chief executive officer 
overall were looking at more seats to more destinations than 
prior to these changes 
continental agreed to buy as many as 60 of boeings narrowbody 
737300s with deliveries of 30 aircraft planned for 1992 to 1994 
and with an option to purchase another 30 of the jets in 1995 and 
1996 
the total cost of the continental purchase would be about 17 
billion corr said adding that about threequarters of the new 
fleet would replace aging aircraft 
corr declined to discuss financing for the purchase continental 
posted a firstquarter loss of 165 million narrowed from an 806 
million loss in the same quarter of 1988 
in a statement texas air said it would obtain financing for the 
planes in later years nearer to the delivery dates based on 
prevailing capital market conditions and projections 
airline analyst louis a marckesano of philadelphiabased janney 
montgomery scott said the airlines competitive position in the 
1990s strongly depended on orders for new jets 
the biggest difference we find right now between the haves and 
the havenots in the industry is the airplanes on order he said 
it may sound like a trite thing to say but when youre 
spelling out the differences that will exist between these two 
groups the share of market these airlines hold in the future is 
going to directly hinge on the size of their fleetshe said 
continental a nonunion carrier that emerged from bankruptcy 
reorganization in 1986 and eastern were among only three major us 
airlines that did not have new planes on order troubled pan am 
corp is now the only one in that category 
the agreement with boeing allows continental to substitute a 
portion of its order for boeings 737400s or 737500s which have 
different seating capacities allowing for greater flexibility as 
the airlines needs change in the coming years corr said

the new york stock exchange can fine its member 
brokers who engage in securities fraud but the government cannot a 
situation the chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
wants to change 
sec chairman david s ruder told a house subcommittee wednesday 
that under current law his agency can impose fines only in a few 
instances mostly for insider trading 
but several selfregulating organizations overseen by his agency 
including the national association of securities dealers and the 
nyse have more authority to fine their members than the sec does 
he added 
and this legislation would remedy that disparity said ruder 
the chairman said the proposal to widen the scope of the secs 
ability to seek fines would give it and the courts more flexibility 
to fit the penalty to the crime take away much of the financial 
incentive for white collar crooks discourage repeat offenders from 
breaking the rules again and help the government recoup some of the 
money spent enforcing the law 
on another matter ruder told reporters after the hearing that 
hes still waiting around for the white house to name his 
successor 
ruder who announced plans in may to return to teaching law at 
northwestern university said that despite the bush administrations 
inaction i havent made up my mind when i will leave 
on the proposed legislation sec enforcement director gary lynch 
explained that a change was needed because for all practical 
purposes our fining authority is limited to insider trading 
a 1988 law allows the sec to seek civil fines of as much as three 
times the amount of illegal profits from those who trade illegally 
on confidential information 
but in other sec civil actions for stock manipulation or 
securities fraud theres no ability for a court to impose a 
fine said lynch 
he noted that the sec is empowered to seek restitution called 
disgorgement of illegal profits but not fines which are now only 
possible after criminal convictions but criminal cases must be 
brought by the justice department 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance noted that in fiscal 
1988 only 25 of the 252 enforcement cases initiated by the sec 
primarilly involved insider trading 
for most other civil violations the sec has only two 
alternatives seeking an injunction against further violations or 
suspending a wall street firms brokerdealers license which 
markey termed the regulatory death penalty 
lynch who is stepping down later this month after more than a 
dozen years with the sec said that censure is not enough punishment 
in many cases but suspending a brokerdealers license even for 
one day would be going too far 
if one section of a large multiservice firm violated securities 
law its not going to be appropriate to take actions that would 
affect the entire firm not to mention that it would hurt the 
customers as well leaving their accounts frozen for the day it 
really isnt a viable alternative said lynch 
the new legislation also would empower the sec to seek either 
through an administrative proceeding or court order a bar against 
security law violators serving as officers or directors of any 
secregistered company 
outside the meeting room ruder who previously said he would 
stay on at the sec until a successor was named said i suppose the 
final means of forcing some action would be for me to leave 
although he has not set a deadline for himself 
ruder also said that no successor has been selected yet for 
lynch who was repeatedly praised by subcommittee members at the 
hearing 
lynch who played a central role in breaking a series of insider 
trading cases including stock speculator ivan boesky and investment 
banking giant drexel burnham lambert inc said he would decide 
within the next couple of days where he will work after leaving 
the sec

for the time being chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca says the nations no 3 automaker is more of a truckmaker 
than a carmaker 
if you call minivans trucks it looks that way because in the 
last 40 days in total weve sold one car for every truck iacocca 
said in an interview this week 
other companies arent quite in that position he said but 
thats just because of jeep cherokee strength and minivan 
strength 
auto industry analysts say the struggling companys emphasis on 
the profitable jeeps and minivans may be the best tonic 
right now its a truckmaker that also makes cars said auto 
analyst ronald glantz of montgomery securities inc of san 
francisco i think its an intelligent decision on chryslers part 
because trucks make more money that cars 
chrysler is expected to announce monday that its secondquarter 
earnings were near or slightly lower than those during the same time 
last year this time around the company will be relying more on the 
dollars generated by trucks than in the past 
chrysler through its dodge caravan and plymouth voyager holds 
56 percent of the minivan market in the united states it pioneered 
the popular vehicles back in 1983 and has held most of the market 
since 
through the first half of this year and for the first time in 
history chrysler sold more domestically made light trucks than 
cars together those vehicles make up more than 90 percent of the 
companys fleet 
trough june 30 this year the company sold 097 cars for each 
truck a year ago at the same time the ratio was 114 cars per 
truck the gap was wider in the first half of 1987 as the company 
sold 156 cars per truck 
general motors corps car sales have run slightly more than 
twice the rate of its truck sales and ford sells better than 15 
cars for every truck 
despite the dominance of truck sales at chrysler iacocca said 
the company is very much in the carmaking business 
we cant become just a truck company he said weve got 
good car programs first of all our luxury cars are in pretty good 
shape because theyre not too big 
then we have an all new platform coming in late 92 he said 
thats a billiondollar effort at a new midsize group of cars and 
theyre coming along nicely 
the one thats tough is we dont have an dodge omni 
replacement at the moment our smallest car really is the pcar the 
plymouth sundancedodge shadow 
chrysler isnt letting todays truck business take care of 
tomorrow there will be more competition in the segment beginning in 
the next few months as the new gm minivans come to the market and as 
foreign companies including mazda introduce more versions 
a growing number of companies also are offering sportutility 
vehicles like chryslers jeep line but chrysler isnt standing 
still 
the company has broken ground for a new assembly plant in detroit 
that will make a jeep model codenamed the zj earlier this 
year iacocca announced that chrysler and the french automaker 
renault would join forces to make a smaller sportutility vehicle 
named the jj 
both of those products are to be introduced in the early 1990s 
and mean the company will have more truck production capacity than 
it does now 
anyone watching chryslers profits knows the company these days 
is making money from minivans and jeeps 
people look at the car side and wonder if they are at a 
competitive disadvantage to ford and general motors said analyst 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york thats hopefully 
just a temporary condition 
but clearly now you can make an excellent case if you want to 
classify it as a truckmaker he said over the next couple of 
years youd have to say the show belongs mostly to the truck side 
of the operation

time inc maintaining its board has the right to 
decide the companys longterm strategy has asked the delaware 
supreme court to uphold a lower court decision allowing the media 
giant to proceed with its 14 billion tender offer for warner 
communications inc 
time made the request in a brief filed wednesday with the supreme 
court two days after paramount communications inc asked the court 
to overturn the ruling by chancery court judge william t allen and 
block the planned timewarner merger 
paramount is trying to buy time in a hostile 122 billion tender 
offer 
allen ruled last week the proposed timewarner merger resulted 
from times longterm business strategy and that paramount and time 
shareholders who are also trying to stop the merger had not proved 
they possessed a right to interfere with the transaction 
paramount claimed in its brief that allens decision would allow 
time to proceed although the merger and times longterm strategy 
would cost time shareholders the financial benefits of the 
200ashare paramount bid 
time responded that the state supreme court itself noted in a 
1985 case involving unocal corp and takeover strategist t boone 
pickens that there is substantial evidence that director 
resistance to hostile bids even at a premium over market price 
tends in the long run to enhance market prices 
the supreme court also has stated that a board of directors is 
not a passive instrumentality even in matters of fundamental 
corporate change and that directors are allowed and even 
obligated to take steps to protect shareholder interests in the face 
of a tender offer time contended 
delawares highest court will hear the case monday and the 
justices could rule at any time after arguments are concluded 
times 70ashare tender offer for warner is scheduled to expire at 
5 pm monday 
paramount charged in its brief that allen used improperly used 
standards for director actions set in the unocal case but time said 
the judges decision was unquestionably the product of an orderly 
and logical deductive process 
time said further there was support for the boards actions in a 
case arising from the takeover battle for macmillan inc last year 
the case allowed a board to use several criteria in refusing to 
entertain offers that threaten corporate policy including a firms 
longterm plans time said 
nothing in the macmillan decision suggests that these criteria 
particularly longterm strategic plans become inoperative in 
the face of an allcash allshares tender offer time said 
time stock closed up 137 a share to close at 13937 in new 
york stock exchange composite trading warner was unchanged at 
6562 a share and paramount picked up 162 to close at 5862 
a share 
separately time announced wednesday its secondquarter earnings 
rose 12 percent to 94 million or 161 per share up from 84 
million or 145 a share in the same period of 1988 
revenue for the period rose to 122 billion from 11 billion 
time said in a statement all of its business segments 
magazines books programming and cable television had improved 
results during the quarter 
for the first half time had it earned 143 million or 249 a 
share down from 150 million or 258 a share in the first six 
months of 1988 
the firsthalf results were affected by times lower 
firstquarter profits which fell due to lower operating earnings 
from the companys magazine segment heavier interest expenses and 
costs related to the warner deal

the united mine workers and pittston coal 
group inc resumed contract talks with both sides digging in their 
heels on the key issue of benefits for retired miners 
pittston coal president michael odom stated flatly wednesday that 
the company wont take part in the unionsponsored health and 
retirement funds period 
the companys attempt to withdraw from the unions industrywide 
pension and health care plans in favor of a program for pittston 
employees has been a main issue in the 3monthold strike the 
union fears that if pittston pulls out of the plan other employers 
will too 
weve given everything we have to give odom said at company 
headquarters in lebanon give us a proposal that displays this 
union flexibility 
odoms statement was basically another demonstration of bad 
faith umw president richard trumka said 
pittston has never said it is unable to afford any proposal the 
umw has offered including the pension plans trumka said 
the two sides met for the first time in six weeks at a motel in 
this southwest virginia town they sat in separate rooms with 
federal mediators shuttling notes back and forth talks were to 
resume today 
trumka said pittston refuses to rescind what the company calls 
its final offer which the union rejected last month 
they want us to be flexible but they dont want to be union 
spokesman joe corcoran said 
odom said earlier wednesday on cbs this morning that the 
company was standing by its previous contract proposal 
at this point the movement will have to come from the union 
odom said we have our proposal on the table 
the 1950 umw retirement fund covers 130000 pensioners who 
retired between 1947 and 1976 it was established so miners who went 
from company to company when mines shut down could have pensions 
corcoran said 
pittston which has 560 retirees covered by the fund said it 
doesnt make sense for the company to contribute to pensions 
received by retirees of other companies 
trumka said the union wouldnt give in on the issue the umw 
wont turn our backs on 130000 pensioners he said 
later trumka told a rally of about 3000 union members and 
supporters in st paul that the umw plans to increase pressure on 
directors of the pittston co parent of the coal company 
union officials said that pressure will be demonstrated today 
with a visit by boston mayor raymond l flynn to the region 
the boston city council has threatened to pull city funds out of 
shawmut bank unless william craig a member of pittstons board who 
is connected to the bank resigns his board seat 
about 1900 umw miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
went on strike against pittston beginning april 5 because of the 
companys refusal to sign a national contract outlawing mandatory 
overtime and sunday work in addition to the retirement benefits 
issue 
up to 46000 miners in 10 states had been off the job until 
monday in wildcat strikes to support pittston workers most have 
gone back to work but the union said up to 40 percent of the 7900 
union miners in southcentral and southwestern west virginia 
remained on strike wednesday 
fred tucker contract administrator for seven umw districts said 
he expected all to return to work by today

the us dollar closed higher against the japanese 
yen thursday while the tokyo stock exchanges main index rose 
moderately 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 10770 
points or 032 percent ending the days trading at 3366487 the 
index had gained 21344 points wednesday 
the dollar ended at 14223 yen up 043 yen from wednesdays 
14180yen close opening higher at 14280 yen the currency 
gradually moved downward ranging between 14205 yen and 14290 yen 
the currency started higher in tokyo following an overnight rise 
in new york despite a lowerthanexpected consumer price index 
figure released wednesday said hisashi matsuda a trader with daiwa 
bank 
the us department of commerce reported the nations index for 
june rose by 02 percentage point compared with a 06percentage 
point increase in may 
the small increase in the index indicates a slowdown in the 
economy meaning inflationary pressure is easing 
it seems that market players bought the dollar regardless of 
the us economic fundamentals matsuda said indicators showing a 
slowdown in the economy normally discourage investors from buying 
the currency 
concerns over the upcoming election have made the yen less 
attractive but many investors seem to be buying the dollar not 
because they are avoiding the yen temporarily but because they think

a new 620room casino hotel is on the 
drawing board for resorts international inc a company already 
burdened with massive debt 
when entertainer merv griffin purchased resorts international 
last november he inherited the obligation to develop atlantic 
citys uptown urban renewal tract long a desolate site just a few 
blocks away from the resorts casino 
earlier this week resorts officials submitted plans to the 
atlantic city housing authority for the 56acre plot a 
60000squarefoot casino with a 32story hotel tower and 
2860space parking garage will take up about 14 acres according to 
the designs 
resorts also outlined plans for the rest of the tract including 
a shopping center and parking spaces 
the plans were submitted several weeks after resorts quietly 
announced it hired the salomon brothers investment banking firm to 
help it refinance its enormous corporate debt 
resorts has more than 900 million in longterm debt including 
200 million in mortgage bonds and 125 million in notes that 
griffin sold to finance his takeover of the company from developer 
donald trump 
gaming analyst marvin b roffman of the philadelphia investment 
firm janney montgomery scott inc said wednesday that resorts plans 
for the renewal tract are all pie in the sky 
this company is going to have to restructure period the 
sooner the better he said there is no way in the world that 
any sane person would lend this company any more money everyone on 
wall street is against them 
roffman said that resorts management also needs to prove it can 
run a casino without losing market share the gaming halls market 
share has declined in the past year 
resorts officials said they do not plan to build or finance the 
proposed casino hotel estimated to cost 262 million christopher 
whitney resorts chief of staff said the company is looking for a 
third party to finance the project 
resorts had already received two extensions on a deadline to 
submit its proposals to the housing authority but was denied 
another extension request 
resorts is now obligated to take title to the land from the 
housing authority by september for the first phase of the project 
which includes the shopping center said authority director john 
mcavaddy construction must begin 90 days after the land is 
acquired he said 
the second phase of the proposal which focuses on the casino 
must be acquired by next april he said 
the authority realizes resorts financial predicament mcavaddy 
said wednesday 
that is the reason they are seeking a joint venture partner 
because the financial picture indicates there might be a problem in 
financing the development inhouse he said 
resorts may be viewed with skepticism when it does start 
developing the renewal tract in 1976 resorts bought development 
rights to the tract for 56 million and promised to build at least 
1200 housing units and an accompanying shopping center 
but the acreage bounced along with the changing owners of 
resorts under resorts founder james crosby the development was 
stalled by litigation from a prior developer and state claims 
when crosby died in 1986 trump bought the gaming hall and 
unveiled plans for a complex that would have been like a city within 
a city 
griffin purchased resorts from trump last year the new proposal 
explores transferring the housing obligation from the urban renewal 
tract to other resorts property in the city 
mcavaddy said the housing authority is willing to discuss that 
possibility 
if they do build housing within the tract it would probably be 
uppermiddle or luxury housing and it would not meet the demands to 
serve the people were aiming it for he said 
even the proposed shopping center might be better placed 
mcavaddy said perhaps closer to new housing developments in the 
citys inlet section 
resorts has the option of modifying its plans in the next few 
months he said until the time when preliminary construction plans 
are due

the rich the famous and the 
beautiful love to summer on marthas vineyard so does everyone else 
but this year locals who feared their idyllic island was being 
overrun by tourists are complaining of a summer spending slump 
the marthas vineyard chamber of commerce blames a weakening 
economy that has depressed tourism across new england and a tougher 
ferry policy for cars adopted in an effort to control traffic 
things are off regionally the chambers executive director 
angeljean chiaramida said wednesday theyre off for us a little 
more because of the perception that people are not going to be able 
to get here 
receipts at local hotels restaurants and stores are down at 
least 20 percent and for some merchants as much as 40 percent said 
jane tomassian executive director of the marthas vineyard 
historical preservation society 
many hotels post vacancy signs even on saturday night 
reservations are not essential at elegant seaside restaurants where 
old money and new talent rub shoulders the real estate market is 
sluggish and some private homes were not rented this summer 
after area residents complained of endless traffic jams the 
steamship authority agreed to stop guaranteeing passage to autos 
without reservations though 99 percent standby motorists are 
ferried across within a day merchants say the lack of a guarantee 
deters many travelers 
i think word has filtered out forget going to the vineyard 
unless you made your reservation a year ago because you cant 
possibly get your car over tomassian said 
a spokesman for the steamship authority said the number of 
passengers and cars ferried to the island from jan 1 to july 4 
actually increased slightly compared with last year 
i could speculate and say that while were carrying people we 
dont search them and check them to see how much theyre going to 
spend spokesman ray martin said maybe people traveling these 
days have a tighter budget once they get off the vessel 
conservationists however welcome a season of sanity after a 
decade of unrelenting growth 
the business people are never satisfied said eleanor h 
krantz head of the marthas vineyard conservation society theyd 
like to have every road filled with people and all the cars and all 
the stuff that makes life miserable 
celebrities are certainly not deserting the resort already this 
summer islanders have spotted the likes of jackie onassis walter 
cronkite beverly sills mike wallace dan akroyd and james reston 
yearround residents include carly simon actress patricia neal and 
heirs to the spalding corning glass and vanderbilt fortunes 
the slump is bad news for yearround vineyard residents who must 
earn the bulk of their annual income in 100 summer days chiaramida 
said it is also bad news for the oak bluffs edgartown and vineyard 
haven which depend on a 4 percent hotel tax to stay afloat she 
said 
according to tomassian the slump has renewed tensions between 
workaday islanders who thrive on tourists and welltodo summer folk 
who fear their tshirt shops will overrun the island 
im afraid that things have become so polarized she said 
you are either an environmentalist or you are prodevelopment and 
probusiness maybe this slump will make people realize that 
whats needed is a happy medium

businesstrip costs can send corporate travel 
managers through the roof but a big accounting firm says its new 
computer software package can help put employees on the road for 
less 
new yorkbased price waterhouse is marketing air auditor an ibm 
personal computer compatible software program that keeps track of 
the schedules and air fares offered by domestic airlines 
alan d miles manager of price waterhouses travel management 
consulting group says the 1500air auditor package can be used to 
plan an employees itinerary or confirm the lowest fare 
the software also can control future travel costs when 
information on the companys travel policies are stored in air 
auditors database 
class of service connecting flights ground transporation 
airline preference and other information can be evaluated by the 
software to give a company the lowest possible cost for any travel 
itinerary miles said 
although in use only a few months air auditor is getting good 
reviews 
i think its doing fine said nancy rowley operations 
manager of us west inc a regional bell company headquartered in 
denver it is another tool for us to keep corporate travel costs 
down 
price waterhouse estimates us corporations spent about 100 
billion last year on travel and entertainment with about 40 percent 
on air tickets alone 
the accounting firm hopes confusion caused by daily changes in 
airline fares will increase demand for software it says could reduce 
corporate travel costs by as much as 25 percent 
under development for three years air auditor originally was 
created by airplan system inc a small chicago software firm price 
waterhouse worked with the company to refine the program before 
airplan was acquired by system one inc an airline reservation 
system owned by texas air corp 
lets say youre flying from chicago to new york and you want 
to leave around 5 pm air auditor will show what flights and fares 
are available and rank those flights and fares to how well they meet 
company travel policy miles said it is the same information a 
travel agent would look at the computer deciphers it for you so you 
dont have to be a trained travel agent to use it 
miles said corporate ignorance has created problems selling the 
software 
most companies are like we once were he said they dont 
know how much is being spent on travel so they dont know what can 
be saved 
price waterhouse estimated three years ago it was spending 35 
million a year on travel but later discovered the actual cost 
exceeded 42 million 
part of the reason miles said was we had a hundred different 
offices using 500 different travel agencies 
he said the company instituted a travel policy that used only one 
travel agent and required the lowest logical fare forcing 
employees to travel economy class but the company also put a value 
on the travelers time 
we wont look for a cheap fare that would have the traveler 
spending three hours in atlanta waiting for a connection he said 
this year we hope to reduce travel expenses by 6 million to 7 
million 
travel agents arent offended having their customers looking over 
their shoulders with air auditor 
these systems are developed to meet a need said stephanie 
maxson of the american society of travel agents a trade association 
in alexandria va corporations are asking for more information 
about fares 
ms maxson said its common for agents to be questioned about why 
they didnt take advantage of a special promotion 
a lot of corporate travel officers dont read the fine print 
she said the program will help them wade through all the 
restrictions 
ms rowley noted that us west communiciations spends about 25 
million on corporate travel 
it doesnt exclude us from using other means of reducing travel 
costs she said it is just another tool 
she said that in checking fares through air auditor the company 
has discovered only a few instances where the travel agent failed to 
find the cheapest fare but she said the software is still useful 
i dont know if we will ever get to the point of not using 
it she said it is an ongoing tool to verify that our employees 
are getting the lowest fares 
air auditor also is used by some airport authorities to determine 
whether the fares offered by airlines are competitive with other 
airports within driving distance 
tom miller assistant director of the greater peoria airport 
authority says he wants to ensure that fares offered by airlines 
serving peorias airport are competitive to those offered in st 
louis and chicago 
when prices get out of line we contact the airlines and tell 
them we noted that fares might be higher in a particular market 
said tom miller assistant director of the greater peoria airport 
authority who worries about competition from the airports in st 
louis and chicago we ask for explanation and if it is not 
satisfactory ask that they be lowered

brunswick corp says it will cut the jobs of 4000 
workers about 20 percent of its employees from its troubled 
marine operations because of a sharp drop in demand for pleasure 
boats and engines 
workers will be laid off at more than 30 plants in 28 states 
brunswick said wednesday announcing an expected 75 percent plunge 
in secondquarter earnings from record results of 683 million or 
78 cents a share in the same quarter a year earlier 
the biggest cuts will be at the skokiebased companys largest 
facility a mercury marine engine plant in fond du lac wis where 
300 workers will be let go the company said about 300 were laid 
off there earlier this year 
projections for the quarter would mark it as the second 
consecutive period of sinking profits at brunswick because of 
problems in the marine group comprised of sea ray us marine 
mercury marine and mercury powerboat divisions 
profits dived 68 percent in the first quarter to 17 million 
at the time the company blamed higher costs of materials and 
industry observers cited assembly problems and the practice of 
selling boats and engines as a unit rather than separately 
chairman jack f reichert said the slumping consumer demand in 
the second quarter was virtually unprecedented after record 
sales in the first quarter 
given the buildup in dealer inventories and the end of the normal 
selling season the company said it cant predict when and at what 
level there might be callbacks of laidoff workers 
layoffs are to take place over the next two months 
brunswicks rival suburban waukeganbased outboard marine corp 
also reported dismal results at the beginning of the month it 
projected a 50 percent drop in its thirdquarter earnings blaming 
its results on decreased demand

the european economic communitys first 
annual report on employment in the 12nation trade bloc released 
thursday showed a rise of 25 million jobs since 1987 instead of a 
predicted drop of 500000 
eec commissioner for social affairs vasso papandreou said that 
forecasts made by the cecchini report on the impact of the eecs 
plans to create a single borderless market by dec 31 1992 had 
been wrong 
but ms papandreou said despite the improvements there is still 
a problem of underemployment in the community 
she added that opportunities to find jobs vary substantially from 
area to area and that employers were slow to recognize that the 
quality of products in the eec was linked with the quality of the 
labor market 
the report showed that the rate of employment in the eec that 
is the number of people who have a job divided by the number of 
people of working age had dropped to less than 60 percent from 64 
percent 20 years ago 
ms papandreou said this was substantially below that in other 
industrialized parts of the world the united states japan and the 
scandinavian countries where the employment rate is over 70 
percent 
the report is to be used to set employment policy guidelines and 
was written according to ms papandreou in clear and simple 
language so that it would be widely read by all those concerned 
with employment at national regional and local levels in the member 
states

a japanese toymaker said today it will stop selling 
a black inflatable doll with big round eyes and a grass skirt but 
the company denied it was acting because critics called the doll 
racist 
shusuke kubota a spokesman for takara co said it also was 
discontinuing the use of the doll named dakkochan as its 
corporate symbol 
takara which also makes transformer robots that can be bent 
and twisted into other objects is the second japanese company in 
less than 10 days to say it is abandoning symbols that critics have 
called derogatory to blacks 
last week calpis food industry co said it was discontinuing a 
65yearold trademark portraying a tophatted black man sipping a 
drink through a straw because some customers had found it 
objectionable 
but kubota said takaras decision to discontinue dakkochan 
had no connection with racial issues 
its not a black it represents a japanese child whose skin has 
darkened from being out in the sun all summer long he said 
takara has sold 24 million of the roundfaced dolls which can 
cling to an arm or leg and wink as they move since they were 
introduced in 1960 and became a big hit kubota said 
he said takara had been planning to eliminate the doll for some 
time but didnt have a hit product to replace it with that changed 
with the recent worldwide success of its flower rock toys 
kubota said 
the toy consists of a fake flower that wears sunglasses and moves 
in its pot when music is played nearby the new toy has been popular 
among adults as well as children kubota said 
the masscirculation newspaper mainichi shimbun said takara 
apparently was concerned that criticism of the black doll in the 
united states might hurt flower rock sales 
in august 1988 us congressional black caucus criticized japan 
for mannequins and dolls which the caucus said stereotyped and 
degraded blacks by exaggerating their physical features 
a department store in tokyo removed two black mannequins with 
distorted features including huge lips and sanrio a major gift 
manufacturer stopped producing three dolls with black features 
in october kanebo ltd stopped making a brand of chewing gum 
bearing a face with big round eyes and big lips after receiving a 
protest from the african national congress an antiapartheid group 
in january a japanese publisher said it would no longer publish 
little black sambo books one of the bestselling childrens 
books in japan for more than 30 years because of racist 
connotations 
japan has only about 50000 nonasian foreign residents among its 
120 million population

frequently emphasized the countrys unity and relative racial purity

a federal bankruptcy judge today approved the 
release of 75 million cash from escrow to eastern airlines which 
the strikebound carriers creditors indicated should help meet the 
companys financial needs through the end of the quarter 
the miamibased airline initially had asked us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland for the release of 100 million from its 
creditors while a committee representing eastern creditors asked 
for only 40 million to be released 
however the parties agreed to the 75 million figure and the 
judge approved it with the understanding eastern could request 
additional funds in the future 
eastern was expected to file a plan for reorganizing with the 
bankruptcy court by the end of the week 
separately published reports indicated eastern was prepared to 
sell latin american routes and most of its terminal space to 
american airlines because of continuing difficulties in contract 
negotiations with its striking pilots union 
a memo from eastern senior vice president tom matthews to the air 
line pilots association said the route sale idea would be scrapped 
if the company reached a contract agreement with the pilots 
according to todays editions of the sunsentinel in fort lauderdale 
and the miami herald 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the company would not 
comment on the report al becker spokesman for american said the 
dallasbased airline has done no deals with eastern but added 
we are an acquirer if any airline has assets it wants to sell 
well look at them 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp and 
eastern president phil bakes said in atlanta on wednesday that 
easterns rebuilding is moving along well they said a measure of 
their confidence was evident in their announcement of the aircraft 
purchase 
under the plan texas air will acquire 28 billion worth of 
boeing 737300 aircraft the order includes 50 firm purchases and 
options to buy 50 more of the jets 
sixty of the jets were earmarked for continental airlines 
another texas air subsidiary and 40 for eastern lorenzo also 
announced a number of other aircraft transactions involving 
continental and eastern 
he said the transactions demonstrate confidence that eastern will 
be a thriving operation in the 1990s the company is in the midst of 
a rebuilding program launched during the 4monthold strike by 
easterns machinists union members pilots and flight attendants 
weve arrived at the point where were able to make a major 
acquisition of this type lorenzo said 
however ron cole a spokesman for the air line pilots 
association called the aircraft purchase a joke 
its nothing but a stunt to draw attention away from the fact 
that eastern is falling apart cole said from tampa fla 
lorenzo and bakes announced the aircraft purchase at a news 
conference at a downtown atlanta hotel on the street outside about 
20 strikers picketed in protest of lorenzo 
the two eastern officials acknowledged that the august expansion 
of easterns flight schedule will not be as big as originally 
announced but they maintained that the smaller expansion is not a 
sign that the rebuilding program is failing 
bakes said too much attention is being paid to the actual number 
of flights eastern will have in its august expansion 
the airline originally promised to have 390 flights a day by aug 
1 but it said this week some reductions may be necessary before 
the strike march 4 eastern had about 1100 daily flights it now 
has 220 
bakes refused to say exactly how many flights will be on the 
schedule in august but he said the airline is refusing to take 
bookings on flights for which crew training is incomplete 
bakes said the company has made progress in revenue hours flown 
and passengers carried he insisted that eastern has enough money 
from the sale of assets to persevere through the rebuilding period 
though he would not respond when asked how much money the airline 
was losing each day 
the appearance by lorenzo and bakes in atlanta followed reports 
that negotiations between the company and the pilots union had 
broken down the officials refused to discuss specifics of the talks 
but said they were not making progress 
i cant be here bubbling with optimism about where they the 
talks are going lorenzo said 
lorenzo also dismissed a plan by chicago businessman joseph 
ritchie to buy eastern as a public relations attempt 
ritchie who has been trying to buy eastern in alliance with its 
unions said tuesday he is close to securing a highly confident 
letter from his financial adviser shearson lehman hutton inc in 
the letter shearson says it would agree to raise 280 million in 
debt financing for the eastern bid ritchie told the wall street 
journal 
ritchie owner of a commodities trading firm also said he has 
been talking with the aflcio about an additional 200 million for 
an employee stock ownership plan

investors who believed they could get rich 
selling tshirts and bumper stickers were bilked of up to 30 
million by the company that made the printing equipment the federal 
trade commission said 
the case equipment co was ordered to temporarily stop making 
promises about its sublicolor system which actually consists of 
oldfashioned mimeograph machines that were sold for 10000 each 
a federal judge also ordered case equipments assets frozen while 
the ftc tries to recoup money believed to have been lost by people 
from all 50 states and canada 
the companys scam cheated somewhere between 2000 and 4000 
people multiplied by a minimum of 10000 each said ftc attorney 
sara greenberg we estimated up to 30 million in court papers 
case equipments owner anthony j casella said this morning 
that his equipment works as advertised he said customers who made 
no money using it probably were just not cut out to be in business 
for themselves casella said he had sold about 3800 of the machines 
we sell to an awful lot of people who have never been in 
business before and they think the equipment is going to make them 
a millionaire and thats not true casella told the associated 
press in a telephone interview people make themselves 
millionaires 
the ftc last week asked us district judge gene carter to issue 
a temporary restraining order against case equipment 
ms greenberg said from her boston office that ftc lawyers plan 
to return to us district court on friday to seek a preliminary 
injunction that would halt the allegedly fraudulent sales until the 
ftcs civil lawsuit against the company is resolved 
its ok if he sells the equipment she said he just has to 
tell the truth about it were seeking restitution for customers 
which is plenty theres your 20 million to 30 million 
case equipment is also named in a separate lawsuit in us 
district court in which customers from several states say they were 
bilked they are asking for compensatory and punitive damages 
case equipment has operated in turner since 1984 prior to that 
casella also known as aj casella and aj case abandoned a 
similar operation in massachusetts when that states attorney 
generals office began investigating complaints ms greenberg said 
she said potential investors were lured to case equipment by 
national magazine advertisements flown into portland international 
jetport and picked up in limousines that took them to case 
equipments showroom in turner 
they were shown impressive samples of printing and given a sales 
pitch that said making money with the sublicolor system would be 
easy and that case equipment had service centers around the country 
and long lists of potential customers ms greenberg said the 
customers living expenses were paid during their visits 
its a wine em and dine em sort of operation and the people 
are impressed ms greenberg said even people who had some 
knowledge of the printing industry were taken in they have told 
customers stories about how a 15yearold could use it they said 
anyone can use it 
but once people bought the case equipment machinery they were 
ignored and given little training in using it ftc documents say 
the machinery could not be operated by untrained workers and 
produced sloppy printing without regular maintenance the ftc said 
the company falsely claimed to have service centers all over the 
nation when it had none the ftc said 
consumers not only lose their initial 10000plus investment 
they spend significant additional sums and valuable time in vain 
trying to get the equipment to function the ftc said 
the commission accuses case equipment of cheating mostly 
working people looking to start or expand their own small business 
ventures however the only ones to profit have been case and 
casella 
casella said the companies that make and distribute his equipment 
provide numerous service centers he said his company provides food 
and lodging to potential customers to make sure they come see what 
they are buying he said he insists buyers attend training sessions 
and sign a form saying they are trained in the use of the sublicolor 
and satisfied with its performance

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today the central bank has been pushing down interest rates in an 
effort to keep the country out of a recession and acknowledged the 
feds best efforts might not be enough 
after a year of raising interest rates to dampen inflationary 
pressures greenspan said the fed switched course in june and began 
lowering rates because of widespread signs of a weakening economy 
greenspan making his midyear report to congress indicated that 
the fed stood ready to lower rates further but he said its best 
efforts might not be enough to stave off an economic downturn 
some day some event will end the extraordinary string of 
economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982 greenspan 
said in testimony before a house banking subcommittee 
the fed chairman said it was entirely possible that some federal 
reserve policy mistake could trigger a new recession despite the 
agencys best efforts to keep the current record peacetime recovery 
going 
elsewhere on capitol hill the bush administration praised the 
feds efforts to drive down interest rates 
michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser told the 
joint economic committee that the central bank had acted prudently 
and had avoided any major policy mistakes 
he declined to say whether it should lower interest rates further 
to avoid a recession saying i dont like to preach to the fed in 
public 
the federal reserve is committed to doing its utmost to ensure 
prosperity and rising standards of living over the long run 
greenspan said we do however face a difficult balancing act 
greenspan said the fed must weigh the dangers of a recession 
against the risk that too loose a monetary policy could spark a new 
inflationary spiral in the country 
greenspan said the feds policies would be oriented toward 
avoiding an unnecessary and destructive recession 
the fed chairmans comments indicated that the central bank was 
likely to continue its policy of gradually lowering interest rates 
over the coming months greenspan said the fed first began easing 
credit conditions in early june and eased again in early july 
greenspans remarks were the first official indication that the 
central bank had indeed reversed its yearlong tightening efforts 
although there was a widespread belief in financial markets that 
this was occurring 
greenspan released a revised economic forecast which showed that 
the central bank still hopes to achieve a socalled soft landing in 
which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but not 
decline so much that the country is thrown into a recession 
the fed forecast that the overall economy would grow at an annual 
rate of between 2 percent and 25 percent this was lower than the 
administrations revised forecast on tuesday that the economy would 
grow at a 27 percent rate this year 
the congressional budget office today forecast a 24 percent rate 
of growth this year slowing to 2 percent in 1990 
the fed saw more dangers from higher inflation forecasting that 
consumer prices would rise by between 5 percent and 55 percent this 
year up from last years 44 percent increase 
the administration is less concerned about an uptick in 
inflation forecasting that consumer prices would rise 49 percent 
this year 
the cbo estimated consumer price inflation and interest rates 
will be about half a percentage point higher both this year and in 
1989 than the administration forecast tuesday 
it predicted civilian unemployment will rise from its current 53 
percent to average 55 percent in 1990 
the recent slowing in economic growth will not go so far as to 
turn into a recession during the next several months cbo director 
robert reischauer told the house budget committee 
reischauer estimated the chances of the economy slipping into a 
recession during the next nine months was in the 15 percent to 40 
percent range 
in setting preliminary monetary growth targets greenspan said 
the fed had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for this 
year and next year as well 
for m2 the measure of the money supply which includes currency 
in circulation and interestbearing checking accounts the fed said 
it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent both 
this year and in 1990 
the central bank is charged with the primary task of guarding 
against inflation by controlling how fast the money supply 
increases the goal is to supply enough money to support healthy 
growth while making sure that inflation is not reignited by pumping 
too much money into the system 
the feds actions influence the cost of money interest rates 
with the decision in early june to ease credit conditions a 
variety of business and consumer interest rates have been falling 
and economists are predicting that the current fed easing course 
will mean further declines in banks prime lending rate and in 
mortgage rates over the next several months 
recent inflation figures look favorable on wednesday the 
government reported consumer prices edged up just 02 percent in 
june the smallest advance in 16 months that followed news last 
week that prices at the wholesale level actually fell last month 
before the june slowdown consumer prices were shooting up at the 
fastest pace since 1982 but economists believe the worst is now 
over for energy price increases caused by the clampdown on 
production by oil exporting countries and in food costs which were 
driven up by last summers drought

textron corp said thursday its 
secondquarter earnings declined nearly 14 percent reflecting an 
arbitrators decision that textron owed money to iran and because of 
weakness in its aerospace division 
the diversified company said it had income of 593 million or 
67 cents per share compared with 689 million or 78 cents per 
share in the 1988 quarter revenue was 185 billion compared with 
179 billion a year earlier 
earnings were depressed by an arbitrators ruling that textron 
owed iran 95 million under an agreement to jointly produce 
helicopters said company spokesman raymond w caine jr 
iran had paid for materials in 1978 but they had not been 
shipped before textron was prohibited by the us government from 
providing any further supplies to iran he said 
the aerospace divisions earnings decreased nearly 25 million 
primarily because of increased costs on fixedprice development 
programs for the v22 osprey and on some rocket and smartbomb 
systems caine said that was offset by an increase of almost 10 
million in earnings for financial services 
textron also recorded a 14 million increase in interest expense 
mostly from its acquisition of avdel plc a british fastener 
manufacturer textron has been unable to complete the acquisition 
and absorb the earnings however because of federal trade 
commission opposition 
textron has interests in a number of industries including 
aerospace technology commercial products and financial services

the big three automakers earnings roll is slowing 
down 
after setting earnings records in three of the last four 
quarters analysts expect general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp will announce secondquarter earnings slightly lower 
than a year ago reflecting a softening us car and truck market 
but they add its no time to panic 
i dont think theres that much importance thats going to be 
placed on earnings comparisons with last year said auto analyst 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york 
earnings last year were exceptionally strong and this year all 
weve heard about is weakness he said 
the big threes roll of quarterly earnings records began in the 
second quarter last year when the companies reported earnings of 
349 billion or 714 a share that was followed by a record 
thirdquarter report of 183 billion and a record fourth quarter in 
which the companies made 3 billion 
the big three earned 354 billion in the first quarter of this 
year second only to the record of 387 billion posted in the first 
quarter of 1984 
gm and ford tentatively have scheduled their earnings reports for 
the middle of next week and chryslers is due july 31 
surveys of analysts predictions show gm will report 
secondquarter earnings around 217 a share ford will show a 
pershare profit of about 310 and chrysler will have a profit of 
150 a share 
those estimates compare with secondquarter pershare earnings 
last year of 226 for gm 343 for ford and 145 for chrysler 
the industry began to soften early this year car and truck sales 
for the big three during the first half of the year were down 65 
percent from last year 
whats more important is the level of profitability the big 
three will demonstrate given this weak setting brady said 
some observers say the market is saturated by the 80 million or 
so new cars that have been sold during the last five years 
the automobile industry also has been hit by expectations of 
slower economic growth fluctuations in interest rates and consumer 
indifference to recent sales incentives 
that compares robust sales in the industry and a more stable 
overall economy at the same time last year incentives a year ago 
also sparked consumer demand making it easier for automakers to get 
rid of inventories that can drag down earnings 
incentives though can be a wild card in an automakers earnings 
since they come directly out of profits if not careful an 
automaker can find itself in a vicious circle 
higher sales increase profits while incentives lower them in an 
effort to boost sales the companies have increased incentives and 
thats costly 
analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co of new york 
estimated that the big three spent about 600 per car in incentives 
during the first quarter and boosted that to 800 to 850 per car in 
the second quarter 
i think the crunch time is coming he said 
analyst ronald glantz of montgomery securities inc of san 
francisco said the big three are facing a twofold problem 
the primary problem is unprecedented incentives compounded by 
the recent strength in the dollar which has improved import 
competitiveness and reduced the dollar value of overseas earnings 
he said 
the profits that gm and ford have posted in recent quarters have 
been buoyed strongly by their european automotive operations while 
theyve made money in north america recently earnings have been 
stronger in europe 
european income has little effect on earnings of the muchsmaller 
chrysler 
while the big three are likely to report slightly lower earnings 
in the second quarter some analysts said the financial community is 
looking more toward the thirdquarter results which will be 
reported in october 
in general my sense is there are going to be a lot of earnings 
cuts coming after the release of these secondquarter numbers 
kirnan said 
i think a lot of people have delayed making major adjustments 
in their earnings estimates because they want to see how things 
fared in the second quarter how heavy were the incentive costs

wheat futures prices closed higher while corn and 
soybean futures finished mostly lower thursday on the chicago board 
of trade where attention was focused on the expiration of the july 
soybean contract 
trading in soybeans for july delivery ended at 1201 pm central 
time after a spurt of selling that pushed the contracts price down 
to 688 a bushel 39 cents below wednesdays settlement price 
analysts said thin trading conditions made the july soybean 
contract extremely volatile traders had been exiting that market 
since july 11 when the board of trade issued an emergency order 
requiring them to limit their holdings in the july contract 
some said it appeared that the italian grain concern ferruzzi 
finanziaria spa the reputed target of the exchanges unusual 
order had switched its large july position into the august 
contract possibly setting up another confrontation with the 
exchange 
trading companies believed to be representing ferruzzi were large 
sellers in the minutes before the july contract expired traders 
said 
the wheat market gained support from expectations of new export 
business and perceptions that the market has reached its seasonal 
bottom said katharina zimmer an analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
the corn and soybean markets were pressured by rain in the 
midwest in addition to the pronounced weakness in the expiring july 
contracts 
july wheat expired cent higher at 390 a bushel july corn 
expired 6 cents lower at 247 a bushel july oats expired 3 cents 
lower at 143 a bushel 
at the close other wheat contracts were 3 cents to 7 cents

from 144 million or 53 cents a share in the 1988 period 
operating revenue totaled 120 billion down 5 percent from 
126 billion in the comparable 1988 period 
schlumberger chairman evan baird said earningspershare

5 cents a share from the sale of schlumbergers defense systems 
businesses and 22 million or 9 cents a share from an award by

transfer the license to an rko subsidiary gradh107 which in turn 
will transfer the license to buckley upon consummation of the 
settlement 
the greenwich connbased buckley will pay rko 24 million of

also will pay 15 million in addition to the 24 million 
directly to principals of the competing applicants 
the fcc said rkos receipt of less than full market value for

misconduct 
the sale was the latest step in the fccordered dismantling of 
the rko network which began in the 1960s when challenges were 
filed to rkos fitness to operate its stations 
in a 1980 ruling that stripped rko of one tv license the fcc

the stock market turned downward today yielding 
to a late wave of selling that wiped out earlier gains 
analysts said traders were generally encouraged by the testimony 
today of alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board 
before the house banking committee on the feds credit policies 
greenspan said the central bank had taken note of a slowing in 
the pace of economic activity and was seeking to avoid an 
unnecessary and destructive recession 
however he also noted that inflation remained clearly above 
where the fed would like to see it 
brokers said greenspans comments squared with the recent belief 
that the fed was proceeding gradually to try to steer the economy 
toward a soft landing that could set the stage for renewed 
growth

the chicago board of trade took its emergency 
action in the soybean futures market last week after federal 
regulators took steps against a single concern the cbots chairman 
testified thursday 
chairman karsten mahlman would not identify the major 
participant believed to be italian agribusiness giant feruzzi 
spa which took a massive position in july soybean futures 
mahlman said the cbot board voted the emergency order which 
required liquidation of large positions in the july bean futures 
market after determining that only one board member who was 
excused from the meeting and did not vote owned or controlled 
positions in july soybeans 
we hope our strong action in july will not be necessary in 
august mahlman told reporters after testifying before a house 
subcommittee 
although he conceded under repeated questioning by rep david 
r nagle diowa that several other board members were employed by 
companies that controlled or served customers that controlled 
soybean positions mahlman defended the cbots action 
outside the hearing room he said i think we have 
dramatically enhanced the credibility of the board 
mahlman said eliminating all board members with employer links 
to futures positions would force about onethird of them to resign 
mahlmans version of the emergency order differed from that 
given by federal regulators earlier this week 
the hearings are being conducted on proposed legislation that 
would tighten antifraud rules and also reauthorize the agency that 
regulates futures markets the commodity futures trading commission 
in earlier testimony the head of another chicago exchange said 
congress should not ban the controversial practice of dual trading 
where brokers trade for themselves and their customers 
critics say dual trading allows brokers to take care of their 
own needs first but banning it outright would be dangerous 
said leo melamed chairman of the chicago mercantile exchanges 
executive committee 
mahlman concurred with that position in a prepared statement 
submitted to the subcommittee mahlman chairman of the worlds 
oldest and largest futures exchange also opposed a ban on dual 
trading saying it will adversely affect the liquidity of futures 
markets particularly agricultural markets by increasing the cost 
of doing business 
the cbots emergency order last week and federal regulators 
reaction to the order was a hot topic during a subcommittee session 
on tuesday 
cftc chairwoman wendy gramm exasperated committee members 
tuesday with her cautious answers to questions about the agencys 
consulting role in the chicago soybean situation 
ms gramm who also said more study was needed before dual 
trading was banned said her agency was reviewing the cbots 
emergency order but neither directly approved or disapproved the 
action 
subcommittee chairman glenn english dokla alluded to his 
frustration with the cftc at the start of the second session when 
he said the congressmen present want to get complete answers 
instead of the ones they got tuesday 
the proposed bill sponsored by english and the subcommittees 
ranking republican e thomas coleman of missouri would allow dual 
trading in only certain circumstances including futures that have 
an average daily trading volume of less than 7000 contracts 
but melamed the chicago mercantile exchange official said dual 
trading was needed to maintain liquidity when there are few 
customer orders he added that pegging dual trading permissibility 
to volume ignores the monthly idiosyncracies of various markets 
such as soybeans cattle oil or gold 
on the other hand robert d josserand president of the 
national cattlemens association advocated complete elimination of 
dual trading to restore public confidence

williams an elf spokesman at the companys us headquarters in 
stamford conn 
the ftc said it was concerned about two chemicals both companies

was fearful the deal would give elf too much control of the market 
for the chemicals 
i think people are getting nervous the deal is going to get 
stopped said jeffrey cianci analyst for bear stearns amp co in 
new york my gut feeling is the deal will get done in some 
modified form 
christopher willis an analyst with brown brothers harriman amp 
co in new york also said he doubts the deal will fall through 
its in their elfs hand right now all they have to do is 
divest a couple of small businesses he said referring to elfs 
production of the two chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride and its 
precursor vinylidene fluoride 
polyvinylidene a plastic resin pennwalt sells under the brand 
name kynar is used to coat electrical wires and to line pipes in 
chemical plants and as a coating in buildings elf makes some 
products similar to kynar 
kynar is one of pennwalts major products but the company would 
not release sales figures it is made at plants in thorofare nj 
and calvert city ky 
pennwalt management accepted the offer from elf acquitaine in 
march the company whose majority owner is the french government 
outbid centaur partners a new york investment group that pennwalt 
had spurned

lastminute changes in the bush 
administrations clean air bill would ease up on requirements to 
reduce motor vehicle pollution and let the government push back 
cleanup deadlines according to an administration summary made 
available thursday 
the changes were made after a june 30 draft became public and 
was widely criticized by environmentalists as not living up to what 
president bush promised on june 12 
the environmental protection agency summary was given to members 
of congress on thursday a day before president bush was to hold a 
white house ceremony to formally present the bill to lawmakers 
members of congress gave the summary to reporters 
after studying the summary the head of an environmental group 
coalition richard ayres said the bill would allow chicanery and 
fraud by industry and permit an epa administrator so inclined to 
wreck the effort to clean the nations dirty air 
epa administrator william reilly however told reporters 
earlier the bill was faithful in every respect to the program 
bush outlined on june 12 to fix the nations air pollution problem 
there are no games he said indismissing the environmentalist 
criticism as inevitable prepositioning on the legislation 
todays draft is far weaker than last months draft which was 
far weaker than the presidents promises said rep henry a 
waxman chairman of the house energy and commerce environment 
subcommittee which will hold the first hearing on bushs bill 
monday 
it undercuts the clean fuel program pushes back compliance 
deadlines and loosens emissions standards the bill actually 
appears to allow emissions from cars and trucks to increase from 
todays levels waxman said 
some of the changes 
new buses in cities of more than 1 million population would be 
required to use special cleanburning fuels starting in 19911994 
the earlier draft required them in all cities of 250000 or larger 
the final bill also would permit the epa to delay the requirement 
for two years 
the epa administrator could postpone for two years a clean fuel 
program for automobiles that would have to be sold in the nations 
most polluted cities in 1995 
the deadline for all cars to meet new emissions standards for 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides was pushed back from 1994 models 
to 1995 models 
tougher emissions standards for light trucks could be phased in 
from 1993 to 1995 instead of being required by 1993 
criminal penalities against automakers for violating the 
antipollution standards were dropped 
in contrast to the environmental groups vocal comments 
industry has lobbied quietly telling the administration and 
repeating to reporters who asked that the legislation has become 
too strict on business 
a group of republicans who appeared with reilly thursday praised 
the bill but kept repeating that the legislation wasnt perfect 
lacking tough cleanup timetables 
the package does not pass all the tests said rep sherwood 
l boehlert rny who added that the bill would have been better 
if bush and reilly had written it alone 
the epa and the office of management and budget reportedly 
fought often during the drafting of the bill according to 
government sources who spoke only on condition they not be named 
the sources said the epa generally took the environmentalists side 
rep robert smith rnh said he would cosponsor the 
legislation but believed it needed tougher provisions for some 
industrial boilers more incentives for utilities to pursue energy 
conservation more specifics on reducing air toxics emissions and 
consideration of tougher provisions to reduce emissions of a 
contributor to smog nitrogen oxide 
the environmentalists criticism has included these points 
sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced less than originally 
indicated in the acid rain section proposed fleetwide averaging 
for auto emissions would fail to reduce motor vehicle pollution as 
promised and that provisions to reduce toxic chemical emissions 
could be undermined by giving too high a priority to industrys 
economic considerations 
reilly said the bill will be faithful in every respect to the 
spirit and letter of the promises he bush made adding there 
was no postannouncement erosion 
he contended environmentalists have been astonished at the 
sweeping breath of the legislation but acknowledged they have 
their reservations as does everyone else some of the groups are 
going to advocate more thats their role eventually the country 
is going to unite behind this
