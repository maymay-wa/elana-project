the airconditioned walkway was the extravagance 
most appreciated by the democratic political leaders and washington 
media elite lingering by the mock newsstand bars at the atlanta 
newspapers welcoming party sunday night 
even the ringling brothers tent isnt air conditioned one 
guest marveled at the cox enterprises inc party on the eve of the 
democratic national convention 
dozens of invitationonly affairs and 56 parties for individual 
state delegations kept thousands of delegates and journalists 
entertained on the hot and humid day 
prospective democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis and 
his family attended ted turners crowded party at cnn center next 
door to the convention site before joining a family reunion hosted 
by his cousin atlanta restaurateur pano karatassos 
massachusetts sen ted kennedy dining at a separate party at 
karatassos 103 west stopped by to greet the families of dukakis 
and his vice presidential choice texas sen lloyd bentsen 
meanwhile jesse jacksons fans jammed the ornate fox theater 
for a fundraising jazz and gospel concert listening to music by 
nat king coles brother freddie an atlanta resident and others 
for three hours before jackson and his family arrived to rally the 
faithful 
frigid air pumped into a tent spanning the short walkway between 
the woodruff arts center and the high museum of art cooled the 
3000 politicians and media honchos attending a special edition 
of southern hospitality hosted by the parent company for the 
atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution 
the media chain founded by 1920 democratic presidential nominee 
james cox apparently spared little expense for its party filling 
the tent and the lobbies of both buildings with bars and tables 
overflowing with homegrown delicacies such as peach cheesecake 
sundays partying completed a weekend of carousing by about 
35000 journalists lobbyists staffers elected officials and 
political junkies who have descended on atlanta for the convention 
which opens monday 
all night saturday hotels were hopping bars were packed and 
lines extended out of dozens of nightclubs and restaurants along 
peachtree street long past the normal closing time of 2 am 
the horsedrawn carriages in the downtown hotel district were 
doing a booming business as hundreds of people wandered streets 
normally occupied in the early morning hours by the nowscarce 
homeless 
an overflow crowd from a heavy metal nightclub spilled onto 
nearby railroad tracks halting a train loaded with revelers but 
neither party missed a beat as the train retreated 
private parties ranged from a formal dinnerdance at the home of 
anne cox chambers former us ambassador to belgium and chairwoman 
of atlanta newspapers inc to an old fashioned stump speakin 
with a real stump mint juleps and ham biscuits given by betty 
talmadge former wife of former sen herman talmadge and liz 
carpenter former press secretary to lady bird johnson 
the biggest affair was a rock n roll extravaganza for about 
10000 journalists at the georgia world congress center featuring 
plenty of free liquor and dozens of dishes ranging from hot dogs 
and egg rolls to brunswick stew and jambalaya 
bandstands scattered throughout the huge exhibition hall 
showcased such acts as jazz artist grover washington 
rhythmandblues duo ashford and simpson and folk rocker stephen 
stills 
in a brief greeting mayor andrew young extended a special 
welcome to the kid reporters for the childrens express whom he 
called the only uncorrupted honest unbiased journalists in 
the hall 
clearly he had missed seeing the express reporter who raided a 
fruit display plopping whole pineapples into a plastic bag 
we might get hungry later the boy said 
atlantas black community hosted a party for more than 250 black 
elected officials from across the country at the whitecolumned 
mansion of atlanta businessman nathaniel goldston 
many of those revelers then joined former atlanta mayor maynard 
jackson on his midnight train to georgia a fundraiser on the 
stateowned new georgia railroad to benefit jacksons 1989 campaign 
for another stint as mayor 
baseball stars hank aaron and willie stargell were among the 
celebrity conductors at a preride party at the historic 
georgia freight depot one of the citys few surviving precivil 
war buildings before the train chugged out of the depot for an 
18mile loop around the city 
during the trip the crowd from metroplex a heavy metal 
nightclub near spilled onto the tracks rather than break up a 
good party the train turned around few at jacksons party noticed 
the difference 
the in event saturday probably was former president jimmy 
carters party for what he called my old friends and i use the 
word carefully in the white house press corps

democratic presidential nomineeinwaiting 
michael dukakis declaring that for the last 17 months ive had 
georgia on my mind arrived with his running mate on sunday after 
dismissing lastminute convention controversies simply as the 
stuff of politics 
his first public appearance in the convention city was at a 
party across the street from the hall where he will become his 
partys presidential nominee 
were going to come out of this convention a unified party an 
inspired party he said 
were going to need your help were going to need jesse he 
added in a pointed reference to jesse jackson who so far has 
withheld an endorsement of dukakis and his designated running mate 
texas sen lloyd bentsen 
dukakis canceled appearances scheduled for monday morning and 
the expectation was he would be meeting with jackson in an effort 
to resolve their differences 
we have come a long long way together said dukakis and 
now were in the final stretch 
when he arrived at the atlanta airport the massachusetts 
governor predicted a good convention and a strong and unified 
party 
were delighted to be here dukakis said as he and bentsen 
and their families flew in on a charter flight from boston via 
washington on presidential airways 
we hope and expect to launch a winning campaign said the 
man who will lead the democrats against george bush in the fall 
bentsen was predicting as much saying that the democrats had more 
unity now than any time in the past 20 years and adding the tide 
is really moving with us 
the dukakis plane stopped in washington just long enough for the 
texas senator and his wife ba to board the plane dukakis has 
chosen bentsen as his running mate and he introduced the 
silverhaired politician as the next president of the united 
states before quickly correcting himself to say vice 
president 
on the eve of the opening of the democratic national convention 
dukakis expressed confidence that jackson will be a member of his 
team but emphasized that it will have only one quarterback the 
presidential nominee 
you cant have two quarterbacks he told a boston news 
conference before leaving for atlanta 
he rejected the idea that he was angered or frustrated by 
jacksons reaction to the selection of bentsen jackson had openly 
sought the vice presidential nomination 
this is the stuff of politics he said 
im on my way to a convention where if everything goes well 
im going to be the democratic presidential nominee thats never 
happened to me before 
im looking forward to the week 
dukakis said he and jackson talked by telephone sunday morning 
but he refused to discuss the conversation or speculate on when 
they would sit down together in atlanta 
we know each other we like each other we respect each 
other dukakis said of his relationship with jackson 
no democratic convention would be a democratic convention 
without a little controversy he said trying to minimize the 
prospects for disruption by the jackson forces 
the massachusetts governor said he still has no idea whether 
jackson will challenge his choice of bentsen 
i would hope it wouldnt be he replied when asked if 
jacksons name would be offered to the convention as an alternative 
to bentsen 
jackson so far has refused to rule out such a possibility 
hes a member of the team dukakis said of jackson and a 
good democrat besides an important member of the team 
but he said every team has to have a quarterback thats the 
nominee 
as for a meeting with jackson in atlanta dukakis would only 
say we meet when we decide to meet 
weve had a remarkably good relationship he said this 
has been as quiet and as happy a democratic race as any i can 
remember 
he said jacksons involvement as an active campaigner would be 
a tremendous asset 
dukakis also completed action on state budget matters including 
using his line item veto to delete 138 million in spending 
the action enabled the governor to head for atlanta with his 
state budget in balance 
in the evening dukakis bentsen and their families celebrated 
their first night in atlanta at a dinner hosted by a cousin of 
dukakis local restaurateur pano karatassos 
karatassos is a second cousin of dukakis said elaine 
lamontagne a spokeswoman for the restaurant 103 west their 
grandmothers were first cousins she said

escalating strife in nicaragua is sending 
familiar ripples through washington where congress appears headed 
for yet another fractious confrontation over us policy in the 
region 
riding a crest of antisandinista sentiment in congress senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan introduced legislation last week 
to provide a new 47 million in aid 20 million of it in weapons 
to the contra rebels fighting the leftist regime in managua 
the rebels have been without new us military aid since 
february and have been making do with the 17 million for food and 
clothing that congress provided in earlier legislation the 
humanitarian aid was designed to enhance peace talks which 
collapsed june 9 the talks have not gotten back on track 
the reagan administrations strategy appears to be to get some 
version of the dole aid bill passed in the more favorable climate 
of the senate as an amendment to a pentagon money bill that could 
happen soon after congress returns july 26 from its break for the 
democratic national convention 
the measure then would go to a housesenate negotiating 
committee where the contra aid amendment would be among the items 
subject to bargaining members of the house negotiating team such 
as reps bill chappell dfla and john murtha dpa look more 
favorably on contra aid than the full house and are seen as likely 
to accept the senate provision 
that would mean house members who have narrowly rejected contra 
military aid in the last several showdowns would be faced with a 
vote on an entire pentagon spending package that includes aid to 
the rebels as a small section of the bill 
democratic strategists concede the aid is far more likely to 
pass in that form since it would be easier to get a yes vote from 
the three dozen or so swing members most of them democrats 
who traditionally hold the balance of power on the issue 
house speaker jim wright dtexas the leading congressional 
critic of the administrations contra policy was seeking to 
arrange a resumption of the peace talks he said while he would not 
oppose an extension of humanitarian aid to the rebels i dont 
think there exists in congress a desire to resume the war 
but chances for the new military aid could be enhanced even 
further if conditions inside nicaragua continue to deteriorate 
last weeks moves by the sandinista government to suppress 
opposition demonstrations and close independent media outlets 
brought virtually unanimous condemnation from congress in the form 
of harshly worded resolutions 
since the resolutions were passed the government has sentenced 
opposition leaders arrested at a rally to six months in jail and 
has confiscated a sugar plantation that was the countrys largest 
private business 
nicaragua also expelled us ambassador richard melton and seven 
colleagues last week 
the outcome of the newest contra aid push will depend largely on 
what the sandinistas do in the weeks ahead said rep tony coelho 
dcalif the partys chief house vote counter 
if managua begins to restore democratic freedoms the 
shrillness the sharpness of the bitterness will have calmed 
down coelho said recently 
the sandinista crackdowns have demonstrated a lack of concern 
about the peace process in the region coelho said if it looks 
like theyre thumbing their noses at the process youre going to 
have people supporting some alternative 
doles bill includes 20 million in military aid for the rebels 
but makes it more palatable to congressional moderates by leaving 
the aid in escrow it would flow only if requested by president 
reagan and only if congress passes another bill authorizing the 
weapons money 
the reagan administration bitterly opposed such a congressional 
trigger in the last aid battle but now believes the mere 
threat of lethal aid may be enough to drive the sandinistas to 
concessions according to one senior administration official 
the official also pointed out that the prospects for new aid may 
be further enhanced because the democratic vice presidential 
candidate sen lloyd bentsen of texas is a consistent supporter 
of contra military aid

in the midst of the nations war on drugs 
a plant in this suburban community quietly imports coca leaves and 
processes them into medicinal cocaine and a nonnarcotic flavor 
extract for cocacola 
workers at the stepan co plant the nations only legal 
importer of cocaine must undergo strict background checks and 
agents from the federal drug enforcement agency frequently visit 
said plant manager john obrien 
dea spokesman milton smilek in newark said there havent been 
any security problems at the plant just west of new york city he 
said it processes hundreds of tons of cocaine each year 
the company imports coca leaf from peru and to a lesser extent 
from bolivia obrien said 
part of what stepan extracts from the coca leaf is sold to 
mallinckrodt inc a st louisbased pharmaceutical company 
mallinckrodt further purifies the extract into pharmaceutical 
grade cocaine hydrochloride used as a local anesthetic by eye ear 
and nose specialists said company spokeswoman roxanna motchan 
mallinckrodt also is subject to stringent dea requirements 
including background checks of employees she said 
carlton curtis a spokesman for cocacola in its atlanta 
headquarters said use of the coca extract in the soft drink is 
common knowledge although the company closely guards its secret 
formula first developed in 1886 
weve been openly talking about that for 102 years curtis 
said 
cocacola whose name is derived from the companys use of the 
coca extract has said that before the refining process was 
modernized around the turn of the century traces of cocaine may 
have made it into some drinks 
mayor john a steuert jr said hes unsure if most of the towns 
9900 residents know the plant processes cocaine 
its the kind of publicity im sure they try to avoid if they 
can he said

bert lance has no official role at the democratic 
convention but jesse jackson will make sure there is a place at 
the table for the burly georgia politician declared persona non 
grata four years ago 
hes one of jesses kitchen cabinet said longtime jackson 
adviser frank watkins watkins said lances public support of 
jackson helped give the democratic presidential runnerup to 
michael dukakis tremendous credibility among democratic 
established officials and southerners in particular 
lance talks as often as four times a day to jackson watkins 
said and his advice is sometimes accepted sometimes not but 
always candid and frank and extremely helpful to the 
candidate 
beyond that lance and jackson have a close personal 
relationship that has been nurtured over the past four years of 
political hills and valleys for both men 
its a brother relationship lance said in an interview 
its not so much a political relationship as it is a real 
friendship were really close in the sense that we can joke 
with each other and be very frank with each other 
the alliance between the unlikely pair one a fiery black 
preacher and civil rights activist the other the epitome of a 
white southern insider helped lance make something of a political 
comeback from troubles that began when he was director of the 
office of management and budget under president carter 
he got rehabilitated politically and theres nothing wrong 
with that said watkins 
lance left the carter administration under a cloud of alleged 
past banking irregularities then was acquitted of those charges by 
a federal jury but he was dogged by a negative image that 
resurfaced at the democratic national convention in 1984 
walter mondale thankful for lances help in the south courted 
him during the convention to head up the democratic party then in 
the face of party protest summarily dumped him all within a matter 
of illtimed days lance ultimately stepped down as chairman of 
both mondales 1984 campaign and of the georgia democratic party 
but today its a different story lance is sought out by those 
looking for an inside track on the candidate who will walk into the 
atlanta convention with some 1200 delegates in his pocket 
in rare appearances on the campaign trail lance invariably was 
buttonholed by reporters eager for his insight 
he gamely sang jacksons praises on tv news programs giving 
early assurances that jackson was not a disruptive force but a 
loyal democrat 
and when jacksons campaign needed a public display of 
establishment acceptability as his campaign was catching fire it 
was largely through lances efforts that a meeting with democratic 
leaders was arranged in washington 
their friendship goes back to 1983 when jackson began his 
presidential bid lance had already proven himself by organizing 
southern state chairmen to go to jacksons home base of chicago and 
campaign for harold washington who became the citys first black 
mayor in a bitter election against jane byrne 
it was lance whom mondale turned to as a liaison to jackson in 
trying to deal with jacksons various complaints about party 
workings 
robert beckel who ran mondales 1984 campaign recalls an early 
negotiating meeting with lance and jackson 
it was a chemistry that worked right away they talk a lot of 
grits and gravy with each other they talk south with a natural 
affinity since jackson is from south carolina beckel said the 
two of them sit there and theyll go face to face and disagree with 
each other ive never seen two guys fight through smiling the way 
those two guys do 
tennessee politician john j hooker said their affinity stems in 
part from rejection at the hands of their own party 
their relationship was born in pain here were two men who had 
walked on the hot coals and felt that they had not been dealt with 
fairly theres no question in my mind that jesse jackson is a 
hero of bert lance and bert lance is a hero of jesse jackson 
said hooker

iran has asked the european airbus 
consortium for help in its search for flight recorders from an 
iranian jetliner that was shot down by an american warship 
the official islamic republic news agency said sunday that 
irans civil aviation organization made the request 
robert alizart a spokesman for the airbus industrie consortium 
in the french city of toulouse said the company received a telex 
wednesday from iran asking where to buy or rent equipment to help 
find the flight recorders 
the a300 was shot down by the us missile cruiser vincennes on 
july 3 and iran said all 290 aboard were killed us military 
authorities said the plane was mistaken for an attacking f14 jet 
fighter 
the pentagon said information gathered by the cruiser showed the 
plane was descending in altitude on an attack profile but iran 
said the plane was climbing 
discovery of the planes two flight recorders in the waters of 
the strait of hormuz could help determine the truth each of the 
black boxes containing the recorders has a radio beacon that can 
transmit for 12 to 30 days after a crash 
alizart says airbus doesnt manufacture the beacons so the 
company is tracking down an agency of the britishbased beacon 
manufacturing company that could provide iran air with the 
equipment it needs to detect the black boxes 
the iranian news agency monitored in cyprus said iranian 
frogmen have searched for the recorders since the plane was shot 
down 
so far 179 bodies have been recovered the agency reported

president saddam hussein said sunday that a 
string of iraqi victories on the battlefield should persuade iran 
to accept an honorable peace and end the war between the 
persian gulf nations 
iraq later said its forces withdrew from an iranian border area 
after ridding it of enemy troops and bombed industrial targets in 
southern iran 
irans rulers have to accept the peace road they have to 
abandon their unjust dreams and foolish mottos and slogans their 
hollow illusions after their defeats the iraqi leader declared 
in a speech broadcast on baghdad radio 
husseins speech came on the 20th anniversary of his seizure of 
power 
he proposed that iran and iraq sign a peace accord exchange 
prisoners return to their respective borders and vow not to 
interfere in each others internal affairs 
hussein first listed his peace plan in an open letter to the 
iranian leadership in august 1986 
a military communique issued shortly afterward said iraqi forces 
withdrew from the iranian town of dehloran which they seized 
tuesday 
the iraqis advanced 30 miles into iran to capture dehloran after 
chasing iranian forces out of the zubaidat region on their side of 
the border military communiques said at the time that iraq did not 
wish to hold onto iranian territory and would withdraw from 
dehloran after clearing the border area of enemy troops and 
destroying their bases 
the iraqi news agency reported that iraqi warplanes bombed fuel 
storage tanks near the southern iranian city of ahvaz scoring 
destructive hits 
there was no immediate iranian comment on the iraqi reports 
iraqs victories in zubaidat and dehloran were the latest in a 
series of iraqi triumphs this year that chased iranian troops out 
of almost all the iraqi territory they had seized since 1982 
the iraqis began recapturing their lost territories in april 
they said they seized about 133 strategic heights in the northern 
region of the 730mile long front 
simultaneously they launched assaults in the south recapturing 
the southern faw peninsula in april and the shalamcheh and majnoon 
islands in may and june 
 
hussein said these victories could lead to a peace settlement 
and urged iran to accept the un security council call for a 
ceasefire in the 8yearold war iraq accepts the july 1987 
resolution but iran maintains the conflict cannot end until iraq 
is branded the aggressor in the war 
iraq stands now on victorious ground confident today and 
in the future iraqis and the noble arabs now stand on victorious 
peaks while the rulers of iran are in the trench of defeat and 
shame hussein said 
iraq extends the hand of honorable peace and calls on the 
iranian rulers to draw lessons from their defeats he said 
hussein stressed sunday that any settlement should guarantee 
iraqs navigation rights along the shatt alarab waterway which 
forms the southernmost border with iran as well as through the 
strait of hormuz the narrow entrance to the persian gulf 
iraqs only access to the gulf along the shatt alarab has been 
blocked by iran since the outbreak of fighting

every time policeman miguel rosario 
drives down san ysidro boulevard near the mexican border he 
remembers how it felt to be pinned down by a fusillade of bullets 
from an deranged mans submachine gun 
and he wishes hed been the officer who fired the shot that 
ended james oliver hubertys 77minute rampage in a mcdonalds 
restaurant four years ago monday huberty killed 21 people and 
injured 19 before being slain 
the restaurant was razed after the july 18 1984 massacre the 
nations worst oneday mass murder by a single gunman and a 
southwestern college building is taking shape on the lot 
every time i go by i look at the spot and the area where i 
laid for about an hour said rosario who was the first officer 
on the scene 
the 10year san diego police department veteran said in a recent 
interview that the first call was for an assault with a deadly 
weapon he expected to find a victim of a domestic argument 
he parked his car and began walking toward the postal building 
where the victim had been reported 
i looked over and i see people hiding behind cars crouched 
behind cars he said and i got this funny feeling in my 
stomach that something was really wrong deadly wrong 
at that time an older guy pointed to mcdonalds and i was 
standing right dead in the middle of the parking lot 
he spotted a man with an uzi 9mm submachine gun in the doorway 
we made eye contact and he brought it up in an aiming position 
and i looked for cover rosario said there was this truck 
right to my right there a big truck thank god because i got 
right behind it and it saved me 
he was shooting over me and trying to get the rounds through 
the truck at one point he tried to skip the rounds off the 
ground 
inside the restaurant huberty 41 ordered the four dozen 
patrons to lie on the floor armed with a small arsenal of weapons 
and more than 400 rounds of ammunition the unemployed security 
guard systematically shot his victims pausing occasionally to sip 
a soft drink 
the massacre ended when police sniper chuck foster fired one 
shot through hubertys chest 
i wouldve loved to be the one said rosario and i did 
have him in my sights for about 10 seconds but by the time i did 
what i had to do he had moved 
soon afterward mcdonalds corp had the restaurant razed and 
donated the threequarteracre lot a mile from the mexican border 
to the city with the stipulation that no restaurant be built there 
for three years the land was occupied only by a makeshift 
shrine to the victims some argued a park should be built as a 
permanent memorial on the site about 20 miles south of downtown 
san diego 
it finally was sold for about 136000 to southwestern college 
a community college with about 14000 students school officials 
expect a onestory classroom and administration building to be 
completed in time for the fall semester 
the agreement calls for the school to dedicate a 300squarefoot 
area in front of the building for a permanent memorial to the 
victims the colleges students were invited to submit designs for 
the memorial and a committee is selecting one from about 30 
entries said school spokesman fred carvell 
councilman bob filner whose district includes the community of 
about 17000 people said selling the land to the college seemed 
appropriate 
i think because we did something positive the anniversary is 
less of a negative thing now than it would have been he said 
people now see something positive going to happen there

controversy follows attorney general edwin 
meese iii everywhere he goes even out the door 
the latest installment involves the leaking of unfavorable 
information about two former justice department officials who have 
been invited to testify before a senate panel about their former 
boss 
committee sources and sources close to the justice department 
say the leaks were an attempt to discourage the two men from 
testifying 
meeses resignation by itself may have convinced one of the men 
former deputy attorney general arnold i burns to resist the 
committees invitation to testify about meese burns reportedly 
believes meeses stewardship is now ancient history 
but former criminal division chief william f weld who along 
with burns suddenly announced his resignation march 29 is still 
expected to appear july 26 before the senate judiciary committee 
burns and weld left march 29 when meese was under intense 
scrutiny from independent counsel james mckay who was 
investigating meeses conduct on a number of ethics matters 
the democraticcontrolled judiciary committee invited both men 
to tell why they left but neither would consider the request 
before mckay completed his work 
mckay submitted his stillsecret findings on july 5 and on the 
same day meese announced that he would resign in late july or 
early august the committee then committee asked burns and weld to 
testify on july 26 mckays report was expected to made public on 
monday 
robert j duke short a committee aide to sen strom thurmond 
rsc said he was asked by the committees democratic staffers 
after meeses resignation announcement to check whether burns and 
weld were coming 
according to short burns told him the meese story is now 
ancient history but if im subpoenaed of course i would 
testify a subpoena is highly unlikely and as of now burns is 
not expected to come 
weld described his conversation with short in a startling letter 
to the committee 
weld said that short asked me whether there was an internal 
justice department investigation of me in 1986 or 1987 based on an 
anonymous letter alleging that i had smoked marijuana at a wedding 
in 1982 and if so whether that might not complicate the 
testimony 
weld pointed out an internal justice department investigation 
found the allegation lacked merit and in subsequent interviews 
emphatically denied the marijuana incident 
short said he received a call about the marijuana allegation and 
asked weld about it 
asked if he was attempting to hint to weld that he avoid 
testifying short said in an interview absolutely not not under 
any circumstance 
furthermore short said he made the calls to weld and burns at 
the request of the democratic committee staff because both men are 
republicans and short knew them personally 
mark gitenstein chief counsel for the committees democratic 
majority supported short i dont believe duke tried to 
discourage weld from testifying he said i dont believe that 
was his intention 
but last week the washington times carried a news story about 
the marijuana allegation and had previously published several 
stories about burns efforts to get his former law partner a 
federal judgeship 
a justice department spokesman patrick korten said he had no 
idea who is responsible for making any of that information 
available 
as to the conflictofinterest allegations stephen markman the 
assistant attorney general in charge of screening judicial 
candidates said burns was above board in his efforts on behalf of 
his former partner stuart summit now a nominee for the 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals 
obviously his name came to our attention because of his 
relationship to mr burns markman said mr burns probably 
bent over backwards to make sure he wasnt viewed as pushing the 
candidate to the exclusion of other candidates 
mr summit went through the normal procedures the regular 
interview process the regular background process and final 
approval by the attorney general the attorney general was aware 
that summit was a partner of arnie burns burns relationship with 
summit was quite open

orthodox jews are scouring israels 
mediterranean beaches for a rare snail that produces a blue dye 
they say is needed to revive a religious ritual abandoned 1500 
years ago 
the snail hunt was prompted last week by rabbi menachem burstin 
of jerusalem who is trying to recreate a process once used to dye 
a single thread of the jewish prayer shawl in accordance with a 
biblical command 
jews were forced to abandon the practice in the fifth century 
burstin said when roman authorities banned all but the ruling 
class from wearing colored clothing the recipe for the dye they 
used was lost 
now we are looking for it said burstin of the prestigious 
mercaz harav religious seminary we want to revive the mitzva 
biblical command 
israels chief rabbis who rule on religious issues have not 
given the goahead to renew the ancient practice and are awaiting 
burstins findings before they consider it said zalman quittner a 
spokesman for the rabbis 
interest in the mollusk mystery was roused when burstin appealed 
in a religious newspaper erev shabat for seminary students to 
seek out the rare snail known as the janthina or violet snail 
because of its purpleblue color 
burstin said he has been deluged with reports of snail 
sightings but he has so far collected only a tenth of the 
bucketful he says is needed to extract enough dye to test his 
theory 
the 33yearold rabbi is trying to validate a claim made in 1920 
by the late chief rabbi yitzhak isaac halevy herzog father of 
president chaim herzog 
in a doctoral thesis at the university of london the elder 
herzog suggested the original dye used came from the janthina 
snail but he noted the the snail seldom made it to israeli shores 
this summer however the snails have been sighted along with 
schools of jellyfish that have been plaguing beaches burstin said 
hank mienis curator of the hebrew university of jerusalem 
mollusk collection said there are five species of the janthina 
the largest are 1 inches in diameter he said 
the ancient jewish practice involved coloring one of eight 
strands of a prayer shawl as a sign of devotion to god 
the white prayer shawls have been worn under clothing by devout 
jewish men since the ancient israelites roamed the desert with 
moses during their exodus from egypt it is customary to kiss one 
of the fringes during portions of morning prayers 
the old testament says that god ordered mosesspeak to the 
children of israel and tell them to make for themselves fringes on 
the corners of their garments throughout their generations and to 
put on the fringe of each corner a blue thread 
you shall have it as a fringe so that when you look upon it 
you will remember to do all the commands of the lord and you will 
not follow the desires of your heart and your eyes which lead you 
astray 
the talmud which interprets jewish law explained how the blue 
fringe should be dyed but did not give the source of the dye 
jewish sages have speculated about the recipe but only began 
trying to revive the custom about 100 years ago in poland burstin 
said 
he said a hasidic rabbi gershon hanoch leiner of radzin 
maintained the dye came from a squid about 17000 followers of 
leiner used the method he said and many died at the hands of the 
nazis during world war ii 
herzog differed with leiners followers by suggesting the 
janthina snail and not the squid was the true source of the dye 
i am checking herzogs method to the end said burstin who 
has been studying the issue for 14 years we cannot push this 
mitzva forward until we solve this

about 150 hispanic democrats founded a political 
group of their own sunday in an effort to galvanize the clout of 
the nations fastestgrowing minority 
were here to demonstrate to the democratic party that we are 
a community once and for all united rep esteban torres of 
california a cochairman of the group told the sunday morning 
gathering were coming together here for the first time and it 
will not be the last 
the group called national hispanic democrats is made up of 
mexicanamericans puerto ricanamericans and cubanamericans 
about 200 of the 4200 delegates to this weeks democratic 
national convention are hispanic 
hispanics have drawn acute attention from both parties this year 
because their growing vote is concentrated in key states like 
california texas and florida both democratic presidential 
candidatetobe michael dukakis and his republican counterpart 
george bush have already pledged to appoint a hispanic cabinet 
member if elected 
the group said it hopes to capitalize on that interest 
what we have here is the most serious effort in recent times 
to focus the hispanic agenda torres said our challenge is not 
the differences sometimes created by national origin or regional 
bias but the similarities which over shadow our differences 
in the past organizers said differences among the different 
segments of the hispanic population have kept its clout fragmented 
the new group has agreed to disagree on some issues but agrees on 
the need for improvements in education jobs health care and crime 
fighting as well as mobilizing the hispanic vote in november 
the time is right for this to work said cochair marife 
hernandez a democratic party activist from new york were going 
to make sure that were heard

on the eve of the democratic national convention 
with 4162 delegates watching to see what hes made of michael 
dukakis is still struggling with jesse jackson for control of a 
primetime spotlight that ought to be his without question 
through weeks of preconvention jockeying dukakis has never 
been able to get jackson to quit gnawing at his ankle if it isnt 
one thing the vice presidency a platform plank a mediator 
partnership its another 
its supposed to be his convention someone mentioned to 
jackson on sunday 
thats an illusion he responded this is a convention of 
the people its the delegates convention they will determine who 
the nominee will be 
the nominee will be dukakis because dukakis beat jackson every 
tuesday for months on end now the dukakis people want the payoff 
televised unity that will provide a campaign boost in the fight 
against republican george bush 
this is the stuff of politics dukakis said sunday in 
minimizing the prospects for convention chaos no democratic 
convention would be a democratic convention without a little 
controversy 
but jackson has been running for president for five years 
drawing large and adoring crowds that dukakis can only dream of 
and he is hard put to give up the limelight he seems reluctant to 
even share it 
the week could go two ways 
at this late date the best dukakis can do and its pretty 
good is a convention that looks like this 
monday dukakis makes a neighborhood antidrug appearance 
pressing one of his key issues against bush lloyd bentsen does 
some quiet missionary work and wins private assurances from key 
jackson supporters a summit is arranged dukakis and jackson 
emerging with broad grins and little to say garrison keillor sings 
the national anthem and millions of tv viewers wonder if this isnt 
going to be a democratic year 
tuesday dukakis does a zillion interviews by satellite with 
local tv anchors they want to know about jackson and he tells them 
democrats are united on the key economic issues ok so theres a 
floor fight on the platform the dukakis people oppose three 
jackson planks no tax hike and no freeze on military spending and 
no palestinian state and they relish and win a showdown the 
story of the day is jacksons speech and what a speech hands that 
pick cotton will pick a president the crowd is going crazy how 
else to describe it and bentsen is somewhere fidgeting a little 
when the hysteria ends with a dramatic encore jackson returns to 
the podium and endorses the dukakisbentsen ticket 
wednesday it is nomination day and delegates pack the hall 
after dukakis and bentsen attend an emotional ceremony at the 
martin luther king center the roll call is a loose bantering 
competition between dukakis people and jackson stalwarts ohio or 
pennsylvania two key states with 48 electoral votes between them 
compete to put dukakis over the top dukakis makes a surprise 
appearance with jackson at his side and nomination night becomes 
unity night too 
thursday the bentsen roll call is anticlimatic after all the 
delicious speculation of a jackson challenge bentsen follows his 
victory with a speech that lays out the case against bush i beat 
him once and i cant wait to beat him again bentsen says he tells 
that wonderful jim wright joke i like george bush because were 
both texans im from fort worth and hes from fort 
kennebunkport dukakis takes to the podium and looks taller than 
he is his is a vision of the future upbeat he is the son of 
immigrants proud of the path he has traveled insistent america 
can have change for the better for the first time in months he 
does not not deliver the standard lines about good jobs at good 
wages and the need for a real war not a phony war on drugs 
thats the message but delivered in new more dramatic rhetoric 
then a fanfare to michael dukakis music by john williams 
orchestra led by kittys dad harry ellis dickson of the boston 
pops 
that assumes jackson will stop biting dukakis ankle dukakis 
worst nightmare a jackson convention looks like this 
sunday on the eve of the democratic national convention 
michael dukakis is acting more like rodney dangerfield than john 
kennedy his arrival is overshadowed by jackson appearances in 
which he tells supporters they deserve respect not just an 
apology paul brountas delivers an apology his 16th 
monday dukakis antidrug appearance is overshadowed by a 
jackson foray into one of atlantas toughest neighborhoods where 
he leads a spontaneous rally which sweeps dealers and degenerates 
off the street to cheers of down with dope up with hope 
tuesday jacksons speech sends his 1100 delegates and most of 
dukakis into a frenzy he pushes every democratic button with a 
revivalist style that simply takes over the convention dukakis 
people stand with jackson supporters and wave a common banner 
dukakisjackson 88 
wednesday nomination day dukakis wins jackson veep fever 
running high 
thursday bentsen is nominated but so is jackson he couldnt 
stop the draftjackson movement if he tried but things have gone 
far enough jackson takes to the podium endorses bentsen and 
calls for acclamation he has controlled the convention from the 
beginning to now dukakis speaks viewers wonder if jackson can 
control dukakis convention will he control his campaign his 
presidency

on the eve of its ninth anniversary 
the leftist sandinista government confronts unprecedented 
discontent brought on by civil war a shattered economy and 
unfulfilled promises 
the sandinistas have put the brakes on recent moves to restore 
basic freedoms and have cracked down on opponents with a vengeance 
the measures came just days before july 19 anniversary ceremonies 
being held in the city of juigalpa 85 miles east of the capital 
the government began easing restrictions on civil liberties to 
comply with a regional peace plan signed in august by the 
presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala honduras and costa 
rica 
the plan aimed at ending the war here and guerrilla wars in el 
salvador and guatemala called on signatory nations to grant 
amnesties negotiate ceasefires and undertake democratic reforms 
to comply the sandinistas in january lifted a 6yearold state 
of emergency discontent started surfacing immediately 
opposition news media that had been shuttered or censored under 
the emergency law reappeared and harshly attacked the government 
antisandinista marches which had been prohibited began 
with their more liberal policies the sandinistas achieved their 
main goal congress voted down a request by president reagan to 
renew military aid to the contra rebels fighting the nicaraguan 
government 
but last week the sandinistas lashed out indicating they had 
had enough and wouldnt take any more 
president daniel ortega and his cabinet also came under pressure 
from party hardliners opposed to the concessions which included 
the previously taboo step of opening negotiations with the contras 
in a series of quick moves the government expelled us 
ambassador richard melton and seven other american diplomats july 
11 a day after police beat up opponents at an antigovernment 
demonstration 
it jailed three dozen opposition figures closed the roman 
catholic churchs radio catolica and a private news program and 
ordered la prensa the only opposition newspaper to suspend 
publication for 15 days 
the sandinistas said the crackdown was a response to a 
destabilization plan fostered by the us embassy and increasing 
rebel attacks but they offered little proof to back up their 
accusations 
barricada the newspaper of the sandinista national liberation 
front published a list saturday of dates on which melton and the 
other us diplomats met with opposition groups the headline read 
subversive itinerary of melton and the cia the state 
department called the visits normal 
the sandinistas have become increasingly frustrated by their 
inability to end the contra war which is wrecking the economy and 
fueling public discontent 
in a move that took washington off guard sandinista and rebel 
leaders signed a ceasefire agreement march 23 but since then they 
have made almost no headway in discussions to achieve a permanent 
truce 
the initial ceasefire extended for 30day periods by tacit 
agreement on both sides has been wearing thinner and thinner in 
recent weeks with the government recently reporting almost daily 
rebel attacks 
opposition leaders said the crackdown was motivated by the 
governments fear that the usually fragmented opposition was 
unifying some claimed the crackdown showed the true face of the 
sandinistas 
the mask came off and the people didnt see smiling faces 
they saw gas masks said virgilio godoy a former sandinista 
labor minister and now president of the independent liberal party 
referring to the opposition protest july 10 which police broke up 
with tear gas 
when the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that 
ousted the rightist proamerican dictatorship of anastasio somoza 
they promised a better life to a povertystricken people they 
enjoyed widespread support 
we knew they were marxists but we thought they were different 
marxists who would deal realistically with the situation here 
godoy said many people felt deceived 
in 1981 the united states cut off all economic aid to 
nicaragua claiming the sandinistas were exporting revolution to 
the rest of central america and serving as a communist beachhead in 
the region a usimposed trade embargo followed in 1985 
the measures together with us support for the contras and 
sandinista government mismanagement and corruption almost scuttled 
the economy about half of nicaraguas budget now goes to the fight 
against the contras 
the economic situation the hunger the misery has gathered 
momentum by all citizens and we were tapping it said another 
opposition leader enrique bolanos head of the superior private 
enterprise council 
meanwhile supermarket shelves stand bare the nation that once 
exported rice and cotton has now turned to foreign donations for 
basic food staples children rummage through trash piles seeking 
scraps of food and the average worker doesnt earn enough to feed 
his family

jesse jackson said sunday his minority platform 
planks are majority positions that deserve to be debated and 
decided by the full convention 
the democratic platform committee released the jackson 
campaigns minority report on 13 disputed issues sunday but said 
compromises still were possible to avert floor fights tuesday 
resolution of the lingering platform disputes must await a 
settlement of the larger differences between jackson and the 
certain nominee michael dukakis 
even then jackson made clear sunday that he wants the democrats 
to debate his bedrock issues especially his call for higher taxes 
on the wealthy and corporations and a pentagon freeze 
the fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberated 
upon and decided by the convention jackson said on cbstvs 
face the nation 
our minority planks are majority positions for example most 
americans do not want any more taxes on the middle class and poor 
people but corporations and the wealthy must pay their share 
jackson said 
the dukakis campaign has said repeatedly it will not accept 
jacksons call for higher taxes a fiveyear freeze on pentagon 
spending a policy of nofirstuse of nuclear weapons and support 
of selfdetermination for the palestinians 
the minority report carries the disclaimer these minority 
positions are under discussion by the parties for possible 
agreements on language that may lead to their inclusion in the 
platform 
michigan gov james j blanchard chairman of the platform 
committee said saturday night its really in the hands of the 
campaigns now 
blanchard predicted in an interview that if jackson does press 
floor fights on all 13 issues he might win one or two 
some jackson minority planks cover less thorny domestic issues 
that lend themselves more readily to compromise these included 
jacksons call for full funding of head start prenatal care and 
the women infants and children program doubling the education 
budget and creation of a national health program 
ron brown jacksons convention manager told reporters the 
platform negotiations suspended tuesday are not moving forward 
until we have resolved the broader issues of the relationship 
between jesse jackson and michael dukakis more importantly the 
relationship between democratic party and its crucial progressive 
wing to pursue detailed discussions on the platform just dont 
make sense said brown 
ann lewis a senior jackson adviser predicted that if the two 
candidates come to terms compromise language can be found for more 
than half the disputed planks 
at a dinner for the platform committee hosted by rep bill 
richardson of new mexico on saturday night both jackson and 
dukakis delegates seemed pleased with their handiwork 
janice thurmond a jackson delegate from athens ga said 
jacksons going to have to send a cue as to what he would like 
his representatives and delegates to do about the platform and 
that hasnt come down yet 
richardson a cochair of the platform committee said i 
think there may be a skirmish on the defense and the revenue issue 
but once that chemistry returns between dukakis and jackson then i 
think everything will work out 
the platform writers were in a selfcongratulatory mood 
well platform people we did it didnt we didnt we do a 
good job its probably the only platform in the history of america 
that just says good morning america we love ya said rep 
louise slaughter of fairport ny were right on the edge of 
something absolutely wonderful 
william schneider an american enterprise institute analyst 
told the democrats both the choice of sen lloyd bentsen and 
the platform that youve written have a message to reagan 
democrats those are democrats who are not liberals there are tens 
of millions of them 
the message is come home there is no ideological test 
were not going to ask you complicated questions we want your 
votes your confidence the only thing that we require is that you 
want to change the direction of this country said schneider 
the majority platform report hammered out last month in 
mackinac island mich and denver runs fewer than 4500 words a 
tenth the size of the turgid 1984 platform and the democrats 
shortest election blueprint since the 1930s 
without mentioning ronald reagan or george bush it commits the 
party to reverse seven years of voodoo economics trickle 
down politics fiscal irresponsibility and economic violence 
against poor and working people it calls for more stable 
defense budgets

rehabilitation specialists say that because 
of the drought they are seeing more cases of young people diving 
into shallow water striking bottom and becoming paralyzed with 
spinal injuries 
these are usually young people who dive in a particular spot 
for years with no problem but they hit bottom this year said 
dr dennis maiman chief of the spinal cord injury center at the 
veterans administration hospital in milwaukee 
maiman said colleagues in california illinois and minnesota 
have noted similar increases in diving accidents 
its amazing how farreaching the affects of the drought 
are maiman said 
dave kunelius a department of natural resources spokesman said 
low water levels are creating new ripples and currents that are 
disguising river bottoms and obstacles 
dr donald kelman a marshfield clinic neurosurgeon said diving 
accidents often paralyze more severely than auto accidents the 
leading cause of such injuries 
that is because they often injure vertebrae in the neck causing 
quadriplegia or lack of movement or sensation from the neck down 
rather than just the lower body 
dan eckert a rehabilitation counselor at university hospital in 
madison who uses a wheelchair because of injuries suffered in a 
lake diving accident at age 14 said there were three 15yearolds 
in rehabilitation there who suffered permanent injuries from diving 
into shallow water 
im hearing a lot of conversations from patients who say they 
dove in a particular area 10000 times and never had a problem but 
this spring they were hitting bottom eckert said 
most people who hurt their spine in a diving accident suffer 
permanent injuries 
eckert said the victims have ranged from 15 to 31 years old 
people in that age group are more willing to take risks he 
said

a spill of more than 600000 
gallons of crude oil in the harbor has killed a small number crabs 
birds and other wildlife officials said 
the effect of the spill on the wildlife isnt that great 
because it happened in the harbor said coast guard lt tom 
blinkinsop theres not that many species of wildlife there 
a tanker carrying crude oil from scotland rammed a refinery dock 
wednesday opening a gash that allowed 15350 barrels of oil or 
644700 gallons to gush into the ship channel the spill closed 
the port for 56 hours 
volunteers sounded a propane cannon and air horns saturday to 
scare birds away from the oily marsh near the dock 
ive found quite a few blue crabs fiddler crabs and one 
hermit crab dead in the marshy area larry gamble environmental 
contaminant specialist for the us fish and wildlife service said 
saturday 
in addition he said at least two birds and an opossum died as a 
result of the spill 
there have probably been more than two birds killed because 
when birds are injured theyre vulnerable to prey and so they hide 
and we might not have found them yet gamble said 
in the long term there will be a reduction in food sources 
such as plankton needed by such organisms as shrimp and crabs 
he said 
chip volz district manager for the texas water commission said 
no dead fish have been spotted fish were not affected because a 
southeasterly wind carried the oil immediately to the north shore 
of the harbor he said 
the fish had other places they could go in the harbor he 
said fish have a kind of avoidance factor in their movement

11pounder at the same time 
marge walker and angie crawford of aberdeen were fishing in 
separate boats on lake oahe earlier this month when the doubletake 
occurred it took about a minute before they realized they were 
trying to reel in the same fish 
it was just the weirdest thing crawford said we were 
both pulling on it because the thing had both her hook and my hook 
i really thought i had something big it could have knocked us both 
out of the boat then someone from my boat told me that it looked 
like we both had the same fish 
the boats each carrying four people were a few hundred feet 
from each other walker said we pulled up along side their boat 
and everyone was just amazed that it had both spinners in its 
mouth she said 
the women had never met before the incident we all just sat 
there and laughed and laughed and laughed said walker 
he must have been hungry added crawford who kept the prize 
fish and later filleted it

the 350 map lists the states population as 2000000 and 
falling and has a nonprimitive areas designation but doesnt 
list any 
the state bird is the california gull the state tree is the 
colorado blue spruce and according to the map narm bangerter 
is the state dinosaur 
utah is one of those places with a big kick me sign on its 
back said dale everyone in utah takes themselves so 
seriously and everything out here is so sacrosanct we decided to 
pick on those things 
the brothers renamed the great salt lake the mediocre salt lake 
we were laughing about all these people coming from all over 
the world to see the great salt lake and it has to be one of the 
dirtiest smelliest places around don said calling it great

generations and to bring snow for this winter and to keep peace 
with god and unite the people said cliff doebel a florist who 
brought crow dog to clyde in june 
about an hour and a half after the ceremony a line of 
thunderstorms passing through northern ohio produced rain in clyde

crow dog performed a rain dance june 19 and the village 
received a quarterinch of rain later in the week just as he 
predicted 
doebel said the visitor from south dakota made no predictions 
about when the rain would come as a result of his rain prayer 
i had a lot of people seek me out and thank me for bringing 
him in doebel said the people that are here tonight are 
holding on to hope that some good will come from this and the rains

this man is head and shoulders above any contemporary leader 
in south africa tutu said any sensible government would 
realize that nelson mandela is absolutely essential for peace and 
stability in southern africa 
mandela turns 70 on monday he was jailed in 1962 for leaving 
south africa illegally and inciting unrest while serving a 
fiveyear sentence he was given a life term in 1964 for sabotage 
and plotting the overthrow of the government 
south africas whiteled government banned all major birthday 
celebrations for mandela whose anc guerrilla movement is outlawed 
there 
organizers arranged a lastminute concert sunday at the 
university of cape town but police stopped it about two hours 
after it began the audience of 500 left peacefully 
dozens of foreign governments called for mandelas release in 
recent days 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told mandela it distresses 
one to realize that you mark the birthday in a prison dungeon into 
which you were thrown by the racists more than a quarter of a 
century ago 
soviet people firmly demand your release comrade mandela and 
the release of all political prisoners in the republic of south 
africa gorbachev said in a telegram sunday which was published 
by the official tass news agency i give you a strong handshake 
in italy thousands jammed piazzas for a saturday night concert 
in bologna and another one sunday in rome dutch and swedish 
antiapartheid movements scheduled events for monday 
in central london traffic was snarled as the demonstrators 
headed by 25 activists who had marched 500 miles from glasgow 
scotland poured into hyde park under rainy skies 
the organizers britains antiapartheid movement estimated the 
crowd at 250000 people but police put the figure at only 30000 
scotland yard reported three arrests on minor offenses 
the mostly young white crowd swayed as a south african band 
belted out african nationalist themes from the podium which was 
ringed with red and black tribal warrior shields 
they roared with approval as the face of winnie mandela the 
jailed leaders wife flashed on a giant video screen in a message 
taped in south africa she said her husbands birthday relates to 
a symbol of resistance in this country 
we are very moved very touched by this gesture she said 
expressing thanks to the entire international community for 
applying pressure for her husbands release 
security forces some in armored vehicles patrolled south 
africas major black townships sunday although there were no 
reports of violence police also set up several roadblocks 
including one outside cape towns pollsmoor prison where mandela is

particularly british prime minister margaret thatcher for refusing 
to impose tough economic sanctions against south africa 
mandela has refused an offer of release by the south african 
government on the condition he renounces violence saying that the 
real prepetrators of violence are south african authorities 
south african diplomat justus de goede the secondranking 
official at the london embassy said in a radio interview the anc 
was committed to the violent overthrow of the government and noted 
that bomb and grenade attacks by anc guerrillas were increasing 
i think it is asking a great deal of any government to 
knowingly release the leader of an organization which has this 
political manifesto into society without some sort of guarantee 
de goede said 
the anc is the main guerrilla group fighting south africas 
government and its system of apartheid under which the countrys 
26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and 
districts 
in addition to gorbachev west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher malaysian prime minister mahahir mohamad 
and danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen all called sunday

this is what atlanta has become 
suspicious 
before jesse jackson arrived at the marriott marquis hotel 
grown men in dark suits pushed ball point pens into the soil of 
hundreds of planters hanging off the balconies on each of 46 
floors this unusual method of aerating the soil was a check for 
explosives 
helpful 
the iowa delegation in a superbly crafted handbook advises 
conventioneers to wear light clothing good advice in 90 plus 
temperatures and to wear comfortable shoes for considerable 
walking on unforgiving concrete floors the best advice of all 
however is find the rest rooms this will save time 
hospitable 
a sign at the tattletale a strip joint reads welcome 
delegates but not all one delegate to the democratic national 
convention is 18 years old too young for such educational 
enterprises besides kristin farr of redmond wash possibly 
prefers other entertainments 
a collectors paradise 
one of the most active subcultures at the convention is the 
button collector he prowls the hard concrete of the georgia world 
congress center where the news media do their work in 
bluecurtained enclaves sniffing out new sources the way a pig 
goes for truffles you got any buttons has replaced whens 
jesse coming as a topic at the new york times more than a day 
before the first sound of the gavel at the convention a 
handlettered sign frostily declared no more buttons 
a protest site 
a promarijuana group of hippies clad in tiedyed garments is 
staging the alternative convention 88 just three blocks from 
the omni saturday was human rights day for the alternatives 
sunday was animal rights day and monday will be particularly busy 
as no nukes native american rights and environmental day complete 
with music from the plutonium players 
on saturday urine testing was a major point of contention for 
the alternative platform and marijuana was touted as both a safe 
drug and in a hemp form as a cheap source of paper products 
some 75 groupies heard philosopher and former drug guru timothy 
leary say that at the democratic convention aint going to be no 
one thinking for themselves that did not keep him from showing 
up at a convention party perhaps to check out the thinking 
a walk down memory lane 
the world congress center home for 3500 news people is so big 
that the fire department insisted on partitioning it with street 
names there is john f kennedy boulevard lyndon b johnson 
avenue harry s truman road and latimore lane latimore a party 
staff member got in there it is said because they ran out of 
democratic presidential names nonwinning nominees like george b 
mcclellan horatio seymour horace greeley and alton s parker 
apparently never were considered 
demopolitically aware 
gorins ice cream put its analysis of the political situation 
into its product creating dukakis delight a mixture of 
strawberry and chocolate those being the favorites of the 
massachusetts governor and his wife 
cynics suggested the dukakis treat would typically be bland and 
boring there was no sign of jesse jackson rainbow sherbet 
almost but not quite ready 
it was ever thus but come opening day monday for better or 
worse the 40th democratic national convention the first in the 
south since 1972 will open in a splash of rose skyblue and pink 
visitors are told those podium colors truly are patriotic that 
they will be the traditional red white and blue to the folks 
watching on tv the delegate seats however are covered with the 
real red white and blue 
the omni usually home to the atlanta hawks may well be the 
smallest hall for a democratic political convention in modern 
times the scoreboard high overhead betrays its heritage with ads 
for winston cigarettes cocacola the hometown product and 
delta air lines which also makes its home here

police charged a black man with murdering 
a black woman that investigators thought was possibly racially 
motivated because the letters kkk were carved on her leg 
detective mike turck said sunday that any racial motive in the 
death of anna kithcart 19 had been ruled out and that a drug link 
was suspected 
police arrested jeffrey allen dawson 29 late saturday he 
appeared before a city court judge sunday but his arraignment was 
postponed until monday after he asked for an attorney no bond was 
set and he remained in jail 
there is evidence of drug use and abuse throughout this 
case turck said both persons have been known to use drugs in 
the past 
police said dawson and the victim were acquaintances they were 
both seen at a tavern last monday night and miss kithcarts body 
was found the next day a few blocks away the carving of klan 
initials on her leg was revealed by police last thursday 
also charged in the case was joseph kiernan 41 who police 
described as a transient and former psychiatric patient kiernan 
who is white was charged with sexually abusing the victims corpse 
and was jailed pending a psychological examination 
kiernan told a radio station in an interview last week that he 
thought miss kithcarts body was a lifesized pornographic doll 
and that he called police when he saw a head wound 
police chief james riggens said investigators suspect the 
letters may have been carved on the victim after she was killed 
police obtained a handwriting sample from kiernan and were 
awaiting test results to determine whether his handwriting matches 
the writing style of the person who scratched kkk on kithcarts 
body assistant district attorney john prizzia said 
miss kithcarts father told the kingston daily freeman earlier 
in the week that his daughter had fallen victim to drugs im 
almost positive it was a drug rub eugene kithcart said 
preliminary autopsy results indicated miss kithcart was 
strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument police 
said 
kingston is located about 25 miles north of wappingers falls on 
the opposite shore of hudson river last november 16yearold 
tawana brawley of wappingers falls was found with the letters 
kkk and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoallike substance 
on her skin after being missing for four days 
she later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of 
white men but she and her family have refused to cooperate with a 
state investigation

police determined to avoid blood in the 
streets canceled a march and rally by white supremacists sunday 
after helmeted officers used riot shields to shove aside hundreds 
of antiracist demonstrators 
the leader of the white supremacist group the nationalist 
movement later was taken into protective custody by police 
there was frequent shoving between police and 
counterdemonstrators but no reports of violence or injuries outside 
the georgia state capitol where the opposing groups gathered the 
spot is a halfmile from the omni where the democratic national 
convention opens monday 
the entire capitol was roped off as antiracist contingents were 
confined to either end of washington avenue separated by police in 
riot gear as temperatures rose above 90 the protesters 
representing a variety of groups chanted such slogans as no kkk 
no fascist usa 
an american flag and a confederate flag were burned in the 
street as hundreds of reporters looked on barechested shaggy 
youths danced wildly and chanted as others beat drums and played 
flutes 
police with helmets and riot shields pushed the crowd back at 
one point firecrackers popped and mounted police moved in then 
left the area 
this was a hostile angry nasty crowd and thats why we 
canceled the march said public safety commissioner george napper 
it was a tough call because this is america he said but he 
said he was determined to avoid blood in the streets of atlanta 
after the cancellation about 250 counterdemonstrators marched 
from the capitol to the official protest zone near the convention 
center chanting we just took the klans march 
gov joe frank harris said he did not think the cancellation 
amounted to a failure of security 
i think that shows the system worked he said were here 
to provide security for the people and also to protect them and to 
see that everybody has a good time and nobody gets hurt 
convention security spokeswoman jackie barrett said richard 
barrett chief organizer of the nationalist movement march and no 
relation was taken into protective custody when he entered the 
protest zone 
about 30 of his backers carrying confederate battle flags tried 
to march to the protest zone despite the cancellation the 
antiracist protesters surrounded them but police separated the two 
groups again before there was any violence the white supremacist 
marchers were then taken back to their cars by police bus and 
there were no arrests police said 
if our lord jesus can ride into jerusalem on the back of a 
donkey richard barrett can drive down marietta street in his 
chevrolet pickup truck protested barrett before he was taken 
into custody 
this is a shameful act on the part of the city said gene 
guerrero executive director of the american civil liberties union 
of georgia regarding the cancellation the aclu has gone to court 
several times on behalf of white supremacists free speech rights 
the presence of 200 counterdemonstrators is no reason to 
cancel the united states constitution he said thats the same 
argument they used to cancel civil rights demonstrations in the 
1960s 
they white supremacists wanted to have a rally on this very 
spot said andre powell of baltimore a member of the all 
peoples congress one of the antiracist groups and look whos 
here we feel its very important that when the klan comes out 
they must always know that people wont idly sit by 
barrett said in a telephone interview that he was held at the 
fulton county jail for four hours in what he called police 
oppression 
freedom isnt free and sometimes youve got to pay the 
price said barrett who said his pickup truck was vandalized 
while he was in jail i paid mine today but like douglas 
macarthur i shall return 
barrett said he planned to hold a news conference monday morning 
in the forsyth county seat of cumming site of a huge civil rights 
protest in january 1987 to discuss the incidents sunday 
sunday marked the first day of scheduled protests in the 
twoacre parking lot across the street from the convention where 
city authorities are providing a stage and sound equipment for 
groups to demonstrate at twohour intervals 
about 20 people not including reporters showed up in 
broiling heat as the coalition to support cuban detainees began the 
protests the mad housers a homeless relief group based in 
atlanta built a small red white and blue hut as an example of the 
structures they put up for homeless people in the city 
about 120 people carrying signs and chanting slogans marched 
from atlantafulton county stadium to the protest zone to 
demonstrate against ethiopian control of the eritrean region of 
north africa 
in other demonstrations 
legal a gay rights group pressed for more efforts to cure 
aids and for an end to discrimination against homosexuals sen 
alan cranston dcalif a sponsor of major aids funding 
legislation told a crowd of about 2000 people we must not be 
overly cautious in battling this killer and urged more 
experimentation with different possible cures for aids 
ray hill of houston tex a gay rights activist for 26 years 
said the democratic party is not as sensitive to the brothers and 
sisters who have died of aids as you and i have become 
many demonstrators wore pink triangles similar to those adolph 
hitler forced homosexuals to wear in nazi germany 
radio personality casey kasem was among the speakers for 
compassion campaign 88 an animal rights group the organization 
is promoting legislation to outlaw steeljawed leg traps use of 
veal cages that hold calves immobile to keep their flesh

michael dukakis vowing to launch a winning 
campaign for the white house arrived in atlanta on sunday to 
claim the democratic nomination for president he said he wanted to 
meet with rival jesse jackson in a bid to assure conventionweek 
unity 
were working hard to make sure we have a good convention a 
strong and united party the massachusetts governor said after he 
and ticketmate lloyd bentsen touched down in their chartered 
presidential airways jet 
jackson spent his day moving triumphantly around town holding 
the conventioncity spotlight even if he was far short of the 
delegates needed to dislodge dukakis hold on the nomination 
this is not a coronation he said this is a convention 
the runnerup in the primary season said it was too much to 
expect a party gathering without debate that is in the highest 
and best traditions of the democratic party he told cbs 
although he predicted there would be unity by the end of the week 
bentsen said he thought the democrats were showing more unity 
than in any time in the past 20 years adding the tide is really 
moving with us 
dukakis and jackson talked by phone during the day and the 
massachusetts governor said well probably be talking a little 
later this evening by phone he added im sure were going to 
be meeting during the course of the convention 
advisers to the two men met for more than an hour in a downtown 
hotel jackson press secretary delmarie cobb said she expected a 
monday morning meeting 
the dukakis camp also worked to create the impression of a 
campaign looking toward the fall election senior aide jack 
corrigan announced that 35 state field directors met during the 
day he said jackson advisers would be among those yet to be named 
dukakis during farewell remarks from boston seemed to 
stiffen in the face of jacksons continuing demands 
you cant have two quarterbacks he said in a blunt 
assessment of jacksons call for shared responsibility he 
added every team has to have a quarterback thats the nominee 
he added no democratic convention would be a democratic 
convention without a little controversy 
as for jackson dukakis told a statehouse news conference in 
boston we know each other we like each other we respect each 
other 
ohio democrats passed the word that sen john glenn would 
introduce bentsen to the convention on thursday a gesture of unity 
by a man passed over when dukakis picked his running mate 
bentsens nomination was assured but jackson and his aides held 
out the possibility of a challenge just the same 
some of jacksons backers cautioned against pressing too hard 
there is a danger in taking your followers to the brink said 
birmingham ala mayor richard arrington a jackson delegate 
countered rep tommy robinson of arkansas dukakis doesnt 
know how to communicate with southern blacks all the blacks he 
talks to are harvard grads he needs to sit down with jesse 
bentsen professed optimism that a convention collision with 
jackson could be avoided i think the process is under way and 
were certainly reaching out to rev jackson he said 
thousands of delegates flooded into heatdrenched atlanta in 
plenty of time to sample the tourist attractions and restaurants 
before settling down to the business of anointing dukakis as their 
man to lead the fall campaign against republican george bush 
jim smith from new jersey may have spoken for many when he said 
ive checked in and im headed for the bar 
at the georgia state capitol police equipped with riot shields 
intervened to prevent violence between white supremacists and 
counterdemonstrators authorities revoked a permit held by the 
supremacists because they said they couldnt guarantee their safety 
it was a tough call because this is america said public 
safety commissioner george napper after taking supremacist leader 
richard barrett into protective custody he said he was determined 
to prevent blood in the streets of atlanta barrett called it 
police oppression 
advocates for cuban detainees and a homeless relief group called 
the mad housers demonstrated outside the hall in a parking lot 
set aside by city authorities for protests 
the latest polling information was good for the democrats a 
survey by the chicago tribune indicated that the dukakisbentsen 
ticket led bush in california new york and illinois accounting 
for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the white house 
the survey showed the democrats running even or slightly ahead in 
bentsens home state and behind in florida 
this is a week weve been looking forward to for a long long 
time dukakis said at a lowkey airport welcome in atlanta we 
hope and expect to launch a winning campaign 
just before leaving boston dukakis told reporters im 
looking forward to the week he said im on my way to a 
convention where if everything goes well im going to be the 
democratic presidential nominee thats never happened to me 
before 
the omni hall was ready to receive the assemblage a basketball 
arena transformed into a madefortelevision facility when we 
made the selection of the omni we loooked at this hall as a 
television studio said party chairman paul kirk 
a parade of convention speakers took turns practicing their 
remarks party in a rehearsal room beneath the podium keynote 
speaker ann richards said she was there to decide which color 
jacket would look best on television 
party elders made the rounds of the morning talk shows 
predicting the convention would end in unity 
former president jimmy carter said jackson would inflict 
political damage on himself it he demanded selfish things for 
himself that are divisive in naturehes not going to make that 
kind of mistake carter spoke on abcs this week with david 
brinkley 
in my judgment jesse jackson will deliver one of the great 
unity speeches ever delivered at a democratic convention agreed 
robert strauss a former party chairman 
former new mexico gov toney anaya who has represented jackson 
in the peacemaking talks said he is optimistic the differences 
can be worked out before the opening gavel falls on monday 
the man republicans will name to run against dukakis vice 
president george bush was fishing in wyoming with treasury 
secretary jim baker hell be back campaigning on wednesday the 
day democrats make it official and bestow their nomination on 
dukakis 
in his morning talk show appearance jackson said he was sure 
the democrats would wind up with a unified convention eventually 
at this point there is no defined place for the progressive 
wing in the campaign he said our minority planks are majority 
positions he said 
its too much to expect that we not debate and deliberate 
and arrive at decisions and arrive at a mandate to govern that is 
in the highest and best traditions of the democratic party he 
said

began a visit to israel that was expected to create friction over 
the crackdown on palestinian demonstrators a soldier shot and 
killed a palestinian who allegedly tried to grab his rifle 
also sunday foreign minister shimon peres appeared to break new 
ground by saying he was willing to negotiate separately with 
palestinian representatives previously peres and other leaders 
have called for talks with a joint jordanianpalestinian delegation 
lubbers was the most senior foreign leader to visit the jewish 
state since the palestinian uprising began dec 8 
the dutch leader hinted from the outset he would be critical of 
israels handling of the uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip in which 223 palestinians and four israelis have been 
killed 
to disagree is a privilege of friends lubbers said during a 
welcoming ceremony near prime minister yitzhak shamirs office 
we are with you even if we speak up we speak up because we are 
with you 
later at a state dinner given by shamir lubbers said of the 
israeli response to the uprising the harsh measures that have 
been taken in attempting to normalize the situation have left 
disturbing images in the minds of many of israels friends 
he also called on israel to participate in an international 
middle east peace conference that would be under united nations 
auspices and to withdraw from the occupied lands in exchange for 
peace claiming peace but denying land will be in our view 
incompatible he said 
shamir opposes an international peace conference that would 
include the soviet union and the four other permanent members of 
the un security council saying concessions would be demanded 
that would jeopardize the jewish state shamir head of the 
rightwing likud bloc also has said israel would not withdraw from 
the occupied territories 
shamir acknowledged he disagreed with the dutch leader on some 
middle east issues but said he hoped the netherlands would defend 
israel against the campaign of vilification that is being waged 
against us on that continent 
earlier sunday lubbers met with shamir for about 30 minutes and 
they agreed to postpone working discussions until monday israeli 
officials said

tikva fatally shot a palestinian after the man jumped him from 
behind grabbed his throat and tried to steal his rifle police

intersection to hitch a ride to his base when he was assaulted

planned to kidnap the soldier it said another palestinian was 
arrested in connection with the attack

in the west bank village of qabatiyeh wounding an 18yearold arab 
in the leg officials at nearby al ittihad hospital in nablus said 
the army said it was checking the report

5000 apiece to form the keep hope alive pac staffers began 
distributing enrollment forms and envelopes for contributions and 
he said 100000 already had been raised a week ago 
we get our mandate from fannie lou hamer from dr martin 
luther king he said in a preemptive defense of the formation 
of the pac ms hamer led and won a credentials battle at the 1968 
convention to seat members of the mississippi democratic freedom 
party instead of the regular state delegation 
he said the pacs goal would be to get more blacks and other 
minorities to run for office 
only by running are you going to open up this process he 
told the crowd of about 500 at the atlanta life insurance building 
who had come to pay tribute to the drum majors of the dream 
eight individuals including jackson the rev ralph abernathy 
myrlie evers coretta scott king georgia rep john lewis the rev 
joseph lowery atlanta mayor andrew young and rosa parks were 
honored for their roles in the civil rights movement of the 60s 
with former rival sen albert gore jr at the podium jackson 
spoke pointedly about the tensions and negotiations going on 
between his campaign staff and those of the allbutcertain 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
we are at a moment of deliberation development and 
challenge he said we are just an attitude away from the white 
house 
in a reference to dukakis he said the issues facing the 
democratic party were bigger than any one person 
the issue is having a seat in the budget next january we can 
cut the defense budget without cutting our defense he said 
he acknowledged that the right wing of the party had been 
accommodated in dukakis selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen as 
his running mate but said you need two wings to fly 
we can afford to lose a vote on the floor but not our 
integrity he added 
jackson also warned that the pac would hold accountable those 
democratic officeholders coming to the convention as super 
delegates from areas where he won a significant percentage of the 
vote in the primaries and caucuses 
we must visit those senators and governors whose states we won 
but are not voting for us and find out what their plans are for the 
future for private and public life

more than 400 members of the rittenhouse 
clan some from as far away as west germany and england gathered 
to share family gossip and history over the weekend at the 
tricentennial celebration of wilhelm rittenhausens arrival in 
america 
people hovered over genealogical charts running their fingers 
down the litany of names searching for descendents of rittenhausen 
cousins greatgreatuncles or halfremembered names first heard 
in childhood stories 
paul monroe rittenhouse of state college manned the genealogical 
tables helping distant relatives fill in the blanks in their 
record books noting marriages births deaths 
were here to fill in the voids of the familys history he 
said 
although family members began tracing their ancestors more than 
100 years ago paul rittenhouse recently found a missing link 
in 19thcentury documents from lancaster county those documents 
added more than 3000 families to the rittenhouse lists bringing 
the total in this country to 50000 descendents of rittenhausen 
charlotte rittinghausen of mannheim west germany came to 
visit friends at the celebration which ended sunday she said her 
father is interested in the family history but she wasnt until 
the american celebration 
ms rittinghausen said she is continually learning of family 
members in her country now she has more names to add to her 
christmas card list 
we are spreading all over she said 
rittenhausen settled in germantown the countrys first 
permanent german settlement in 1688 he built a papermill in 1690 
on the monoshone creek in philadelphia and became the american 
colonys first papermaker 
his name itself a derivation of rittinghausen was changed 
erroneously by american clerks according to rittenhausen decendant 
milton rubincam of west hyattsville md rubincam called the name 
change a peculiarity of colonial times when american 
immigrants were confronted by strange languages and names 
it doesnt matter what your name is its fun for everybody to 
trace their roots said one of two donald rittenhouses at the

some insurance companies say that testing 
more applicants for exposure to aids has benefited the industry by 
helping identify other applicant health problems such as cocaine 
use and diabetes 
life and health insurers are using the opportunity offered by 
increased aids testing to perform more general screenings on the 
blood and urine of applicants when abnormal readings turn up 
insurers sometimes deny applications for coverage or charge higher 
premiums industry officials said 
aids is the best thing that ever happened to the 
lifeinsurance industry said david richman a vice president at 
associated benefits inc in plainville its the best thing as 
far as underwriting insurance companies can now underwrite with 
much more information 
until recent years a consumer could buy several hundred 
thousand dollars of life insurance by answering medical questions 
on an application without submitting to blood or urine tests but 
with growing concern about acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
companies began requiring aids antibody tests of applicants for 
amounts of life insurance above certain threshholds commonly 
100000 worth of insurance 
insurers also often require aids tests of people applying for 
individual health policies travelers for instance requires the 
tests for most of its individual health policies 
companies will not insure people with positive aids antibody 
test results because of the increased likelihood they will develop 
the syndrome and they will not insure cocaine users 
when insurers require blood to be drawn for an aids tests they 
generally have a laboratory screen it for other problems and also 
order a urine test a typical blood and urine screening costs the 
insurer 50 to 75 per person said george kelly an associate 
counsel at hartford insurance group 
the lab checks blood for sugar levels fats and protein and 
looks for signs of cardiovascular disease liver and kidney 
disorders companies also are checking urine for nicotine to 
verify whether people who say they are nonsmokers are telling the 
truth and for problems associated with heavy drinking 
prudential said it is rejecting about 3 percent of applications 
for individual life insurance compared with 2 percent two years 
ago but testa was not sure how much of the increase is due to 
increased blood testing 
aetna would not say how often it denies applications because of 
positive aids tests and said it did not track denials for other 
medical causes 
travelers said testing is revealing more conditions that warrant 
higher rates or rejection of an applicant but spokesman scott 
bushnell said that when an insurer knows it is discovering more of 
its customers problems through tests its rates will reflect fewer 
cost for unknown risks 
if we can better classify peoples mortality risk actuaries 
can sharpen their pencils in terms of pricing kelly said the 
better we can underwrite the more narrowly we can price and 
everyones better off
