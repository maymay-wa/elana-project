silent windless surges from hurricane gabrielle 
far out in the atlantic whipped up huge waves this weekend sweeping 
beachgoers out to sea and capsizing boats from maine to new york 
at least six people were reported missing and three people 
apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the sea 
swells undertow and waves that have reached 15 feet in height even 
on rivers 
though hundreds of miles from land the spinning arms of 
gabrielle were still sending waves banging against the seaboard 
late sunday gabrielles winds had weakened to 65 mph and it was 
downgraded to a tropical storm gabrielle was located 350 miles 
southsouthwest of sable island nova scotia the national hurricane 
center in florida said 
people shouldnt be out there said jarred randall a 
narragansett ri police sergeant who rescued two teenagers from 
the water saturday night its just so majestic and inviting but 
it isnt safe 
gabrielle has been churning out in the atlantic since aug 31 
its vastness and power has prompted comparisons with last years 
hurricane gilbert which became the storm of century and 
devastated jamaica 
the occasional rogue wave can come along higher than the 
others its kind of neat to look at the surf and people dont 
realize there is personal danger when youre looking at 15foot 
waves said coast guard quartermaster 1st class david jersey in 
boston 
jeff waldstreicher a meteorologist at the national weather 
service office in boston said that the waves and undertow were 
fierce up and down the coast 
you have these strong 100plus mile an hour winds that 
generate all these waves and long after the waves have crested you 
have all this energy moving the water from east to west 
waldstreicher said 
in the meantime the wild water was causing havoc 
dorothy daggett 19 of cushing maine apparently slipped and 
fell into the surf while walking saturday night along the rocky 
shore in the midcoastal fishing village of tenants harbor with her 
brother and cousin said quartermaster 1st class robert ream in 
southwest harbor maine 
the two men went into the water after her and were also quickly 
swept away from the shore they were picked up by a fishing boat 
the coast guard searched for ms daggett but she was still 
missing sunday 
a coast guard helicopter rescued two surfers who got in trouble 
off the coast of new hampshire on sunday at the time the chopper 
was on its way to salisbury beach in massachusetts to search for a 
middleaged swimmer reported missing by a lobsterman who said he saw 
the man disappear into the water jersey said no one was found 
jersey said 
and north of boston an ipswich police patrol boat searched for a 
25yearold man who vanished in the rough waters of the ipswich 
river north of cape ann 
richard troudt was with two other men and a baby sailing in an 
18foot motor boat saturday when the vessel capsized the coast 
guard said the other two men and the child were rescued by a 
passing vessel 
in new york divers searched the atlantic for a 37yearold man 
missing after a houseboat capsized two miles out from the breezy 
point section of the new york city borough of queens 
a 58yearold woman apparently drowned when the houseboat 
capsized about 2 am sunday her body was recovered 
two fishermen in their 30s were swept off a new york city jetty 
saturday afternoon by a large wave searchers could not find the men 
in new jersey a man in his mid50s died after being pulled 
unconscious from heavy surf sunday morning at barnegat light said 
long beach township patrolman joseph paolino a woman of about the 
same age who was pulled out with him was revived and was under 
intensive care at a hospital 
a man drowned at normandy beach but no other details were 
available dover township police said 
at 1030 pm edt gabrielle was located near latitude 390 
north longitude 620 west or about 350 miles southsouthwest of 
sable island nova scotia 
gabrielle is the seventh named storm of the atlantic hurricane 
season systems become named tropical storms when their winds hit 39 
mph and are termed hurricanes at 74 mph

the energy department wants to curtail 
development of a nuclear reactor to power weapons for a spacebased 
missile shield or for manned bases on the moon according to a 
published report 
the new york times in its monday editions quoted federal 
officials as saying that the department wants to stop spending on 
the reactor because of rising budget pressure and opposition from 
private groups and congress 
the energy department now provides most of the funding for the 
42ton reactor known as the sp100 which is meant to generate 100 
kilowatts of electricity and to fit in the space shuttle the 
newspaper said 
one pentagon official told the times the proposed cut would leave 
the reactor program severely crippled 
but other officials who were not identified by the newspaper said 
the proposed cut could be a ploy to get other federal agencies to 
increase their financial support 
this fiscal year which ends sept 30 the energy department is 
paying 56 million to support the reactors development while the 
space agency is paying 10 million and the pentagon another 10 
million 
the sp100 program began in 1983 a government audit last year 
found the program seriously flawed and in danger of failing 
on the moon the reactor could be used to power a manned base 
through the lunar night in space it could be used to power 
antimissile arms in orbit around the earth 
it has drawn criticism from congress for its potential military 
uses 
rep george e brown jr dcalif recently introduced 
legislation calling for an international ban on putting reactors in 
orbit and for limiting their use to deep space missions

to some parents choice means deciding not 
only which school their child will attend but also at what age to 
start them 
take tracy hill 
by the time daughter jessica was ready to turn 6 mrs hill had 
twice tinkered with jessicas birth date to meet enrollment cutoff 
dates and the entire family was confused about when to hold her 
birthday party mrs hill knows she broke the law and asked that her 
real name not be used 
we celebrated jessicas third and fourth birthdays on sept 
8 mrs hill said with a chuckle jessicas real birthday is oct 
8 
her mother explained that she had wanted her daughter when she 
was 2 to attend a private bilingual preschool with her playmates 
but the program required that children be 3 years old by sept 15 to 
be admitted 
this year mrs hill faced another problem 
she wanted to enroll jessica in a neighborhood public school 
kindergarten but the district of columbia school system says any 
child who turns 6 by dec 31 must be placed in first grade the 
preceeding september or be labeled as a slow learner 
when i saw what the firstgraders were doing i didnt want to 
see a girl who has always loved school be put in a negative 
environment where she would be forced into reading math and other 
competitive academic work before she was ready her mother said 
so mrs hill restored jessicas real birth date and entered her 
in the kindergarten of a private 6000ayear school 
schools are more concerned about statistics exclaimed willa 
hennigan another frustrated mother who tried to enroll her son in a 
public prekindergarten program in the district when he was 5 but 
was told he must enter kindergarten or the schools computer would 
list him as an atrisk child 
i think each parent ought to determine whats best for her 
child said mrs hennigan who teaches a fifthgrade class for 
gifted and talented students in suburban virginia 
at least where public schools are concerned the age at which a 
child begins his education is becoming as controversial as 
parental choice a centerpiece of president bushs education 
initiatives that would let parents decide which public school their 
child would attend 
some educators are convinced that youngsters will be more 
successful in school if they are 5 starting kindergarten others 
scoff at the notion of arbitrary age limits and favor flexible 
curricula for various maturity levels 
we agree there is a problem in that young children are not 
succeeding in kindergarten and first grade as they should but the 
problem is with the curriculum and the strategy in the way children 
are asked to learn what is inappropriate with their age group 
said barbara willer of the national association for the education of 
young children 
susan dranitzke an educational consultant who advises parents on 
their childrens school readiness said kindergarten is more like 
first grade used to be at this point the way public kindergartens 
are its probably better to have them older 
to be eligible for public school kindergartens 23 states now 
require children to be 5 years old by sept 2 ten years ago most 
states allowed youngsters to begin kindergarten if their fifth 
birthday would fall as late as november december or january 
complicating the situation for parents in five states are laws 
requiring that their children attend kindergarten those states are 
arkansas delaware rhode island south carolina and west virginia 
the district of columbia and the adjacent maryland counties of 
prince georges and montgomery have held to the dec 31 kindergarten 
eligibility date in virginia the cutoff has been moved to sept 
30 but children with later birthdays can be tested to determine if 
they are emotionally physically and intellectually ready for 
kindergarten 
david elkind professor of child study at tufts university in 
medford mass and the author of the hurried child said 
raising the entry age of children is merely a policy solution to a 
people problem and policy solutions to people problems never work 
the need is for flexible programs in kindergarten and first grades 
raising the age is not going to do anything except raise the 
curriculum he explained we need to recognize what children are 
like at that stage and then match the curriculum to the child 
indianas new school entry age law kicks in this year with a 
september cutoff date that moves up to june 1 by the 199293 school 
year 
we are not letting our kids grow up we are pushing them and i 
dont know why said rep esther wilson a thirdgrade teacher and 
state legislator who wrote and pushed through indianas law after 
nearly six years of work 
with this bill i predict the dropout rate is going to be down 
because the majority of our boys and girls will be socially and 
emotionally ready for school said wilson 
tom schultz project director for early childhood education at 
the national associaton of state boards of education said raising 
the entry age results in a problem of equity in terms of what the 
experiences will be during that extra year out of school 
by merely raising the entry age schultz said a group of kids 
who would have gone to kindergarten will sit in a preschool at home 
or at day care another year parents vary in their ability to pay 
for and provide stimulus 
we need to help teachers find ways to deal with student 
diversity he said 
one solution schultz said would be to allow children to enter 
school the month they become 5 the problem with that he added is 
that it would be difficult for teachers to adjust to new kids 
continually arriving 
another idea is cooperative learning which places a child in 
a group of youngsters with abilities similar to his own assignments 
are given to the groups so that youngsters can teach each other as 
they work together 
susan sweitzer of the gesell institute a private educational 
organization in new haven conn said 1518 percent of more than 
16000 school districts around the nation use gesells procedures to 
assess young childrens readiness to learn 
when these procedures are properly used she said school systems 
can determine which approach is suited to the needs of a particular 
child either the traditional lockstep grade system or 
alternative programs that insert a transitional year for children to 
mature before or after first grade 
i used to feel pretty strongly that the cutoff date should be 
sept 1 or aug 31 but i have really grown to an opinion of 
encouraging districts to create options from which parents can 
choose so it doesnt really matter when the cutoff date is ms 
sweitzer said 
regardless of when a child is enrolled in kindergarten all 
states require that by a certain age children must be in first 
grade in no state however is that required date set so early 
that parents do not have the freedom to delay their youngsters 
entry into kindergarten said ms weller of the national association 
for the education of young children

former house speaker jim wright is 
backing pete geren but a tv doctor is counting on heavyweight 
endorsements of his own to put a republican congressman in the seat 
wright occupied 34 years 
with little campaign time and few policy differences to 
distinguish themselves democrat geren and political newcomer dr 
bob lanier are touting endorsements and their backgrounds to sway 
voters in tuesdays runoff election 
just getting the vote out is a challenge only a fifth of the 
districts voters went to the polls in aug 12s special election to 
fill wrights unexpired term 
wright resigned june 30 after a house ethics investigation turned 
up 69 instances of alleged rules violations 
still he was greeted as a vanquished hero upon his return to 
fort worth and remains popular in the district 
geren 37 has started using radio spots by wright and has 
brought the former congressman with him on campaign appearances 
geren a former aide to sen lloyd bentsen also has that texas 
democrats endorsement 
jim wright is proud of his years of service to this community 
but he recognizes that his seat is going to someone new and hes 
been very careful not to interject himself in any way that would 
suggest that hes trying to control things geren said 
lanier host of the nationally syndicated television show 60 
second housecall is relieved wright hasnt done more for geren 
we initially feared it quite a bit we thought it would make a 
major difference said lanier a pediatric allergist but it 
hasnt been quite as much as we anticipated 
the 44yearold lanier has some of his own big guns endorsements 
from president bush and former dallas cowboys coach tom landry 
the candidates have similar stands on major issues 
both oppose abortion but would not make it illegal want better 
health care funding for the elderly and support strong measures 
against illegal drugs 
lanier has tried to make residency an issue claiming geren 
doesnt live in the district he accuses the lawyer who comes from 
a wealthy family of being out of touch with voters 
geren counters that lanier hasnt voted in recent elections and 
lacks experience in public office 
lanier garnered 39 percent of the vote and geren 32 percent in 
the special election that trimmed the field from eight candidates 
lanier said he is swimming upstream as the republican 
candidate but believes fort worth might be ready for change since 
1980 voters here have helped elect ronald reagan bush and gop sen 
phil gramm texas is represented by nine republicans and 20 
democrats in congress 
democrats are hoping for a voter backlash against the republicans 
for what happened to wright 
the fort worth startelegram recently endorsed geren as have 
state educators senior citizens and labor officials 
the local police association has endorsed lanier 
the election is one of two being held tuesday to choose 
successors to congressmen who resigned amid ethics problems in 
california voters will decide among eight candidates for the seat 
of former democratic house whip tony coelho who resigned in 
midjune as questions were raised about his financial dealings

the people who run the miss america 
pageant are faced with a dilemma proving miss america has brains 
and maintaining a television audience 
the pageant has to continue to be an entertainment vehicle 
said director leonard horn if it turned into a twohour 
documentary nobody would tune in 
the 69yearold pageant which airs nationally on nbctv 
saturday will still capture loyal audiences with dazzling evening 
gowns the 10 finalists talent performances and the everpopular 
albeit evercontroversial swimsuit competition 
but since he took over the pageant last year horn has aimed to 
show off the intelligence of the beauty queens last year he showed 
clips of contestants interviews with the judges and the 10 
finalists were asked thoughtprovoking questions on live television 
this year horn has gone one step further each of the 51 
contestants has submitted an essay outlining what issues she might 
want to take a stand on during her year as miss america 1990 the 
winner will have the opportunity to use her reign as a soap box to 
promote her cause he said 
many of the essays deal with the environment health issues 
child abuse poverty all the issues we read about every day 
horn said i was impressed with their seriousness and concern 
the judging process also has been revised to give more credit to 
the contestants interviews with a preliminary panel of judges 
interviews will count for 30 percent of the final nights 
competition talent will weigh 40 percent and evening gown and 
swimsuit each will count for 15 percent swimsuits have never 
counted for so little 
less emphasis on body and more on brains represents a far cry 
from the bathing beauty pageant started by atlantic city 
businessmen it was originally held the weekend after labor day as a 
public relations gimmick to prolong the summer season 
were trying to close the gap between what some people perceive 
this program to be and the reality we know it is horn said 
he said that the ambitions of many contestants speak for 
themselves 
for instance five contestants aspire to be attorneys others 
want to be a doctor a medical researcher and a pharmacist more 
than a dozen see their future on stage 
miss america 1989 gretchen elizabeth carlson is a stanford 
university student who plays classical violin and hopes to attend 
law school 
this years celebrity judges include developer donald trump 
entertainer merv griffin tv psychologist joyce brothers actresses 
phylicia rashad and debbie allen baseball great mike schmidt and

highrolling developers betting on a housing 
construction boom in the las vegas valley have been stopped in their 
tracks by the designation of a turtle as an endangered species 
the federal listing of the desert tortoise nevadas official 
state reptile prohibits disruption of the animals habitat that 
has already blocked offroad races and threatens cattle grazing on 
some federal land and some military activity 
the potential impact on las vegas could be horrendous said 
paul selzer a palm springs calif lawyer hired by local officials 
to draw up and sell the federal government on a plan to save the 
tortoises while allowing development its now a crime to move the 
tortoises from your building site and its a crime to hurt them in 
any way 
selzer set up a refuge for an endangered lizard in the coachella 
valley near palm springs that has become a model for settling 
conflicts over endangered species 
the aug 4 listing by the us fish and wildlife service was 
brought about by biologists concerns that a respiratory disease is 
killing off thousands of the burrowing tortoises which live up to 
80 years the emergency designation means all the protections of the 
endangered species act immediately went into effect for eight 
months pending further decisions 
it affects desert areas in nevada california and utah 
but only in las vegas where a recent study estimated that 
73000 new residences will be needed in the next four years just to 
house new workers for the casino industry is the impact so severe 
and so immediate an estimated 3000 people move into the area every 
month 
if you have ungraded land that has tortoises on it it 
basically stops you dead said jim ley a clark county 
administrator there wont be any impact for six to nine months 
because of the projects already under construction but after that 
youll see a definite lull 
most casino construction will be unaffected because it is done 
mostly on previously developed or already graded property but 
outlying housing projects shopping centers golf courses and other 
developments will be put on hold 
affected most is summa corp empire of the late howard hughes 
which is developing 25000 acres west of town into a community to 
house 250000 people 
summa already has spent 60 million putting in a freeway 
interchange a fourlane highway and utilities and had planned to 
offer housing tracts to developers later this year 
but only about 350 acres have been graded and the rest of the 
tract will be in limbo pending resolution of the tortoise problem 
i really dont have any reason to be optimistic about it 
because of the bureaucratic process involved said summa president 
john goolsby 
summa joined several other homebuilders the city of las vegas 
and clark county in filing suit last month in federal court in 
washington claiming there is little evidence of the tortoise 
respiratory disease in southern nevada and that the regulation 
should be confined to areas affected by the ailment 
a federal judge refused to act his decision will be appealed but 
local officials and developers say they are resigned to the 
endangered species designation 
theyre fighting the method of the listing so they can win some 
time on this thing ley said 
developers are not the only ones affected 
the huge nellis air force base bombing range and the nevada test 
site where nuclear weapons are tested are also inside the 
designated area although federal law allows exemptions in cases of 
national security some operations could be affected 
two weekend offroad races in the mojave desert in california 
were canceled by the bureau of land management and ranchers face 
revocation of grazing rights on bureau land that is tortoise habitat 
city and county officials have drawn up ordinances to charge 
developers a 250anacre tortoise fee that will bring in up to 
1 million a year to preserve tortoise habitat 
but selzer said even if the fish and wildlife service buys that 
plan it will be at least a year before any new development on 
tortoise land is allowed 
weve got to do an environmental impact report and weve got to 
get cooperation from everybody he said all of that takes 
time

voters on saturday handed gov gaston 
caperton an overwhelming defeat on three constitutional amendments 
he said were necessary to complete his reorganization of state 
government 
with 99 percent of the vote counted only one of the amendments 
garnered as much as 19 percent support 
one of the amendments would have eliminated three statewide 
elected offices secretary of state treasurer and agriculture 
commissioner and placed their duties under the governors control 
the people of west virginia have scored a great victory at the 
polls today said secretary of state ken hechler an opponent of 
the amendments 
the second amendment would have given the governor greater 
authority over the state primary and secondary education system the 
third would have given cities and counties the ability to merge or 
choose new forms of government 
caperton who took office in january said the voters rejected 
the proposals because the administration failed to fully explain 
them 
i believe the defeat of these amendments was due in part to the 
inability to get our true message about these complex and 
complicated amendments across he said in a statement 
caperton had said the elimination of the three offices would save 
the state about 3 million annually 
thirty percent of the 828000 registered voters participated in 
the election clear weather with temperatures in the 80s and college 
football games apparently proved too attractive to the bulk of the 
states voters 
the constitutional officers amendment was defeated 217582 or 89 
percent to 28095 or 11 percent the education amendment was 
beaten 217727 or 88 percent to 29670 or 12 percent the 
citycounty amendment was rejected 199507 or 81 percent to 
46573 or 19 percent 
folks have not been fooled said agriculture coimissioner 
cleve benedict the voters have seen through the highpowered 
media and see they like to run state government themselves and i 
think thats the way it ought to be 
in addition to hechler agriculture commissioner cleve benedict 
also opposed the measure the third officeholder whose job would 
have been eliminated treasurer thomas loehr supported capertons 
plan 
meeting in special session earlier this year the legislature 
gave caperton the most extraordinary powers since the state was 
created in 1863 to reorganize 150 executive offices under seven 
cabinet secretaries 
lawmakers also heeded his call for the three constitutional 
amendments which he said was needed to complete that reorganization 
opponents said the vote was a referendum on the administration 
which also had the legislature adopt the largest tax increase in 
state history 
in a debate last thursday loehr predicted defeat for the 
amendments 
i think theyre all in trouble said loehr who was appointed 
by caperton in july people are fed up with government and thats 
a shame this was a good opportunity to restructure our state 
government in a very positive way 
several state legislators have been indicted or resigned in 
recent months and the former treasurer and attorney general 
resigned recently 
respondents to a telephone survey conducted in august indicated 
residents would approve the amendment to allow the citycounty 
government merger while saying they probably wont change the way 
education is administered in the state nor would they abolish the 
elected offices

the united states and pakistan are 
backing a guerrilla governmentinexile as the only alternative to 
communist rule in afghanistan but six months after it was formed 
the rebel cabinet is feuding openly and has yet to move onto afghan 
soil 
the guerrillas many headquartered in the pakistani frontier city 
of peshawar predicted the marxists wouldnt last more than a few 
weeks after soviet combat forces withdrew from afghanistan in 
february 
but the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan which 
continues to recieve massive soviet aid has held its ground 
the communists are defending kabul the capital and other key 
afghan cities the insurgents called mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors still control much of the countryside 
but to the dismay of their sponsors some rebel groups have 
engaged in bitter internal disputes 
the afghan interim government was formed feb 24 in islamabad by 
an alliance of seven mujahedeen groups based in pakistan the 
temporary home of some 3 million afghan refugees 
assuming the communists imminent defeat the interim government 
was meant as a transitional administration to oversee the 
establishment of an islamic republic of afghanistan 
the interim government pledged to move inside afghanistan and 
hold elections for a parliament within 6 months in liberated 
areas and in refugee camps in pakistan the parliament was to 
draft an islamic constitution and vote on whether to replace the 
interim government 
none of that has happened 
the rebels fought in march to the suburbs of jalalabad 
afghanistans thirdlargest city just 40 miles from the pakistan 
border but they stalled under withering artillery fire and aerial 
bombardment 
then in july the traditional enmity between two of the most 
powerful rebel groups led to a massacre in northern afghanistan 
guerrillas of the fundamentalist hezbiislami group allegedly 
ambushed and murdered 32 commanders of the more liberal 
jamiatiislami party there are unconfirmed reports of hundreds 
more dead in subsequent clashes between the two groups 
the united states expressed its disappointment the recently 
reported internecine fighting is discouraging since resistance 
unity and cooperation is of paramount importance said peter 
thomsen the us special envoy to the rebel government 
naim majrooh an afghan intellectual living in peshawar said the 
tension isnt based on ideology 
its a moral struggle among the ranks a physical struggle 
among the parties and an ego struggle among the mujahedeen 
leaders majrooh said 
most observers believe the parties of the rebel government are 
united only in their hatred of the kabul government of president 
najib 
fundamentalist parties want to replace the communists with a 
strict islamic order while others favor a more liberal regime some 
want to fight for a total military victory while others are 
prepared to talk peace several parties are based primarily on 
personal loyalties 
the rebel government does not include the iranbased alliance of 
eight mujahedeen groups called the council of islamic coalition of 
afghanistan the coalition is predominantly shiite moslem while the 
pakistanbased rebels are mainly sunnis 
shiites were estimated to make up about 17 percent of 
afghanistans prewar population of 15 million the pakistanbased 
rebels claim the shiites have demanded a disproportionately large 
representation in the government 
thomsen said on a recent visit to pakistan that the iranbased 
guerrillas remain essential if the rebel government is to 
represent a broad sampling of afghans 
the fighting between the hezbiislami and jamiatiislami 
parties has widened the rifts within the guerrilla government itself 
sibghatullah mojaddidi the moderate president has publicly 
called the leader of the hezbiislami gulbaddin hekmatyar a 
killer who is destroying afghanistan 
hekmatyar who serves as foreign minister has suspended his role 
in the government for its failure to hold elections 
pakistan is anxious to see an end to the war which broke out 
after the communists seized power in kabul in a 1978 military coup 
soviet forces intervened in december 1979 to replace one communist 
government with another then sent in more than 100000 red army 
soldiers to help fight the insurgents 
moscow finally withdrew its troops between may 15 1988 and feb 
15 1989 after managing only to fight the mujahedeen to a stalemate 
prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan in a recent interview 
with the associated press indicated she shares the us view that 
the rebel government with all its problems is still the only 
alternative to what both countries view as an illegitimate 
government in kabul 
it would make us much happier if accusations and 
counteraccusations did not take place but we feel that in the 
given context the afghan interim government is the best framework 
there is for a political settlement in the country ms bhutto 
said 
mujahedeen leaders have attributed their recent military problems 
to a lack of ussupplied weapons and a change from guerrilla 
tactics to conventional warfare 
we havent received any new weapons for eight months said 
masoud khalili a spokesman of the jamiatiislami group 
thomsen insists washington still stands firmly behind the 
mujahedeen despite the antiamerican sentiments of some of the 
fundamentalist moslem rebel leaders notably hekmatyar

when chernenko died everybody said oh my 
god what does this mean for world peace says bill strauss 
but when i heard the news i said oh my god what rhymes with 
gorbachev 
strauss was worried because he is director and chief lyricist for 
the capitol steps a singing troupe of washingtonbred political 
satirists who have been lampooning public figures in song and verse 
for nearly eight years 
we pick up the paper every morning and look not at the 
importance of major world events but whether theyre funny and 
whether any of them rhyme says elaina newport the groups 
producer and colyricist 
strauss panicked at the challenge when soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev assumed power in march 1985 after all his predecessors 
were a rhymers dream andropov was bombs drop off chernenko 
rhymed with commie pinko he said 
but gorbachev 
strauss finally borrowed the tune from jim croces bad bad 
leroy brown and introduced gorby gorbachev the hottest red 
since andropov the worlds first yuppie slav the coolest 
dude since ustinov 
it all started as a lark in 1981 when six members of the staff 
of sen charles percy rill put together some impromptu musical 
entertainment for an office christmas party 
since then the cast of the capitol steps has expanded to 15 
members including understudies and all are current or former 
congressional aides they have given close to 1000 performances 
written about 350 songs and produced eight albums and tapes 
one of their latest recordings includes such bushera hits as 
stand by your dan thank god im a contra boy and fifty 
ways to hide new taxes 
their humor knows know partisan bounds they dont care whether 
the toes they step on belong to democrats or republicans the only 
difference says strauss is that republicans dont know when to 
laugh and democrats dont know when to stop 
at first the capitol steps performed free now they play an 
average of 25 engagements around the country each month charging 
5000 to 11000 per show theyve entertained at white house and 
capitol hill parties and on several network television shows and 
are weekend regulars at chelseas a trendy georgetown restaurant 
last wednesday night they taped their first tv special at 
antons nightclub in downtown washington before a celebrity audience 
that included outgoing surgeon general c everett koop and members 
of congress koop faced the cameras and warned that the show could 
be extraordinarily dangerous to your health the capitol steps will 
split your sides 
the tv special was produced by weta the washington public 
television station for local broadcast starting sept 13 and 
subsequent airing by other public tv stations 
the capitol steps group is a favorite of president bush who 
invited them to perform at three of his christmas parties as vice 
president he also joined in goodnaturedly when the steppers sang 
try to remember at bushs pearl harbor day party last december 
the song recalling bushs campaign goof over the date of the 
japanese bombing began try to remember that date in september 
the day japan attacked pearl harbor 
the only three founding members remaining in the capitol steps 
recalled bushs performance 
he sang it by himself and i use the word sang loosely 
said ms newport a former legislative assistant to percy and sen 
alfonse damato rny 
he sings kinda gentler said strauss former staff director 
of a senate governmental affairs subcommittee a thousand points 
of notes said jim aidala a pesticides expert at the 
congressional research service 
barbara bush wagged her finger at us but laughed and sang 
along when the steppers performed a satirized version of silver 
bells at the bush familys last christmas party in the vice 
presidential mansion ms newport said it went this way 
silver hair 
silver hair 
barbara will shine in the white house 
hair so white 
it glows at night 
helping to light georges way 
after gary harts womanizing ruined his political career strauss 
said the democrats seem to have gotten somewhat dull the funniest 
thing the steppers could find to celebrate former house speaker jim 
wright in song was 
you could have bagged a bimbo like jessica hahn 
but no you got in trouble and you kept your trousers on 
strauss said the steps were terrified that democratic 
candidate michael dukakis would win election as a coolly competent 
president for a while they promoted a duke and fluke ticket 
of dukakis and dan quayle 
they sighed with happy relief when quayle their richest source 
of comedy material was elected vice president 
id like to see a tremendous number of overseas trips being 
given to quayle and lots of speeches said strauss i hope he 
just keeps being himself

discontent over the economy and the 
environment has caused many norwegians to shift party loyalties 
signaling danger for socialist prime minister gro harlem brundtland 
in mondays national elections 
there is tremendous migration of voters from party to party 
the likes of which we have never seen in norway said per arne 
hestetun of the polling company norsk gallup as 
in an august poll of 7038 people by gallup voters listed as 
their main concerns the pollution of norways unique fjords a 
record unemployment rate of 5 percent and care for the aged 
many voters feel the prime minister of the socialist labor 
party has not worked hard enough to clean up norways environment 
they also say they have yet to feel the benefits of her economic 
austerity program 
ironically mrs brundtland is known abroad as a champion of 
conservation she is chairman of the un world commission on 
environment and development and foreign economists have praised her 
for turning around an economy sinking deeply into debt 
about 32 million norwegians in this scandinavian nation of 42 
million are eligible to vote monday for the 165seat parliament or 
storting which has been expanded from 157 seats 
the elections come after a weekend suspension of campaigning to 
mourn 55 people mostly norwegians who died friday in a plane crash 
off denmark 
analysts predict no clear majority will emerge in mondays 
voting a large block of undecided voters up to 20 percent could 
swing the outcome 
a poll published saturday in oslos aftenposten newspaper 
predicted that mrs brundtlands labor party will sink from 405 
percent of the vote in the 1985 election to 337 percent her party 
has governed with a parliamentary minority of 71 seats and 
issuebyissue support from other smaller parties 
the poll also said the conservatives the leading opposition 
party will drop from the 304 percent of the vote they garnered in 
1985 to 20 percent it gave the rightwing party of progress 16 
percent and the rest of the votes to a variety of small parties 
based on the poll aftenposten predicted 86 nonsocialist seats 
and 79 socialist seats in the new parliament 
the telephone poll of 1215 voters was conducted sept 47 by the 
bergen survey institute opinion as for aftenposten the margin of 
error was 22 to 28 percent 
pollster hestetun said he believed mrs brundtland will resign 
maybe not on the eve of the election but shortly afterwards and that 
a nonsocialist coalition will take over 
mrs brundtland appeared to be recovering some lost support 
sunday analysts said her nonsocialist opponents retained an 
apparent majority they said but it was possible deep rifts would 
prevent them from forming a working alliance 
mrs brundtland 50 a doctor and ustrained specialist in 
public health became prime minister of a minority government for 
the second time when a conservativeled coalition resigned in 1986 
she has said a poor showing in mondays vote will not 
automatically force her to step down since an alternative to a 
labor government remains unclear 
conservative party leader jan p syse 58 is the most likely 
alternative to mrs brundtland his party is allied with three 
smaller nonsocialist parties 
syse has said labor is ducking responsibility by blaming his 
party and that socialism is bankrupt but his party and its 
allies have failed to find reach final accord on a candidate for 
prime minister or a common platform 
christian democratic chairman kjell magne bondevik a junior 
member of the nonsocialist alliance has put himself forward as a 
compromise choice with some public support 
the wild card in mondays election is carl i hagen of the 
rightwing party of progress who is challenging the underpinnings 
of the welfare state by urging sharp tax cuts and privatization of 
stateowned industries and services 
hagen has been shunned by the other parties for a decade 
distaste for him could unify the other nonsocialist parties enough 
to overcome their differences and exclude him from government 
analysts said 
mrs brundtland has been accused of ignoring the goals of a 
government commission that drafted a 1987 environmental plan called 
our common future she has rejected the criticism as unfair 
politicking by her rivals 
the international organization of economic development and 
cooperation has credited mrs brundtland for the austerity diet she 
imposed on the economy which had grown fat on north sea oil wealth 
and then crashed with a price collapse in 1986 
despite her political leanings mrs brundtland imposed wage 
restrictions and other fiscal restraint that halved inflation in two 
years to under 5 percent and turned the foreign debt into a surplus 
however unemployment and bankruptcies have hit record levels 
giving a hollow ring to labors motto of employment for all

former president richard m nixon is 
making plans to visit china alone and meet with its leaders despite 
his earlier cancellation of a group trip said his spokesman 
political unrest forced him to put off his visit this fall with 
six friends among them william e simon former treasury secretary 
in nixons administration spokesman john taylor said last week 
simon heads an investor group that owns several banks in hawaii 
and is interested in acquiring a stake in a chinese bank said roy 
doumani simons partner taylor stressed in an interview from his 
office in woodcliff lake that nixon had no business relationship 
with simon 
taylor said nixon had been invited by chinas government and 
that the state department knew about the former presidents plans 
no date has been set for the trip 
nixon who lives in upper saddle river has visited the peoples 
republic of china five times his first visit in 1972 was the 
first by a us president and opened the door to normal diplomatic 
relations 
the following year china and the united states opened diplomatic 
offices on each others soil after a break during the vietnam war 
nixons representatives and chinese officials are arranging the 
details of a sixth visit though taylor did not rule out a future 
group trip 
the purpose of the solo trip would be to have extensive 
discussions with the top leaders of china taylor said noting 
that the former president has done the same on every trip to china 
hes not doing it at the behest of us officials said the 
spokesman he is of course in touch with the us government about 
his plans and they have communicated to him their views on his 
plans 
taylor refused to discuss why nixon was going to speak to chinas 
leaders 
these things are matters of very sensitive discussions he 
said i really dont see the value of acquainting the associated 
press with all the details 
if nixon does go on his solo trip he will be accompanied only by 
a lone bodyguard he gave up secret service protection in 1985

just across the street from the building where 
drug war director william bennett sits at his desk in a twostory 
suite the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws 
carries on its own quest from a small warrenlike office 
norml which opened its first storefront office in a rundown 
section of washington in 1970 is emerging as one of the most vocal 
critics of president bushs antidrug campaign 
the simple question is whether marijuana should be included in 
the war on drugs normls incoming national director donald 
fiedler told reporters at a national press club press conference 
following bennetts outline of the bush plan this past week 
if it is he said the price of a drugfree america is an 
america that can no longer be free 
norml wants legalization of marijuana but supports continued 
prohibition of cocaine although it has had its ups and downs 
fiedler said he believes harsh attempts to penalize the nations 
millions of marijuana smokers eventually will bolster normls 
diminished strength 
when bush went after the aclu it helped their membership when 
the recent supreme court decision on abortion came out it helped 
now and we fully expect the bennett drug war plan will help 
norml said fiedler a lawyer from omaha neb 
in its early days norml gained attention by defending youngsters 
facing years in prison for lighting up its efforts helped spark 
decriminalization moves in many state legislatures 
as the marijuana laws changed normls 25ayear membership roll 
shrank from a high of 20000 people in 1978 to about 5000 now 
to support its annual budget of 250000 the organization now 
holds seminars for criminal defense lawyers in an article published 
in 1986 washington monthly said a third of normls budget came from 
such conferences which it claimed were geared toward helping 
lawyers defend midlevel mobsters some members told the magazine 
that the drug defense seminars had caused dissension within the 
organization 
asked about the article doug mcvay activist coordinator for 
norml said the lawyers who are interested in this issue tend to 
do drug defense work nowadays however if you are doing criminal 
defense work in general more and more of it is drug defense its 
unfortunate but its the case 
from its initial location in a seedy area of washington that has 
since blossomed out in highprice hotels norml has moved to an 
office building it shares with such tenants as the international 
joint commission a governmental body concerned with uscanadian 
affairs not with the kind of joints marijuana smokers talk about 
the drug war office is on the top two floors of a building across 
the street 
they can peek in our windows and we can peek in theirs said 
carole moore who like a number of norml activists is also a 
member of the libertarian party jim turney of richmond va former 
national chairman of the libertarians is treasurer of norml 
the libertarians contention that the government should interfere 
as little as possible with individual rights meshes with normls 
stance on marijuana although the two organizations differ on some 
other issues 
joining fiedler at wednesdays news conference were gatewood 
galbraith of lexington ky and jack herer of help eliminate 
marijuana prohibition both advocates of hemp the marijuana plant 
as a cash crop herer showed a 1942 agriculture department movie 
extolling hemps value to the war effort as a source of rope for 
battleships and parachutes 
they all wore jackets and ties and galbraith puffed on a cigar as 
he waited for the conference to start 
in the audience were ms moore wearing an i smoke pot 
button and dana deal one of the originators of a new yorkbased 
coalition of marijuana activists wearing a psychedelic tshirt with 
the words boycott white powder bring back herb 
deal is part of norml but said he would like the group to be more 
activist 
what it really is is some young lawyers and they feel more 
comfortable dealing with other professionals he said they 
dont like demonstrations because every time you have a 
demonstration somebody smokes pot they dont want to advocate pot 
they want to advocate legalization we advocate pot 
in an interview in his office fiedler said at the smokeins 
some people do smoke pot some demonstrate norml has spoken at 
smokeins but to my knowledge norml has never sponsored a smokein 
we will come and speak at them but as to sponsoring them no 
the incoming director said he thinks the link with the 
libertarians is a natural liaison because the libertarian party 
believes that we have the right to shape our own destiny and the 
government doesnt have the right to jump in and tell us what we 
should and should not do 
turney in a telephone interview from richmond said members 
of norml leaders of norml are becoming more and more libertarian 
in their outlook 
they part company on some things however the libertarian favor 
repeal of all laws prohibiting drug use while norml seeks only to 
legalize marijuana the libertarians also oppose taxation while 
norml accepts taxation of marijuana as part of the legalization 
process 
well fight to legalize it with the tax and then fight to take 
the tax off said ms moore

a federal contractor who reported problems in 
the socalled doomsday project a topsecret program designed to 
keep the government running after a nuclear war asserts in a sealed 
lawsuit that the federal emergency management agency burglarized his 
offices 
the alleged breakins occurred after the contractor retired army 
major fred westerman rejected a demand by fema to turn over all his 
corporate records to a business competitor according to the suit 
filed in federal court 
westerman was kicked out of the secret program less than two 
months after he refused to surrender the documents which he still 
has 
an army counterintelligence officer for 20 years westerman 
started telling superiors about security and management problems in 
the continuity of government program in 1986 according to 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
cog is the nations contingency plan for reconstituting the 
government in the event of a nuclear attack while almost all 
details are secret it is known to involve mobile communications 
networks supply depots and a system of underground bunkers 
the program was dubbed the doomsday project in a recent us 
news amp world report article the magazine reported that the 
pentagon the justice department and the house armed services 
committee all are conducting investigations into security and 
performance problems in the program 
fema and the justice department both refuse to discuss the cog 
program or westermans lawsuit in addition the government obtained 
a gag order to prevent the contractor from discussing his case 
westerman and his lawyer frank mroz both declined to comment 
when asked about the suit 
under a contract with the army corps of engineers westermans 
small company provided security and other services to fema for 
portions of the cog program in five states 
he reported that alarm and security systems at highly classified 
locations were faulty and that his employees were exposed to 
dangerous chemicals that had leaked from containers at several 
facilities according to the sources westerman also reported that 
water had seeped onto highvoltage electrical lines in one area and 
that engine parts were falling off emergency vehicles parked at 
several facilities the sources said 
in one instance westerman reported that the government removed 
an alarm system and installed a new one that provided less security 
than the one it replaced said the sources 
westerman frequently was pressured by his superiors not to make 
any complaints at all the sources added 
on nov 20 1987 representatives from fema the army corps of 
engineers and the maryland company of brogan associates inc came to 
westermans offices according to copies of the lawsuit obtained by 
the associated press from sources other than parties in the case 
fema employee robert lorenz and army corps officer gerald boggs 
demanded that westerman turn over all his corporate documents 
communications records invoices and checkbooks to brogan president 
arthur hutchins the suit says 
boggs told westerman then and in subsequent weeks that if he 
refused to turn over the documents he would not be awarded a new 
fiveyear contract according to the lawsuit 
lorenz a specialist in femas operations security division 
threatened to put westermans company out of business according to 
the lawsuit 
the meeting ended with westerman in possession of his corporate 
records 
fema brogans company and the corps of engineers then did 
unlawfully break into corporate headquarters of westermans 
company systems evaluation inc westerman alleges in the suit 
westerman according to several sources says that the first of 
at least four burglaries occurred within 48 hours of his nov 20 
meeting and that the others occurred over the next three months 
four weeks after the meeting boggs told westerman that 
negotiations for the new fiveyear contract were being terminated 
due to all the things that had taken place the suit says 
last month us district court judge norma johnson placed a gag 
order on westerman which prohibited him from discussing his case 
with anyone even members of congress westerman subsequently 
withdrew his suit and refiled it in federal court in alexandria va 
government searches of premises ordinarily require a search 
warrant signed by judges and law enforcement agencies such as the 
fbi ordinarily are the agencies that execute them under a national 
security directive the attorney general can approve a surreptitious 
entry for intelligence purposes targeting a foreign power or an 
agent of a foreign power 
westerman suspects fema placed him under surveillance and tapped 
his telephones according to another suit he filed against the 
federal agency 
that suit invoked the freedom of information act in demanding 
that fema turn over any records gathered as the result of 
surveillance telephone taps or any other electronic 
listening device 
us district court judge albert bryan dismissed that case sept 
1 at a hearing where government lawyers refused to confirm or deny 
that the agency had any such records pertaining to westerman 
in dismissing it bryan relied on a secret declaration the 
government filed with the judge and which westerman and his attorney 
were not permitted to see 
after being pushed out of the program in january 1988 westerman 
went to the fbi the inspector generals office at fema and the 
justice department to detail irregularities in cog according to 
an affidavit he filed with the us court of claims 
the affidavit does not elaborate on the irregularities 
in june the us attorneys office informed westerman that he 
himself had become the target of a criminal investigation in 
connection with his work for cog 
the criminal inquiry has frozen westermans case in claims court 
where he is seeking to recover 500000 even though he is no longer 
doing work for the government he is locked into paying longterm 
leases for office space and equipment that he would have used in his 
work for cog 
the fema public affairs office refused to comment on the suit 
the public affairs office at the army corps of engineers referred 
questions to the army judge advocate generals office which said 
the justice department would handle any inquiries justice 
department lawyer alan ferber who is defending the government in 
the lawsuit referred questions to spokeswoman amy brown who 
declined to comment 
brogan president arthur hutchins has not returned telephone calls 
for the past month and a lawyer representing the company did not 
respond to calls the past week

the duchess of york says she was a naughty child at 
school and at home singling out a mathematics teacher for 
particular mischief but described her own little girl as a 
smiley easy baby 
asked by the british broadcasting corp interviewer saturday to 
comment on a school report that described her as slapdash 
stubborn and headstrong the duchess replied i always tried to 
do things and not get caught i put dye in the lavatory cistern and 
put glue on the teachers chair because it was maths and i didnt 
like maths 
maths is the british way of saying math while a lavatory 
cistern is a toilet tank 
to begin with i was a bit of a tomboy but when i finished up 
at school i did work quite hard and i was becoming more responsible 
by the minute said the 29yearold wife of prince andrew queen 
elizabeth iis second son 
the duchess who has learned to fly airplanes and helicopters 
has written a childrens book about a helicopter name budgie 
she said her own daughter 1yearold princess beatrice enjoyed 
the pictures but when i showed it to her she did her normal 
trick and tore it up and threw it in the dustbin 
she thinks its a great book because she loves the pretty 
pictures and it all lands in the dustbin 
she said beatrice was a placid happy little girl she has got 
everything she needs and she has got devoted parents who see her as 
much as they possibly can 
and surely thats the answer for every child everybody says 
they cant get over what a smiley easy baby she is

aids is so prevalent on this resort island 
that chamber of commerce officials worry the disease may turn away 
the tourists the economy relies on and change this into a place to 
die 
monroe county which includes key west has an aids rate even 
higher than new york city and san francisco most county residents 
live on the florida keys the chain of islands anchored by key west 
the deadly disease has spurred compassion among many residents of 
key west a city with a highly visible gay population though no 
reliable statistics exist some social workers say many aids 
patients from other cities are aware of this and are coming to key 
west for treatment and to die 
that compassion could overwhelm the local healthcare system and 
stifle tourism key wests primary industry officials say 
if this is a great place to die then its not a great place to 
have your winter vacation said jaye harkow a social worker who 
moved to key west a year ago to counsel aids patients 
and that worries greater key west chamber of commerce officials 
the impact on this community could be tremendous if we have 
aids patients come into key west for their last days said john 
parks jr chamber president we dont want to advertise that this 
is a place for aids patients to come 
if the negative gets out that there are a large number of aids 
cases in the key west area then people have the fear of not coming 
to key west he said this can be an explosive situation to the 
community 
monroe county had 121 cases aids per 100000 people in 1988 
according to the federal centers for disease control in atlanta san 
francisco had a rate of 102 cases per 100000 from august 1988 to 
july 1989 new york city had 63 and the greater miami area had 45 
since the county first started keeping records of aids cases in 
1982 217 people have been diagnosed with the disease in the keys 
said dave nolan who handles statistics for the monroe public health 
unit that number does not include those who were diagnosed 
elsewhere and then moved to key west of the 217 diagnosed 132 have

epa administrator william reilly on sunday 
defended the administrations plan to require cleanerburning 
alternatives to gasoline in the worstpolluted cities saying 
there is no other way to curb smog 
appearing on nbcs meet the press reilly also said 
alternative fuels can compete economically with gasoline 
alternative automotive fuels such as methanol ethanol and natural 
gas a linchpin of the bush administrations clean air plan 
the environment subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee will hold a hearing on the plan tuesday 
the petroleum industry contends the alternativefuels proposal 
would put its members at an unfair disadvantage against the makers 
of the other fuels methanol for instance is derived from natural 
gas or coal 
the petroleum industry says cleanerburning gasoline can be 
developed and should be allowed 
the automobile industry contends it may not be able to develop 
the technology to meet the proposed 1995 deadline for supplying half 
a million alternativefuel cars to the nine dirtiest cities by 1995 
reilly said however the fact is the automobile remains about 
half a little less than half of the problem even though weve made 
great gains since the early 1970s in cleaning up pollution from 
automobile tailpipes 
weve got to go back in and do better and the major 
opportunity we have is alternative fuels 
reilly also said its not at all clear that alternative fuels 
would cost more 
the presidents council of economic advisors has been unable to 
come up with a precise estimate of the cost differential for the 
alternative fuels because of the distant deadlines reilly said 
but we are reasonably confident that the range of cost is 
likely to be close he said we dont see a significantly 
increased expense for some of the alternative fuels 
reilly said the administration is open to the kinds of fuels 
that are used provided they get the pollution reductions that we 
need but for many cities in the country we see no other way to get 
there than to change the fuel mix 
discussing the proposal in general reilly said the chief issue 
will be the 14 billion to 19 billion cost and who pays it 
the whole question of imposing the kinds of expense that its 
going to take to clean up the air obviously is going to entail a 
great debate how those costs are borne what segments of society 
in some cases with respect to acid rain what regions he said

so confident is coleman young of breezing through 
tuesdays nonpartisan mayoral primary that the normally combative 
dean of us black mayors is taking the high road or no road against 
his 12 opponents 
he wont fight them and he rarely faces them 
thus the big question in the primary in the nations 
sixthlargest city is who will finish second and face young in the 
nov 7 runoff at 71 young seeks an unprecedented fifth fouryear 
term 
accountant tom barrow 40 whom young easily defeated in 1985 is 
working hard to overtake john conyers 60 a 13term congressman 
whose name recognition alone may carry him into the runoff farther 
back in the pack are city council president erma henderson and 
businessman charles costa 
a poll released aug 27 by wjbktv found 38 percent of 413 
respondents supported young 12 percent conyers and 9 percent 
barrow henderson had 44 percent and costa 15 percent with 30 
percent undecided the margin of error was 48 points 
only conyers is given much of a chance against young in november 
young despite taking a beating in the news media for most of his 
current term seems to have all the advantages among them 
a reported 5 million in campaign funds 
a 15year incumbency and a record of accomplishment to go with 
it he kept a promise from his first campaign to bring affirmative 
action to an overwhelmingly white police department which now is 52 
percent black and 20 percent female he expanded city airport and 
cobo convention center and he has helped detroit banks pledge more 
than 2 billion in loans to city residents 
support from the citys most influential unions leaders of its 
largest black churches most of the citys state representatives 
and the michigan chronicle the states largest black newspaper 
conyers and barrow also are black as are twothirds of detroits 1 
million people 
conyers political service consists of a quartercentury in 
congress and he has a national reputation though his lastminute 
candidacy just before a filing deadline didnt help much 
the rev jesse jackson has endorsed conyers so did the detroit 
free press which had supported youngs four previous election bids 
but denounced his lack of leadership the past four years the 
newspaper said conyers would provide detroit its best assurance of 
a full debate and a real choice in november 
barrow practically never stopped campaigning since he lost to 
young 61 percent to 39 percent in 1985 a nephew of boxer joe louis 
barrow has no experience in office and some observers feel he has 
dues to pay in the roughandtumble world of detroit politics before 
he can expect to be mayor 
barrows greatest accomplishment was leading last years 
opposition to youngs third effort to bring casino gambling to 
detroit his doortodoor politicking also has given him more 
visibility and the detroit news endorsed him as more conservative 
than young and conyers 
one matter that put young into the headlines a few months ago 
the disclosure that he had fathered a child by a former city 
administrator hasnt been much of a campaign issue 
youngs greatest problem might be the perception that hes been 
around too long the need for a change has been the central theme of 
conyers and barrows campaigns they have accused the mayor of 
neglecting neighborhoods at the expense of downtown development and 
not doing enough about drug abuse among police officers though 
young did get a judge to approve drug testing for patrolmen 
theres something called the abc vote anybody but coleman 
said wilbur rich an associate professor of political science at 
wayne state university who wrote a biography of young 
but that may not help youngs foe in the runoff rich said 
those people who have an ax to grind will show up for the primary 
but dont look for them in november 
should conyers finish second tuesday rich looks for a bloody 
campaign for the runoff focusing on issues including drugs crime 
and neighborhood services 
conyers is not a guy young can knock out easily conyers has a 
lot of national visibility but if it gets down to the cliche 
soundbite kind of stuff young will be in his element rich said 
youngs campaigning appears designed to keep him clear of 
multicandidate events where he might be forced or tempted to answer 
one of his challengers he says hes avoided such appearances to 
give his challengers a chance to present their proposals 
young briefly encountered conyers at a labor day parade young 
walked a block of the parade route then hopped in his limousine and 
rode to the reviewing stand that brought knocks from conyers and 
barrow about youngs stamina 
instead young has campaigned as the mayor during the last week 
in august he announced a new 33 million soft drink bottling plant 
that will employ 300 an 86 million bond sale and the construction 
of 500 housing units with 30 million in state money 
in november rich said the winner cant be just as good as 
coleman theyll have to prove they are better than coleman

china has issued 40 slogans to mark the 40th 
anniversary of its communist revolution including one celebrating 
the recent suppression of the student prodemocracy movement 
the slogans compiled by the communist party and published sunday 
by the official xinhua news agency are a mixture of selfpraise for 
the nations accomplishments and admonishments to do better in such 
areas as corruption and education 
since the revolution 40 years ago china has made heavy use of 
slogans in newspapers and on billboards and signs to express policy 
and exhort people to follow it 
one slogan opening with declarations hailing the 40th 
anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic of china and 
its great achievements in modernization calls on people to 
warmly hail the successful quelling of the turmoil and the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
china claims the bloody june 34 military crackdown on students 
and their supporters in beijing was necessary because demands for 
democratic reform had become a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
attempting to overthrow the government 
another slogan calls on people to salute the peoples 
liberation army men police and armed police who have performed 
remarkable feats in the struggle to defend the peoples republic 
chinese also are urged to retain loyalty to socialism and the 
communist party and to firmly fight against bourgeois 
liberalization or attraction to western ideas and political 
systems 
they are told to support economic reforms and an opendoor policy 
while fulfilling the task of straightening out the economic 
order a reference to the current policy of reasserting central 
controls and halting new reforms in the wake of inflation and other 
economic woes 
one new slogan calls for selfreliance hard work and building up 
the country through thrift and hard work 
another repeats mao tsetungs 1956 promise of free expression 
let a hundred flowers bloom let a hundred schools of thought 
contend that was followed in 1957 by a crackdown on those who 
spoke out against the party 
the phrase is again suspect because many intellectuals who spoke 
out for democratic reform earlier in the year have been arrested or 
publicly condemned since the june crackdown 
chinese are urged to build an honest and clean government and 
punish and eliminate corruption a major issue during the spring 
demonstrations 
they are also told to maintain the sovereignty of the country 
and national dignity and firmly oppose any foreign interference in 
chinas internal affairs an apparent reference to western 
condemnation of the violence used to suppress the student protests 
on oct 1 china marks the 40th anniversary since mao tsetung 
standing on beijings tiananmen square declared the founding of the 
peoples republic of china

charles sanders peirce an irritable 
genius who invented the illbelieveitwheniseeit philosophy 
called pragmatism was born 150 years ago sunday yet the 
appreciation of his wideranging mind has only begun say scholars 
who gathered to study his work 
theres a tremendous story to be told said professor kenneth 
ketner of texas tech university cohost of the charles sanders 
peirce sesquicentennial international congress that wound up this 
weekend at harvard university peirces alma mater were talking 
about one of the great geniuses of all time 
a prolific writer inspired scientist and daring philospher 
peirce didnt stop at pragmatism he also thought up semiotics 
devised modern symbolic logic the mathematical system that 
underpins the computer and determined long before this 
mechanistic age that treating people like machines wont work 
peirce delved into the history of science astronomy physics and 
metaphysics evolution psychology and the reality of god all 
entertained his roving mind 
it helps to have a dictionary handy when considering peirce 
pragmatism for example is the philosophy that determines the 
meaning and truth of ideas and tests their validity by their 
practical results in other words it ties ideas to action let us 
not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our 
hearts he wrote 
semiotics is a general theory about signs and symbols and how 
they relate to communication 
peirce knew how hard he was to understand he once confided to 
his friend promoter and fellow pragmatist william james that he 
felt like a snarl of twine 
in college courses james usually gets the credit for pragmatism 
peirce is just a footnote but ketner says that even james referred 
to his chum as the founder of the philosophy james made famous 
ketner was among more than 400 scholars from a dozen countries 
including china japan west germany and brazil who attended the 
harvard congress 
peirce for a long time was undervalued as the greatest american 
philosopher said umberto eco the bestselling italian novelist 
who teaches philosophy at the university of bologna he ranks peirce 
among the two or three greatest thinkers of his time 
he was americanborn but he was a universal mind said eco 
who like all peirce fans correctly pronounces the name purse 
harvard was more than peirces alma mater he grew up there 
the son of the famed harvard mathematician benjamin peirce he 
was raised in a house in harvard yard where he began to study logic 
and reasoning at age 12 and was trained in math and science by the 
time he entered harvard at 16 
the younger peirce made his living as a mathematical physicist 
for the government and was wellknown in his day for his scientific 
ventures he devised a way to chart the shape of the earth and 
pioneered the use of light waves to measure lengths he tried to 
measure the milky way went around the world gauging gravity and 
explored zoology 
while he was little known by the public he was elected to the 
american academy of arts and sciences the national academy of 
sciences and the london mathematical society 
overbearing but overly sensitive his difficult personality was 
forgiven by friends like james but his efforts to enter academia 
failed badly he was fired from a parttime job teaching logic at 
johns hopkins university when it was discovered he was living with a 
woman while not yet divorced from his first wife 
peirces only outlets then were such publications as the nation 
and obscure scientific journals but he wrote down his ideas daily 
and after his death at age 75 in 1914 on a farm in milford penn 
his widow gave his papers to harvard the first collection of 
peirces philosophical writings was published in the 1930s more is 
in the offing and even now scholars continue to come up with new 
intellectual gems 
enthusiasm worldwide for peirce can be attributed to curiosity 
about america and american thought his ideas ready applicability 
to modern technology and contemporary philosophy and the universal 
context in which he worked said israel scheffler a harvard 
professor of philosophy and education 
the substance of peirces thoughts have not been fully 
plumbed scheffler said

leaders of the mormon church who abruptly 
excommunicated the only american indian ever appointed to the church 
hierarchy are busy trying to blunt the impact of his stormy exit and 
questions he raised 
george p lee the first mormon high official in 46 years to be 
erased from membership rolls is heading to the mountains alone for 
a month or more of fasting and meditation about his future outside 
the church which he claims is polluted from the top by pride and 
racial prejudice 
its the way of my people lee a navajo and son of a 
medicine man said a week after losing his official standing sept 1 
as a role model for more than 40000 navajo mormons 
two mormon officials convened a hastily scheduled meeting friday 
with local church leaders at window rock ariz headquarters of the 
navajo reservation a similar session was arranged saturday in 
shiprock nm 
navajo sources who attended fridays meeting characterized the 
session as an effort by the church to isolate lee and his beliefs 
from his people 
generally they said it was not the churchs fault and that it 
was due to george said one navajo who spoke on condition of 
anonymity they are trying to nip it in the bud but at the end we 
were all somewhat confused 
lee said in an interview he had no intention of recruiting his 
own following and discouraged disillusioned church members from 
leaving the faith 
but he did not retreat from his characterization of mormon 
leaders as vain men bent on dislodging indians from what lee sees as 
their rightful place in mormon theology 
lees abrupt departure is seen by many navajo mormons as a 
validation of his claim that the church leadership under president 
ezra taft benson is quietly moving to dislodge indian members from 
their heritage 
mormons believe indians are descendants of ancient peoples who 
sailed to the americas and whose history is detailed in the book of 
mormon the volumes title page says it is written to the lamanites 
or indians who are a remnant of the house of israel and also to 
jew and gentile 
lee says bensons predecessor spencer w kimball taught that 
indians are literal descendants of israel while nonindian mormons 
are gentiles adopted into the house of israel when they embrace 
the faith 
church spokesman bruce olsen said it was not his place to define 
current mormon doctrine but sources at the window rock meeting said 
elder h burke peterson attempted to do so by arguing that the blood 
of nonindian mormons is transformed making them literal 
descendants of israel 
he peterson said that those who are being baptized into the 
church their blood physically changes to that of the house of 
israel said one source who demanded anonymity this kind of 
confirms what elder lee was saying 
lee contends the belief that all mormons are literal descendants 
of israel reflects an attitude of white supremacy among mormon 
leaders who have systematically cut indian programs at churchowned 
brigham young university and elsewhere 
lee a member of the first quorum of the seventy since 1975 was 
excommunicated for apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member 
of the church following an hourlong meeting with benson his 
counselors in the governing first presidency and the quorum of the 
twelve apostles an advisory body that supervises the seventy 
members of the three panels are known as general authorities in 
the 67 millionmember church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
at the meeting lee read a 23page letter detailing his concerns 
then within minutes two officials told him to turn over all church 
property including a credit card and a signed pass with which 
faithful mormons gain entry to their temples 
it was just absolutely cold said lee 46 a father of seven 
who is without pension or immediate job prospect 
a request to interview a member of the twelve was declined as a 
matter of policy church officials do not divulge details of 
disciplinary actions

a philosophy professor says in a published article 
that the soviet system continues to exploit workers and waste 
resources and suffers from a tyranny of authoritarian 
bureaucracy 
in another interview published sunday an economist attacks 
socialist principles the two articles carry glasnost the openness 
policy of president mikhail s gorbachev further than most in the 
statecontrolled press by questioning the ability of communism to 
solve societys basic problems 
the philosophy professor mikhail kapustin rips into the 
governing system in a 25page article in the august issue of the 
literary magazine called october 
the monthly raised eyebrows earlier this year by reprinting a 
novel criticizing vladimir i lenin the founder of the soviet state 
kapustin assailed a 1989 dictionary on communism that outlines 
the historic advantages of socialism 
the advantages of socialism are not historic or real but 
purely theoretical conjectural kapustin wrote they are an 
ideological mirage in a social economic and legal desert 
the interview with economist rair simonyan appeared in the latest 
issue of ogonyok magazine released sunday 
simoyan said socialism alienated workers and hampered competition 
needed for free development of the individual one of the ideologys 
stated goals 
gorbachev and other leaders have repeatedly said communism and 
socialism are basically sound theories properly put into effect by 
lenin but distorted by his successor dictator josef stalin 
as recently as saturday night gorbachev said in a television 
speech that his perestroika or restructuring program was aimed at 
socialist renewal of society he said perestroika had returned 
to this great country a feeling of dignity and gave the soviet man 
a sense of freedom 
however the philosophy professor wrote in his article entitled 
whats coming that because of stalin the working people 
once again found themselves where they had been before the 
revolution in conditions of hopeless labor and oppression in 
serfdom and slavery 
he indicated that the problems persist even under gorbachev 
saying despite glasnost we still continue to live in customary 
stale darkness that keeps people engaged in theoretical 
optimism 
kapustin says socialisms goal of organizing production for the 
wellbeing of the people has for 70 years been retreating further 
and further he adds tht cumbersome economically unjustified 
construction projects and huge ecologically criminal projects 
have been undertaken instead 
another stated goal of socialism was to eliminate exploitation of 
workers but kapustin said they are exploited in any case 
in his interview with ogonyok simonyan agreed those who work 
well are exploited by those who work poorly honest workers are 
exploited by those who live off unearned income those who work in 
industries are exploited by officials of the 
administrativebureaucratic apparatus generally speaking a worker 
is exploited by the state he said 
kapustin recommended abandoning the communist tenet that 
capitalism will inevitably decay 
he said communism was supposed to foster the rule of reason but 
in fact it has produced no reason just an accumulation of the 
same mistakes 
the working class he said was supposed to be in charge but 
instead the tyranny of czarism aristocracy and bourgeoisie was 
replaced by another tyranny of authoritarian bureaucracy 
stalin and his successors brought our society to a spiritual 
and moral degradation where the ruling elite has turned out to be 
made of the least worthy material kapustin said

instead of using poison to rid their homes of 
mice hennepin county residents are being asked to call in the 
killer potatoes 
thats right put out a bowl of mashed potato powder near a dish 
of water and its supposed to bloat the varmints to death 
thats just one of the chemicalfree suggestions the county has 
in a fourpage trashcanshaped brochure it began giving out last 
week at its household hazardous waste collection sites set up to 
encourage people not to put their leftover household chemicals and 
such in the trash 
the ideas in the brochure a cross between mother earth news and 
hints from heloise were gleaned from several sources and include 
buying hints and disposal tips 
the county printed 30000 copies of the brochure for residents 
who want natural alternatives to toxic remedies for common household

exxons prime contractor on cleaning up 
the nations worst oil spill estimates the petroleum giant will end 
up spending 2 billion on the job nearly twice as much as estimated 
in july 
veco inc president pete leathard said the 2 billion figure 
should include all oil spillrelated costs except major lawsuits 
which could take years to settle and could push the final tally 
higher 
weve paid more than 1 billion but were not speculating 
on future costs or lawsuits said don cornett an exxon 
spokesman 
by the end of june exxons costs for the cleanup had been 
estimated at 128 billon 
the tanker exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 spilling 
almost 11 million gallons of heavy north slope crude oil into prince 
william sound since then the oil has spread hundreds of miles 
exxon has said it will stop the cleanup work friday because of 
worsening weather and shorter days 
exxon had made no commitment to send workers back to the area 
next spring will have to finish the cleanup next spring or pay the 
government to do the job epa administrator william reilly said 
sunday in washington the job isnt done he said on nbcs 
meet the press 
veco and its subcontractors are expected to spend more than 700 
million of exxons money on the cleanup leathard said in an 
interview in sundays editions of the anchorage times 
on its own exxon has handled many of the bigdollar items 
including the rental of many vessels longer than 100 feet he added 
the cost of scientific studies openwater oil pickup and the 
numerous damage claims against the company also will combine to 
drive final costs to about 2 billion he said 
leathard said the 700 million in veco expenditures were about 
evenly divided beween labor boat rentals and materials at the peak 
of the cleanup veco and its subcontractors employed about 7500 
workers and leased 2000 vessels he said 
hundreds of companies in more than 30 states and a halfdozen 
foreign countries were tapped by veco for material and equipment 
at one point veco which handled about 90 percent of the 
shoreline work for exxon was spending about 5 million a day on 
payroll boat leases materials and equipment he said 
through the end of august veco had paid 123 million in wages to 
alaska employees he said norcon a veco subsidiary paid an 
additional 69 million in all about 460 million of the 700 
million spent by veco was pumped into the alaska economy leathard 
said 
exxon has done what the said they would do and they have 
given us all the money we needed leathard said

the city will begin steering its money to banks 
committed to serving minority neighborhoods credit needs mayor 
raymond flynn has announced 
the move comes less than two weeks after a federal report said 
white boston neighborhoods have gotten more mortgage loans than 
black neighborhoods 
flynn said saturday he will sign an executive order establishing 
a linked deposit program requiring the city treasurer to 
evaluate banks on such factors as home mortgages smallbusiness 
loans and other services 
we dont see this as a panacea treasurer lee jackson said 
but on the other hand we think its important we put our money 
where our mouth is and do what we can to encourage positive 
investment behavior 
the mayor also said he will establish a community banking 
commission to monitor lending practices of boston banks and 
recommend ways to improve services to city neighborhoods 
boston city deposits range from 50 million to 350 million at 
any given time and are split among 20 banks and moneymarket funds 
banks bid for deposits 
in its recent report the federal reserve bank of boston said 
that between 1982 and 1987 the largely white areas of boston 
received 24 percent more mortgage loans than black neighborhoods 
the study urged bankers to reach out to minority consumers 
a boston community group issued a similar study a month ago 
meanwhile the us house banking committee said friday it will 
hold a hearing sept 29 in boston in response to the federal reserve 
study 
also on friday the massachusetts bankers association offered a 
series of proposals to ease inequities in money services between 
black and white neighborhoods statewide 
the proposals include setting up a minority business investment 
center to encourage expansion of minorityowned companies and 
changing mortgage lending practices to increase minority access to 
financial institutions

repair work begins monday on the tanker exxon 
valdez which caused the nations worst oil spill when its hull was 
ripped open on a reef and one of the first objectives is removing 
big chunks of the reef 
one rock about the size of a volkswagen bug and another rock 
estimated to weigh about 6000 pounds are still wedged in torn 
sections of the tankers hull said dick vortmann president of 
national steel amp shipbuilding co 
both rocks are from bligh reef in alaskas prince william sound 
where the ruptured tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude 
oil in march 
nassco vice president fred hallet said more than 300 workers are 
expected to cut away and replace about 3200 tons of steel the 
damaged area represents more 75 percent of the tankers bottom 
twelve of the ships 25 compartments need repairs 
the tanker underwent temporary repairs in a remote lagoon in 
prince william sound before being towed to san diego during the 
voyage large sheets of hull plating came loose and dragged below 
the ship and had to be cut loose before the valdez could be towed 
through shallow water to the shipyard 
reporters were allowed to examine the tankers hull saturday as 
workers prepared for the ninemonth 25 million repair job 
the valdez is sitting 5 feet off the ground in dry dock on dozens 
of concrete pylons the ship was built by nassco in the same dry 
dock and launched in 1986 
the largest visible damage was to a 300by80foot section of the 
starboard side an area of scraped and twisted metal and gaping 
holes 
in some of the nowopen compartments large twisted beams and 
broken pipe were smashed together 
its amazing said wayne butterfield nassco repair manager 
also touring the tanker was jean michel cousteau executive vice 
president of the cousteau society who was in san diego for an 
underwater film festival 
it is far more than i had believed cousteau said i can 
understand now why there was a real concern about the ship

gov evan bayh has signed another veto 
nixing his own official autograph 
with the stroke of a pen the governor has written off as a loss 
the signature affixed to thousands of documents during the first 
eight months of his administration 
in its place bayh has penned a new signature that shuns modern 
efficiency in favor of oldtime legibility 
i started seeing these documents coming back to me with my 
signature on them and i looked at them and thought to myself boy 
thats not a very good example of penmanship bayh said friday 
so i took the initiative myself and insisted im going to take 
my time and write a nice legible signature rather than this scrawl 
i hurriedly put down before he said 
the governor acknowledged his autograph had consisted of an e 
and an elongated squiggle followed by a b and two loops one 
descending and one ascending 
the new autograph with the full eight letters each more or less 
readable has replaced the old one on the machine used to affix 
bayhs signature to thousands of documents he doesnt have time to 
sign himself 
bayh said a penmanship teacher had written to him suggesting he 
take more care in signing his name and he admitted feeling a little 
sheepish about the reaction from some people he gave autographs 
like a high school graduate at a commencement bayh spoke at this 
spring 
this one young guy was the first up to me and i proceeded to 
give him my quick signature said bayh he looked at it and

lighthouses now they are about a quarter of the way toward their 
goal of photographing every one of an estimated 850 lighthouses 
nationwide many of them in various states of disrepair 
i think its kind of the romance of the sea mrs shanklin 
said 
i think its a symbol of security her husband said 
shanklin gave up a measure of security in putting aside a studio 
and then a commercial photography business to sell photos as art 
for years i shot what everyone wanted me to shoot and i got 
to the point where i couldnt stand to take pictures of people any 
more shanklin said i almost pulled out of photography and 
then decided id start shooting what my heart told me to shoot 
shanklin met his wife a seascape artist at an art show they 
now make a living selling their photographs at shows and to 
publications although they photograph other subjects the 
lighthouses have sold best particularly in this year of the 200th

the cia and pakistani intelligence have bungled 
the war in afghanistan threatening to turn what appeared to be a 
victory by anticommunist guerrillas into a triumph for the 
sovietbacked government there a us congressman charged sunday 
the cia has secretly pursued a wrongheaded afghan policy for 
years the chairman of the republican task force on terrorism and 
unconventional warfare rep bill mccollum of florida charged in a 
2600word article in the editorial section of the washington post 
the most recent blunder he wrote was to shut off the supply of 
us arms while pressuring afghan guerrillas into launching an 
assault on the afghan city of jalalabad near the pakistani border 
at the same time the soviet union continued massive arms 
supplies to its client in kabul enabling that government to 
withstand the assault 
the siege of jalalabad has turned into a stalemate that threatens 
to stall the entire resistance movement 
the key mistake by the central intelligence agency and the state 
department was to give control us arms shipments to the guerrillas 
to pakistans interservice intelligence that nations equivalent 
of the cia mccollum wrote 
why the cia gave isi its proxy was easier to understand in the 
beginning as the united states began to arm the moslem 
guerrillas or mujahedeen after the 1979 soviet invasion mccollum 
wrote 
our intelligence community had little faith in the mujahedeens 
ability to drive out the soviets for a relatively small sum we 
could blacken moscows eye and get our own back for vietnam he 
wrote 
but the policy allowed generals around the late pakistani 
strongman mohammad zia ulhaq to bolster an islamic fundamentalist 
whom mccollum compared to libyan leader moammar gadhafi the policy 
slighted tribal leaders who had greater support in afghanistan 
in 1976 isi recruited gulbadin hekmatyar who was then a 
firebrand fundamentalist student leader at kabul university and 
who now heads hezbiislami one of seven afghan resistance parties 
based in peshawar pakistan the congressman wrote 
hekmatyar was censured by the leaders of the six other parties 
this summer after guerrillas under his control ambushed and killed 
32 lieutenants of the leading afghan resistance fighter ahmed shah 
massoud who belongs to another party 
that highly publicized action fit a pattern mccollum said 
rather than establishing direct ties to the afghan resistance 
the cia channelled the aid through pakistani intelligence which in 
turn handed over the lions share to hekmatyar mccollum wrote 
after the soviet invasion as millions of afghan families took 
refuge in pakistan and their men took up arms hekmatyars party 
received the majority of weapons money and other support from 
pakistans interservice intelligence mccollum wrote 
and for the next nine years roughly half of all weapons 
provided by america europe or the saudi government went to 
hekmatyar he said 
compared to more effective afghan resistance leaders such as 
massoud hekmatyar has attracted a very small group of competent 
commanders and a somewhat larger collection of rural bandits and 
wouldbe warlords the congressman wrote 
they are choked with supplies but low on competence and zeal 
apart from raiding other parties he said 
the cia and isi made an additional mistake after the withdrawal 
of soviet forces last february by overruling resistance leaders who 
favored a gradual wearing down of the regime and instead ordered an 
assault on jalalabad 
the siege of jalalabad has resulted in a stalemate in large part 
because cia tacticians were so certain they were right that they 
turned off the arms supply for the last eight months virtually 
nothing has reached the mujahedeen the congressman wrote

the senate takes an initial step this week 
toward fashioning a military spending bill in the first test of 
president bushs defense program since the august recess 
the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense votes tuesday 
on the presidents package that stresses bigticket strategic items 
such as star wars the b2 stealth bomber and the mx and midgetman 
nuclear missiles 
last month the full senate largely endorsed the presidents plan 
in passing a 305 billion defense authorization bill 295 billion 
for the pentagon and 10 billion for the department of energy the 
appropriations subcommittee is expected to do the same 
the senate version of the authorization bill trimmed the 
presidents 49 billion fiscal 1990 request for the star wars 
antimissile shield by 400 million and made a modest cut of 300 
million in the 47 billion earmarked for the b2 bomber 
the senate also left intact bushs request of 11 billion for 
the railgarrison multiplewarhead mx and 100 million for the 
singlewarhead midgetman 
while the appropriations subcommittee crafts its blueprint the 
house is expected to select its conferees who will thrash out a 
defense authorization bill with the senate 
the house version of authorization legislation pretty well 
shredded george bushs strategic programs armed services chairman 
les aspin dwis said after the chamber vote 
the house bill slashed 18 billion from the presidents star 
wars request limited production of the b2 bomber the batwinged 
aircraft designed to evade soviet radar cut 502 million from the 
mx budget and eliminated all funds for the midgetman 
the house restored money for conventional programs bush sought to 
kill including the navys f14d jet fighter and the marine corps 
v22 osprey the verticaltakeoff plane 
the house later approved a spending bill that largely mirrors 
what the authorization plan does the appropriations bill also 
slashed 2 billion from classified programs that include the 
advanced tactical fighter and the advanced cruise missile 
in other congressional action this week 
the full senate on tuesday considers bushs choice of donald p 
gregg as ambassador to south korea a nomination dogged by charges 
gregg lied about playing a role in the irancontra affair gregg has 
repeatedly denied under oath that he was involved in oliver norths 
secret operation to resupply the nicaraguan rebels while serving as 
national security adviser to thenvice president george bush three 
democrats on the senate foreign relations committee joined nine 
republicans in recommending approval the panels vote was 127 to 
send the nomination to the senate floor 
the senate takes up an 119 billion transportation spending 
bill for fiscal 1990 that includes a provision permanently 
prohibiting cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights the 
current ban on smoking aboard flights lasting two hours or less is 
scheduled to expire in april 
the house on tuesday considers a statute to ban flag burning in 
response to the supreme court ruling this spring that said the 
practice was constitutional that decision raised the ire of 
lawmakers and the bush administration which has pushed for a 
constitutional amendment rather than a statute 
disputes are expected this week as the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee on tuesday takes up bushs plan to rid 
cities of smog control poisonous chemicals and stop acid rain 
issues expected to cause disagreement include antipollution 
requirements for cars who foots the bill for acid rain cleanup and 
how thoroughly the government should clamp down on toxic substances 
in a speech thursday bush said the house bill is totally 
unacceptable and contains unneeded programs costing nearly 20 
billion from 1990 to 1994 holding our defense budget hostage to 
projects that will strip money from programs crucial to strategic 
modernization 
in light of the major disparity between the house and senate 
bills and the presidents complaints a conference bill is not 
expected to be hammered out until after oct 1 the start of the 
fiscal year 
lawmakers and congressional aides have indicated that after a 
contentious session the tenuous mxmidgetman missile compromise 
will likely survive while the spending level for star wars may be 
around 35 billion less than the 4 billion spent on the program 
in fiscal 1989 
there were few predictions on the eventual fate of the b2 bomber 
both the house and the senate restored money for the v22 osprey 
despite bushs cancellation plans a healthy harbinger for the 
tiltrotor aircraft the f14d however faces an uphill fight 
the senate endorsed the presidents decision to kill the carrier 
aircraft manufactured by grumman aerospace corp of new york the 
house earmarked 1 billion for 24 planes over the next two years 
the f14ds cause may have been helped by recent reports of 
problems for the advanced tactical fighter which is considered the 
late 1990s replacement for the f14d and the air forces f15 
last week during a confirmation hearing sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee questioned the 
sixmonth slip in the atf and why some air force programs are having 
difficulty in the latter stages of development

the showdown over logging of the ancient 
forests of the northwest could come as early as this week when house 
and senate negotiators consider legislation imposing an uneasy truce 
in the bitter battle between environmentalists and the timber 
industry 
both sides have mounted intense lobbying campaigns aimed at the 
20 or so lawmakers who will consider the interior appropriations 
bill for the coming fiscal year 
attached to the senatepassed version of the spending bill is an 
amendment offered by sens mark hatfield rore and brock adams 
dwash that has outraged environmentalists and has the reluctant 
support of the industry 
national environmental groups have made defeat of the amendment 
one of their top legislative priorities this year and 
conservationists from around the country have been prowling the 
halls of congress over the past week buttonholing members and their 
top aides 
two loaded logging trucks from the northwest will roll onto 
capitol hill on monday for an industrysponsored rally more than 
150 people including loggers and millworkers from 22 oregon and 
washington communities will spearhead the industry lobbying drive 
this week 
at stake is the future of the cathedrallike forests on federal 
lands in washington state oregon and northern california the 
stands of oldgrowth trees some up to 1000 years old provide 
prime habitat for the northern spotted owl and timber for mills that 
serve as the sole source of income for residents of dozens of small 
communities 
the hatfieldadams rider will kill spotted owls as sure as a 
drunken logger with a shotgun said andy kerr conservation 
director of the oregon natural resources council 
mark rey executive director of the newlyformed american forest 
resource alliance said the fate of small independent timber 
operations was on the line and if environmentalists have their way 
the forests will be closed to logging creating an economic 
catastrophe for the onemill towns 
we are on record supporting the legislation reluctantly and we 
hope it passes said rey adding the that the amendment provided 
only a shortterm fix and that the battle will continue as the fish 
and wildlife service decides whether to list the owl as a threatened 
species 
environmentalists are especially incensed over provisions in the 
amendment they say would limit their access to the federal courts 
where they have won a string of legal victories including 
injunctions that at one point tied up almost half the timber sales 
planned in the federal forests this year 
the legislation would bar federal courts from enjoining or 
overturning any timber sales planned in the federal forests of the 
northwest over the next 11 months known to contain spotted owls 
in addition the legislation would require that environmentalists 
release more than half of the timber currently enjoined from sale 
if the environmentalists do not agree to release the timber the 
forest service and the bureau of land management would be allowed to 
proceed with the sales despite the injunctions 
the legislation would also allow for the sale of 10 billion board 
feet of timber through the end of fiscal 1990 and the protection of 
blocks of significant stands of old growth through a policy 
known as minimum fragmentation 
the entire northwest congressional delegation supports the 
legislation but there is formidable opposition elsewhere

in the philippines are targets of an assassination plot hatched by 
supporters of president corazon aquino and the us government 
army headquarters in manila said soldiers and civilian militiamen

rebel leader antonio zumel spokesman of the communist national 
democratic front claimed an alleged assassination plot would be put 
into action before the start of official talks between the 
philippine and us governments on the future of american military 
facilities in the philippines 
the plot involves the neutralization and even worse the 
assassination of leading personalities from the ndf and the legal 
movement who are opposed to the us bases zumel said in a 
statement 
the elimination of certain key cadres of the cpps communist 
party of the philippines national urban commission and united front 
commission will then be blamed on the socalled warring factions 
within the cpp and ndf he added

embassy which are closed on sundays 
several groups including the communist underground have pressed 
for the dismantling of six us facilities which they view as an 
infringement on philippine sovereignty 
the future of the bases is to be a major topic during mrs 
aquinos visit to the united states in november the bases lease 
expires in 1991 and any extension must be approved by twothirds of 
the 23member senate where opposition to the facilities is strong

the national weather service is hoping to 
deliver a blizzard of weather news to clients with completion of its 
new satellitebased weatherwire later this year 
the system that channels weather data and forecasts to news media 
and others across the nation is being speeded up by several hundred 
percent reports michael sikorski of the weather service 
indeed the satellite service is already running in many areas 
although sikorski admitted some stumbles have occurred in making the 
changeover from the slowspeed service first established in the 
1960s 
little known to the public the weather wire allows the national 
weather service to send information directly to about 1500 
newspapers news services radio and television stations and public 
safety agencies across the country 
but the teletype networks relatively low speed of about seven 
letters per second results in a cluttered wire with the increasing 
amounts of data being collected and reported 
in addition the rising price of telephone lines had cost agency 
nearly half its clients in recent years officials said 
the new satellite system should reduce the cost to 100115 a 
month per client sikorski said cutting the price of the service to 
as much as onethird of the past level for many subscribers by 
replacing the telephone lines with small satellite dishes 
it also allows faster movement of data with the report speeding 
up to print about 480 letters per second 
satellite service is already available across the 48 contiguous 
states and is now being extended to alaska and hawaii said sikorski 
problems have occurred in some areas he confirmed because of 
delays in delivery of satellite receiving equipment to subscribers 
in oklahoma for example a contract for wiredelivery of the 
service expired in july before all subscribers had satellite dishes 
installed sikorski said he said service should be restored within 
two weeks to affected subscribers in that state 
in addition said sikorski the new systems high speed will 
allow subscribers access to weather data from across the nation the 
older wire provided data for the state and area of a subscriber but 
not the national detail that will now be available 
in general each state has one forecast office responsible for 
issuing reports and warnings and developing forecasts for that 
state he said that information is then sent to a satellite and 
comes back down to clients subscribing to the service 
subscribers will have a terminal allowing them to read all of the 
state and national reports or to code out the ones they do not 
want explained sikorski thus he said each subscriber will select 
its own service 
contel asc of mclean va is the contractor operating the new 
system for the weather service which is part of the commerce 
department contels contract to operate the wire is valued at 12 
million over a decade 
the weather service offices will continue to have a separate 
satellite data system for internal service within the agency that 
is known as afos which stands for automated field operations and 
services 
before establishment of the weather wire a quartercentury or so 
ago the weather service distributed its information on local 
telegraphic systems in metropolitan areas or simply via telephone 
or telegraph to interested persons and news media 
it also provides information directly to the public via noaa 
weather radio a network of lowpower radio stations blanketing most 
of the nation that deliver local forecasts and warnings to listeners 
with special radio receivers

god knows how they behave in the dead of night in our townships when 
there is nobody to protect our people said rev allan boesak 
leader of the world alliance of reformed churches 
evette otto a teenager who was five months pregnant when she 
was killed wednesday in kalksteenfontein township was buried sunday

into a numbers game since law and order minister adriaan vlok 
called boesak and anglican archbishop desmond tutu liars for their 
death toll reports the clergymen have called for vlok to be fired 
zach de beer a leader of the antiapartheid democratic party 
was quoted sunday as saying it is clear we are dealing with human

the parliament of iran on sunday condemned 
nearly 190 us congressmen for endorsing iranian resistance groups 
and declared their moves will unleash unspecified consequences 
official tehran radio quoted parliament speaker mahdi karrubi as 
saying that us leaders will take the wish of overthrowing the 
islamic republic to their graves 
the us lawmakers requested that the united states support 
iranian resistance groups

failure to realize the depth and dignity of the islamic 
revolution the radio reported

270member majlis which released a statement telling the us 
leadership that the responsibility for the consequences of such 
acts lie with the signatories to this letter said the report

rafsanjani reiterated irans support for the moslem people of 
lebanon especially hezbollah 
however there were no details about the meeting 
rafsanjani 55 is seen as the leader of a pragmatic camp within 
the iranian leadership whose first priority is to rebuild irans 
economy devastated in its eightyear war with iraq both side

gateways into the besieged christian region north of beirut sunday 
and christian gen michel aoun charged the united states is allowing 
syria to annex lebanon 
police said four people were killed and 17 wounded in overnight 
artillery duels and daytime battles on beiruts dividing green line 
and the mountain towns of souk elgharb and ein eltuffaha 
that raised the casualty toll since the current round of 
lebanons 14yearold civil war erupted march 8 to at least 837 
killed and 2491 wounded 
along the lebanese border the israeli army commanders reported 
arab guerrillas shot and fatally wounded an israeli soldier in an 
overnight clash that also left one of the attackers dead 
george habashs syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of 
palestine claimed responsibility for the attack saying israeli 
troops suffered heavy casualties but giving no figures 
police said syrian guns opened up before dawn on ships trying to 
run a sixmonth blockade of the christian enclave apparently 
suspecting the vessels were carring arms and supplies from iraq 
aouns main backer and syrias arab archrival 
aouns gunners responded with 155mm howitzer barrages against 
syrian artillery batteries along the seaside ein mreisseh boulevard 
in moslem west beirut 
syrian and christian forces traded tank and gunfire at souk 
elgharb and ein eltuffaha in the central mountains all day police 
reported 
the two abandoned summer resorts have key road junctions leading 
to the christian region from the central mountains 
police said syrian artillery and rocket batteries in hills above 
ein eltuffaha were pounding the nearby town of bekfaya sunday night 
at a rate of 10 shells a minute 
in beirut the syrians and christians clashed in running gun 
battles behind heavy artillery barrages across the main crossing 
point between the christian enclave and moslem west beirut 
police said several buildings were ablaze as the thunder of 
exploding shells resounded across the city radio stations urged the 
remaining population to seek refuge in basements and bomb shelters 
more than 13 million of beiruts 15 million population have 
fled the capital to safer areas because of the fighting 
beirut newspapers quoted aoun as saying that president bushs 
administration is doing nothing to curb syrias actions in lebanon 
america practices the policy of bowing to syrias influence in 
lebanon and is giving syria the opportunity to annex lebanon 
aoun declared we ask the united states not to support syrias 
occupation of lebanon 
the 54yearold maronite catholic general has vowed to chase out 
of lebanon the 40000 syrian troops deployed in mainly moslem 
sectors since a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate aoun says 
syria has betrayed the mandate by siding with the moslems against 
christians in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
aoun repeatedly has accused the americans of selling out to 
syria christian leaders charge washington is afraid any action 
against syria could harm eight americans held hostage by 
iranianbacked shiite moslem groups 
syria is irans main ally and has pledged to help free the 
americans who are among 16 westerners missing in lebanon 
aoun was quoted as saying america does not have enough courage 
to confront terrorism 
its certain that americans will become the target for 
increased attacks all over the world because the american government 
is making concessions to the terrorists 
aoun described the us embassy in christian east beirut as an 
espionage network but offered to guarantee the security of the 
30 diplomats evacuated from the fortified embassy compound wednesday 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler blamed the 
evacuation on aouns reported threats to take 20 americans hostage 
aoun has denied the allegations and called on washington to send 
back its diplomats it is the first time the americans have closed 
their beirut embassy since the civil war erupted 
the clash on the border with israel is the third in 10 days 
pitting guerrillas from lebanon against israeli forces or their 
lebanese christian militia allies 
israel radio said the firefight involved its elite givati brigade 
and occurred a mile inside lebanon near the golan heights which 
israel captured from syria and annexed 
israeli maj gen yossi peled said the guerrillas were laying 
explosives when they were spotted by a routine patrol the 
guerrillas then opened fire he said

a former nurses aide is slated to go 
on trial monday on charges she suffocated five female nursing home 
patients in a bizarre pact with her lesbian lover 
gwendolyn graham 25 is charged with five counts of murder and 
one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths at the alpine 
manor nursing home in walker a grand rapids suburb during the 
first half of 1987 
the defense argues that no killings ever occurred 
the trial before kent county chief circuit judge roman snow was 
to begin with jury selection however both the prosecution and 
defense are seeking a change in the location of the trial because of 
late publicity about the case 
on thursday grahams alleged accomplice and former livein 
companion former nurses aide catherine wood pleaded guilty to one 
count each of seconddegree murder and conspiracy to commit murder 
two counts of firstdegree murder against wood were dropped in 
exchange for her testimony against graham 
wood 27 who could be sentenced to life in prison said during 
the hearing that she and graham discussed killing up to 20 patients 
during their overnight shifts at the nursing home 
wood testified in april that graham chose victims whose poor 
physical condition would leave no signs of a struggle and that 
graham used a washcloth to suffocate them 
the grand rapids woman said graham told her killing the patients 
helped her relieve tension wood said she agreed to go along with 
the slayings sometimes acting as a lookout because she it would 
bind them as lovers 
she was always happy when one of them died wood testified 
adding that graham tried or plotted to kill at least five other 
patients but was foiled when some fought back 
wood said graham took a souvenir from each victim including 
earrings and handkerchiefs and that the two had planned to spell 
murder with the victims initials the plan failed because some 
targeted victims struggled too much she testified she said the 
souvenirs apparently were thrown away 
grahams attorney james piazza said he believes wood is a 
pathological liar and made up the story to get even with graham for 
leaving her for another woman graham left michigan for her hometown 
of tyler texas after the two split up in july 1987 
police began investigating late last year after woods exhusband 
told them she had confessed 
the deaths of the five patients 60 to 97 years old between jan 
18 and april 7 1987 were originally listed as natural and no 
autopsies were performed 
three of the alleged victims were cremated the two other bodies 
were exhumed but autopsies revealed no evidence of suffocation

after he outlined a plan to revise tax wage and trade policies 
asked later on national television whether poles could expect to 
live better under the new solidarityled government balcerowicz 
replied there is a real chance 
he said howeverour economic point of departure is extremely 
difficult therefore i feel that no responsible person should be 
going around making easy promises 
the labor ministry nominee jacek kuron also was approved in a 
daylong session of the welfare committee but andrzej kosiniak the 
peasant party candidate for the health ministry was rejected 
two other nominees for farm policy and rural affairs ministries 
failed to win approval during a first day of hearings on friday 
but the committees opinion is not binding the sejm the 
powerful lower house of parliament makes the final decision 
hearings on nominees for the foreign trade ministry and chairman 
of the national bank were scheduled for monday television news said 
the cabinet proposed by prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the 
east blocs first noncommunist leader in more than four decades 
gives half of the 24 council seats to solidarity 
the communists have just four although the party keeps the 
strategic ministries of defense and the interior 
the remaining seats are distributed among the peasants and the 
democratic party which helped put mazowiecki a top aide to 
solidarity leader lech walesa in office by breaking their 
traditional alliance with the communists 
parliament is to vote on the new government tuesday when 
mazowiecki is expected to outline his governments program 
the solidarity government faces tripledigit inflation a 39 
billion debt and workers demoralized by long lines and poor quality 
goods 
the economic program outlined by balcerowicz calls for 
restructuring the tax system implementing wage controls 
liberalizing foreign trade rules and unifying the exchange rates

communist party after the military crackdown on the solidarity trade 
union in december 1981 he said he now belongs to the warsaw chapter 
of the solidarity citizens committee

government and won a sweeping victory in june parliamentary 
elections taking 161 seats in the 460seat sejm and 99 seats in the 
new 100seat senate 
kuron a veteran opposition activist told the committee wages 
should be set by the market but that a minimum wage should be set 
to protect workers he said however the first task of the new 
government was to stop inflation which is thought to have reached 
40 percent in august alone 
he said the transition to a market economy and measures to 
control inflation could lead to a drop in purchasing power but that 
the government would not abandon the disadvantaged 
economic journalist aleksander paszynski the solidarity 
candidate for the building ministry was approved by the local 
government committee

one of three civil rights workers killed in 
1964 was spied on three months before his death by a state 
commission formed to maintain segregation a newspaper reported 
sunday 
the mississippi sovereignty commission in march 1964 received a 
report on the activities of michael schwerner and his wife rita in 
meridian said the clarionledger which obtained commission 
documents 
the commission circulated a description and the license number of 
a vehicle used by the schwerners and other congress of racial 
equality workers the newspaper said 
schwerner andrew goodman and james chaney were killed june 21 
1964 near philadelphia miss their deaths and the subsquent 
federal investigation were the basis for the film mississippi 
burning 
the three who were reported missing were found buried in an 
earthen dam on aug 4 1964 
the state never prosecuted the case but a federal court 
convicted seven ku klux klan members of conspiring to deprive the 
three of their civil rights another klan member pleaded guilty 
eight were acquitted and the cases against three ended in a 
mistrial most of the 19 men prosecuted are alive 
state attorney general mike moore has asked the fbi to help him 
research the case to determine whether to bring state charges now 
schwerners widow seattle attorney rita schwerner bender said 
she was unaware of the surveillance i didnt know they were 
spying on me she said 
there was clearly a governmental investigation in an effort to 
discredit the civil rights workers and participation in the 
movement bender said now it would appear that there was 
organized mississippi state governmental misconduct 
the surveillance may have encouraged the slayings university of 
mississippi history professor david sansing said in oxford 
those murders could have been prevented sansing said 
instead of being prevented the power structure was in a way 
encouraging them by this surveillance 
they may not have said go kill them but they sure made it 
easy he said 
former commission director erle johnston of forest said the 
agency spied on the schwerners but denied it had any connection with 
the slayings 
we had no knowledge of what happened johnston said we 
didnt have any involvement 
the role of the commission in the murders was just making 
reports he said we had no part in the arrests or prosecution 
we put down what we saw 
the commission was created by the 1956 legislature to help 
preserve segregation it went out of business in 1973 after gov 
bill waller vetoed funding 
the main body of the commissions records remains sealed in a 
state department of archives and history vault in jackson on orders 
of the 1977 legislature us district judge william h barbour jr 
ruled july 27 that those records should be made public but they 
remain sealed pending appeals

a woman is suing the man convicted of 
sexually attacking her demanding the 586 million he won last year 
in the california lottery 
raymond wilson 20 a fastfood worker from los angeles has 
admitted he attacked becky rasnick 28 while she jogged near her 
home on jan 21 police arrested him at his santa monica apartment 
on feb 10 
wilson pleaded guilty to attempted rape on june 12 but insists 
he never meant to rape or harm mrs rasnick on aug 10 ventura 
superior court judge charles mcgrath sentenced him to five years 
probation although the prosecutor had asked for up to six years in 
prison 
mcgrath ordered wilson to get therapy as a condition of 
probation to register with the state as a sex offender and to serve 
one year in jail 
mrs rasnick and her husband ben were outraged by the short 
sentence especially after wilson used the proceeds from the lottery 
he won last oct 12 to hire an expensive defense attorney and 
psychologist 
the rasnicks are seeking 234400 a year from wilsons winnings 
they say they would use most of the money to fight abortion and 
pornography 
a smaller amount would be used to pay for mrs rasnicks 
continuing therapy and reimburse her lost earnings as a church 
teacher the couple said 
a victory for the rasnicks would devastate wilson said his 
lawyer james farley of ventura 
it could totally wipe out everything ray has leaving him 
broke and unable to pay for the therapy he needs he said 
according to court records wilson was sexually abused by a male 
baby sitter when he was 4 or 5 years old and has been obsessed with 
sex since 
i feel sorry for them both farley said of rasnick and 
wilson they both have their burdens to tote around

britain on sunday deported an iranian who spent 
nine years in a british prison for participating in a bombing 
attempt the government said 
kourosh fouladi a former doorman at the iranian embassy in 
london was arrested in 1980 after a bungled car bombing attempt he 
was convicted in 1982 and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
on sunday he was taken to heathrow airport and put on a flight 
to tehran the home office said 
in tehran officials said britains release of fouladi was linked 
to the plight of british businessman roger cooper who was accused 
of spying in iran where he has been imprisoned without trial since 
1985 
but a foreign office spokesman said in no way is this linked 
he is simply being released because with remission he has served 
his time 
if the iranians plan to let roger cooper go that would be 
extremely welcome but there is no indication that they have such 
plans 
in response to a previous iranian statement linking the two 
cases foreign office minister william waldegrave said in april 
there was no provision in british law for exchanging fouladi for 
cooper

maverick soviet politician boris n yeltsin said 
sunday that his country faces continuing economic and social decline 
and can learn from american democracy while changing its political 
system 
were having an economic crisis a financial crisis a 
political crisis the living standard is falling yeltsin said at 
a news conference sunday 
yeltsin arrived saturday to begin his first visit to the united 
states a twoweek tour that includes stops throughout the country 
we have to take what is positive from soviet experience and 
what has been positive in the experience of the other socialist 
countries positive from americas more than 200 years of democratic 
experience and on the basis of that create a new model of 
socialism yeltsin said earlier through a translator on cbs news 
face the nation 
we do need a new model of socialism yes he said we have 
to stop being so dogmatic as we were before 
the whole society is in a crisis and such extraordinary 
measures of an economic or financial nature are obviously necessary 
since the standard recently not only has not risen but has actually 
fallen he said 
yeltsin 58 lost his position as moscows communist party chief 
in 1987 after criticizing the slow pace of change under soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev but this year he was overwhelmingly 
elected to the soviet congress where he is an outspoken member of a 
radical bloc 
gorbachev he said missed some opportunities to accelerate 
perestroika or political and economic restructuring 
naturally there has started a movement from below in the form 
of strikes indicating dissatisfation with the national leadership 
including with mr gorbachev yeltsin said during the television 
program 
if the situation gets worse and i think it is going to his 
popularity and authority will doubtless continue to decline 
however yeltsin said he believes gorbachev did a lot about the 
democratization of the country and that he will indeed retain 
his position as leader 
he added i would like him to remain the leader of the country 
and i think thats the way its going to be for the time being 
he also said he does not reject the idea of creating a new 
multiparty system in the soviet union 
but this question has got to be discussed by the population 
first and when the public opinion has matured to that point then 
we can decide that issue 
through an intermediary yeltsin sent word earlier this year to 
the leigh bureau a speakers agency based in princeton nj that 
he was interested in coming to the united states he has said he 
will donate his fees to a soviet fund to fight aids 
appearances have already been announced in new york 
philadelphia chicago indianapolis minneapolis baltimore dallas 
miami and washington although final details of the schedule were 
not set 
yeltsin said he circled the statue of liberty in a helicopter 
earlier sunday and he felt twice as free as before he said his 
first 24 hours in the united states had changed his idea of america 
americans are in no way aggressive or badly behaved in fact 
they are very polite and optimistic lively wellintentioned and 
know how to live and know how to work he said 
yeltsin who said he hopes to meet with president bush during his 
trip says he would like to discuss with the president how the 
united states could participate in measures to rescue 
perestroika 
but he said he has received no indication from the white house 
about the possibility of such a meeting

police escorted nonunion 
construction workers back to work at a paper mill sunday as 
residents prayed for an end to the turmoil that erupted into a 
violent labor protest 
prounion protesters saturday stormed a housing camp for 
nonunion workers at the boise cascade paper mill in this town of 
6500 residents on the canadian border setting trailers on fire and 
overturning vehicles 
about 45 law enforcement officers used tear gas to disperse the 
crowd estimated at 400 five people were injured and 32 people were 
arrested authorities said boise spokesman andrew drysdale 
estimated damage at 13 million 
yesterday was a sad day for us in international falls the 
rev robert a kitchen told his congregation at the faith united 
church of christ it was a day of desperation of anger of 
hopelessness perhaps 
kitchen describing the labor unrest as an open wound that we 
know has ripped our community apart prayed that the community 
pull together and denounce the violence 
about 370 nonunion workers riding buses escorted by police 
returned to the plant sunday morning to work on a 535 million 
expansion project drysdale said crews had been told not to report 
to work saturday following the protest 
the violence stemmed from boise cascades decision to hire 
nonunion general contractor beampk of birmingham ala to expand its 
international falls mill a move that sparked a wildcat strike by 
union members in july 
union officials have not sanctioned the strike and say they have 
tried to dissuade protesters from violence or mass demonstrations 
we had planned a rally here on the state capitol steps next 
saturday and urged them to come to that rally bill peterson 
head of the minnesota building trades council said in st paul 
my attempts were to stop any other rally we think any rally at 
international falls ought not be held because we were sure that 
tensions running as high as they were there could be some 
problems peterson said 
drysdale said union workers should not blame beampk and its 
subcontractors for being out of work 
eighteen of the first 20 contracts on this project went to 
union contractors drysdale said sunday but they wanted it all 
we gave them a tremendous amount of work on this project 
this is not a case of us excluding the unions we tried to 
include them 
iron range building trades council president brad skarich of 
virginia minn could not be reached for comment on drysdales 
statements he did not immediately return messages left on an 
answering machine 
the 32 people arrested were being held at the koochiching county 
jail pending court appearances this week on charges of criminal 
damage to property and contempt of court 
law enforcement officers remained on alert saturday night in case 
of renewed violence but none was reported said sheriff william 
elliott 
gov rudy perpich acting on a request by local law enforcement 
officials put national guardsmen on alert but did not send them 
into the city perpich took the guard off alert status sunday 
afternoon 
elliott and boise cascade officials had been critical of the 
decision not to send national guardsmen to international falls 
because of its remote location elliott said it could be difficult 
to get adequate help from other law enforcement agencies 
perpich and state law enforcement officials sunday said there 
reports of possible trouble but perpich said the state could not 
send in the guard simply in anticipation of trouble he said there 
was no reason to send the troops after the violence had ended 
the governor said evidence including videotapes made by state 
bureau of criminal apprehension agents would be sent to the us 
attorneys office for possible federal charges

former president ford criticized the bush 
administration for omitting alcohol abuse from its antidrug 
campaign and attacked the reagan years for continuing the nations 
serious economic woes 
i basically endorse president bushs drug strategy ford said 
saturday while speaking to the 19th annual vail symposium 
however the former president called alcohol abuse more damaging 
to society than cocaine and other drugs 
ford said four times more people were killed in 1987 in 
alcoholrelated traffic accidents than accidents involving drugs he 
said alcohol abuse had cost society 120 billion compared with 60 
billion from drug abuse 
the bush administrations campaign against drugs focuses on 
antidrug education for youth but the drug problem is an equally 
serious challenge among adults ford said 
former first lady betty ford several years ago underwent 
treatment for alcoholism and addiction to prescription drugs 
ford who owns a home in vail also lambasted the reagan 
administration and congress for failing to adequately reduce the 
federal budget 
over the last seven or eight years both the white house and 
congress have done a very inadequate job of managing the budget 
ford said 
he called inexcusable the annual 180 billion budget deficit 
during the reagan administration years and he termed 
unacceptable the current projected deficit of 110 billion to 
150 billion

the scandal swirling around some generic drug 
companies is forcing the industry to regroup and is refueling a 
longrunning rivalry between makers who emphasize brandname 
medicines and their competitors who sell only lowerpriced clones 
disclosures of fraud and corruption within the industry and at 
the food and drug administration and admissions that brandname 
products were substituted for generic drugs in sampling tests have 
shaken confidence within the industry 
we have to rebuild confidence in generic drugs said jay 
molishever a spokesman for the generic pharmaceutical industry 
association a trade group representing generic drug makers 
generics are used to fill about a third of all prescriptions 
the largest of the generic drug makers under scrutiny bolar 
pharmaceuticals of copiague ny has begun a public relations 
drive in the wake of the fdas move to take the companys generic 
version of the widely prescribed highbloodpressure drug dyazide 
off the market 
the company has hired a public relations firm and is sending 
letters to physicians pharmacists and customers trying to bolster 
confidence in its product said a company official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
the fda has said that while it does not consider bolars drug to 
be unsafe it questions whether the drug was manufactured under 
specifications approved by the agency 
in a mailing to physicians earlier this month bolar said the 
generic drug industry has become the victim of irresponsible and 
unsubstantiated charges 
bolar employees also stepped into the fray taking out a 
fullpage advertisement in the new york times and another in newsday 
earlier this month to defend the companys management as 
reputable honest and caring 
the employees also said they were outraged at us rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee that has been investigating the generic drug industry 
for creating a climate of fear and distrust within the industry 
because of the fraudulent deeds of a few 
analysts said last week it was too early to tell whether bolars 
sales have been affected by the fdas action against its 
largestselling drug analysts say bolars generic dyazide accounts 
for more than half of the companys earnings 
bolars drug is the only generic version left on the market since 
vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield gardens ny withdrew 
its generic dyzaide from the market after admitting it had 
substituted the brandname drug for its own in tests to win fda 
approval 
kaiser permanente the oakland califbased healthmaintenance 
organization has pulled bolars drug from its pharmacy shelves 
however the major drugstore chains including the american 
association of retired persons pharmacies are continuing to supply 
the product said hemant k shah a warren nj analyst who 
follows the generic drug industry 
brandname companies have long questioned whether generic drugs 
work as well as the namebrand products but as generics gained 
public acceptance and began taking a greater share of the business 
from the brandname market many of these companies have gotten into 
the generic business themselves often making generic versions of 
their own products after the patents expire 
meanwhile smithkline beecham which makes dyazide is doing its 
own public relations with a letter to physicians and pharmacists 
informing them of the developments in the generic drug investigation 
and reminding them that their brandname product was not affected 
the investigation certainly reaffirms the necessity for 
dispensing your dyazide prescriptions with the branded product 
the letter said 
this was to clarify confusion said jeremy heymsfeld a 
spokesman for smithkline

after living through romance and reality falling 
in love and then making it work 773 couples gathered sunday to 
celebrate 50 years of wedded bliss at holy name roman catholic 
cathedral 
the theme was the more the merrier as about 2000 children 
grandchildren and greatgrandchildren packed into the nearby 
cathedral school auditorium to watch the mass celebrated by cardinal 
joseph bernardin via closedcircuit television 
sometimes you feel like it isnt worth it sure said samuel 
smith of the citys south side who will be married for 50 years in 
november but you say youre together for better or worse and deal 
with it 
marsha ross a volunteer for marriage encounters for family 
ministries said the ceremony had special significance for the 
couples 
for the cardinal to be the main celebrant is an extremely 
powerful moment for most of these couples she said 
but the main focus of the mass celebrated for the past 12 years 
was to balance some of the negative press about marriage and 
divorce ms ross added 
this balances that with a real vision of the commitment that 
you see 773 times 50 years represents ms ross said i mean its 
a very powerful witness to well marriage 
catherine and joseph bergthold from the citys south side were 
married sept 9 1949 and now have 10 children 25 grandchildren 
and seven greatgrandchildren they say the secret to a successful 
marriage is to concentrate on family togetherness and working 
together to solve problems 
it certainly keeps you together mrs bergthold said the 
key is to get mad with each other and get over it 
florence and charlie lesperance married on june 24 more than 50 
years ago say their advice for future and present marriages is 
having a giveandtake relationship 
you just have to go 5050 mrs lesperance said you win 
and he wins you give in once in a while and he gives in once in a 
while 
jill and bruno wicker seemed to sum up their feelings for many 
couples 
i hope the next 50 are as nice as the first 50 mrs wicker

retail gasoline prices dropped 137 cents 
nationwide over the past two weeks but wholesale prices rose 
slightly signaling a possible pump price increase this fall an 
industry analyst said sunday 
the average retail price for all gasoline grades at full and 
selfservice pumps was 10907 cents per gallon for the aug 25sept 
9 period said trilby lundberg director of the lundberg survey of 
12000 gasoline stations 
wholesale prices rose by 33 cents as wholesalers inventories 
stockpiled after springs valdez oil spill returned closer to 
normal levels ms lundberg said 
intense competition has dissuaded retailers from passing along 
the price increase to consumers but that could change ms lundberg 
said 
it now appears that gasoline retailers operating margins are 
being squeezed and that more of them may soon pass along the 
increases in the way of higher street prices she said 
the average retail gasoline price has dropped 933 cents since it 
peaked may 19 ms lundberg said 
over the twoweek period ending sept 8 the average price of a 
gallon of gasoline at a selfservice pump dropped from 9942 cents

a jewish leader on sunday criticized pope john paul 
iis attitudes toward judaism and israel and urged jewish people 
worldwide to press ecumenical efforts on lower levels of the roman 
catholic church 
tullia zevi president of the union of italian jewish 
communities said the best progress in jewishcatholic relations 
could be made with the national bishops conferences 
they have autonomy to work within their own countries and in 
many nations they are often one step ahead of the vatican she 
told a meeting of the european jewish congress 
the congress met in london as a dispute brews between the 
international jewish community and the roman catholic church over a 
convent built at the auschwitz concentration camp in poland at 
least 25 million jews died there during world war ii 
a 1987 accord between jewish and catholic representatives 
stipulated the convent should be moved by feb 22 but the deadline 
passed and the convent remained the polish primate cardinal jozef 
glemp has termed the accord offensive 
the polishborn pope has not taken a firm public stand on the 
dispute 
before becoming pope in 1979 john paul was the archbishop of 
krakow in the archdiocese where auschwitz lies 
mrs zevi a signatory of the convent accord said that in recent 
apostolic letters about world war ii the pope spoke harshly of the 
nazi genocide of jews and affirmed that hatred of judaism conflicted 
with christian tenets 
but acknowledgement of horrors of the past and warnings about the 
way the gospel is taught are not reflected in the popes theology 
and politics as far as jews and judaism are concerned she said 
the apostolic letters and the auschwitz convent controversy are 
symptomatic of a pattern aimed to revise the history of the 
holocaust and the role of the church during that terrible period 
mrs zevi said 
he is seeking to christianize the holocaust by means of 
churches and convents in the extermination camps he has proclaimed 
the sainthood of edith stein a jewish nun and continues to keep 
the state of israel in a diplomatic limbo mrs zevi said 
but she said the catholicjewish dialogue that has grown since 
the 196265 second vatican council is more important than any 
individual pope and we must ensure that it continues 
in 1965 the vatican council issued the document nostra 
aetate in our times which officially rescinded the 
accusation that the jews killed christ it is considered a turning 
point in catholicjewish relations

financially conservative retirees still make up 
the biggest block of american telephone amp telegraph co 
shareholders but those who have bought stock since the bell system 
breakup tend to be younger and more interested in growth the 
company says in a new survey 
atampt is the most widely held stock in the nation at 26 million 
shareholders a legacy of the days before 1984 when it was the 
worlds largest company its status as a regulated monopoly made it 
a conservative investment known as the widows and orphans stock 
the 1984 breakup left atampt smaller and more exposed to 
competition but the survey seems to indicate that shareholders have 
not fully caught up with the 5yearold change 
the survey showed that shareholders still place a high priority 
on dividends which have been stuck at 120 a year since the 
breakup the new atampt has been reinvesting profits for future growth 
instead of distributing them as higher dividends 
atampts survey of 1712 shareholders the first since 1983 was 
provided to the associated press for publication monday the survey 
excluded current employees who account for about 5 percent of the 
direct shareowners 
among the findings of the survey which was conducted in may and 
june 
seventy percent of shareholders are 50 or older 37 percent are 
65 are older and 46 percent are retired 
the percentage of shareholders who are younger than 50 is up 
sharply to 28 percent in 1989 from 15 percent in 1983 
shareholders still rate security of the investment as their top 
reason for owning atampt stock as they did in 1983 but growth 
potential has moved up into second place edging out dividend income 
as a priority for shareholders also more shareholders cited profit 
opportunities than did so in 1983 
seventysix percent of shareholders bought their shares before 
the 1984 breakup and 40 percent bought their initial stock when 
they were employees of atampt or the old bell system 
in the 1984 breakup of the bell system atampt shareholders 
received shares in the new atampt as well as in each of the seven 
regional companies that provide local phone service nynex corp 
bell atlantic corp bellsouth corp pacific telesis group u s 
west inc southwestern bell corp and ameritech 
the new atampt provides longdistance service and sells

white house science adviser d allan bromley 
said sunday that the united states needs to develop a supercomputer 
network or face erosion of its historical leadership in the 
field 
bromley made the assessment in releasing a report by the white 
house office of science and technology that proposes a fiveyear 
19 billion program to promote advanced computing capabilities 
including the creation of a fiberoptic network linking the nations 
supercomputers 
highperformance computing is a vital and strategic technology 
exerting strong leverage on the rest of the computer industry and 
other cuttingedge areas said bromley director of ostp 
however he said that in recent years us leadership and 
diversity in the supercomputer industry itself has declined 
dramatically we cannot afford to cede our historical leadership 
in highperformance computing and in its applications 
a future national highspeed computer network could have the 
kind of catalytic effect on our society industries and universities 
that the telephone system has had during the 20th century bromley 
said 
the program envisions establishment of a national research and 
education network which would transmit data between supercomputers 
at speeds up to 3 gigabits 3 billion bits per second or 2000 
times faster than current computer networks 
this tremendous challenge is within the grasp of the united 
states in the next 10 years the report said 
the proposed program also would involve increased federal support 
for research and development work on highperformance computer 
equipment software and training 
federal spending needed to implement the program would grow from 
an estimated 151 million in the first year up to 597 million in 
the fifth year for a total of 1917 billion 
the ostp report noted that it is designed for agencylevel 
planning purposes and does not represent the administrations 
approval or support of any program not included in the presidents 
budget requests 
rep sherwood l boehlert rny ranking republican on the 
house science subcommittee on science research and technology said 
friday he was hopeful that money to launch the program could be 
provided in the fiscal 1991 budget 
its an absolute must he said it shows that were 
concentrating on the future rather than dwelling on the past a key 
test will be how its incorporated into the budget plan its a 
great idea lets provide the funding for it 
boehlert added that i really think president bush is tuned in 
and hes going to be a strong advocate of the highperformance 
computing effort

china is expected to resume 
efforts soon to join the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
gatts directorgeneral said 
arthur dunkel of switzerland said that officials from china 
whose application for gatt membership was temporarily shelved after 
the bloody crackdown on studentled protests in june plan to hold 
discussions with gatt members about reviving talks on membership 
some days from now there will be extensive informal 
consultations in geneva with chinese authorities to see where things 
stand dunkel said in an interview saturday with the associated 
press he declined to elaborate 
a 46member gatt group set up to examine beijings bid put off 
further meetings indefinitely after the crackdown because many 
delegates felt the political turmoil precluded progress on practical 
issues 
china applied in 1986 to join gatt a 96nation marketoriented 
group whose members pledge to bring their policies in line with its 
freetrade rules gatt has its headquarters in geneva 
dunkel said he also expected the soviet union to apply for 
membership at some point as part of its effort to move toward a more 
marketoriented economy 
but this isnt something for tomorrow he said 
he added however that since the current round of gatt world 
trade talks began in 1986 soviet trade authorities have been kept 
informed of the progress of the negotiations 
every change in soviet trade legislation since then has been 
made in such a way that it will facilitate the entry of the ussr 
into gatt dunkel said 
dunkel was interviewed while attending a conference of the swiss 
commodities futures and options association

burke 47 pulled the magazines pieces together gradually in 
1976 he hired a small staff and hid expenses from his family 
business an advertising display company to finance the magazine 
then called mariah after the wind but at the same time another 
adventure magazine was being bankrolled by 2 million in profits 
from rolling stone magazine 
that magazine called outside began to falter with an 
overbudgeted staff and undersold advertising and the two combined 
in 1978 under burke who now controls the magazine 
circulation stands at 300000 compared to about 90000 for 
mariah with annual profits nearing 23 million 
the magazine is familiar to most hardcore outdoors enthusiasts 
but burke wants to make outside a household word among the less 
adventurous too 
he recently hired additional advertising staff and a public 
relations firm to target slightly older more affluent readers 
burkes also developing his idea for a camp outside an adventure 
vacation camp for children and adults 
like a true adventurist burke relishes the heights of the 
challenge before him 
we are undermarketed he said and while that might depress 
some people i look at it as a great opportunity

individual incomes in latin america dropped 
overall last year and will drop further the interamerican 
development bank said sunday in a report that shows regional growth 
at less than 1 percent in 1988 
according to the bank 1988 per capita income was lower in 12 of 
25 latin american countries including three of the most populous 
and heavily indebted mexico brazil and argentina 
the bank did not provide dollar figures in its report but world 
bank statistics for 1987 show that the average argentine earned the 
equivalent of 2370 the average brazilian 2020 and the average 
mexican 1820 
the comparable us income was 18430 in 1987 the most recent 
year for which the world bank figures are available 
the interamerican bank said the 1988 drop was the greatest in 
panama 188 percent followed by nicaragua and peru with 111 
percent each 
the united states has imposed economic sanctions against both 
panama and nicaragua perus problems worsened last year after a 
surge in growth during 1986 and 1987 
in one country bolivia the average income appeared static in 
1988 
the other 12 countries showed increases with the best record in 
chile the world bank put income there at 1310 in 1987 the iadb 
reported an increase of 56 percent last year 
once more it was a very bad year for latin america bank 
president enrique v iglesias said the overall growth was a very 
disappointing figure 
iglesias plans to release the report formally at a news 
conference thursday 
the report said the areas total income grew by 06 percent 
since the population grows much faster over 2 percent a year 
that translated into an average decline of 15 percent for 
individuals 
iglesias said this years total income figure would be worse 
only a little over zero overall that could mean a 2 percent drop 
for the average latin american 
he called the increase of inflation the top negative development 
of 1988 the international monetary fund has reported that prices in 
brazil which accounts for onethird of the areas production rose 
at an annual rate of 854 percent in april compared with a year 
earlier 
the overall upsurge of inflation in 1988 reached 100 percent 
weighted by population iglesias said 
he added that the rise in prices affects the political as well as 
the economic situation 
his bank owned by 44 governments is a major source of loans to 
raise living standards in countries of latin america and the 
caribbean it authorized 116 billion in new lending last year the 
united states is the largest shareholder 
willy van ryckeghem head of the banks country studies division 
said there was encouraging news from the region he said exports 
from latin america last year grew twice as fast as world trade as a 
whole 
he also pointed out that for the first time in recent years there 
was a reduction in the areas foreign debt he attributed that drop 
largely to debtequity swaps in such deals latin american 
debtors who owe debts to foreigners usually foreign banks in 
dollars or other hard currencies are allowed to pay in their own 
currency the creditor then uses the money to buy property or 
business in that country 
the report estimated foreign debt of the 25 countries at 426 
billion in 1988 down from 441 billion the year before
