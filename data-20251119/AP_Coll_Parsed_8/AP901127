iraq will have until jan 15 to withdraw 
its troops from kuwait before it faces the prospect of 
unauthorized military action the soviet un ambassador said 
tuesday 
yes its going to be the 15th ambassador yuli m vorontsov 
replied when asked if there was a consensus among the five 
permanent members of the security council on a resolution 
but wednesday in beijing foreign minister qian qichen said 
china will not vote for the un resolution 
qian however refused to say whether china will veto the 
resolution expected to come to a vote on thursday or abstain 
as one of the permanent members of the un security council 
china has veto power over any resolution it has voted for all 10 
previous resolutions that seek to pressure iraq to end its nearly 
4monthold occupation of kuwait but has said it does not want 
force used 
it has always been the position of china to call for a 
peaceful settlement qian told reporters at the beijing airport 
while preparing to leave for the united states to cast chinas 
vote 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze fixed the deadline in the last 24 
hours said western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
the measure will authorize all necessary means to get iraq 
out of kuwait after that deadline the date after which a military 
strike could begin had been the only unresolved issue in the draft 
measure 
the united states had already secured agreement on the overall 
measure from the soviets french british and it was thought 
the chinese the draft resolution has more than enough pledges of 
positive votes to pass when it comes before the full council 
most security council members are expected to be represented by 
their foreign ministers at thursdays meeting with baker 
presiding 
a resolution requires at least nine votes to pass so long as 
none of the permanent members vetoes it 
the measure is supported by at least six of the nonpermanent 
council members canada finland romania ivory coast zaire 
ethiopia 
initially the united states had pressed for a jan 1 deadline 
but the soviets wanted it set at jan 31 to allow more time for 
diplomatic maneuvers 
us reinforcements on their way to the persian gulf will not be 
ready for a military strike before late january or february in any 
case diplomats said 
the measure would call on iraq to release all foreign hostages 
withdraw its troops and restore kuwaits government by jan 15 
if iraq fails to comply it would authorize member states 
cooperating with the government of kuwait to use all necessary 
means to uphold and implement the security council resolutions 
passed in response to iraqs invasion and occupation of kuwait and 
to restore international peace and security 
the resolution cites chapter 7 of the un charter which 
authorizes the use of military force to counter aggression if 
sanctions and other steps fail 
the only other time military force was sanctioned by the united 
nations to counter aggression was in 1950 during the korean 
conflict 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon said his country could not 
support it yemen the councils only arab member is believed 
likely to abstain or vote against it 
malaysia and colombias votes are uncertain colombias foreign 
minister said tuesday his government was still undecided

the campaign season for local government offices 
in beijing opened with plenty of hoopla the city communist party 
chief shook hands at the main department store 
a brass band played vans with loudspeakers cruised city streets 
and the official xinhua news agency reported volunteers gave out 
1 million pamphlets 
only the candidates were missing 
they are chosen weeks later but there is no suspense for 
voters only members or supporters of the ruling party are 
nominated incumbents who supported last years prodemocracy 
movement already have been purged 
its like taking part in a play performed for the 
communist party a woman voter said on condition of anonymity 
we dont put much value on our voting rights 
for the communists the elections are a deadly serious play the 
basis of their claim to be the peoples choice 
all other officials are appointed in some fashion so chinas 
assertion of democracy rests entirely upon popular elections held 
every three years for the lowestlevel representative bodies 
district peoples congresses in urban areas and county peoples 
congresses in the countryside 
the congresses make no laws and function mainly as conduits for 
passing citizen complaints and ideas to higher levels beijing has 
18 such congresses with a total of 17000 delegates 
other parts of the country held elections in the spring but 
balloting in beijing was delayed until dec 26 the reason given 
was that everyone was too busy getting ready for the asian games 
held in september 
officials also may have wanted to keep the elections from 
coinciding with the anniversary of beijings massive prodemocracy 
demonstrations which the army crushed in june 1989 among other 
things the marchers wanted more say in picking government 
officials 
voters say they have little part even in choosing the local 
congresses god knows how the candidates are chosen the woman 
said 
after the single burst of citywide publicity that opened the 
election season in late october preparations reverted to 
closeddoor committees that take nominations from such official 
groups as the communist youth league and allchina womens 
association 
a group of at least 10 voters can put a candidate forward but 
few do the candidate would be unable to organize publicity 
activities and would have little chance of success 
the law allows two candidates for each seat but voters say 
there usually is just one 
because there are no competing parties television ads or 
debates campaigns are placid events it is not mandatory to vote 
but failure to do so is frowned upon and would be noticed 
chinese officials insist the system is more democratic than 
multiparty elections in the west which they say keeps power in the 
hands of the rich 
our election rights may not be the same as in the west but 
equality is a basic principle xu jingyu chairman of the 
election commission in beijings chaoyang district said in an 
interview 
he acknowleged not everyone can run for office only those with 
correct ideological views but said this was in keeping with the 
constitution 
delegates have to be able to represent the views of the 
masses he said how can someone who opposes the partys four 
basic principles do that 
the emphasis on ideological correctness is especially strong 
this year in keeping with the countrys conservative turn after 
the democracy movement was crushed 
a public notice addressed to comrade voters in the chaoyang 
district called for vigilence against bourgeois liberals who 
might seek to sabotage the election there have been no reports of 
any such plots 
bourgeois liberals are people who favor westernstyle 
democracy with more than one party 
xu was unable to explain why some people accused of being 
bourgeois liberals were elected to past peoples congresses 
the most prominent example is astrophysicist fang lizhis wife 
li shuxian a physics teacher at beijing university who shares her 
husbands dissident views and was elected in 1987 
she was expelled from the haidian district peoples congress in 
1989 soon after police accused her and fang of 
counterrevolutionary crimes they since have been allowed to go to 
the west 
people change xu said maybe when she was elected she 
didnt have this problem

airlines offering two tickets for the price of 
one may be setting the stage for what could escalate into a 
damaging fare war but analysts say the carriers can minimize risks 
if they limit freebie flights 
things like this tend to spread like wildfire said raymond 
e neidl an airline analyst with dillon read amp co inc if they 
can control the number of seats with blackout periods then the 
damage can be controlled 
the latest gimmick for filling seats comes as airlines have been 
hit hard by rising fuel costs brought on by the persian gulf crisis 
and a downturn in the economy that has kept demand for air travel 
sluggish 
after iraq invaded kuwait in august and oil prices spiraled 
upward airlines initiated three sets of fare increases that 
totaled about 15 percent 
but now most if not all of the airlines are fighting for 
passengers through limited promotions that offer two seats for the 
price of one for some flights tickets must be purchased by friday 
although many are good for trips through the end of february 
travel agents caution that the free flights are hard to get and 
blackout periods are in effect during the holidays heaviest travel 
days travelers should be extremely flexible about arrival and 
departure dates if they want to get the fares 
theyre few and far between said william cooper president 
of adventure travels in pompano beach fla youre talking about 
coming into the christmas season if youre going out of here on 
december 21st its almost impossible to get a seat 
for example someone wanting to get the bargain rates around 
christmas might end up flying at an odd hour on christmas day 
itself he said 
cooper pointed out that the freebies werent offered until many 
travelers had already booked their holiday trips anyone who 
already has tickets would have to determine whether it would be 
worth taking a penalty by changing reservations and going for the 
free flights he said 
the freebies have caused some confusion among travelers who 
often get the false impression that lots of seats are available 
under any airline promotion cooper said one of his agents spent 
three to four hours trying to get a customer a cheap seat last 
week to no avail 
two of the larger healthier carriers american and united 
fired some of the early rounds in the battle which could 
eventually hurt the weaker carriers if things get out of control 
analysts said in the early stages of the promotion airlines were 
offering 25 tickets for companions of people who flew at full 
price 
it soon became a free companion ticket 
as an example of how quickly airlines respond to cheaper fares 
offered by a competitor continental had separate advertisements 
appearing in two new york city newspapers one day last week with 
one offering a companion ticket for 25 and the other offering it 
for free 
the airlines cheapfare strategy had been shifted too quickly 
for the outdated ad to be replaced by the new one a spokesman 
said 
an allout fare war could prompt more restructuring in the 
industry like the job cuts and asset sales that have followed the 
recent runup in fuel costs in one of the most dramatic moves so 
far pan am corp agreed to sell united airlines five prized london 
routes for 400 million 
the stronger guys have more staying power neidl said 
thomas canning an airline analyst with standard amp poors does 
not foresee the cheap seats having any major impact on the 
industry 
as in all of these things the seats are limited he said 
its going to have some effect i dont think it will be 
disastrous

a series of bloody border 
incidents has given israelis a feeling that their frontiers are 
closing in on them 
in the latest attack a gunman crossed the egyptian border north 
of the red sea port of eilat on sunday and killed four israelis on 
a desert road it shocked israelis who have grown used to the 
11yearold formal peace on the egyptian front 
on the jordan border where an unofficial peace has reigned 
since 1971 guerrillas have killed two israeli soldiers this month 
the raids have raised concerns here that king hussein of jordan is 
losing control of the extremists in his midst 
on saturday night an israeli gunboat sank a dinghy which the 
army said was ferrying gunmen from lebanon to israel hours later 
the army said a woman with explosives strapped to her body blew 
herself up next to an israeli army patrol in south lebanon 
wounding two soldiers 
the lebanon front has long been israels most troublesome 
border but now that syria controls lebanon israel worries about 
losing its selfdeclared security strip in southern lebanon 
at massua an israeli farming settlement in the occupied west 
bank 15 miles north of jericho the tension is inescapable 
two miles from here a jordanian teenager crept across the 
jordan river one november night shot dead the israeli guarding a 
forward emplacement and would have killed more soldiers had one not 
clubbed him into submission 
the israelis obvious state of unreadiness reflected how much 
israel has come to take the peace on this border for granted it 
has since moved in bettertrained forces but we definitely 
expect more of the same says yossi olmert director of the 
government press office 
this past summer things have gotten worse and worse it makes 
us very uncomfortable a massua woman said last week as she 
wrapped bunches of hothouse roses for export to europe she spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
that morning the settlement kept its gates shut until 9 am 
because a jordanian soldier was thought to have infiltrated across 
the jordan river during the night 
the claustrophobic atmosphere is not restricted to existing 
frontiers a wave of knife attacks on jews led authorities to seal 
off the occupied territories for four days last month in a sense 
resurrecting the pre1967 war border between israel and the west 
bank and gaza strip 
tension is running particularly high in jerusalem israels 
largest concentration of jews and arabs it worsened dramatically 
after oct 8 when police fired on rioting palestinians outside 
their main mosque killing at least 17 people 
on friday a satirical tv sketch featured a young israeli with a 
rucksack telling his parents he was off on an adventure south 
america nepal no jerusalem he replies whereupon his mother 
bursts into tears and begs him to reconsider 
israelis have grown used to daily arab violence during the three 
years of the palestinian intefadeh or uprising but now the 
tension has reached places that were supposed to be immune such as 
eilat the resort town 15 miles from the scene of sundays 
shootings 
we try to sell eilat as a secure and comfortable place said 
shalom doron an assistant hotel manager now he worries that 
israelis may become as frightened to come here as they are to 
come to jerusalem 
most disconcerting for israelis is their belief that the latest 
attacks are not the work of their old enemy the plo but of 
islamic fundamentalists 
they see a direct link between the rise of moslem militancy in 
jordan and the raids across the jordan river 
the propaganda and the agitation of the islamic forces in 
jordan has reached very dangerous proportions olmert said 
one can see why there are those repeated attempts to 
infiltrate into israel from jordan attempts that we have no reason 
to think are approved of or initiated by the regime 
the same goes for egypt he said despite the cairo governments 
strong commitment to the 11yearold peace treaty there is an 
infrastructure of strong antiisraeli feeling in egypt basically 
fueled by islamic fundamentalists 
the fundamentalist factor was always present he said but has 
been accelerated by the persian gulf crisis which is forcing arabs 
to take sides for or against iraqi president saddam hussein

score one more victory for equal rights no 
longer do federal prisons discriminate gainst men in deciding 
whether prisoners may wear wigs 
under a bureau of prisons regulation that took effect nov 1 
inmates of both sexes are banned from donning hairpieces unless 
they get medical authorization from the warden 
it was one of countless changes that have been made in federal 
laws and regulations to bring about equal treatment of the sexes or 
to eliminate what is perceived as sexist language 
bureau officials say hairpieces are outlawed to prevent their 
use as disguises or to conceal contraband 
the previous regulation read 
5513 hairpieces 
a a female inmate may wear a wig or hairpiece 
b a male inmate may not wear an artificial hairpiece 
in its notice printing the new regulation in the federal 
register the bureau said the change was intended to provide for 
the security good order and discipline of the institution and to 
apply this provision equally to male and female inmates 
occasionally as in the wig rule such changes do away with 
discrimination against men for the most part however they are 
designed to assure equal rights for women 
for instance old rules of the veterans administration now the 
department of veterans affairs presumed that a female veteran 
could be the dependent of a male veteran but not the other way 
around 
va spokesman don smith said this has been changed as part of an 
effort that goes way back 
for the most part va considers that in the last decade or 
decade and a half it has eliminated just about everything that 
would suggest that there is a difference in benefits or services 
depending on sex smith said 
some distinctions remain in law if not in federal regulations 
and practice 
there is for example a law still on the books that calls for 
the bureau of indian affairs to train indian boys as farmers and 
industrial workers and indian girls as assistant matrons 
indian affairs spokesman tommy garrett however said that this 
and similar distinctions have been removed in an administrative 
sense over the years or superseded by later laws 
phineas indritz a washington lawyer who has filed briefs with 
the supreme court in landmark sex discrimination cases said 
there have been a large number of substantive changes eliminating 
distinctions in law but there are still a goodly number left 
the law on training of indian children was one of many that 
would have been repealed by legislation introduced in the last 
session of congress but not acted on 
sen orrin hatch rutah a sponsor of the legislation said 
some of the laws were archaic or obsolete and others had already 
been negated by agency action or court decisions 
a number of these laws however are of continuing 
applicability hatch said 
one that is of continuing applicability bars women from combat 
roles in the military another requires young men but not young 
women to register under selective service 
hatch and sen bob dole rkan steered clear of such 
controversial issues in their bill 
there also are continuing efforts to eliminate language that 
suggests sexual discrimination even though it may not exist 
a case in point is the office of chief judge of the district of 
columbia court of appeals the incumbent is named judith rogers 
but the dc code refers to the chief judge as he and him 
the judicial conference of the united states recently went 
through the codes of practice governing federal courts to do away 
with several hundred of such gender pronouns 
the last time i looked at them there was only one reference 
to a gender basis indritz said 
the code still spoke of a ship as her

here are excerpts from the opening statement 
of edwin j gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board at mondays session of the senate ethics committee 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
near the beginning of this drama in march of 1984 charles 
keatings american continental corp bought lincoln savings a 
california statechartered sampl california law then permitted 
direct equity investments mr keatings sampl could buy companies 
and stocks participate in leveraged buyouts build and run hotels 
and own and operate real estate development ventures of all types 
mr keating could easily raise the funds he needed to do such 
things because lincoln savings with its federally insured 
deposits was a cash cow well able to finance these endeavors 
in 1984 mr keating in order to gain permission to acquire 
lincoln had assured state regulators and us that he would continue 
to operate the institution as primarily a home mortgage lender 
despite these assurances he soon began using californias 
liberal thrift laws to their fullest one month after mr keating 
acquired lincoln the bank board asked congress to roll back state 
thrift powers to the boundaries set by the garnst germain act for 
federally chartered thrifts thats something congress had done for 
federally chartered thrifts 
this move would have severely curtailed direct investment 
authority for california thrifts but the bank boards request went 
nowhere the board began trying through administrative 
rulemaking to limit the investment authority granted by 
california law and mr keating enlisted the first wave of paid 
apologists dedicated to preventing us from doing so all of this 
occurred before i had even heard of charles keating 
the bank board adopted its first directed direct investment 
regulation on january 30 of 1985 it limited the amount of a 
thrifts assets that could go into direct equity investment to 10 
percent of assets unless regulators permitted exceptions and to 
be granted only under specific conditions 
by the time of our rulemaking mr keating had apparently been 
lobbying heavily to try to insure that the rule wouldnt be applied 
against lincoln or that it would be scuttled by a powerful show of 
force in congress largely as a result of the keating effort more 
than half the members of the house signed a resolution intended to 
cause me and my colleagues to back down in the face of this 
demonstration of power we didnt and the direct investment 
regulation stood 
mr keating next sought to deal with this problem by hiring me 
out of my job as his chief regulator he did so in a personal 
meeting with my chief of staff who on my prior instructions 
rejected his proposal 
in 1986 it became clear that mr keating was conducting a 
campaign through its employees agents and sympathizers to create 
the impression with the media and with other influence molders 
that i was feuding with him actually ive never met him or even 
seen him in person but we began hearing and then reading that i 
was somehow conducting a vendetta against lincoln 
a graykeating feud story ran on the front page of the 
washington post on september 20th 1986 in which it also was 
falsely alleged that i was harassing lincoln from that time 
forward my senior staff and i believe that the alleged gray 
vendetta was intended to be used by keating as a basis for fighting 
thrift regulators in the future 
vendetta accusations were not the only pressure tactics i saw in 
operation that year it was we now know not an accident that 
opposition to my efforts to warn about growing sampl problems 
coincided with the appearance of critical news stories about 
certain of the bank boards practices 
when i arrived at the agency these practices had been in place 
for over a decade the regional banks would routinely pay part of 
the expenses incurred by bank board officials including myself 
when we attended outoftown conferences of the regional banks 
these practices had been approved by bank board counsel on more 
than one occasion and were known to the congress 
despite this history and whatever may have been the source or 
motivation of the news stories i concluded that the questions 
raised in the news stories were not unreasonable and that the 
public perceptions created by the news stories were not only 
hurting me but would even if i survived in office destroy any 
chance i might have at reforming the thrift system 
i therefore reviewed these practices revised them and without 
being required or asked to do so paid back certain challenged 
expenses i also reimbursed the cost of airplane charter arranged 
for me by regional bank officials on the occasion of a severe 
medical emergency in my family the total amount of the 
reimbursements were approximately 27000 
this matter was thoroughly investigated by the office of 
government ethics the department of justice and the bank boards 
inspector general none of whom recommended any remedial action 
against me these attacks were part of a pattern of pressures meant 
to discredit and to discredit me and derail the effort to 
achieve sampl reform and protect the american taxpayers 
senator cranstons opening statement signaled that some would 
like this issue to play the same role at these hearings i hope it 
will not 
in mid1986 the terms of my two bank board colleagues mary 
grigsby and donald hovde were due to expire news reports 
speculated as early as august 1986 that two keating associates 
professor george benston of the university of rochester a paid 
consultant to lincoln since 1984 and lee henkel a keating lawyer 
and close associate who also was a major borrower of lincolns 
were being seriously considered by the white house under the 
leadership of donald regan to fill the grigsby and hovde seats on 
the bank board

henkel was indeed given a recess appointment for the republican 
slot on the bank board in late october of 1986 this sent a very 
strong signal to me and the bank board staff that mr keating had 
especially heavy political clout and that he intended to use it 
the pressures during those years came from the hill as well as 
the executive branch and the media and the congressional 
pressures were the heaviest of all 
beginning in 1985 id been asking congress for a major 
recapitalization of the fslic the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp that was in october of 1985 finally in the 
fall of 1986 we had a recapitalization bill moving through 
congress inadequate as it was but suddenly it stopped 
incoming speaker james wright had been told that our 
regulators were being too tough on texas sampls owned by his 
constituents and contributors and he personally was putting a hold 
on the bill until he could get some satisfaction 
the delay was critical it also impressed on all of us at the 
bank board if we had not known it before that congressional 
consent was the key to stopping the hemorrhage the losses to the 
taxpayers 
board member henkel in his first open meeting of the bank board 
proposed an alternative regulation for our direct investment rule 
which was due to expire his version would have forgiven thrifts 
for certain massive violations of the grandfathering clause of the 
extant direct investment regulation 
we believed then and i believe today that mr henkels 
regulation was specifically intended to benefit lincoln and only 
lincoln savings 
newly appointed board member larry white and i voted against 
henkels regulation and for renewing our direct investment rule 
later at the end of february of 1987 mr white and i voted to 
strengthen the direct investment regulation very substantially by 
tying a thrifts ability to make some equity investments to the 
level of tangible net worth on the books of the institution 
lincoln savings thereupon sued the bank board on the grounds that 
we had exceeded our statutory authority 
on april 2nd 1987 this issue of the direct investment rule 
came up in my meeting with senators deconcini mccain cranston and 
glenn as to which ive already testified in my deposition today 
as we look back it is clear many times over that the lions share 
of the staggering losses that taxpayers will have to pay are the 
result of overly rapid deposit growth fueled in large part by 
money brokers which went into equity investments particularly 
those involving speculative real estate projects 
charles keatings losses from direct investments and highrisk 
land loans demonstrate beyond doubt that our regulatory concerns 
our warnings and our actions were correct charles keatings 
purpose for lincoln savings was to use the institution as a source 
of funds for enterprises that had nothing to do with making home 
mortgages available to those seeking the american dream 
but there were many other thrift managements which to a lesser 
or greater extent were operating their thrifts for similar ends 
lincoln was not at all unique 
these people played their political cards like masters in order 
to keep the regulators at bay all the time the stakes for the 
taxpayers continued to go up and up and up 
the technique did not intimidate me or my regulators im proud 
to say but it visited a crushing burden on both the taxpayers and 
those depositors and bond holders who had placed their trust in our 
regulatory system 
i hope this account makes clear that when i met in 1987 with 
the five senators now before this committee we were not discussing 
a normal regulatory issue to be addressed through the normal kinds 
of pressure negotiation and compromise this was a matter of clear 
and present danger to the nation and demanded a more sober 
treatment 
we have heard a lot in these hearings about the responsibility 
of senators to represent constituent interests but ive always 
assumed that we also send our senators to washington because we 
think they will have the sense to know when narrow constituent 
demands must take a back seat to the safety of their constituents 
as a whole 
i hope this recounting of events also makes clear that when i 
met with the five senators it was not in the midst of a normal 
political climate these meetings capped years of private threats 
and public vilification designed not just to change particular 
decisions by the bank board but to render us unable to carry out 
our central responsibilities to protect the financial system and 
the taxpayers from loss no one in washington with the slightest 
knowledge of this issue can have been ignorant of this situation or 
the effect that it would have on the way regulators received and 
interpreted messages from senators and congressmen 
finally i hope my experience makes clear that the savings and 
loan problem was not merely a problem of personal ethics among five 
senators there were hundreds of players in this political drama 
each of whom had some sort of interest in preserving the existing 
system rather than changing it and reforming it and making it 
safer and more sound 
this is the classic problem of a democracy the private 
interests fit together so closely and operate so powerfully that 
the public interest the broad public interest the ordinary 
folks out there their interest never gets served perhaps this 
crisis will encourage all of us to build more safeguards against 
that danger in the future

hafr albatin saudi arabia ap around the dinner table under 
a bedouin tent the foreign legionnaires sang of their love for the 
desert and readiness to die for france 
the deserts for us as for sailors the sea they roared 
let the sun bronze our corpses 
the 1100 men of the 2nd infantry regiment deployed in the 
northeastern saudi arabian desert come from 46 countries some 
joined to flee legal problems or broken love affairs and nearly 
twothirds use an assumed name 
we never ask them why they joined the foreign legion said 
lt col antoine lecerf 40 
their past is their property maybe theyre looking for 
adventure maybe they want to forget something in their own life 
we dont mind 
americans may complain of harsh conditions waiting out saddam

legion camp 65 miles south of the border with iraqioccupied 
kuwait 
the legion was almost born in the desert said cpl martin 
meyer 28 of chicago we love it out here 
the 2nd infantry is part of the frances 4000man rapid action 
force deployed alongside arab troops in the faceoff with saddam 
the legionnaires have seen action in lebanon chad gabon and 
other hotspots where they were sent to advance frances foreign 
policy 
far from shunning a fight the legionnaires look forward to it 
five years without seeing combat and im still a virgin 
said meyer who joined after serving in the us air force 
thats what i signed up for thats what everyone signed up 
for 
he said he preferred the legion to the us military because 
its a lot more liberal hey i got my corporals stripes because 
i was thrown in the nick jail they dont like wimps 
as they wait for action the legionnaires live with gallic 
savoirfaire 
they have bought large bedouin tents and arab carpets to lay on 
the sand they drink from glasses decorated with the regimental 
crest and the food is a far cry from the american mres or meals 
ready to eat that the gis complain about 
in the event of hostilities they have packaged readytowarm 
rations but those too are a lot different from american army 
chow one such ration includes lamb with beans mushroom soup 
beef conserve tunnyfish in oil candy caramels and a variety of 
other goodies 
the desert is their home 
its very beautiful lecerf said you can have a constant 
communion with nature i love the desert because its a demanding 
environment that imposes a special effort from everyone 
cut off from their backgrounds the legionnaires can find a new 
life among their comrades with no questions asked 
most of my friends are in jail or dead so it was a good 
move to sign up said pvt john garcia 20 of the bronx new 
york he stressed it was his real name and that im no 
criminal 
asked whether he was hoping for war he answered in his newly 
learned french yes of course everyone here is 
the legionnaires have strips of velcro on their uniforms for 
name tags but none of the men of the 2nd infantry wore the tags 
many refused to be photographed or to give their names even 
aliases 
these days many of the new recruits come from eastern europe 
the legion predicts that eastern europeans will form the largest 
minority within two years 
it ethos hasnt changed much since the 1939 movie beau geste 
starring gary cooper told the story of three wellborn brothers who 
join the legion to escape disgrace 
capt hans eberle a 25yearold legion veteran said 
legionnaires are like modeling clay they have to adapt 
speaking french in an accent tinged with his native german and 
the lilting southern accent of the legions home base nimes 
eberle acknowledged he misses his wife and three children 
but in our noble profession there are so many rewards said 
the 44yearold captain who has made hundreds of parachute jumps 
with a full combat load 
the legionnaires spend up to 300 days a year away from home base 
in a totally masculine world and they shudder at the thought that 
women could ever be recruited 
i love women too much to accept that they be in the legion 
said eberle ive seen the corpses of women its not a pretty 
sight 
as reporters left the legion camp eberle said goodbye see 
you in baghdad

seventyfive percent of the nations top 
economic forecasters contend the nation has sunk into a recession 
although twothirds expect it to be mild and end by april 
according to a survey released today 
recession is here the national association of business 
economists said in a report on its canvass of 51 professional 
forecasters 
the finding was a dramatic switch from an nabe survey just a 
year ago when 62 percent of the forecasters said the economy would 
escape a recession through 1992 just after the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait in august 45 percent of the forecasters said a recession 
either had begun or was imminent 
some economists on the current panel who say the downturn has 
not yet begun predicted a recession would begin early next year 
only 15 percent of the panel continue to hold to the no 
recession scenario 
the nabe survey mirrored an earlier survey this month by blue 
chip economic indicators eighty percent of the 52 prominent 
economists participating in that study said a recession will begin 
before years end another five percent said it would begin in 
1991 
virtually all of the nabe forecasters who contend the economy is 
in recession say it began either in the third or the current 
quarter 
the recession is also expected to be mild in historical terms 
with the trough occurring in the first quarter of 1991 the nabe 
report said it projected economic growth to decline 10 percent in 
the current quarter and 08 percent in the next 
a recession generally is defined as two consecutive quarters of 
negative growth 
if the current expansion is dead it lived a long and 
prosperous life of 93 months assuming an august peak and was just 
a year short of the longest postwar business expansion of 
19611969 the report said 
the forecasters project the economy will expand just 1 percent 
for all of 1990 and 08 percent next year that includes inching up 
06 percent in the second quarter and growth of 2 percent in the 
third and 25 percent in the fourth the economy grew 25 percent 
in 1989 and 45 percent in 1988 
the survey also found the forecasters believe unemployment will 
rise from 55 percent this year to 61 percent in 1991 the jobless 
rate in october was 57 percent up from 52 percent in june 
at the same time inflation as measured by the labor 
departments consumer price index will drop from 55 percent in 
1990 to 52 percent in 1991 the 1990 rate forecast in the latest 
survey is up from 53 percent in the previous survey because of 
higher oil prices following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the report said 
corporate profits are projected to decline 4 percent this year 
and 13 percent in 1991 thats down from the previous survey that 
forecast a 27 percent decline in 1990 and a 3 percent gain in 
1991 
the forecasters said the federal budget deficit will rise from 
2204 billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 to 258 
billion in fiscal 1991 and 240 billion in fiscal 1992 
the projections include the cost of the savings and loan 
bailout excluding those costs the deficit would be 198 billion 
in the current year and 180 billion in fiscal 1992 
the other deficit merchandise trade is forecast to drop to 
100 billion this year and 93 billion in 1991 the trade deficit 
which totaled 10899 billion in 1989 has not been below 100 
billion since 1983

a man accused of shooting his exwife in 
the head and murdering her lover was set free after two trials in 
which the defense argued the womans memory was faulty because of 
her head wound 
george gurney who had spent 17 months in jail became a free 
man monday after his second trial in five months ended in a hung 
jury 
the prosecution decided against a third trial citing the health 
of gurneys former wife miriam stoltzgurney she spent four 
months recovering from the february 1989 attack before identifying 
gurney as the assailant 
bringing her back getting her ready for trial and actually 
subjecting her to having to testify again not only is not helping 
her rehabilitation process its inhibiting that process said 
assistant attorney general michael ramsdell 
the defense had hammered at the reliability of stoltzgurneys 
memory calling a harvard university psychologist who testified 
that people with her type of head injury sometimes create memories 
to fill in gaps in their recall 
defense attorneys also stressed that there was no physical 
evidence linking gurney 54 to the crime scene 
gurney who did not testify had no comment monday 
stoltzgurney 49 was not present for the dismissal of the case 
the jury deadlocked last week after deliberating about 14 hours 
according to one juror who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
dissenting juror doubted stoltzgurneys testimony the first trial 
ended in a 66 deadlock in june 
gurney was charged with murder attempted murder and kidnapping 
in the attack that left stoltzgurney in a weeklong coma and her 
lover roger whittemore dead 
gurney a newspaper advertising salesman had faced life in 
prison without parole 
stoltzgurney who now lives at a boston rehabilitation center 
had stunned doctors with her recovery in walking to the stand she 
needed the help of a cane at times her voice was barely audible 
and she admitted her memory was spotty 
david davidoff a psychologist who interviewed stoltzgurney 
told the jury that she made up things to feel a sense of mastery 
and completeness he testified the few things she does recall 
are likely to be distorted 
the prosecution had portrayed gurney as a scorned lover who was 
insanely jealous of whittemore 
stoltzgurney who had maintained a relationship with her 
exhusband since their divorce in 1986 testified that he called 
the night of the murder and asked to come over she said she told 
him he couldnt because whittemore was there 
the next thing she remembered she testified was gurney 
storming into her room wearing camouflage fatigues and army boots 
she said gurney tied a pillowcase over whittemores head and bound 
his hands 
george took a fire iron and whacked roger with it roger was 
screaming i have four children and i want to do more for them 
she said i was on the staircase cowering i was really scared 
about the whole thing 
gurney then told her that they were going for a ride she said 
she testified she did not remember being shot 
whittemore 52 of swampscott mass was found dead and 
stoltzgurney was found unconscious in nearby woods

a beneficial natural fungus that attacks two 
costly plant diseases has been approved by the government for 
commercial use in greenhouses 
the agriculture department said the fungus a strain of 
gliocladium virens has been approved by the environmental 
protection agency as a greenhouse biological control of two harmful 
fungi that cause damping off diseases 
according to the departments agricultural research service it 
is the first time in the united states a biocontrol fungus has been 
approved for use against a plant disease 
dampingoff diseases cause rotting of seeds seedlings and 
cuttings losses are estimated at more than 1 billion a year 
the research service said its scientists invented and patented 
the technology for formulating the good fungus gliocladium into 
easily applied pellets wr grace amp co was granted an exclusive 
license for its use 
grace developed the technology further and hopes to have a 
product on the market in two years eventually the company said it 
may seek epa approval for using the pellets outdoors as markets 
develop 
the research service said monday that dampingoff fungi are 
attacked by the pellets rhizoctonia solani and pythium ultimum 
the diseases can destroy 10 percent to 30 percent of a crop 
among dampingoffs victims are geraniums snapdragons 
chrysanthemums celosia poinsettias cotton corn beans and 
soybeans 
tests performed by usda plant pathologists robert d lumsden and 
james c locke show plant losses caused by dampingoff were reduced 
by 80 percent to 95 percent which are similar to results gained 
from the use of chemical fungicides 
the agency said further improvements are being sought to reduce 
losses 95 percent or even 100 percent 
approval by epa allows gliocladiums use on any plants grown in 
a greenhouse including ornamentals and edibles such as tomatoes 
cabbage or broccoli 
the pellets resemble granular fertilizer and are made of dormant 
fungi spores wheat bran and alginate a natural gellike material 
that binds the particle together 
when the pellets are moistened the spores germinate and the 
fungus multiplies and controls the disease the agency said 
gliocladium was described as a naturally occurring organism 
that was isolated from maryland soil in the early 1980s at the 
agencys biocontrol of plant diseases laboratory in beltsville md 
 
washington ap the agriculture department has concluded a 
national hearing on possible changes in the pricing procedures 
under the nations 42 federal milk marketing orders 
but department officials say it will be well into next year 
before a final proposal can be drawn up for public comment 
more than 10000 pages of comments were taken from 195 witnesses 
during the 43 days of testimony that began sept 5 in eau claire 
wis and concluded nov 20 in irving texas

with usdas hearing clerk no later than april 13 1991 replies 
will be accepted by april 27 
after april 27 the department will evaluate the evidence and 
briefs prepare a recommended decision on the proposals which 
will be open for public comment after that a final rule will 
be prepared 
any changes that rule might propose would be contingent on 
referendums in each milk marketing area a proposal would affect 
the department said 
the procedure involves the milk pricing provisions used in all 
federal milk marketing orders the system used to set minimum 
prices for milk that wholesalers must pay producers 
although the marketing orders do not set retail milk prices the 
minimums specified at the farm level are felt through the marketing 
chain

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
many critics underestimate the governments ability to accommodate 
both the environment and the timber industry 
i dont see those as nearly as incompatible as some have 
suggested so far he told reporters monday 
yeutter said the defeat of environmental initiatives containing 
extreme positions in the nov 6 elections shows voters want 
common sense approaches to the environment including protection of 
the northern spotted owl 
the secretary criticized views of extremists on both sides of 
the fight over the threatened owls habitat which is primarily in 
the centuriesold forests of the pacific northwest he also said he 
expects the forest services northwest logging plans to survive 
most legal challenges 
the forest service acting under the agriculture department has 
been forced to alter its logging plans since the fish and wildlife 
service declared the owl to be a threatened species in june 
a panel of government scientists led by forest service biologist 
jack ward thomas said in april that logging must halt on 3 million 
acres of northwest federal forests to save the owl 
but timber industry leaders say that would cost tens of 
thousands of timber jobs by the end of the decade 
it certainly has been politically difficult to strike a 
reasonable balance in many of these areas of conflict not just the 
spotted owl but a good number of others as well yeutter said 
that is due to radical or extreme positions being held by a 
number of folks in the environmental community on the one side and 
sometimes equally radical or extreme positions being held by folks 
on the other side he said 
yeutter said the defeat of several environmental ballot issues 
such as californias big green should provide encouragement to 
policymakers at all levels of government 
the voters opted for reasoned and good judgment and common 
sense and they rejected a lot of proposals in early november that 
would have in my judgment gone off into extreme positions he 
said 
that is an encouraging illustration of democracy in action and 
a sound solid middleoftheroad approach emerging as a result of 
the election process the secretary said

when philip morris spent millions on a 
hightech 50state exhibition of the bill of rights cynics 
complained the cigarette company wanted to convey a notsosubtle 
message one of our inalienable rights is the right to smoke 
now the american lung association of connecticut is delivering 
its own message with a notech lowbudget counterexhibition of 
the revered document 
its not an established right for someone to blow smoke in my 
face said john e zinn the lung associations executive 
director in connecticut what theyre trying to do is perpetuate 
this myth where smoking is a right and polluting other peoples air 
is a right 
philip morris cos borrowed virginias copy of the bill of 
rights for a 16month tour that began oct 10 to commemorate the 
200th anniversary of the signing of the document 
when the lung association heard the tour was coming to new haven 
earlier this month members quickly arranged their own exhibit 
moving connecticuts copy from the connecticut state library to the 
old state house in hartford 
connecticuts copy is one of 13 given to the original states 
after the bill of rights was ratified in 1791 the federal 
government also has a copy on display in washington 
costs for the philip morris tour including advertising and 
security are expected to top 60 million the lung associations 
monthlong exhibition which opened friday cost 300 
the philip morris exhibition uses blue lights and loud music to 
show off the bill of rights in an elaborate multimedia show the 
document is transported around the country in an armored car 
accompanied by a caravan of six trucks four vans and two buses 
wilson h faude executive director of the old state house used 
his 1983 nissan to transport the bill of rights for the lung 
associations exhibition from its home at the state library the 
document is displayed in a simple glass case 
theres a certain dignity surrounding the bill of rights 
zinn said well leave the splashy demonstration to them 
philip morris a conglomerate that also owns kraft general foods 
and miller brewing co denied it wanted to make a statement about 
smoking 
theres absolutely nothing in the tour that promotes any of 
our products nothing whatsoever and how touring the bill of 
rights is going to fight smoking restrictions is beyond me said 
the companys mary taylor 
antismoking groups or gay activists angered by the companys 
support of sen jesse helms rnc have protested the philip 
morris tour at stops in barre vt west warwick ri augusta 
maine new haven albany ny and boston 
visitors at the lung associations exhibition on monday were 
divided over the philip morris tour 
im against smoking but the fact is nobodys asking people 
to smoke just because they come see this said peter ottaviano a 
hartford insurance agent 
its their right to sponsor it but i think their motives are 
questionable said val pajer of durham something like this 
something thats part of our heritage should not be connected with 
a profitmaking motive 
faude said the controversy probably has helped boost attendance 
at the connecticut exhibit in three days it has drawn 8000 
people 
this debate is good he said i think all this means is 
that the bill of rights is very healthy

the bush administration is urging dismissal of 
a lawsuit by 45 house democrats who say the president must get 
congressional approval before launching any us attack on iraqi 
forces 
the justice department said monday night the courts should not 
decide the case because there is no imminent threat of hostilities 
and in any case the issue is political and cannot be decided on 
legal principles 
the ultimate check on presidential power to deploy military 
force is congressional control of the federal purse strings and not 
the courts the department said in legal papers filed with us 
district judge harold greene 
those filing suit must show that they have suffered some injury 
as a result of illegal conduct the department said 
the congressmen have not alleged that such an attack is 
imminent or even probable but merely that there is a realistic 
threat of one the department said the fact that a threat may 
be realistic however does not mean that it is likely to be 
carried out 
the suit seeks a preliminary injunction restraining president 
bush from launching an offensive against iraqi troops without 
congressional approval 
granting such relief would involve the court in the kind of 
diplomatic and military judgments which are the province of 
congress and the executive branch the justice department said 
the courts have traditionally remained aloof from such 
issues it added it urged the judge to refrain from 
intervening in this ongoing political process and to dismiss the 
case 
the papers filed by assistant attorney general stuart gerson 
called it premature to bring such a lawsuit because it is based on 
the premise of hypothetical future events 
the department also noted that bush has never said that he 
will not seek congressional authorization prior to the use of 
force against iraqi troops who invaded kuwait in august 
in the absence of some actual clash between congress and the 
executive branch considering the lawsuit would only interject the 
court unnecessarily into a political process it added 
the constitution states that congress shall have power to 
declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules 
concerning captures on land and water 
bush and others in the administration have said they have would 
consult with congress before using offensive force against iraq 
secretary of state james baker has expressed reservations about 
the notion that bush would need congressional approval if the use 
of force went beyond the defense of saudi arabia 
earlier monday 11 law professors supported the lawsuit in a 
brief filed with the court 
the constitution requires that the president meaningfully 
consult with congress and receive its affirmative authorization 
not merely present it with faits accomplis before engaging in 
war the professors said 
among them was erwin griswold who was us solicitor general 
during the johnson and nixon administrations 
congressional approval must come through formal action not 
legislative silence stray remarks of individual members or 
activity that the president or a court might construe to constitute 
acquiescence they said

the ironfisted matriarch of a family empire 
of sludge barges and tugboats was given five years probation and 
sent into retirement for fouling new york harbor 
superior court judge anthony j iuliani said monday only evelyn 
berman franks age and ill health kept him from sentencing the 
75yearold dragon lady of the harbor to up to 10 years behind 
bars mrs frank has skin cancer high blood pressure and other 
medical problems 
the judge also ordered mrs frank to perform 2500 hours of 
community service and cut all ties to her business 
her familys general marine transport inc presented a check at 
mondays hearing for 500000 half the fine levied on the company 
under a plea bargain 
for more than 40 years mrs frank had controlled a marine empire 
of more than 45 interlocking companies operating tank cleaners 
barges and tugboats 
she gained a reputation on the waterfront for barking out orders 
to her barge and boat employees over shortwave radio from her fifth 
avenue apartment in manhattan or the basement of her staten island 
home 
competitors and employees dubbed her the dragon lady mrs 
frank in turn christened one of her tugboats the dragon lady 
in july she pleaded guilty to unlawful abandonment and release 
of sewage sludge some of it toxic in new york harbor in 1987 
and 1988 
the familys environmental violations date to at least 1970 but 
drew little attention until september when an illegally operated 
barge dumped waste oil into the harbor in october new york state 
closed the familys barge business 
lawsuits have been filed against the family and its businesses 
in new york and new jersey the city and state of new york are 
trying to collect more than 1 million in back taxes and one 
family company has filed for bankruptcy

a former school administrator who had 
maintained he was being framed for an 11yearold slaying led 
authorities to the body of his exgirlfriend confessed to the 
crime and drew five years in prison 
francis w malinosky 45 was sentenced monday under a plea 
bargain approved by district judge frank mahady he will be 
eligible for parole in a little more than three years 
i am ashamed of myself right down to the very center of my 
being malinosky told the judge in confessing to the crime 
last week the former assistant director of special education for 
burlington schools led authorities to the body of judith 
leoconeys 
i loved judy and her son shamus and i thought we were going 
to be a family malinosky said the boy 3 when his mother died 
has been raised by her parents 
after his arrest in april malinosky said he was the victim of a 
smalltown witch hunt and vowed to prove his innocence authorities 
said malinosky killed the 32yearold special education teacher in 
1979 after she broke off their 2yearold relationship 
im still angry that someone can kill somebody with two 
bullets in the back of the head and throw her body in a plastic bag 
and only get three years said leoconeys mother patricia 
leo its just not right 
the judge and states attorney william sorrell agreed the 
punishment was not strict enough but they said malinosky was 
allowed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter because a murder 
case against him could have been lost 
although malinosky had long been a suspect authorities could 
not find leoconeys body until he led them to her shallow grave 
off a mountain road last week 
she had vanished after going to malinoskys home to pick up her 
belongings malinosky disappeared a short time later and wasnt 
found until april when he was arrested at a los angeles motel 
police tracked him down after sorrell reopened the case last 
year 
i was convinced when i looked at the file that he had murdered 
her sorrell said it bothered me that this guy was getting 
away with murder

levels set in new york because of continuing tensions in the 
persian gulf the dollar closed at 12905 yen in new york 
the dollar tends to rise in times of international tension 
because it is seen as a safe investment while reports of a 
possible gulf war usually weaken the yen because japan depends on 
the middle east for about 70 percent of its oil supply 
the dollar later moved to lose some of its early gains with 
bearish sentiment toward the currency prevailing in the market 
traders said 
the dollar was edging lower as it faced selling pressure above 
the 129 yen said shoken sakamoto an exchange dealer with new 
japan securities co 
on the stock market the nikkei index fell back on smalllot 
selling in trading discouraged by weakening yen and bond prices as 
well as higher oil prices securities dealers said

education secretary lauro cavazos is calling 
on colleges and universities to make tough choices to cut 
costs 
cavazos insisted monday that colleges still are affordable 
although tuition increases during the 1980s averaged about 8 
percent a year average tuition and fees for fall 1990 ranged from 
884 at twoyear public colleges to 9391 at fouryear private 
colleges 
escalating costs of higher education have some analysts 
predicting that four years of college early in the next century 
may cost several hundred thousand dollars said cavazos 
cavazos stressed that the predictions are based on 
misperceptions about both the true cost of college and the 
availability of student financial aid yet he released a 
handbook entitled tough choices to help colleges examine 
institutional goals and priorities and make decisions to control 
spending 
if we are to keep higher education affordable colleges and 
universities are going to have to make serious efforts to control 
costs he told reporters each institution must identify its 
central mission and focus and then allocate resources accordingly 
with the understanding that no single institution can do everything 
well 
for example cavazos said colleges should consider merging 
duplicative services or programs and possibly eliminating programs 
including certain athletic or sports programs institutions also 
might consider coordinating services with nearby schools he said

former american university prssident richard 
berendzen who resigned after being charged with making obscene 
telephone calls says he wants to remain on the faculty 
berendzen said monday the controversy over a reported 1 million 
buyout of his contract as president and as a tenured professor of 
physics has caused him great anguish 
i am seeing the fabric of this family torn by rumor and 
innuendo berendzen said in a statement issued through his 
attorney i have initiated steps that i hope will bring harmony 
to the university i love so dearly 
he pleaded guilty in may to two charges of making obscene phone 
calls in fairfax county va and received two 30day jail 
sentences which were suspended on the condition that he remain in 
psychiatric treatment 
berendzen said he was hopeful the board of trustees will approve 
his return to teaching after an appropriate period of leave 
last week acting president milton greenberg asked the trustees 
to rescind the buyout offer he cited serious rifts which the 
arrangement had caused between the trustees and the rest of the 
university

did thomas jefferson father a child by one of 
his slaves did old hickorys wife already have an old man and 
say what could you see by the dawns early light 
historians professional knowitalls who usually save 
questions for students admit to a few intriguing doubts of their 
own in the december issue of american heritage 
the magazine asked american historians to name the one mystery 
in us history each would like solved responses ranged from 
were sacco and vanzetti guilty to who invented the 
hamburger 
walter lord wonders what francis scott key saw the morning he 
wrote the starspangled banner during the war of 1812 
key was forced to observe the british bombardment of fort 
mchenry in baltimore harbor from a flagoftruce boat eight miles 
away he later said he composed the songs lyrics at dawn when the 
sight of the flag assured him the attack had been repelled 
but that was unlikely lord suggests although the forts 
regular flag might have been visible from eight miles the nights 
rain would have forced the use of a lighter smaller storm flag 
that probably could not have been seen through smoke and rain in 
early light 
lord argues that its more likely key saw an ensign flag raised 
by the victorious americans over the forts guns a flag that a 
british officer saw raised around 9 am not dawn 
key however knew that dawn is a more magic hour than 9 
am lord writes it was time to resort to a little poetic 
license 
another historian charles oneill wonders if the space shuttle 
challenger was sent aloft despite less than optimal temperatures 
because the white house wanted a dramatic background for president 
reagans 1986 state of the union address originally scheduled for 
the night of the launch 
he writes 
by examination of white house logs or otherwise id like it 
clearly proven or disproven whether word went to nasa 
officials bidding those in charge not to be too finicky given 
the upcoming address about getting the challenger into the air 
cold weather or no cold weather 
columbia university historian henry graff wonders why former 
president james monroe repeatedly sued the government for expenses 
after leaving office he suspects monroe was ashamed of the 
substantial charges that he misapplied public money while in 
official posts even that he had personally profited from his 
refurbishing of the white house after its torching by the 
british 
several historians uncomfortable perhaps with the mantle of 
ignorance suggest solutions to their own mysteries 
thomas fleming believes that jefferson did not father the 
mulatto boy who looked like him the slave woman sally hemmings 
was the illegitimate daughter of jeffersons fatherinlaw and her 
children probably were fathered by jeffersons nephew he says 
fleming suspects jefferson never denied the charge publicly to 
protect his family 
despite denials by andrew jacksons supporters biographer 
robert remini says it appears jackson and his wife rachel married 
sometime between october 1790 and january 1791 about three years 
before a court dissolved rachels first marriage and the couple 
officially married 
some questions lack even a suggested answer 
what happened to sen huey longs deduct box which was 
filled with a million dollars in campaign contributions and 
disappeared after his assassination in 1935 ken burns producer 
of pbs documentary the civil war 
why did secretary of war edwin stanton refuse president lincoln 
the military escort hed requested on the day he was assassinated 
and why did he dissuade gen ulysses grant from joining lincoln at 
fords theater that night jacques barzun columbia university 
why did the federal government give virginia the portion of the 
district of columbia south of the potomac river making the 
capitals boundary look like a sandwich with a large corner 
bitten off the late marcus cunliffe george washington 
university 
and then theres the hamburger twenty years ago when jc 
furnas tried to determine its inventor he settled on a creation 
scenario circa 1905 a latenight run on bread for a broiled beef 
patty sandwich forces a restaurant cook to substitute the rolls 
then used for ham sandwiches customers praise the innovation for 
its ease in handling 
but where furnas asks was that allnight lunchroom and who 
was that cook

iraq has transferred more than 100 
westerners including at least five americans from strategic sites 
in kuwait to baghdad diplomats report 
the us and british diplomats say the hostages were brought to 
the mansour melia hotel in the iraqi capital it wasnt clear if 
they would be released 
president saddam hussein appeared on television with hostages 
and their families on monday and said three americans would be 
allowed to go home 
the swedish embassy said more than 50 swedes in iraq also have 
been given permission to leave and the wife of a canadian hostage 
said he told her as many as 25 canadians were about to be released 
i talked to my husband by phone monday and he said the word 
was that 15 to 25 of the canadians were going to be let out lois 
minns said in edmonton alberta ralph minns has been confined to 
his baghdad hotel for the last three weeks she said 
in moscow on monday soviet officials charged that iraq was 
dragging its feet on the departure of soviets from iraq failing to 
allow people to leave as promised it was the first time moscow had 
accused baghdad of preventing soviet citizens from leaving iraq 
at least 4000 of an estimated 8000 soviets who were in iraq 
when it invaded kuwait on aug 2 have left 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said iraq agreed to 
clear another 1000 to leavein november but only 350 have been 
allowed to go 
if iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our 
citizens to leave this will complicate the present situation even 
further and force us to take a tougher attitude he said 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz met with president mikhail 
s gorbachev at the kremlin on monday and indicated a 
bureaucratic accident had resulted in the delay of the 
departure of the soviets the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
a broadcast on iraqi television monday included footage of 
saddam meeting with a group of americans and their relatives who 
were told they would be allowed to leave together 
if you feel that hospitality has come to an end you can 
travel to the united states of america or anywhere else in the 
world at any time you deem appropriate the report quoted saddam 
as saying 
the hostages shown on tv were fred harrington 59 of bellevue 
wash john stevenson 44 of panama city fla 
the daughterinlaw of hostage clyde jesse 55 a suburban 
chicago businessman who was living in kuwait said jesse has also 
been promised he can leave iraq 
the us embassy has said there are more than 900 americans in 
kuwait and iraq including 104 held at strategic sites 
saddam has been freeing small numbers of hostages almost daily 
in response to pleas from visiting dignitaries 
us officials say the releases are a ploy to win sympathy and 
divide the global coalition opposed to his occupation of kuwait 
tony benn leader of a leftwing faction of the british labor 
party arrived in baghdad on monday and said he would try to free 
british hostages 
saddam has offered to free foreigners beginning dec 25 in 
exchange for us guarantees he will not be attacked 
the release period from dec 25 to march 25 coincides with the 
time considered best to launch a military operation since 
temperatures are lower and there are frequent stretches of calm 
weather

some 874 billion changed hands in todays spot trading up 
from 694 billion the previous day 
currency traders said persion gulf tensions helped keep the

the yen was sold because of rising oil prices said a dealer 
with the industrial bank of japan speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the us currency is regarded a safe haven in times of 
international tensions worries about a possible war in the gulf 
also usually weaken the yen because japan imports about 70 percent 
of its oil from the middle east 
brent crude for january delivery was notionally valued at about

voters who have over the past year cast 
ballots in eastern europes first free elections in decades were 
sometimes able to get the results from the evening news thanks to 
a german polling firm 
the bonnbased infas polling institute has made one of the first 
major injections of technical skill into eastern europe in the form 
of exit polls 
the institute founded in 1958 has done exit polling in 
elections in former east germany romania czechoslovakia bulgaria 
and poland 
in poland on sunday infas was within a few percentage points of 
the final result just hours after the polls closed 
it is yet another indication of the might a united germany will 
have in eastern europe as countries lacking in many of the basic 
skills of democracy turn to their nearest and most powerful 
democratic neighbor 
germany is the chief provider of aid to eastern europe and 
major german companies have through years of cultivating contacts 
established themselves firmly in the countries of the former soviet 
bloc 
freed by eastern europes reforms and prompted by their 
fledgling medias attempt to cope the eastern european polling 
ventures mark the first time infas has conducted election polls 
outside germany officials said 
initial exit polls from infas which was hired by polands state 
television projected that lech walesa would take 41 percent of the 
vote with prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and emigre stanislaw 
tyminski tied at 205 percent 
further infas results released around midnight from the 404 
districts it targeted gave walesa 393 percent tyminski 232 
percent and mazowiecki 199 percent 
based on complete but unofficial returns released by the 
polish news agency pap on monday walesa won 3996 percent of the 
vote tyminski 2310 percent and mazowiecki 1808 percent 
these first projected results are sometimes 2 or 3 percentage 
points away from the final result but the second projected result 
is much closer reinhart schneider one of the project leaders in 
infas election department said in an interview monday 
infas has been very accurate in its forecasts schneider 
said he was especially proud of results from romania the most 
difficult of the institutes foreign ventures 
romania was really a unique situation it was a revolutionary 
situation still he said 
but he added you can see how close the methods come 
in the may 20 presidential elections ion iliescu of the 
national salvation front received 851 percent of the vote and 
radu campeanu of the national liberal party got 102 percent 
according to final results 
exit poll projections gave 83 percent of the vote to iliescu and 
11 percent to campeanu schneider said 
infas has been approached and paid by the media in the country 
holding each of the elections schneider said in each case it 
hooked up with a partner institute that translated the institutes 
questions and provided native speakers to do the interviewing 
this is not very difficult but you have to have the 
experience to do this schneider said these eastern countries 
have not yet the experience in doing these things because they have 
not had democratic elections for years for decades

industry analysts say mca inc the 
entertainment giant that gave the world et and jaws is 
so well run that its new japanese owners will allow creative 
control to remain in american hands 
in the biggest japanese purchase ever of a us company 
matsushita electric industrial co struck a 66 billion deal for 
mca on monday 
the japanese maker of videocasette recorders televisions and 
stereos under such brand names as panasonic technics and quasar 
got a company that produces hit tv shows such as murder she 
wrote and major dad records artists such as elton john and 
guns n roses and owns many of the biggest movies of all time 
mca became the fourth major hollywood studio to come under 
foreign control raising fears that responsiblity for the financing 
and political content of american entertainment is falling 
increasingly into nonamerican hands 
in a statement monday matsushita indicated its awareness of 
american fears of japanese investment and sought to allay them by 
promising to leave mcas management intact and allow the companys 
direction to be determined at home 
analysts and mca executives said the public is unlikely to see 
much of a difference in movie theaters from cd players or on tv 
screens 
they bought it precisely because of management said jeff 
logsdon of seidler amdec securities inc it doesnt help them to 
interfere in the creative process 
i dont think matsushita made a major investment in a company 
thats doing very well to try to change what its doing said 
mcas movie chief tom pollock 
still the deal has brought skepticism and criticism 
record producer quincy jones said he was worried that the 
country was selling off its heritage 
in japan the nationally circulated asahi shimbun newspaper 
reported that matsushita pushed to close the deal before dec 7 
the 49th anniversary of the japanese bombing of pearl harbor to 
avoid public relations problems 
concerns were expressed in japanese newspapers of an 
antijapanese backlash in the united states backlashes followed 
japanese purchases of columbia pictures rockefeller plaza in new 
york and pebble beach in california 
skepticism arose at a news conference in japan on monday when 
matsushita president akio tanii was asked if he would object to mca 
making a japanbashing film or one critical of emperor 
hirohitos role in world war ii 
something like that shouldnt emerge said tanii looking 
agitated filmmakers must create films that are inspirational 
that will be enjoyable for everybody i cant even imagine a case 
like that 
to silence criticism that arose during negotiations matsushita 
said it will sell mcas curry co subsidiary which operates 
restaurants hotels and other services in yosemite national park 
matsushita will also spin off mcas wwortv in the new york area 
into a separate company owned by mca shareholders foreign 
companies are not allowed to own domestic tv stations 
japans sony corp bought columbia pictures entertainment last 
year italian financier giancarlo parretti bought mgmua 
communications last month and rupert murdochs australiabased news 
corp has owned 20th century fox since 1985 
like the 5 billion sonycolumbia deal the mcamatsushita 
merger blends hollywood software movies tv shows and 
recordings with japanese hardware in an effort to exploit the 
huge world demand for both types of product 
mca which began 65 years ago as a booking agent for jazz bands 
has grown to become a colossus of films universal pictures et 
the extraterrestrial jaws and back to the future 
records reba mcentire bobby brown george strait and television 
attendance at its universal studios theme parks in florida and

president fernando collor de mello 
suffered a sweeping defeat in gubernatorial runoff elections whose 
results were widely considered a rejection of his tough 
antiinflation policies 
the runoffs were held sunday in 15 of the countrys 26 states 
where none of the candidates obtained an absolute majority in the 
first round 
collors allies lost the runoffs in each of five major states 
contested sunday sao paulo rio grande do sul minas gerais 
parana and espirito santo according to results that came in 
monday 
results in the other six more isolated states were expected to 
trickle in 
the overall picture is terrible for the president said 
presidential chief of staff marcos coimbra 
the results seemed to show a sudden plunge in collors political 
fortunes his allies had swept to victory in 10 of 11 state 
governors races that were determined in the first round of voting 
on oct 3 
political analysts said the election of opposition governors in 
the major states would make it difficult for collor to obtain 
congressional support for his economic programs which have frozen 
wages despite continued severe inflation 
brazils governors are powerful under a 1988 constitution 
states get a guaranteed share of federal tax receipts and 
governors have a large measure of influence over their states 
congressional delegations 
one key state rio de janeiro was won in the first round by 
populist leonel brizola a strong critic of collor 
in sao paulo brazils wealthiest and most populous state luiz 
antonio fleury filho of the moderate brazilian democratic movement 
party defeated paulo salim maluf of the conservative social 
democratic party in the runoff vote

former president augusto pinochet still 
is the army commander but has been losing political ground to 
patricio aylwin the elected civilian who succeeded him 
even rightwing politicians who supported the 75yearold 
general during his 16 years of military rule which ended in 
march are saying he should stay out of politics 
the annual revision of the armed forces high command this month 
gave aylwin the opportunity for a clear demonstration of his 
political authority 
for the first time since the political coup that brought him to 
power in 1973 the makeup of the high command was not determined by 
pinochet alone 
aylwin vetoed the promotions of two generals pinochet 
challenged his right to do so but aylwin was upheld by the general 
comptrollers office which rules on the legality of government 
decisions 
pinochet retained command of the army after leaving the 
presidency under a clause in the 1980 constitution the military 
regime wrote and aylwin cannot fire him 
before the transfer of power aides to aylwin predicted the 
general would retain great political authority and threaten chiles 
newly restored democratic rule that has not happened 
most observers acknowledge pinochets power has faded for 
several reasons a financial scandal involving army officers 
aylwins skillful handling of relations with the military and the 
disciplined nonpolitical attitude of the other service 
commanders 
in occasional comments to reporters pinochet insists he now is 
totally out of politics but some of his public actions suggest 
otherwise 
last may he publicly criticized aylwins establishment of a 
commission to investigate human rights abuses under the military 
regime 
in response aylwin summoned the general to the presidential 
palace and rejected the political connotations of his remarks 
later pinochet caused an international incident by saying the 
german army was made up in part of marijuana smokers drug 
addicts longhairs hommosexuals and unionists 
after aylwin condemned the comments pinochet withdrew them and 
apologized 
on sept 11 the 17th anniversary of the coup pinochet caused a 
political uproar by saying he would do it again under the same 
circumstances 
even some old supporters are putting distance between themselves 
and the general saying he has has no legitimate political role 
gen pinochet is no longer a political option in chile said 
sebastian pinera a leading rightwing senator 
another senator who was an ambassador under pinochet sided 
with aylwin in the dispute over the high command progoverment 
politicians who once feared the continued presence of pinochet as 
army commander now say they may have been wrong 
pinochet is not yet checkmated but he is nearing the end of 
his match said camilio escalona a socialist congressman 
loyalty to pinochet and support for him are believed to be firm 
in the army but only in his military capacity 
aylwin told an interviewer on state television he does not think 
he will have trouble with the army and said of pinochet 
i understand that he who ruled the country as an absolute 
master for nearly 17 years now has trouble accommodating to his new 
role subordinated to the president of the republic and to the 
minister of defense 
the conflict with aylwin on the high command caught pinochet in 
a weakened position a congressional commission is investigating an 
army payment to one of his sons of the equivalent of 3 million 
apparently for the purchase of a metallurgy plant 
newspapers have reported in recent weeks on an illegal savings 
and loan organization in which several army officers participated 
many chileans expect a decisive moment in relations between 
pinochet and the civilian government in february when the 
commission investigating human rights abuses issues its final 
report 
trials are expected to result many of them involving military 
officers 
before leaving office pinochet said repeatedly he would not 
accept trials of military men on human rights issues

state officials who fought for three 
decades to throw a woman off a strip of beachfront property slated 
to become a state park have decided she doesnt have to leave after 
all 
doris gagnon was to be evicted friday from her rundown 
collection of shacks and trailers overlooking long island sound 
but state attorney general clarine nardi riddle announced monday 
that officials have decided to let the 73yearold cancerstricken 
woman stay 
riddle said the decision was made after officials learned that 
bags of human waste had been removed from the property and other 
sanitation violations cleaned up she also said officials dont 
need the land right away 
but gagnon said health conditions at her home are no better than 
before and she accused state officials of letting her stay in the 
hope that their battle with her will end when she dies 
i wont give them the satisfaction of dying she added 
gagnon who originally owned a house on the property refused to 
sell it to the state in the 1960s the government seized it through 
eminent domain proceedings and awarded her 15000 that she refused 
to take 
she began squatting on the property after the government 
demolished her house 19 years ago state officials made no effort 
to evict her until two years ago

advocates for the homeless denounced a supreme 
court decision to keep intact a ban on subway begging 
what this decision does is gives police the authority to 
arbitrarily harass homeless and poor people said doug lasdon an 
attorney from the legal action center for the homeless 
without comment the supreme court monday declined to review the 
case lasdons group had asked it to hear the group argued the ban 
infringes on freespeech rights 
transit officials praised the high courts refusal to review the 
ban saying it will help restore order underground 
nobody likes to push around poor people said jared lebow a 
spokesman for the transit authority which runs the nations 
largest subway system with 35 million daily riders but we also 
recognize that our obligation is to people who use the system to 
get to and from work 
the ban was imposed in october 1989 the objective was to crack 
down on vagrancy in subways where many of the citys estimated 
80000 homeless people go to stay warm sleep and beg for small 
change 
no fine is imposed beggars are merely removed or directed to a 
service agency for help

police say they have no evidence that either new 
york daily news management or its unions have conspired to commit 
violent acts during the monthlong strike against the newspaper 
daily news publisher james hoge told a joint state senate and 
assembly labor panel hearing in new york city on monday that the 
newspapers nine striking unions are responsible for a series of 
violent incidents 
clearly violence and intimidation are longstanding and 
premeditated tools of these unions to lawlessly enforce their 
will he said 
union officials accused daily news management of precipitating 
attacks on strikers 
but police officials testified there was no evidence to support 
the allegations of either side 
we havent been able at this point to put together some type 
of conspiracy said chief of detectives joseph borrelli we 
dont see a conspiracy at all here as of now 
chief of department robert johnston said 107 people had been 
arrested in connection with the strike as of friday 75 of whom 
were union members seventeen were nonstrikers and 15 were people 
whose involvement was not immediately clear he said 
meanwhile daily news officials reported the newspaper expects 
to lose 30 million to 35 million during the last quarter of 190 
bringing its losses for the year to 80 million to 90 million 
the daily news lost 115 million between 1979 and 1989 said 
john t sloan the newspapers vice president for human resources 
the newspapers financial problems continued monday when another 
big company decided to pull its advertising sloan said alexanders 
department store joined macys and a amp s department stores in 
dropping its ads 
the daily news has managed to publish continuously since the 
strike began oct 25 but sloan said its circulation has fallen 
from 109 million before the strike to 508000 as of nov 16

lech walesa said today that an emigres 
strong presidential bid was a cold shower for solidarity and 
appealed to former rivals for help to defeat what he called this 
dangerous third force 
the outsider businessman stanislaw tyminski shocked reporters 
at a news conference by praising gen wojciech jaruzelskis 1981 
decision to impose martial law to crush solidarity he said the 
country then was under unusual danger from within 
meanwhile main national newspapers mourned the fall of the east 
blocs first noncommunist government after it resigned monday 
night prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis government was a good 
and right cause one said 
walesa who will face tyminski in a runoff dec 9 met the press 
in a packed conference room in gdansk and extended an olive branch 
to supporters of mazowiecki his vanquished rival within 
solidarity 
we are doomed to be together we should pull this common 
polish wagon together walesa said 
we have to complete the polish reforms this is what the prime 
minister was only saying and i am trying to actually carry 
out 
walesa polled 40 percent of the electorate in polands first 
democratic presidential elections sunday tyminski got 23 percent 
and mazowiecki 18 
walesa said he had warned that solidarity was losing support 
from the masses 
those people who were with mazowiecki who really worked so 
hard did not want to understand he said this cold shower 
will wake us all up and we will think seriously about reforms in 
poland 
now he said a third force is possible and capable of 
overthrowing us all 
lame duck president jaruzelski formally asked mazowiecki to 
carry on a caretaker government until the next president names a 
prime minister and mazowiecki agreed to stay on walesa told 
reporters he would like the smallest changes possible in 
personnel until parliamentary elections in the spring 
walesa said he would telephone mazowiecki and appeal for not 
multiplying the tension 
tyminski who lived 21 years in canada and peru running a string 
of computer and communications companies returned to his homeland 
in september and launched a bid for president 
at a packed news conference in warsaw he attacked sacred cows 
of polish political life including praising jaruzelski and damning 
mazowiecki for his economic policies and for alleged cooperation 
with communist authorities as a journalist in the early 1950s 
of jaruzelskis martiallaw decision he said i hope that 
this country understands now how much has been done for it by 
president wojciech jaruzelski because at that moment in 1981 the 
country was in unusual danger from within because the hand 
that did the injury for so many years was always our own 
they are very irresponsible he said referring to the shock 
economic reform program instituted in january to almost universal 
praise from the world financial community even if nothing had 
been done there would not be destruction on such a scale 
a radical economic restructuring plan backed by both walesa and 
mazowiecki has caused real wages in poland to plummet 35 percent 
unemployment climbed from almost zero at the start of 1990 to more 
than 1 million today 
mazowiecki in his resignation statement monday night said he had 
been brought down by lack of public patience for the sacrifices 
required to improve the economy 
polands painful but necessary program of getting out of 
economic catastrophe can only be realized with the understanding of 
the majority of the nation he said society made its choice 
the taciturn lawyerly prime minister who took office in august 
1989 after decades as a writer in the catholic opposition won 
international acclaim for his historic role in the democratization 
of his nation 
it happens that good and right causes lose said adam 
michnik editor of the promazowiecki paper gazeta wyborcza 
polands largest rational argument lost out in a dispute with 
aggressive rhetoric and faith in a miracle 
walesa and mazowiecki had been allies in the underground 
solidarity movement but have headed rival wings of the organization 
since shortly after the prime minister took office 
walesa contended reforms had to be speeded up to avert social 
unrest while mazowiecki the longtime adviser walesa had picked to 
be prime minister stuck by an independent policy of measured 
reasoned change 
mazowieckis election committee seemed to throw its support to 
walesa in a grudging way 
in a statement it described tyminskis possible election as an 
unallowable tragedy for poland and said supporters should do 
whatever serves the interests of the country

existing home sales fell 47 percent in 
october to their lowest level in nearly six years a real estate 
trade group said today 
the national association of realtors said house resales totaled 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 302 million compared to 317 
million in september it was the lowest sales rate since february 
1985 when it dropped to 295 million 
reports of persistent budget deficit woes general economic 
sluggishness nationwide and the threat of war against iraq have 
created psychological barriers that are blocking home purchases 
according to harley e rouda nar president 
mortgage interest rates which had been blamed for weak sales in 
previous months have remained relatively stable rouda noted he 
said the federal home loan mortgage corp reported the average rate 
for a 30year conventional fixedrate mortgage ranged between 
1008 percent and 1017 percent during october 
rouda said the current rates are in marked contrast to the last 
homebuying slump in 1982 when rates ranged between 160 percent 
and 180 percent and he added despite tight credit restrictions 
for commercial development projects mortgage funds remain 
plentiful for home buyers 
at the same time the realtors said the median price of an 
existing home was 92800 in october down 17 percent from 
september the median means half of the homes cost more half less 
rouda said the monthly decline and a marginal 04 percent 
increase over october 1989 means that sellers are adjusting their 
prices to fit a buyers market 
monthtomonth sales declines were recorded in each of the 
regions while all but the west posted lower median prices 
in the northeast the resale pace was 470000 units 96 percent 
below the september rate the median price was 136200 down 07 
percent from the previous month 
sales in the west totaled 490000 in october down 58 percent 
from the previous month the median price there was 140600 44 
percent higher than in september 
in the midwest sales were off 57 percent to an annual rate of 
820000 units while the median price fell 28 percent to 72100

president mikhail s gorbachev has issued his 
sharpest warning yet to saddam hussein saying iraq will soon face 
grave consequences if it doesnt withdraw from kit and release 
all hostages 
gorbachev summoned iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to the 
kremlin on monday to deliver a stern message to saddam that no one 
takes seriously baghdads claim that kuwait is iraqi territory and 
that time is running out 
unless iraq obeys un resolutions demanding its withdrawal 
gorbachev said it faces the worst consequences the official 
tass news agency reported 
gorbachev also told aziz that iraq must keep its promises to 
allow the departure of all soviet contract workers who want to go 
home 
another soviet official on monday accused iraq of reneging on an 
agreement to let about 1000 soviets leave this month it was the 
first time moscow had charged that baghdad was keeping soviet 
citizens against their will 
iraq was until recently a close ally of moscow and the soviets 
supplied baghdad with a wide array of armaments 
gorbachev accused saddam of failing to conform to accepted 
standards of morality and of turning the release of foreigners into 
a kind of bargaining tass reported 
aziz reportedly responded that the delayed evacuation of soviets 
was a bureaucratic accident 
on monday the united states finally won soviet support for a 
un resolution authorizing the use of military force against iraq 
foreign ministers are expected to meet in new york on thursday to 
take it up 
the soviet union has attemped to explore all possible diplomatic 
avenues before endorsing the use of force to push iraq from kuwait 
gorbachev and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met 
today with saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal no details 
were reported 
in addition gorbachev is sending envoys to discuss the crisis 
with iran and cuba 
he dispatched deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky to 
tehran and another foreign ministry official georgy mamedov was 
to leave later today for havana cuba is a member of the security 
council 
gorbachev appeared before the supreme soviet parliament on 
monday and forcefully warned saddam that the unity of nations 
allied against iraqi aggression cannot be broken 
answering questions from legislators about the possibility of 
hostilities in the gulf gorbachev said the crisis was a test of 
the new postcold war cooperation 
our position remains based on principles and it includes the 
following aggression is inadmissible it should be punished and 
the preaggression state should be restored gorbachev said in a 
booming voice 
he said saddams aggression could not be allowed to prevail 
because we are just moving away from the cold war when 
everything was decided from a position of force 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said iraq had agreed 
to allow 1000 soviets mostly contract workers to leave during 
november but only about 350 were permitted to do so 
about 8000 soviets including several hundred military 
advisers were in iraq and kuwait at the time of the aug 2 
invasion about 3000 left shortly after the invasion and about 
1000 more left during september and october 
if iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our 
citizens to leave this will complicate the present situation even 
further and force us to take a tougher attitude churkin said 
to his knowledge churkin said no soviets are being used as 
human shields at potential military targets

heavy weekend rains tore support cables from an adjacent span as it 
gave way threatening the main link between seattle and its eastern 
suburbs officials say

five israeli soldiers and at least two 
arab guerrillas were killed today in a clash in southern lebanon 
and israeli warplanes later attacked bases of the terrorist 
mastermind abu nidal 
the fighting began shortly after midnight near shebaa a village 
on the eastern edge of israels selfproclaimed security zone 
after israeli troops arrived by helicopter to battle a guerrilla 
unit security sources in lebanon said it was the third clash with 
palestinians in the security zone in a week 
an israeli military communique from jerusalem said the soldiers 
stormed a ring of four guerrillas who were on their way toward 
israeli territory it said in an exchange of fire at close 
range accompanied by the throwing of hand grenades five soldiers 
were killed and another was wounded 
two of the guerrillas were killed and two fled the area 
including one who was wounded the statement said 
the lebanese sources said eight guerrillas were killed in the 
fighting which they said lasted 2 hours 
there were also conflicting accounts of how the israeli soldiers 
had died 
israel radio said one guerrilla may have been carrying 
explosives on his back that blew up when he was shot israels army 
radio said at least one israeli soldier died when a grenade blew up 
in his hands 
yet another report from a lebanese source said the bodies of 
the guerrillas might have been boobytrapped 
the site of the clash is a known infiltration route to israel 
used by terrorists and the guerrillas carried explosives an 
israeli military spokesman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
george habashs marxist popular front for the liberation of 
palestine claimed in a communique from beirut that it staged the 
attack which came exactly a week after israeli troops intercepted 
another guerrilla squad in roughly the same area in that battle 
israeli troops killed four guerrillas of another radical plo group 
backed by libya the palestine popular struggle front of samir 
goshe and lost a lieutenant 
before habashs claim four israeli fighterbombers fired 12 
rockets into a hilltop position of abu nidals faction the 
fatahrevolutionary council near sidon provincial capital of 
southern lebanon 
palls of black smoke billowed from the stricken base after the 
threeminute air raid the 19th israeli air raid in lebanon this 
year there was no immediate report on casualties 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna split from yasser 
arafats mainstream guerrilla faction fatah in the early 1970s 
since then he has topped wanted lists around the world for 
masterminding scores of bloody terrorist attacks to dramatize the 
palestinian cause 
the palestine liberation organization has sentenced him to death 
for killing dozens of aides to arafat his fatahrevolutionary 
council is libyan funded and has bases in lebanon 
defense minister moshe arens said both the border attack and the 
bombing raids were part of israels constant activity by ground 
sea and air to ensure the safety of israelis in the north of 
the country 
the clash near shebaa 28 miles southeaset of sidon came two 
days after a woman suicide bomber detonated a handbag packed with 
explosives as she walked past an israeli infantry patrol in the 
security zone injuring two soldiers 
the israeli navy on saturday sank a rubber dinghy off the 
southrn lebanon coast killing five guerrillas of the prosyrian 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
the escalating violence sharpened fears that southern lebanon is 
becoming a flash point that could frustrate syrianbacked president 
elias hrawis attempts to assert government authority and end 
lebanons 15yearold civil war 
hrawi said over the weekend that he would seek international 
help to end israels occupation of the security zone once the 
government completes plans to get moslem and christian militias out 
of beirut 
israel carved out the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its 
invading army in the summer of 1985 ending a threeyear occupation 
of much of lebanon

selffunded employee health care plans which 
cover some 95 million working americans are not subject to state 
insurance laws and regulations the supreme court ruled today 
the court by a 71 vote said in the case of a seriously 
injured pennsylvania teenage girl that federal regulation of such 
plans preempts any state regulation 
selffunded plans are those in which all benefits are paid 
directly by an employer and not purchased through an independent 
insurance company 
in an opinion by justice sandra day oconnor the court said 
such health care plans are governed by the federal employee 
retirement income security act of 1974 erisa 
in view of congress clear intent to exempt from direct state 
insurance regulation erisa employee benefit plans we hold that 
erisa preempts pennsylvania law oconnor wrote 
justice john paul stevens was the sole dissenter justice david 
h souter who joined the court after the case was argued last 
month did not participate in the decision 
the illinoisbased fmc corp has a selffunded plan for its 
employees and their dependents and that plan paid for a 
substantial part of the more than 178000 in medical expenses 
incurred by cynthia ann holliday since a january 1987 automobile 
accident in indiana county pa 
miss holliday then 15 suffered permanent injuries when the car 
in which she was a passenger crashed 
her father gerald is an fmc employee 
holliday sued the cars driver robert lyons in state court 
under a settlement miss hollidays financial recovery was limited 
to 4987550 plus interest 
when fmc sought to recover some of its expenses by claiming the 
lawsuit settlement funds holliday successfully invoked a 
pennsylvania law that prohibits such action 
fmc then turned to a federal trial judge for help contending 
that the federal law erisa was meant to be the sole means of 
regulating its health care plan and that it therefore preempted 
the prohibitive pennsylvania law 
the trial judge and the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
ruled against fmc 
but todays decision reversed the lower court rulings saying 
fmc was right in its contention that the federal law superseded any 
state regulation 
the justices sent the case back to the lower courts where 
presumably fmc will be able to recover the money miss holliday won 
in the lawsuit against lyons 
fmcs appeal to the nations highest court has been supported by 
the us chamber of commerce the selfinsurance institute of 
america and numerous selffunded health and welfare plans 
the case is fmc corp vs holliday 891048

presidents proposed treaty to keep the union together 
russian reformers argued the proposal should be discussed 
thoroughly by the public before lawmakers vote on it 
quick adoption of the union treaty by the largest of the 15 
republics would have been a tremendous victory for gorbachev as he 
tries to keep the country from splintering 
it would have been a defeat for russias president boris n 
yeltsin and other republic leaders who are trying to diminish the 
central governments power approval of the union treaty would 
commit them to remain united with a strong central government 
headed by president gorbachev 
gorbachev told legislators he personally lobbied yeltsin during 
a break in the session according to the independent news service 
interfax 
naturally russias position on this question has great 
significance for without russia there is no union gorbachev 
said 
as gorbachev beamed from an isolated balcony in the grand 
kremlin palace his allies in the congress of russian peoples 
deputies tried to force yeltsin to include adoption of the treaty 
on the congress agenda 
the congress is much more loyal to gorbachev and to the central 
government than te smaller russian supreme soviet legislature 
which yeltsin easily controls the congress is holding an 
extraordinary session to discuss russias economic woes and 
consider legalizing private land ownership 
largely through sheer stubbornness yeltsin refused to allow 
hardline communists to add approval of the treaty to the agenda 
instead he called for an exchange of opinions on the treaty 
and won approval by a vote of 696 to 199 with 36 abstentions 
despite the failed endrun gorbachev insisted that in the 
end all the republics will sign the union treaty even those who 
shout against it wont be able to do anything they are all just 
loudmouths 
you carry out a referendum and everything will be clear 
gorbachev told the russian legislators according to interfax 
there has been no decision on holding a referendum on the union 
treaty gorbachev has said repeatedly that he believes most 
citizens want the soviet union to remain whole 
however leaders of six of the 15 republics have said they will 
not sign the new union treaty they are the ukraine georgia 
armenia latvia lithuania and estonia 
yeltsin said earlier this month that russia would not sign the 
treaty unless the republics real sovereignty could be assured 
and unless the issue of resource ownership was resolved 
the proposed treaty would give republics control over most areas 
except defense and the monetary system the central government and 
the republics would share responsibility for economic development 
transportation energy and the space program 
on a more conciliatory note yeltsin told lawmakers that 
continued confrontation between russia and the national government 
was unacceptable 
speaking of his personal differences with gorbachev he said 
for such a struggle we simply dont have any more time 
yeltsin said the russian leadership understood the central 
governments importance to the normal functioning of our and 
other republics 
but he insisted we cannot agree to anybodys interference with 
problems we can solve ourselves better than anyone else we shall 
do all we can to change this situation 
responsibility for the worsening of the republics affairs 
must be carried by federal bodies and destructive forces in the 
republic yeltsin said 
he vowed that russia would use only political methods to 
solve its problems and said the army must not be used for any 
political purpose 
yeltsin said the main task of the congress was to discuss how to 
feed the russian people during the winter he said this task 
threatened to overshadow all other issues 
delays in solving this problem threaten russias revival he 
warned

the united states has won the backing of 
the soviet union china britain and france for a un resolution 
threatening to use all necessary means to drive iraq from 
kuwait if it does not leave by january 
meanwhile 18 foreigners including three americans arrived in 
the jordanian capital today after being freed by iraqi officials 
the americans were released after their relatives went to baghdad 
to plead for their freedom 
at the urgent request of kuwait the security council was 
meeting today to hear accusations of iraqi terror torture 
imprisonment and summary executions in the emirate some kuwaiti 
refugees were to tell the council their stories 
but the focus was on security council action anticipated later 
in the week with mondays agreement on the useofforce measure 
among the five permanent members the broad coalition the united 
states has mustered against saddam hussein crossed a crucial 
threshold 
there had been speculation the soviets and chinese might abstain 
on the resolution which the 15member council is expected to take 
up on thursday 
secretary of state james a baker iii has traveled the globe for 
weeks seeking support from security council members for the 
useofforce resolution 
soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov said on monday he was 
enthusiastic about the new measure the security council has 
already passed 10 resolutions condeming iraqs aug 2 seizure of 
kuwait and imposing trade sanctions 
this may be the last resolution on the persian gulf crisis 
vorontsov said because we all hope that after this a peaceful 
settlement will be possible 
king fahd of saudi arabia where most of the multinational force 
is deployed has appealed to saddam to let reason prevail and 
withdraw unconditionally from kuwait 
we do not want to see a tragedy befall iraq the saudi 
monarch said the remarks made to a citizens group in saudi 
arabia over the weekend were circulated by saudi media today 
saudi arabias foreign minister prince saud alfaisal arrived 
in moscow today for talks with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the soviet foreign minister the official tass news 
agency reported 
gorbachev met with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in the 
kremlin on monday after telling lawmakers the alliance against iraq 
would not be broken and said aggression should be punished 
another soviet official foreign ministry spokesman vitaly 
churkin accused iraq of preventing hundreds of soviet citizens 
from leaving iraq 
it was the first time moscow had charged that baghdad was 
keeping its citizens against their will 
aziz returned to baghdad on monday night and accused the 
security council of pursuing a double standard by calling for 
iraqs pullout from kuwait without similarly pressuring israel to 
leave the occupied territories 
iraq will continue to struggle steadfastly to realize peace 
and justice in the region and to restore first and foremost the 
palestinian arab peoples rights aziz said on iraqi radio 
under the draft un resolution iraq would have to release all 
foreign hostages withdraw its troops and restore kuwaits 
government by jan 1 or jan 15 the security council members have 
not yet fixed a date and the draft contains both dates as options 
it is a pause in which were all making clear that no new 
measures will be taken against iraq prior to the end of that 
period after which the authorization to use all measures which is 
of course the united nations language for measures which include 
the use of force will become available said british ambassador 
david hannay 
the resolution would authorize member states cooperating with 
the government of kuwait to use all necessary means to uphold 
and implement the security council resolutions passed in response 
to iraqs invasion and occupation of kuwait and to restore 
international peace and security 
it cites chapter 7 of the un charter which authorizes the use 
of military force to counter aggression if sanctions and other 
steps fail the only other time military force was sanctioned by 
the united nations was in 1950 during the korean conflict 
the foreign ministers of most security council members are 
expected to gather in new york on thursday to adopt the resolution 
with baker presiding 
the resolution is supported by at least six of the nonpermanent 
council members canada finland romania ivory coast zaire 
ethiopia 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon said his country could not 
support it yemen the councils only arab member is believed 
likely to abstain or vote against it malaysia and colombias votes 
are uncertain 
a resolution requires at least nine votes to pass so long as 
none of the permanent members vetoes it 
britain and the united states favor a jan 1 deadline but us 
officials in washington indicated the resolution and date are 
negotiable french foreign minister roland dumas said today that he 
favors a jan 15 deadline 
the freed foreigners who arrived in jordan today are three 
americans 10 britons and five germans the americans are john 
stevenson of panama city fla fred harrington of bellevue wash 
and clyde jesse of buffalo grove ill 
in another development a spanish navy corvette assisting the 
us cruiser philippine sea and a french destroyer fired warning 
shots to help stop and iraqi freighter early today in the red sea 
spanish officials said 
the iraqi vessel was allowed to continue on its way after it was 
inspected by a us navy boarding party and found to be carrying no 
goods that violated the united nations embargo

sen sam nunn the chairman of the senate 
armed services committee questioned today whether it is in the 
vital interest of the united states to liberate kuwait from iraqi 
invaders 
the georgia democrat said president bushs decision to send 
200000 more troops to the persian gulf signals a fundamental shift 
in policy that raises a number of serious questions 
is it in our vital interest to liberate kuwait how long can 
we sustain more than 400000 troops has president bush limited his 
options by creating a useitorloseit situation nunn asked at 
the start of four days of hearings by his panel on bushs gulf 
policy 
the hearings were prompted by bushs decision earlier this month 
to send more troops and build an offensive military option with 
a force that will total about 430000 in the region by january 
the decision touched off demands by many members of congress for 
closer collaboration with the white house on gulf policy 
nunn indicated his support for a possible united nations 
resolution authorizing military force against iraq unless saddam 
husseins troops leave kuwait the security council is expected to 
act on the measure this week 
however he said this is not a substitute for fully informing 
the american people 
sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the committee said 
it is not enough for president bush to go to the united nations 
to get approval for the use of military force in the persian gulf 
he must also come to congress 
james schlesinger former secretary of defense and onetime cia 
director was the first witness at the hearings 
nunn had envisioned that defense secretarydick cheney and gen 
colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff would kick 
off the hearings 
however cheney and powell will delay their appearances before 
the panel until next week after united nations security council 
action on a resolution authorizing military force against iraq 
unless saddam husseins troops leave kuwait 
the panels ranking republican sen john warner of virginia 
said cheney had delayed his testimony until next monday to have a 
report from secretary of state baker on the un resolution 
secretary james a baker iii is in new york to press the 
security council to approve the resolution baker is to testify 
dec 5 before the senate foreign relations committee 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said monday that cheney and 
powell were not too eager to testify while the united nations 
was debating the resolution powell is scheduled to testify with 
cheney on monday 
the absence of the administrations top defense officials and 
the lack of a guarantee they would testify at all fueled 
speculation about a struggle between nunn a possible 1992 
democratic challenger for bushs job and the white house 
nunn has been critical of the administrations policy since bush 
announced the additional deployment of troops earlier this month 
a republican on the armed services committee sen malcolm 
wallop of wyoming called the hearings illtimed while the 
administration is trying to finish the diplomatic end game 
the timing of the hearings he said is what you do when your 
purpose is more political than policy not partisan politics 
national politics the chairman is opening a presidential 
campaign wallop said referring to nunn 
meanwhile rep patricia schroeder dcolo asked that the 
house be called back from adjournment to discuss the un 
resolution lest war be raging by the time congress returns in 
january 
schroeder a senior member of the house armed services 
committee had contended two weeks ago it would be useless for 
congress to return in a special session to debate a hypothetical 
action all of a sudden the time has come she said in a 
telephone interview 
several congressional leaders including senate republican 
leader bob dole asked earlier this month for a special session 
but that idea quickly died instead senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine called for hearings by several panels

a snowstorm today coated firefighters and their 
equipment with ice but officials were confident they had a handle 
on a blaze feeding on millions of gallons of jet fuel at stapleton 
international airport 
the flames are not near as intense as they have been things 
are boiling down to a simmer said fire department spokesman mike 
mcneill 
as snow fell about 60 firefighters sprayed water and foam on 
the fire burning an 800000gallon tank and a 350000gallon tank 
the fire today did not pose a threat to the eight other storage 
tanks a halfmile from the airport tower officials said 
the fire which started sunday reduced two 400000gallon tanks 
to smoldering crumpled hulks the tank farm had a 125million 
gallon capacity 
mcneill said he expected one of the tanks to burn itself out by 
midafternoon and the other by sometime wednesday 
this is a little fire by comparison to what it was airport 
spokesman richard boulware said today 
temperatures dropped below freezing monday night and the 
sprayed water froze on firefighters clothing and equipment snow 
from the storm that began shortly before midnight monday added 
moisture but also left dangerous layers of ice 
the storm also knocked out pumps that firefighters had hoped to 
use to drain fuel 
fire chief richard gonzales said all firefighters can do is let 
the fire burn itself out 
youve got to let it consume itself you physically cant 
smother it gonzales said 
the cause of the blaze was under investigation 
temperatures near the fire reached 3500 degrees well beyond 
the melting point of iron and too hot for investigators to inspect 
control valves where the flames were first spotted the valves are 
under several feet of water and foam 
we dont know whats left down there at all said arson 
investigator ted baldwin 
a maintenance man performed routine chores 2 hours before the 
blaze was spotted said george doughty denver aviation director 
he also said there was no apparent breakin of the 8foot 
chainlink fence capped with barbed wire 
united airlines which owned the tanks said it lost 26 million 
gallons of fuel to the fire including about 400000 from a 24inch 
pipeline but that all but a few of the airlines flights departed 
on time monday 
no other airlines operations were affected monday 
firefighters by midday monday had used 15000 gallons of foam to 
contain the blaze and had poured about 24 million gallons of water 
on the fire approximately onefourth of denvers water use on an 
average fall day 
the tanks that were destroyed were built in 1976 and probably 
wont be replaced a new airport is scheduled for completion in the 
mid1990s 
in the interim doughty said fuel will be stored in a pair of 
milliongallon tanks built in 1985 for a nowdefunct airline 
city officials said the new airport will feature a safer design 
new building codes require control valves to be farther from the 
tanks so they can be shut off during a fire

iraqi soldiers in kuwait have killed 
children in front of their parents and tortured prisoners with 
electric shocks and by beating the soles of their feet kuwaits 
governmentinexile said today 
kuwaiti un ambassador mohammad abulhasan said 116 days have 
passed since the flagrant iraqi aggression against all 
international laws and covenants especially against the laws and 
values of our islamic religion 
individual and mass arrests are unabated brutal torture of 
kuwaitis continues in kuwait itself and in iraqi prisons 
abulhasan said 
kuwait introduced a draft resolution before the security council 
asking the united nations to take custody of all its census and 
demographic records which were smuggled out of kuwait on 25 
computer discs after the aug 2 invasion 
iraq has been seizing and destroying all citizenship records 
from kuwaiti citizens in an attempt to erase their national 
identity and has moved more than 100000 iraqis into occupied 
kuwait to change its demographic character 
as the security council members began their session they gazed 
at enlargements of color photographs placed in the council chamber 
showing mutilated kuwaiti citizens 
at the urgent request of kuwait the security council took up 
the issue today and wednesday hearing from six or seven kuwaiti 
refugees who escaped their homeland 
the security councils rules allow nondiplomats to address the 
body but un officials with up to 30 years experience said they 
could not recall the council ever hearing such testimony 
the debate on alleged iraqi brutality is expected to harden the 
security councils resolve for thursday when the five permanent 
members introduce a resolution that would allow usallied troops 
to drive iraq from kuwait if saddam hussein does not withdraw by 
january 
abulhasan also plans to show the council members videotape to 
support his assertions 
iraq has denied kuwaits accusations of rights abuse since its 
invasion of kuwait and no longer replies to individual allegations 
abulhasans charges could not be independently verified 
in a letter to the security council abulhasan said that over 
the last three weeks the occupying forces have shown their true 
colors and revealed themselves as perfidious and depraved 
he cited eyewitness accounts of the murder of children 
including a palestinian who said he and other drivers were detained 
in kuwait 
then the street they were in was cleared and all who lived 
there were interrogated the soldiers then opened fire on five 
little kuwaiti girls who were blindfolded abulhasan said 
in another incident iraqi soldiers opened fire and killed 
three kuwaiti children in front of a supermarket 
the children aged 7 to 8 years old were innocently chanting 
the national anthem of kuwait and shouting the name of sheikh jaber 
alahmed alsabah the emir as a group of iraqi soldiers opened 
fire and shot them dead in front of their mother who had a nervous 
breakdown abulhasan said 
in another instance army troops arrested three small girls ten 
days later they returned them to their homes and opened fire on 
them in full view of their parents said abulhasan 
mullahs at mosques who did not cooperate in spreading propaganda 
for saddams ruling baath party have been killed or tortured he 
said 
torture victims including indians moroccans egyptians and 
kuwaitis report a typical pattern of abuse said abulhasan 
detainees were continually tortured by havin electric cables 
attached to sensitive parts of their bodies and were whipped on the 
soles of the feet until they bled abulhasan said

a top state official claims his idea of 
burning marijuana to generate electrcity is far from a pipe dream 
new south wales state minerals and energy minister neil pickard 
told parliament on tuesday that he had asked the electricity 
commission to examine the possibility of burning confiscated pot 
crops to generate electricity 
marijuana burns at extremely high temperatures and gives off 
considerable heat energy he said 
pickards comments were greeted with uproarious laughter but he 
said it was a serious proposition 
he said burning marijuana would be cheaper than coal and produce 
about as much energy the electricity commission would look into 
what modifications would be needed for power stations to handle 
marijuana as well as coal pickard said 
he said the states power stations use an average of 20 million 
tons of coal a year

the government declared a state of 
emergency today following weeks of violence by opposition forces 
demanding the resignation of president hussain mohammed ershad 
ershad said in a televised speech that the emergency was being 
imposed to safeguard the countrys internal security in the face of 
what he called a conspiracy to destroy the nations economy 
the proclamation suspended all civil rights and imposed press 
censorship an indefinite curfew was imposed on dhaka the capital 
city of 7 million people and the government arrested a top 
opposition leader 
the action followed another day of rioting which left one person 
dead and an estimated 100 injured 
students poured into the streets of the dhaka university campus 
a focus of many antigovernment demonstrations shouting we 
dont accept the emergency and down with ershad 
sheik hasina leader of the awami league was taken from her 
husbands home in dhaka and was later shifted to the residence of 
her late father former president sheik mujibur rahman her 
spokesman said 
soon after news of her arrest spread thousands of people took to 
the street protesting her detention witnesses said the turmoil 
prompted the government to announce the curfew 
the opposition has been demanding that ershad quit and allow an 
interim government to suprevise presidential elections claiming a 
fair vote was impossible under his rule 
ershad has refused to step aside but has called an election for 
next year and invited international observers to attend including 
former president jimmy carter 
ershad a former army general seized power in a bloodless coup 
in 1982 he later retired from the military and stood twice for 
elections which diplomats and journalists said were rigged in his 
favor 
a teacher at dhaka university was shot and killed earlier today 
in a battle between rival opposition factions in the third day of 
political violence on the campus 
more than 30 students were wounded when dissidents in the 
student faction of the bangladesh nationalist party attacked a 
march by students from an umbrella group of opposition parties 
the rival student groups clashed with guns bombs and other 
lethal weapons witnesses said dr shamsul alam milon a teacher 
at dhaka medical colleges died of bullet wounds and doctors said 
one student was serious wounded 
it is difficult to get an exact count of casualties because many 
wounded students avoid hospitals where they may be arrested on 
charges of rioting for which they could be jailed for up to seven 
years 
the rift in the bangladesh nationalist partys student 
supporters worsened after party leader khaleda zia expelled six 
students for hooliganism and antiparty activities last week 
campus sources said the dissidents fired on a procession of 
students including mrs zias supporters who were marching to 
condemn what they called terrorism on campus the clash quickly 
caused trouble in other areas around the university 
milon was the second casualty of this weeks campus unrest 
following the death monday of a worker at the student dormitories 
eight people were killed last month by police during 
antigovernment riots 
in a separate incident 30 more students were injured in a 
pitched battle with police using batons and tear gas the students 
were protesting the arrest of mostafa mohsin montu leader of the 
student wing of the awami league 
witnesses said the second incident began when several thousand 
students pelted a police van with stones as it took the awami 
league leader montu from his home when police responded with 
tear gas the mob rampaged through the streets vandalizing shops 
and vehicles police and paramilitary forces rushed to the area to 
prevent the riot from spreading 
the bangladesh nationalist party and the awami league are 
leading the antiershad campaign but their followers frequently 
clash with each other and among themselves

increased fighting between israel and 
guerrillas in southern lebanon could undermine president elias 
hrawis effort to disband unruly militias and extend state 
authority after 15 years of civil war 
palestinian leftist and moslem guerrilla factions apparently 
are stepping up their attacks on the israelis and their militia 
allies israel is expected to retaliate by intensifying its 
military actions in the volatile region 
in the past week israel has intercepted four guerrilla raids by 
land and sea six israelis and 19 guerrillas have been killed 
the israeli casualties are the worst since eight soldiers were 
killed in a car bombing in israels selfdeclared security zone 
in southern lebanon oct 19 1988 the two bombers were also 
killed 
the israelis retaliated for the latest raid monday night with 
air strikes tuesday on bases used by terrorist mastermind abu 
nidals guerrillas and the radical popular front for the liberation 
of palestine it was the 19th air raid on lebanese targets this 
year 
since the palestinians moved into southern lebanon in 1970 the 
region has been in the grip of an endless cycle of violence 
guerrilla attacks provoked israeli reprisals and at least two 
israeli invasions in 1978 and 1982 thousands of people have been 
killed 
there are about 5000 hardcore plo guerrillas in the south and 
hundreds more from other factions 
the israelis say they have not detected any major influx of 
guerrillas following the withdrawal this month of christian and 
moslem militias from beirut under hrawis drive to demilitarize the 
capital area as part of an arab leaguebrokered peace plan 
but shiite moslem militias say they have evacuated hundreds of 
fighters and heavy weapons from their beirut strongholds 
the israelis have voiced alarm at a peace treaty between the 
iranianbacked shiite hezbollah or party of god and the 
syrianbacked shiite amal movement the pact ended a threeyear 
power struggle between the factions for the time being at least 
that accord brokered by syria and iran called for joint 
operations against the israelis in southern lebanon 
the israelis believe that signals an intensification of attacks 
on the security zone by the fundamentalist hezbollah 
the commander of israels northern sector gen yossi peled 
said in an interview with israel radio last week it would be 
natural for amal and hezbollah to shift their hostility toward us 
after theyve decided to stop fighting each other 
israel carved out the 440squaremile security zone when it 
withdrew the bulk of its army in mid1985 after a threeyear 
occupation of southern lebanon 
the zone which runs from the mediterranean coast in the west to 
the slopes of mount hermon in the east serves as a buffer against 
guerrilla attacks on northern israel it is manned by 1000 
israelis and 3000 militiamen of the mainly christian 
israeliarmed south lebanon army 
political sources in beirut speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the violence in the south could thwart hrawis hopes of 
disarming lebanons private armies 
hrawi can try to move against militias that challenge state 
authority but neither hrawi nor syria would try to crush a militia 
that vows to fight israel at least under the slogan of liberating 
lebanese territory said a prominent moslem politician speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
hrawi would either have to get the lebanese army involved in 
effective resistance efforts against israel very risky because it 
might provoke another israeli invasion or forget about disbanding 
the militias the politician said 
hrawi like his predecessors demands the israelis abandon the 
occupied zone in the south 
the syrians the real power in much of lebanon have said they 
will not leave lebanon until the israelis do and the israelis 
have shown no sign of doing that

eighteen foreigners three americans 10 
britons and five germans arrived in the jordanian capital today 
after being freed by president saddam hussein of iraq 
the americans waving iraqi and american flags and the britons 
were released after their relatives went to baghdad to plead for 
their freedom 
john stevenson of panama city fla fred harrington of 
bellevue wash and clyde jesse of buffalo grove ill complained 
they were ignored by the bush administration they said only their 
relatives helped free them 
the bush administration has refused to negotiate the release of 
american hostages saying iraq should free them all 
unconditionally the state department has urged americans not to go 
to iraq saying they could become hostages themselves or play into 
the hands of iraqi propagandists 
i believe it is time we started talking said jesse whose 
freedom was secured by his wife honey after she flew to baghdad 
on thanksgiving day 
perhaps it is time we women did the work mrs jesse said 
smiling and snuggling close to her husband who was wearing a neck 
brace that he refused to comment on we work better where men 
fail she added 
jesse was among the westerners rounded by the iraqis a few days 
after the takeover of kuwait while his wife left the occupied 
emirate on sept 1 
stevenson a computer specialist who worked in kuwait for 11 
years was released after his twin sister mary trundy of brockton 
mass his brothers bill stevenson of panama city fla and james 
stevenson of sarasota fla visited baghdad 
harringon was freed when his son vala fouroohi flew to 
baghdad 
the 18 freed foreigners reached amman aboard two iraqi airways 
flights 
the five germans had been in hiding in kuwait since aug 7 five 
days after iraq seized control of the persian gulf emirate 
the germans said they could not reach baghdad in time to join 
104 of their countrymen who flew out of the iraqi capital on sunday 
after saddam ordered the release of all german nationals 
the britons were freed after their wives or daughters flew to 
baghdad and met with saddam who ordered their release in 
appreciation of the womens visit and the role of women in 
general 
the americans relatives also met widam 
the americans and the britons were accompanied by their 
relatives the women in the british group carried flowers the 
americans waved the us and iraqi flags 
the germans expressed concern for westerners left behind 
hundreds of foreigners have been barred from leaving iraq and 
kuwait and some are being held at strategic sites in hope of 
warding off any attack by the usled multinational force 
there are a lot of people still hiding in various parts of 
kuwait wruck uwe a german commercial photographer the 
telephone system in kuwait is still good and we kept in touch with 
a lot of others like us 
according to us state department figures more than 900000 of 
the estimated 3 million foreigners who were in kuwait and iraq on 
aug 2 have left 
the remaining 2 million the vast majority asian and arab 
workers are expected to try to depart 
some foreigners mostly women married to iraqis or kuwaitis 
have elected to stay some governments and independent public 
figures have negotiated the release of their nationals 
saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for guarantees 
he will not be attacked on nov 18 he offered to free all 
foreigners between dec 25 and march 25 apparently seeking to 
forestall a usled assault 
western governments and others have said they will not negotiate 
any releases because they believe saddam is trying to divide the 
coalition assembled against him since the occupation of kuwait 
however former officials from several nations have gone to 
baghdad and won the release of their citizens the missions have 
drawn criticism but have resulted in the release of some hostages

a federal appeals court today refused to 
reconsider its decision setting aside former white house aide 
oliver l norths three felony irancontra convictions 
the us circuit court of appeals denied a petition by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh that the 12member court 
rehear the case decided july 20 by a split threejudge panel 
the decision sends the case back to us district judge gerhard 
a gesell who must hold a hearing to determine if the 1987 
testimony north gave congress under a limited grant of immunity 
from prosecution had unfairly seeped into the trial 
walsh probably will appeal todays decision to the supreme 
court an action that would delay the lower court hearing if the 
justices agree to consider the case 
walsh issued a statement today saying we appreciate the 
extended consideration that was given to our petition for 
rehearing we are studying the opinions and in all probability will 
petition the supreme court because of the importance of the 
questions involved 
in its july 20 decision the threejudge panel set aside the 
three convictions pending such a hearing by gesell it also 
reversed outright one of the convictions ruling that gesell had 
given improper jury instructions on two points 
north was convicted of helping to prepare a false chronology of 
the irancontra affair for congress altering or destroying 
national security council documents and accepting an illegal 
gratuity the installation of a security fence outside his home 
gesell placed the retired marine lieutenant colonel on 
probation fined him 150000 and ordered him to perform 1200 
hours of community service 
the appeals court did not indicate how its members voted on 
whether to rehear the case though two judges did not participate 
for undisclosed reasons seven votes are needed for the full court 
to rehear a case already decided by a threejudge panel 
in a separate order the threejudge panel reaffirmed all but 
one section of its july 20 opinion the change did not affect the 
outcome of the 21 decision which drew a dissent at the time from 
chief judge patricia wald 
the panel withdrew a section of its july 20 opinion stating that 
gesell had improperly instructed the jury on how to reach a 
unanimous verdict on the count involving destruction of documents 
the panel admitted that it had misread the trial record and 
found that gesell had given a proper instruction on reaching a 
unanimous verdict on that count 
but the panel again over walds dissent stuck by its earlier 
decision that gesell had improperly told the jury to ignore 
evidence that north thought he was acting with authority of his 
superiors in the reagan administration when he altered or destroyed 
documents 
judge ruth b ginsburg dissented from the full courts refusal 
to reconsider this question 
a majority of the panel held that a government official may 
not be convicted of altering concealing or shredding official 
documents if he believed however unreasonably that his actions 
were legal ginsburg wrote of the july decision by circuit judges 
laurence silberman and david sentelle two appointees of president 
reagan 
a federal grand jury still is investigating the roles of other 
reagan administration officials in the irancontra affair north 
has used the july 20 decision as a basis for refusing to testify 
before that panel he had been questioned several times by the 
grand jury before that decision

former banking regulator edwin j gray said 
today that sen dennis deconcini offered a deal in a 1987 meeting 
to have a disputed regulation withdrawn on behalf of charles 
keatings lincoln savings and loan association 
gray in dramatic testimony before the senate ethics committee 
described the april 2 1987 meeting he had with the deconcini an 
arizona democrat and three other senators 
gray said deconcini asked him to withdraw a federal home loan 
bank board regulation limiting the ability of statechartered 
savings and loans such as keatings to make risky speculative 
investments 
the exregulator also said that deconcini said that in return 
lincoln would be willing to make more home mortgage loans the 
traditional business of savings and loans 
deconcini said were very concerned about this direct 
investment regulation of yours were concerned its 
unconstitutional wed like you to withdraw it until we can find 
out if its constitutional if you can do that well get our 
friend at lincoln to make more home loans 
gray said he told the senators he would not do that and the 
senators went on to other issues raising concerns about the length 
of the bank boards examination of lincoln and its appraisal of 
lincolns assets 
none of the socalled keating five senators under investigation 
by the ethics panel were present for grays testimony the 
committeewas holding its sixth day of hearings into allegations 
the senators improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of 
keating a major financial contributor to the campaigns of each 
besides deconcini senators under scrutiny are republican john 
mccain of arizona and democrats john glenn of ohio alan cranston 
of california and donald riegle of michigan all but riegle 
attended the april 2 1987 meeting with gray and all five 
attended a meeting with san franciscobased regulators a week 
later after being referred by gray 
gray said that deconcini was the least passive of the four 
senators in the meeting but that all asked questions 
i considered it to be improper gray said of the session 
gray said deconcini was the host of the meeting and opened it by 
saying were here to talk about our friend from lincoln 
savings 
no aides were present gray said his office had been instructed 
by deconcinis office for no staff to be present a directive 
deconcini denies issuing 
gray who was the reagan administrations chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board from 1983 to 1987 said he felt 
intimidated by the meeting with four senators he stressed that 
deconcini used the word we in making the request 
i felt awkward and pressured he said the whole setting 
was an intimidating one under these circumstances because i had 
never had a meeting like this before 
but under repeated questioning by the committees special 
counsel robert s bennett gray said he never protested to the 
senators that the meeting was improper and he said they never 
threatened him by taking action against legislation he wanted to 
strengthen the boards ability to shut down bankrupt thrifts 
i needed their votes desperately for the legislation we were 
pushing it was not my intent to get in a fight with these people 
when i needed their votes gray said 
gray also testified that a month earlier riegle was the first 
senator to raise the issue of keatings thrift and its opposition 
to regulations limiting its ability to invest directly in 
speculative ventures 
he pulled me aside and said you know there are some senators 
out west who are very unhappy about the bank boards handling of 
lincoln and i think you ought to talk to them gray said 
gray said he protested that keating had been telling people the 
two were feuding and that gray had a vendetta against him 
something he said was untrue i went through how charles keating 
had been making these accusations he said 
keatings irvine calif institution collapsed and was seized 
by the federal government in 1989 its cost to taxpayers estimated 
at 2 billion has made it a symbol of the savings and loan 
industry debacle 
gray read a 13page opening statement monday that recalled how 
the easing of federal controls in the 1980s fueled the savings and 
loan crisis 
gray described lincoln as a cash cow able to use federally 
insured deposits to buy and sell stocks participate in leveraged 
buyouts build and run hotels operate real estate ventures and 
engage in other risky direct equity investments

the pentagon said today its latest estimates 
indicate iraq has 450000 troops in the kuwaiti theater of 
operations an increase of 20000 over last week 
pete williams the pentagon spokesman said half the troops are 
inside kuwait itself the troops are mainly defensive in nature 
but have the ability to go on the offensive if necessary he 
said 
according to the pentagons most recent estimate iraq has 3600 
tanks in the area up from 3500 last week 2200 armored personnel 
carriers and 2400 pieces of artillery an increase of 100 pieces 
williams said the latest estimates reflect the finetuning 
of us figures as well as iraqi troop movements 
iraq continues to move forces around within iraq and within 
the kuwaiti theater of operations he said 
williams said the any iraqi buildup in the kuwaiti theater is a 
further indication that saddam hussein has no intention of 
complying with un resolutions seeking to force his withdrawal 
from kuwait 
while the iraqis appear to be moving more people into the kuwait 
region the defense department has no evidence that iraq has moved 
on its pledge of last week to activate new divisions and call up 
additional reservists we havent seen any sign of that yet 
williams said 
president bush announced recently that the united states would 
increase its troop levels in the persian gulf by 200000 some 
230000 troops are already in the area mainly in saudi arabia

about 85 percent of the rocky shores oiled 
in the exxon valdez disaster have been sufficiently cleaned 
alaskas oilspill coordinator said as the state released next 
years cleanup plan 
the last 15 percent might come hard but theres just not all 
that much left to do ernie piper said monday 
the plan repeats the states contention that exxon corp should 
complete the cleanup next year it is intended to clarify which 
areas the state believes still need treatment 
next summer the big tough decision is going to be made how 
much oil to leave behind piper said its one of the biggest 
decisions since statehood 
the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil in prince william sound after it struck a reef on march 
24 1989 a total of 1285 miles of shore extending into the gulf 
of alaska were coated with oil and countless birds and sea mammals 
were killed 
the plan includes a summary of conditions at 757 shoreline 
segments based on a fall survey the state has determined 404 of 
those segments need no more treatment 
oil remains at many of the 404 sites mostly under the surface 
but the plan says the state considers it neither technically 
possible nor environmentally practical to remove all remaining 
contamination 
in a news release gov steve cowper said the state coast 
guard and exxon have made substantial progress throughout the spill 
area many areas are free of oil however there are limits to what 
we can and should do 
its somewhat misleading to say the sites have been cleaned 
piper said what the state is saying is that everything that can be 
done has been done at the approved sites 
theres no such thing as a successful oilspill cleanup he 
said if you get oil on a beach after a spill youre not going 
to get it all cleaned up 
the shore figures do not include kodiak island sites which 
could not be listed because of a computer programming problem but 
nearly all of the islands shores need no more treatment piper 
said 
exxon spokesman karsten rodvik in anchorage said the company was 
reviewing the plan and would have no immediate comment the company 
will make no decision on next years cleanup until a new shore 
survey is completed next spring he said 
the nations largest oil company has spent more than 22 
billion on the cleanup and paid more than 240 million in claims to 
those who suffered damages from the spill

treasury chief john major finished ahead of two 
rivals but fell short of a necessary majority today in the race to 
succeed prime minister margaret thatcher 
a third and final ballot by the 372 conservative party members 
of the house of commons will be conducted thursday 
major won 185 votes two less than the simple majority required 
for election former defense secretary michael heseltine had 131 
votes and foreign secretary douglas hurd had 56 votes 
heseltine immediately announced that he would vote for major on 
thursday and hurd also conceded that major would win the race 
major 47 and heseltine 57 had been considered the 
frontrunners heading into the secondround ballot 
mrs thatcher who had withdrawn from the contest last week 
following the firstround vote and had given her support to major 
remains prime minister at least until thursday night 
hurd said that the party rules required a third ballot even 
though he and heseltine had conceded that major would be the 
winner 
a week ago voting in the same committee room at the house of 
commons legislators forced the downfall of mrs thatcher 
she received more votes than heseltine 57 but failed to gain 
the 15 percent margin required for an outright victory 
mrs thatcher withdrew from the balloting thursday after party 
leaders warned she would lose the second round 
major and hurd immediately entered the race 
mrs thatcher says she will submit her resignation to queen 
elizabeth ii soon after her successor is chosen ending 11 years 
in power 
lawmakers faced a dilemma in todays vote 
major chancellor of the exchequer has the most support in the 
cabinet and possibly the party in parliament but polls indicate 
the flamboyant heseltine is the most popular with voters and thus 
the most likely to lead conservatives to victory in the next 
election which must be held by mid1992 
hurd 60 hoped to squeeze through on thursday as the consensus 
second choice his supporters argue that as britains spokesman 
throughout the persian gulf crisis he is the best leader to carry 
on mrs thatchers hawkish policy 
mrs thatcher however supported major the son of a circus 
performer 
she looks upon him as the true man of the people said a 
thatcher aide 
major left school at 16 never went to college worked as a 
laborer and was on welfare before becoming a banker he was elected 
to parliament in 1979 when mrs thatcher came to power and was in 
the cabinet four years later as treasury secretary 
mrs thatcher appointed him foreign secretary last year then 
chancellor 
opinion polls published after mrs thatchers downfall indicate 
that the oxfordeducated heseltine is the publics first choice as 
prime minister followed by major 
the polls also suggested that mrs thatchers departure has 
restored her partys fortunes after trailing the opposition labor 
party for six months in polls the latest soundings suggest the 
tories would run well ahead of labor under heseltine or major but 
it was close with hurd 
heseltine who quit the thatcher cabinet in 1986 has portrayed 
himself as a thatcherlike character the only one with the 
determination to walk out instead of getting dropped the one with 
the guts to challenge her 
im perhaps too similar to mrs thatcher he said in a 
weekend television interview in the end were people you can 
trust and who stand up and say what we think and stick to it 
the leadership contest which brought down mrs thatcher 65 was 
precipitated b increasing divisions over her combative stance 
toward the european community 
but her aides say the root causes were rising inflation and 
unemployment compounded by an unpopular new local government tax 
and a growing army of enemies among sacked cabinet ministers and 
neverpromoted legislators 
mrs thatcher appeared in good spirits at a farewell party 
monday night for her staff of 200 at 10 downing street 
life begins at 65 and i shall be working for the future she 
told them 
she doesnt want to go out with a lot of backbiting her 
press secretary bernard ingham said monday its a rough old 
world and i dont think she would have it any other way

a shortage of milk is the latest consumer crisis 
to strike the capital which already has endured scarcities this 
year of such staples as bread sugar cigarettes and potatoes 
under the scare headline even the children of moscow might be 
left without milk if tuesdays editionsof moskovsky 
komsomolets reported that the 18 regions shipping milk to moscow 
are sending fewer supplies 
since the beginning of 1990 moscow has received 100000 fewer 
tons of milk the newspaper said without reporting the total as a 
result production of processed cheese cottage cheese and sour 
cream have been cut 
a clerk at a mostly barren supermarket in moscows taganskaya 
neighborhood confirmed the store was getting less milk with daily 
supplies that usually last until about 6 pm now running out by 
noon scores of people were seen lining up at dairy stores tuesday 
russian republic president boris n yeltsin warned russian 
legislators tuesday that food shortages have nearly overshadowed 
all other issues 
delays in solving this problem threaten russias revival 
yeltsin said 
deputy moscow mayor sergei b stankevich said monday that nine 
regions in russia have announced that they were stopping deliveries 
to the capital pushing residents fearful of a hungry winter to 
the edge of another crisis 
stankevich also blamed the milk crisis on shopping sprees and 
hoarding last week several rushhour shoppers riding moscows 
subway were seen carrying four and five of the lightblue 
oneliter milk cartons apiece 
moscow and leningrad the soviet unions two biggest cities 
traditionally have been spared the shortages that have struck other 
cities in previous years they no longer are immune however as 
nnterprises in various regions withhold supplies and keep them for 
local consumption 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev meeting tuesday with 
members of the russian congress of peoples deputies sharply 
rebuked those republics and regions that have refused to supply the 
cities of moscow sverdlovsk irkutsk and others with grain and 
other agricultural supplies 
the moscow industrial association moloko milk in russian 
said that in the past shortages were eased by supplies of powdered 
milk but with 95 percent of the powdered milk obtained from 
abroad that luxury is no longer affordable the newspaper 
said 
the authors of the story suggested that moloko triple the price 
of a liter of milk to one ruble about 180 to avoid having to 
use state subsidies but the general director of moloko is against 
it he told the newspaper that moscow consumers may not 
understand such an increase 
moskovsky komsomolets said the regions supplying moscows milk 
dont want rubles in payment they want scarce goods in return for 
their dairy products 
but the association moloko is not mitsubishi the 
newspaper added wryly referring to the japanese consumer goods 
conglomerate 
rationing of goods such as vodka pasta and rice is in effect in 
many places in the soviet union as the economy has worsened 
leningrad will introduce food rationing as of saturday although 
moscow already rations sugar and cigarettes and is considering such 
a program for other goods city officials do not believe it is a 
solution because the ration coupons would not necessarily 
guarantee supplies 
some officials are proposing a special kind of moscow money 
for example 50 rubles per month per resident which would be 
backed up with food products the newspaper moskovskaya pravda 
reported it did not provide further details on the plan

goh chok tong formed a new government tuesday 
and prepared to replace the only prime minister singapore has ever 
known 
goh officially takes office wednesday and his new government 
includes a prominent post for his predecdessor lee kuan yew 
lee had been prime minister since the former british crown 
colony became a selfgoverning state in 1959 
during 31 years of authoritarian rule he helped transform the 
former colonial outpost into a flourishing banking and commercial 
center 
the transition of power to his chosen successor has been in the 
works for more than two years 
the 67yearold lee is to be a senior minister without portfolio 
attached to the prime ministers office and is to continue as 
secretarygeneral of the governing peoples action party his 
eldest son lee hsien loong 38 was recently appointed one of two 
deputy prime ministers 
in a ceremony on tuesday at the istana or palace president wee 
kim wee appointed goh prime minister and asked him to form a 
government goh then submitted the names of his cabinet members to 
the president 
gohs government is expected to push to amend the constitution 
to provide for an elected president with an array of executive 
powers the post is now appointive and largely ceremonial 
because his party holds 80 of the 81 elected seats in 
parliament the measure is likely to be approved and the 
constitution amended by midjanuary 
lee kuan yew suggested the changes in 1984 but he says he is 
not interested in seeking the revamped presidency 
critics say having an executive head of state will virtually end 
the countrys british style of government in which parliament is 
supreme particularly if the president and prime minister are at 
odds 
goh said the stronger presidency is needed as an additional 
check on parliament 
the guinness book of world records had listed lee as the 
longestserving prime minister 
i think that singapore has seen and heard enough of me for 31 
years he said last week 
when the cambridgeeducated lawyer took charge this island city 
state had no natural resources no industry bitter racial 
divisions and potentially unfriendly neighbors 
lee helped forge an identity for his polyglot island of 27 
million people uniting an ethnic chinese majority with sizable 
malay and indian minorities 
he demanded discipline to overcome hardships obedience hard 
work cleanliness thrift and the profit motive were applied as the 
shabby british colonial outpost was transformed 
singapore is now a flourishing banking and commercial center 
with hightech industries a firstclass educational system and 
glitzy shopping centers 
years of firm political leadership and stable economic growth 
helped attract investment by multinational corporations seeking a 
doorway to the booming markets of the far east

when the taxman calls everyone must answer 
even the state 
the states top court ruled tuesday that state government is not 
exempt from a law that requires taxpayers to pay their property tax 
even while theyre appealing the assessment 
the state must pay its local property taxes when they are 
due court of appeals judge vito titone wrote in the unanimous 
decision 
state officials launched the case on behalf of the hudson 
riverblack river regulating district in 1987 fulton county 
raised the states tax bill for 380 pieces of property operated by 
the district in northampton from 234000 to 440000 according to 
the attorney generals office 
state lawyers argued that laws that protect new york state from 
paying penalties for delinquent taxes and from tax foreclosure also 
exempted it from paying taxes pending resolution of its appeal of 
the assessment 
but titone argued that if anything the existence of those two 
specific exemptions indicate lawmakers want the state to be treated 
like any other taxpayer when it comes to an appeal 
indeed the balance of equities may even tilt more heavily in 
favor of local governments taxing power when the state is the 
taxpayer since the state is generally in a better position than an 
individual taxpayer to absorb a temporary overpayment pending 
judicial correction titone said

goodbye pricey menus long lines and goat 
cheese hello bistros broccoli and service with a smile 
todays gloomy economy is having a big impact on dining out 
but its not all bad according to the 1991 zagat new york city 
restaurant survey 
consumers are demanding and getting more for their money now 
even on tighter budgets and stricter expense accounts than they 
did a few years ago said tim zagat publisher and editor of the 
pocketsized guide which arrives at bookstores this week 
restaurateurs are holding down prices throwing in more extras 
like free appetizers and larger portions and working harder to 
keep customers happy he says 
according to zagat survey which publishes the restaurant guide 
the number of restaurant closings rose from 38 in 1989 to 54 in 
1990 but the number of openings held at 125 
the new eateries generally have a casual atmosphere lower 
prices and simple food such as scaleddown bistro regional 
american or pasta fare according to the survey 
huberts a fancy upper east side restaurant was among the 
recent closings it tried to change with the times shedding its 
luxury image and slashing its prices to 100 for a dinner for two 
but along the way the establishment lost direction according 
to the guide 
diners may be less willing to support certain kinds of 
marginal or expense account hangouts zagat said but theyre 
still trying out new places in great numbers and are proving 
especially supportive of smaller neighborhood places with moderate 
prices and simpler food 
a total of 5500 volunteer diners participated in the 1991 zagat 
survey which reviewed the decor food and service at 1012 
restaurants citywide to accommodate the shift to dollarwise 
dining the guide for the first time includes a bang for the 
buck index of 100 goodvalue restaurants 
it costs more to get a full tank of gas than to get a good 
meal out in new york zagat said 
still new york citys highpriced restaurants are the highest 
by far in the country according to the survey the average price 
for dinner at the citys 20 most expensive restaurants is 6707 
in washington the average is 5023 los angeles 4822 san 
francisco 4808 baltimore 3830 atlanta 3744 new orleans 
3464 seattle 3395 st louis 3323 and kansas city 2523 
at the top end of the scale in new york the survey notes there 
are still tremendously successful establishments the four seasons 
where dinner averages 64 and lutece where dinner averages 71 
are rated as the most popular 
bouley which opened less than two months before the october 
1987 stock market crash was rated as having the best food in the 
city the ninecourse tasting menu at the flowerfilled french 
restaurant is 65 
it proves that cinderella stories are still possible among new 
york restaurants and that put to the wall some places are 
performing at the peak of their game zagat said

the 1991 spoleto festival usa will 
include an 80th birthday gala for gian carlo menotti and feature 
the composer conducting one of his own operas 
only last month menotti was offering to resign as artistic 
director of the festival he brought to charleston in 1977 he later 
agreed to continue under his current contract for two more seasons 
and his dispute with the festivals board appears resolved 
it would be entirely inappropriate to have a birthday party at 
which the honoree didnt come said ross markwardt the chairman 
of the spoleto board 
menotti was in scotland and did not attend mondays news 
conference announcing the schedule however menotti generally has 
not attended program announcements 
markwardt said the dispute hasnt affected fund raising for the 
57 million festival we find no evidence the artistic content 
of this festival has been compromised he said 
the festival which runs from may 23 through june 9 will include 
three operas including menotti directing his maria golovin 
it is one of his favorite operas and one he thinks has been 
unfairly neglected said nigel redden festival general manager 
a preview on may 23 will be followed by a reception honoring 
menottis birthday the schedule also includes a birthday concert 
for menotti featuring cellist and conductor mstislav rostropovich 
menotti turns 80 july 7 
other operas at next years festival include tales of 
hoffmann and monteverdis the coronation of poppea 
the national ballet of spain and the rambert dance company from 
england will lend an international feeling to next years festival 
the dance program includes the festival of indonesia in 
performance the troupe includes dancers and a 20piece 
percussion orchestra 
dance premieres at spoleto include works by the elizabeth streb 
ringside company and blondell cummings 
three young italian dance companies will make their american 
debuts they include compagnia efesto paco decina and sosta 
palmizi 
choreographer david gordon will present a new work the 
mysteries and whats so funny featuring music by philip glass 
redden said the visual arts program an apparent source of the 
dispute between menotti and the board will be announced in 
january 
the festival has budgeted a record 800000 for visual arts and 
at menottis direction will be taking risks by trying new forms 
markwardt said 
the exhibits are expected to include large works throughout this 
historic port city and possibly decorating facades of buildings 
the schedule for the jazz and theater offerings will be 
announced later redden said

polands defense minister said tuesday he 
is worried about the soviet unions stability and plans to 
strengthen polish troop levels along the two nations frontier 
defense minister piotr kolodziejczyk said polands troop levels 
have been reduced by 100000 to 350000 over the last three years 
and that he expects a further reduction of another 100000 
he said about 40 percent of its armed forces now are along the 
german border and 20 percent on the soviet frontier 
kolodziejczyk said those troops will be redistributed with 
onethird along the soviet border a third along the german border 
and the remainder in the polish interior 
he said the troops are being moved because of lessened eastwest 
tensions and because of worries about the soviet unions stability 
even if the situation in the east soviet union were stable 
the troops would have to be distributed in a different way 
kolodziejczyk said but the situation is not stable which is a 
source of great concern for the polish government 
kolodziejczyk spoke with reporters after meeting with german 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg 
the soviet union is expected to have an unusually harsh winter 
this year there is serious concern that will touch off famine in a 
crumbling empire already beset by other problems and cause an 
exodus of hungry soviets 
there also has been concern about civil unrest 
germany has begun a huge emergency program to help out the 
soviet union during the winter months 
the german branch of the catholic relief organization caritas 
said tuesday it will begin sending 30000 food packages to the 
soviet union this weekend 
german television said further aid might be airlifted into the 
soviet union 
a highlevel team of economic agricultural and transport 
officials from germany led by chancellor helmut kohls top foreign 
policy adviser traveled to moscow on tuesday to talk with soviet 
officials about organizing emergency assistance 
kohl has stressed in recent days the importance of helping out 
the soviet union and ensuring that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev can survive the growing economic and political problems 
facing his nation 
after his talks with stoltenberg kolodziejczyk also said poland 
is interested in acquiring armaments once owned by east germany and 
now in the possession of united germanys armed forces 
through unification stoltenbergs ministry has inherited from 
the east germans among other things sovietmade mig29 aircraft 
rated as among the worlds best fighter planes

saudi arabia and kuwait are despotic clanrun monarchies 
said now president molly yard both systematically oppress 
woman this is gender apartheid in its purest most brutal form 
and should deeply offend all americans

troops to defend south africa from invasion ordering black 
soldiers to respect the culture by bowing their heads in the 
presence of white racists she said at a press conference on the 
now resolution

the us attorneys office is considering 
exhuming the unidentified body of a murder victim to see if it is 
that of missing candy heiress helen brach a newspaper reported 
tuesday 
for the past six months federal agents and illinois state 
police detectives have been trying to gather evidence that might 
connect the body with brachs disappearance according to the 
chicago tribune 
hampering the investigation is the fact that the dead woman 
found in the woods in calumet city in 1978 was missing her hands 
and part of her face including her teeth the newspaper said 
citing unidentified sources 
that has made it impossible to compare brachs dental records to 
those of the body 
investigators hope to exhume the body and conduct a series of 
tests including comparison of brachs xrays with those of the 
woman sources told the newspaper monday 
brach heiress to the brach candy co fortune disappeared after 
checking out of the mayo clinic in rochester minn on feb 17 
1977 she was then 65 years old 
the new interest in the body stems from a federal investigation 
here into a number of horse traders suspected of defrauding wealthy 
individuals who purchased horses the tribune said 
one theory is that brach was murdered after she repeatedly 
complained to authorities that she was defrauded in the purchase of 
horses the newspaper said 
at the time of her disappearance her net worth was estimated at 
17 million the value of her estate has increased to more than 50 
million most of her estate has gone to a charitable trust called 
the helen brach foundation

president bush today said the united 
states and mexico are one family united in their goal to break 
down trade barriers and in their opposition to iraqs aggression in 
the persian gulf 
the size and sophistication of usmexico trade today only 
hints at our potential we can create and share unprecedented 
prosperity and jobs bush said in a speech at the monterrey city 
theater referring to the free trade pact that both governments 
want to accomplish 
bush in a later luncheon toast said the trade agreement that 
could be concluded as early as 1992 would unleash powerful 
energies in both economies he said no country is more 
important to the united states than mexico 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari joining bush in 
speaking at the monterrey city theater emphasized that mexican 
migrant workers make a positive contribution to the us economy 
and the united states has a moral and juridical obligation to 
respect their human and labor rights 
bush on the secondday of an overnight visit also called for 
resuscitation of the faltering international trade talks known as 
the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
he said the critical moment is at hand for the talks which 
resume next week and are aimed at easing worldwide trade barriers 
negotiators have stumbled over european reluctance to give up 
agricultural subsidies 
we must not let the uruguay round fail bush said 
bush praised mexicos cooperation in the usled opposition to 
iraq and its steppedup oil production that has helped cover the 
loss of oil from iraq and kuwait due to a united nationsimposed 
embargo 
mexico and the united states stand united in rejecting 
aggression bush said the world of global conflict is giving 
way to a new world order of global cooperation 
stating that mexico has contributed to the us cultural 
language and architectural heritage bush said somos una 
familia we are one family 
when he arrived in monterrey on monday night bush told tens of 
thousands of people at an outdoor rally that he had come to mexico 
with a message of respect of admiration and hope for a brighter 
future shared by our two countries 
viva mexico bush shouted before he and his wife viewed an 
elaborate fireworks demonstration from a glassedin stage on the 
plaza 
bushs twoday trip focused primarily on the two countries 
efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement 
this morning the president met with a group of us and mexican 
business leaders later he met for a second straight day with 
salinas before they addressed the monterrey city theater audience 
bushs schedule also called for a meeting with another group of 
mexican and us businessmen and more bilateral talks on issues 
such as drugs the environment and economic matters 
bush today refused to answer reporters questions at a photo 
session with salinas on the latest developments in the persian gulf 
crisis 
the mexican president however said in remarks prepared for his 
speech that iraqs invasion of kuwait provides new opportunity for 
international cooperation 
a renewed international community enables us to maintain the 
hope that international law will prevail over the invasion and over 
capricious and arbitrary actions he said repeating mexicos 
support for the united nations sanctions against iraq 
salinas also made clear that he expects the united states to 
ensure better treatment of mexicans who migrate across the border 
there is always a moral and juridical obligation to strive for 
a real respect for the human and labor rights of these immigrants 
and their families whose work unquestionably makes a positive 
contribution to the development of the united states economy 
salinas said in reference to the concerns in mexico about racism 
and violence against mexicans along the us side of the border 
he said every single violation of their physical and moral 
integrity on either side of the border is an affront to the 
values in which both of our nations believe 
bush heralded the goal of reaching a free trade agreement with 
mexico even as salinas sounded a cautionary note citing mexican 
worries about what they see as us protectionist sentiments 
both salinas and bush say they want the trade agreement to go 
forward but salinas complained in an el norte newspaper interview 
published monday that american products can enter the mexican 
market without restriction but ours are detained at customs and 
there are always many restrictions 
mexican fruits and vegetables are periodically barred from the 
united states for not meeting quality standards 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the presidents 
monday underscored their commitment to opening up the trading 
relationship 
they are interested in pursuing the agreement as fast as 
possible and attach high priority to its successful conclusion 
the spokesman said 
if congress approves bushs request to begin formal negotiations 
early next year a free trade pact could be concluded some time in 
early 1992 administration officials have said 
potential sticking points in negotiations might include mexicos 
insistence that its oil industry be kept free of foreign 
investment 
treasury secretary nicholas brady told reporters that problem 
has been eased by mexicos agreement to allow an exportimport bank 
loan for drilling and supplying equipment in mexican oil 
production however that does not extend to allowing us equity 
in mexican oil interests and the united states at this point will 
not insist on that brady said 
brady and other us officials briefing reporters on bushs 
talks with salinas said environmental and central american topics 
were covered as well 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
said the two countries agreed to a study over the next 18 months of 
environmental problems along the border particularly pollution and 
hazardous waste from industry on the mexican side of the border 
the two presidents agreed there is a real need for a 
breakthrough in el salvador where marxist rebels continue to 
battle the government said deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
he said bush and salinas urged a ceasefire there and agreed to 
push for a greater role by un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar in achieving that

three out of four of the nations top business 
economists believe the united states has skidded into a recession 
in part because of the rapid rise in oil prices following the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 
recession is here the national association of business 
economists said tuesday in a report on its canvass of 51 
professional forecasters 
the report reflects a sharp jump in pessimism among the 
economists who just three months ago still felt the country could 
avoid an imminent downturn 
we think that the recession began in the fourth quarter and 
that the persian gulf oilprice shock played a major role in 
ending the expansion richard d rippe nabe president and chief 
economist with dean witter reynolds inc told a news conference 
in our view the economy was on a slowgrowth track prior to 
the invasion of kuwait aug 2 rippe said that slowgrowth 
track has been converted into a mild recession outlook by the 
oilprice shock that has developed 
in a survey following the iraqi invasion only 45 percent of the 
forecasters said a recession either had begun or was imminent just 
a year ago 62 percent of the forecasters predicted the economy 
would escape a recession through 1992 
two other reports tuesday provided further gloomy news about the 
economy 
the commerce department reported the us trade deficit jumped 
289 percent in the julyseptember quarter to 2975 billion the 
highest imbalance in a year 
imports rose 5 percent to a record 12591 billion as the 
persian gulf crisis drove up the cost of oil exports damped by 
falling overseas demand for american farm products fell 06 
percent to 9616 billion 
the national association of realtors said october sales of 
existing homes fell 47 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 302 million the lowest rate since february 1985 when it 
was 295 million 
realtors president harley e rouda said reports of persistent 
budget deficit woes economic sluggishness nationwide and the 
threat of war have created psychological barriers that are blocking 
home sales 
despite the gloomy news rippe the president of the business 
economists said any recession should be shallow by historical 
standards the median estimate of the forecasters is for economic 
growth to decline 10 percent in 
this quarter and 08 percent in the next 
while twothirds of the group believe the downturn will last two 
quarters or less 29 percent said it would continue for three 
quarters four percent said it would continue for 12 months none 
felt it would last beyond a year 
the last recession continued 16 months from july 1981 to 
november 1982 
another survey this month of prominent economists by blue chip 
economic indicators found 80 percent of the 52 participants said a 
recession would begin before years end an additional five percent 
said it would begin in 1991 
assuming two quarterly declines the informal definition of a 
recession the nabe economists projected the economy will grow 10 
percent in 1990 and 05 percent in 1991 that includes growth of 
06 percent in the second quarter next year 20 percent in the 
third and 25 percent in the fourth the economy grew 25 percent 
in 1989 and 45 percent in 1988 
rippe said one key assumption in our economic outlook is the 
prospect that oil prices will fall and diminish the tax on the 
economy and help reduce the rate of inflation 
indeed the panelists projected inflation will drop nearly two 
percentage points on a fourthquartertofourthquarter basis 
from 64 percent in 1990 to 45 percent in 1991 
the survey also found the forecasters believe unemployment will 
rise from 55 percent this year to 61 percent in 1991 the jobless 
rate in october was 57 percent up from 52 percent in june

john major the youngest and fastestrising 
british prime minister of the 20th century epitomizes the virtues 
of selfreliance and initiative preached by his predecessor 
major described himself as a thatcherite but insisted he was his 
own man 
i am not running as son of margaret thatcher i am running 
as myself with my own priorities and my own program major said 
over the weekend 
he reaches the highest office in the land 11 years after 
entering parliament without leaving a trail of bruised and 
resentful enemies and he came all the way up from poverty without 
so much as a university education 
former defense secretary michael heseltine mounted the 
successful challenge to mrs thatcher in the conservative party 
that caused the prime minister to abandon her office but mrs 
thatcher endorsed major to succeed her and in the threeway fight 
for the party leadership and the prime ministership it was major 
who had the votes to defeat heseltine and foreign secretary douglas 
hurd softspoken bespectacled and often referred to as the gray 
man 47yearold major has none of the obvious qualities 
associated with the political highflyer 
but mrs thatcher saw in him a sharp mind political judgment 
and the conciliators talent for negotiation 
she saw him as a man of the people her aides said and even 
his opponents say hes a nice man 
he appeals to the right wing of his party with free market 
economic views and to the left wing with his sympathetic outlook 
toward britains underprivileged 
even for the new breed of conservative who broke into the ranks 
of oxford and cambridgeeducated tory privilege major has an 
unusual background 
the son of a sometime circus performer and actor he left school 
at 16 worked as a laborer and spent eight months on welfare before 
he started his successful banking career as a clerk at age 18 
tall and deliberate major has neat gray hair cleancut 
features and a quiet manner of speech nearly free of the 
inflections of class and geography that still pigeonhole so many 
britons 
he sees increased social mobility as one of the greatest 
achievements of the last 10 years and says his goal is a 
genuinely classless society in which people can rise to whatever 
level that their own abilities and their own good fortune may take 
them 
the contribution of bluecollar workers should be respected he 
says 
we will need the practical manual skills of people in the 
future and we should recognize those for what they are a very 
genuine talent 
once asked if regretted not having gone to university he said 
not a bit 
it has been of immense value to me to have been on the other 
side of the fence and to know what it was like to face a few 
difficulties and i dont regret any of that 
besides the broad electoral appeal of his background majors 
greatest practical asset is his financial experience as a banker 
chief secretary to the treasury and lately as chancellor of the 
exchequer during a difficult year for the economy 
major climbed swiftly through standard and chartered bank where 
he was an executive for 14 years before entering national politics 
his lack of expertise in foreign affairs is regarded as a 
weakness he spent only three months as foreign secretary but he 
has indicated the veteran hurd would stay on to head the foreign 
office 
majors stance on the persian gulf crisis is unlikely to differ 
greatly from mrs thatchers on europe he says he is convinced 
britain will be able negotiate an outcome on political and monetary 
union that will be acceptable to the european community and to 
parliament 
elected to parliament in 1979 he entered the cabinet in 1987 as 
chief secretary to the treasury from july to october 1989 he was 
foreign secretary and when nigel lawson resigned as chancellor of 
the exchequer in october major replaced him as the nations top 
treasury official 
major started life in the comfortable suburb of cheam and went 
to rutlish grammar a state school for bright children 
when he was 11 the family including two brothers and a sister 
moved to the tough south london neighborhood of brixton following 
an injudicious investment by his father 
he speaks with affection of his father who was 66 when john was 
born and soon began losing his eyesight 
i used to walk with him a lot so he wouldnt trip over curbs 
and what have you major once said he was a wonderful talker 
i still think he was the finest raconteur i have ever heard he 
had such a wealth of experience and a range of interests 
the family lived in a cramped apartment cooked on a gas burner 
on the landing and shared a bathroom in the hall with other 
tenants 
the home was five minutes from the oval one of the hallowed 
sporting grounds of england where major acquired a lifelong 
devotion to the game of cricket 
he can no longer play however during a posting in nigeria with 
the bank his left leg was so badly injured in a car crash that he 
nearly lost it 
my leg doesnt permit me to run he said if i bend it im 
likely to go base over apex 
major married norma johnson in 1970 and they have a daughter 
elizabeth 19 and a son james 15 mrs major an operalover is 
the author of a biography of the singer joan sutherland 
an expert cook and dressmaker she likes a quiet family life 
i am very fulfilled by domesticity and i dont feel ashamed or 
guilty about that she says 
the post of chancellor carries with it the prize of 11 downing 
st the house next door to the prime minister but it was never 
home to the majors mrs major stayed home in great stukeley with 
the children and her husband came home on weekends

john major was elected today as leader of the 
conservative party and will succeed margaret thatcher as prime 
minister 
major whose candidacy was endorsed by mrs thatcher fell two 
votes short of the needed majority but his opponents conceded 
defeat and conservative party officials declared him elected 
aides said mrs thatcher was thrilled major 47 her 
treasury chief is the youngest person to be elected prime minister 
since the 19th century 
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the 
conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow 
one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever 
had major said 
he called mrs thatcher a very great prime minister indeed 
our job now i think is quite clear we are going to unite 
totally and absolutely and were going to win the next general 
election said major who emerged smiling from his residence at 
11 downing st 
major won 185 votes former defense secretary michael heseltine 
had 131 votes and foreign secretary douglas hurd had 56 votes in a 
secret ballot election among tory members of parliament 
i congratulate john major and thank him for a firstclass 
campaign fought without rancor or bitterness which i believe lays 
the basis for the unity of our party heseltine said moments 
after the vote was announced 
hurd also quickly conceded he said the party needed to unite 
and john major is the right leader for this task 
within minutes cranley onslow chairman of the conservative 
party committee that supervised the election announced that a 
third ballot was not required and major was elected 
mrs thatcher left her residence at 10 downing st to 
congratulate major who as chancellor of the exchequer is her 
nextdoor neighbor at no 11 
mrs thatcher intended to submit her resignation to queen 
elizabeth ii at buckingham palace once a new leader was elected 
major would then be called to be confirmed as prime minister and 
first lord of the treasury 
major was elected to parliament in 1979 was appointed foreign 
secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year 
he moved up quickly in a fiveday campaign for the leadership 
after mrs thatcher announced thursday that she would resign rather 
than continue a leadership fight against heseltine 
by the weekend opinion polls showed that major was nearly as 
highly regarded by the public as was heseltine who has been 
prominent for a decade 
major attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing 
of the conservative party although his friends insisted majors 
own views were more liberal than many supposed 
he described himself as conservative on economic issues but 
liberal on social issues 
major epitomized the selfreliant hardworking achiever who 
mrs thatcher encouraged born march 29 1943 he was the son of a 
circus performer left school at 16 and was a laborer and at one 
time a welfare recipient 
major became a banker and conservative party activist and was 
elected to parliament in the first thatcher victory of 1979 he was 
appointed to a junior ministerial post in 1985 then to the no 2 
position in the treasury in 1987 
he emerged as a possible heirapparent when mrs thatcher 
appointed him foreign secretary in july 1989 and then chancellor 
of the exchequer three months later 
he inherits a party and a government that have been torn by 
controversy over european policy and local taxes and depressed 
after months lagging behind the opposition labor party in opinion 
polls 
the government has until mid1992 to call an election recent 
opinion polls however suggested that any new leader would greatly 
enhance tory popularity and major was rated as favorably as 
heseltine 
major has indicated he would review the widely hated poll 
tax which replaced the property tax with a flat charge against 
all adults no matter how wealthy 
he entered the leadership race jointly with hurd whose position 
as foreign secretary appears secure 
tall and deliberate major has neat gray hair cleancut 
features and a quiet manner of speech nearly free of the 
inflections of class and geography that still pigeonhole so many 
britons 
he sees increased social mobility as one of the greatest 
achievements of the last 10 years and says his goal is a 
genuinely classless society in which people can rise to whatever 
level that their own abilities and their own good fortune may take 
them

fading consumer confidence continued to take 
its toll on sales of existing homes in october pushing them down 
47 percent to their lowest level in nearly six years a real 
estate trade group said tuesday 
reports of persistent federal budget deficits general economic 
sluggishness and the threat of a mideast war have created 
psychological barriers that are blocking home purchases according 
to harley e rouda president of the national association of 
realtors 
as a result the realtors said house resales fell to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 302 million down from 317 
million in september and the lowest rate since 295 million in 
february 1985 
the commerce department will report on new home sales in october 
next tuesday in september sales slumped 6 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 503000 the biggest drop in six months 
the realtors said the median price of an existing house also 
fell in october down 17 percent to 92800 the median means half 
of the homes cost more half less 
rouda said the monthly decline and a marginal 04 percent 
increase over october 1989 prices mean that sellers are adjusting 
their prices to fit a buyers market 
at the same time the realtors said mortgage interest rates 
remained relatively stable 
rouda said the federal home loan mortgage corp reported the 
average rate for a 30year conventional fixedrate mortgage ranged 
from 1008 percent to 1017 percent in october rates subsequently 
fell to an average of 993 percent by the end of last week

below the september rate the median price was 136200 down 07 
percent from the previous month

percent higher than in september

820000 units while the median price fell 28 percent to 72100

president bush told mexican business 
officials tuesday that a slowing us economy might prompt 
resistance to a freetrade deal with mexico but he vowed to 
write a new page in north american history even if it meant 
vetoing protectionist bills 
bush wrapped up a twoday state visit to this northern mexican 
industrial city with new agreements on oil investment and on 
educational exchanges 
he joined with mexican president carlos salinas de gortari in 
voicing strong support for a pact to end trade barriers between the 
two nations by 1992 but conceded it could face some trouble in 
congress 
this agreement will unleash powerful energies in both 
economies bush said in a toast at a state luncheon were not 
on an easy path but i believe were on the right one 
the president also praised mexico for its strong support of the 
usled effort against iraq in the persian gulf and for increasing 
its production of oil to help offset losses from iraq and kuwait 
salinas has also hinted he would send troops to saudi arabia to 
join us forces if the un security council approves a 
useofforce resolution however us officials said that the 
crisis in the middle east was not discussed in any detail by the 
two leaders 
meanwhile the two presidents appeared to reach an understanding 
in a usmexican disagreement over whether mexicos vast oil 
industry should be open to us or other foreign investment 
salinas has insisted the staterun and subsidized oil industry be 
exempt from the freetrade talks 
but treasury secretary nicholas brady told reporters here that 
the dispute has been eased by mexicos agreement to allow an 
exportimport bank loan for drilling and supplying equipment in 
mexican oil exploration 
under such an arangement us companies could provide mexico 
with expertise in finding oil the exportimport bank is an 
independent us government agency 
brady said the agreement still will not permit us companies to 
own direct interests in mexican oil but he said the united states 
at this point will not press for that 
bush held a breakfast meeting with a group of mexican and 
american business leaders then met for the second day with salinas 
and aides afterwards the two leaders addressed a theater audience 
of monterrey citizens and bush met with about 100 mexican business 
leaders 
it was at this session during a question and answer period 
that bush was asked about protectionism in the united states which 
many mexicans view as a threat to the freetrade agreement 
as the giant us economy slows down it may slow down even 
more it concerns me that some in our country and some in our 
congress might turn inward to what you properly label as a 
protectionist mode bush said 
bush said that if us business want to export we better not 
be protectionists 
were going to have problems with certain elements in 
winning support for the trade pact which would be similar to the 
one the united states and canada signed in 1988 he said 
it is a concern it is not an overwhelming concern i think it 
is something that can be managed he said 
bush told the business leaders that he had recently vetoed a 
textile import quota bill that he said was the epitome of 
protectionism and this president will continue to veto 
protectionist legislation he added 
the size and sophistication of usmexico trade today only 
hints at our potential we can create and share unprecedented 
prosperity and jobs bush said earlier in his address to citizens 
in the monterrey city theater 
i look forward to the day when we will meet to sign our names 
to a free trade agreement that will write a new page in north 
american history he added 
for his part salinas used the speech in the theater to 
criticize the brutal treatment he said some mexican workers are 
receiving as they cross the us border to find jobs in the united 
states 
he said mexican workers make a positive contribution to the us 
economy and the united states has a moral and juridical 
obligation to respect their human and labor rights 
salinas a harvardeducated economist said the free trade pact 
would help mexicans find jobs in their own country instead having 
to cross the border to find work 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
briefing reporters here said mexico and the united states agreed 
to a study over the next 18 months of environmental problems along 
the border he said it would pay special attention to hazardous 
wastes from industry on the mexican side of the border 
the two presidents agreed there is a real need for a 
breakthrough in el salvador where marxist rebels continue to 
battle the government said deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
he said bush and salinas urged a ceasefire there and agreed to 
push for a greater role by un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar in achieving that 
bush and salinas concluded their meeting by announcing a 
3million annual program under which 150 mexican and american 
students a year will receive scholarships to pursue postgraduate 
studies each others countries 
the program to be based in mexico city will be jointly 
financed by both countries

a procedure that freezes cancerous tumors by 
using ultrasoundguided probes offers hope to people who otherwise 
would be certain to die of liver malignancies a radiologist said 
tuesday 
of 30 patients who underwent the treatment six are free of 
disease said dr gary onik of presbyterian hospital in pittsburgh 
the technique called cryosurgery has the ability to destroy 
tumors next to major blood vessels without destroying normal 
tissues nearby onik reported at the 76th scientific assembly and 
annual meeting of the radiological society of north america 
it offers hope to patients whose cancer is caught before it 
involves the entire liver he said noting that radiation and 
chemotherapy are ineffective treatments for liver cancer 
everybody we worked on by definition couldnt be helped any 
other way onik said 
the patients who are now diseasefree after undergoing the 
procedure have survived an average of 29 months with the longest 
survival five years he said 
survival for the other patients has averaged 22 months and two 
of the patients whose cancer has come back are still alive he 
said 
that is considerably longer than the projected survival of six 
months to nine months after diagnosis among comparable liver cancer 
patients who dont have cryosurgery onik said 
he and his colleagues also are testing ultrasoundguided 
cryosurgery for prostate cancer and among seven patients who have 
undergone it so far no complications have resulted onik said 
a cancer specialist lauded oniks work 
i think hes making an important contribution said dr 
andrew gage deputy director of the roswell park cancer institute 
in buffalo ny 
not only does oniks technique offer hope to patients whose 
lives otherwise probably would be lost it also pioneers a method 
in which doctors can watch the effects of surgery as they go gage 
said in a telephone interview tuesday 
the technique involves making an incision into the patients 
abdomen and using ultrasound to find the cancerous lesions in the 
liver a surgeon then inserts a probe into a lesion and freezes the 
lesion with liquid nitrogen 
you can watch the freezing envelop the tumor onik said 
you can show what youve done 
most malignant liver tumors develop from cancers that migrate 
from the colon onik said adding that the phenomenon strikes about 
50000 americans a year while colon cancer is relatively easy to 
remove liver cancer tends to be more scattered through the organ 
and more problematic he said 
gage said conventional surgery still would be the preferred 
treatment for most liver cancer patients cryosurgery might be 
better for about one person in 50 specifically patients with too 
many lesions to remove with a scalpel but not so many that they 
involve the whole liver he said 
liver transplants are not an option in cancer patients because 
they require taking drugs to suppress the immune system and prevent 
rejection of the donated organ antirejection drugs promote cancer 
growth causing tumors to pop up everywhere onik said 
ultrasound is a radarlike technique in which high frequency 
sound waves are sent into the body to form an image 
he said his work with ultrasound and cryosurgery follows success 
with similar techniques in japan and china

a pall hung over israel on tuesday as it buried 
three of its five soldiers killed in a clash with palestinian 
guerrillas in southern lebanon 
radio stations played sad songs and maj gen yossi peled 
commander of the sector where the deaths occurred said today we 
paid in a big way heavily 
the shock over the latest deaths was compounded by the fact that 
only two days earlier four israelis were shot and killed by an 
infiltrator on the egyptian border 
in a commentary in the daily maariv shmuel schnitzer wrote 
we have to learn to live with the feeling that death lurks 
everywhere 
the border violence also includes two army deaths on the jordan 
river this month i dont recall a month where we have paid such 
a price said an army officer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in fact the army has suffered much higher casualties during 
israels 42 years of statehood but the latest deaths caught the 
israeli public off guard preoccupied by the 3yearold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories and the influx of 
soviet jews 
on tuesday prime minister yitzhak shamirs cabinet was in 
special session to debate the 375 billion state budget for 1991 
at issue was how to cover the costs of absorbing hundreds of 
thousands of immigrants while maintaining a strong military 
posture no decision was reached 
the army also faces a struggle to retain public confidence it 
has been wracked for months by a bitter race for the post of chief 
of staff and in the midst of the news of the deaths in lebanon it 
emerged that a senior general had resigned in anger complaining 
that the army was illprepared for war 
as head of training and planning maj gen moshe barkochba was 
in charge of studying the lessons of past military setbacks in a 
letter broadcast by israel radio he claimed no one was paying 
attention to his findings 
all this plus the undercurrent of worry that the persian gulf 
crisis could drag israel into war has created an atmosphere of 
foreboding 
barkochbas letter came at a very bad moment army 
spokesman brig gen nachman shai told israel television i dont 
think he intended it to be this way but thats how it came out 
at the hospital where his 20yearold son haim was recovering 
from injuries suffered in the lebanon clash pinchas cohen 50 
told reporters 
its too bad that our generation didnt solve our security 
problems for our children who are now fated to sacrifice their 
lives 
but we dont have much choice and we cannot allow this to 
break us 
cohen was the only israeli wounded in the clash which occurred 
during the night but was not announced to israelis until late 
morning after the families of the dead had been notified 
those buried tuesday were staff sgt roi domb sgt amnon kadmon 
and sgt gad meinfeld maj yuval veinstein and staff sgt guy tal 
were to be buried wednesday 
in a eulogy at the funeral for meinfeld his commander said the 
guerrillas were headed to northern israel to commit killing and 
murder 
the terrorists mission was foiled peled said the 
settlements of the north are safe the price is unbearable

two inspectors who visited iraqs nuclear 
plants last week found no evidence that baghdad is developing 
atomic weapons for its arsenal the international atomic energy 
agency said tuesday 
a brief statement by the united nations agency said no change 
had taken place in the status of nuclear material under 
safeguards at the four sites since the last routine inspection in 
april 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said 
we would welcome that iraq has decided to permit this 
inspection while the inspectors found no diversion of nuclear 
material williams said the inspection doesnt tell what happens 
in the future 
he also repeated the us position that iraq is continuing with 
its program to manufacture nuclear weapons 
the agency inspects nuclear facilities and fissionable materials 
in various countries every six months under the nonproliferation 
treaty that prohibits the spread of nuclear technology for 
nonpeaceful use 
the statement said inspectors in april also accounted for all 
nuclear materials registered by iraq with the agency indicating 
none had been diverted to develop weapons as iraqs army prepares 
for possible war against the multinational forces in saudi arabia 
president bush last week told us troops in the region their 
mission to push iraqs saddam hussein out of occupied kuwait was 
marked by a real sense of urgency because of baghdads headway 
in acquiring nuclear arms he said it was not clear just how fast 
iraq could have such weapons ready for use 
but a nigerian and a soviet inspector toured iraqs two research 
reactors a storage and a fuelproducing plant nov 1922 at 
baghdads invitation agency spokesman hansfriedrich meyer said 
the inspectors were accompanied by iraqi officials as permitted 
under the nonproliferation treaty he said 
both inspectors were experienced and had led verification groups 
into iraq before meyer said he declined to reveal their names 
although the statement did not say specifically they apparently 
checked on a 27pound mass of highlyenriched uranium that iraq 
salvaged from its osirak nuclear reactor which was destroyed by an 
israeli air attack in 1981 
some analysts in israel which closely tracks iraqs arms 
program believe baghdad could be two to five years away from 
producing its own atomic warheads for missiles or nuclear bombs to 
be dropped from jets 
but other experts say a 10year development phase is now needed 
because of the international trade embargo imposed on iraq after it 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and later annexed the oilrich emirate 
israel claims iraq is using the two reactors for its weapons 
program with the help of 150 pounds of enriched uranium from 
france which sold the reactors to iraq in 1976 for electricity 
production 
israel brought the nuclear program to a halt when it bombed the 
osirak facility but claims development restarted in 1987 
baghdad has repeatedly denied the allegations 
the iraqi invitation to the agency inspectors appeared aimed at 
removing one justification for an invasion of iraq by the 
multinational force in saudi arabia the force has been deployed 
since baghdad invaded kuwait 
some western officials have claimed the middle east can never be 
safe regardless of kuwaits status as long as president saddam 
hussein of iraq could threaten to use nuclear weapons 
the agency has suspended all technical cooperation with iraq in 
line with un sanctions following the invasion but meyer said the 
inspection was not considered technical assistance

technicians suspected a problem in the 
manufacture of the hubble space telescopes main mirror but never 
told anyone and the 15 billion instrument was launched with a 
blurred view of the universe investigators said tuesday 
the manufacturer perkinelmer did not assign its best people 
to the telescope construction and there was a surprising lack of 
participation by optical experts with experience in the manufacture 
of large telescopes the investigators final report added 
nasa released the study by a sixmember panel headed by dr lew 
allen director of the space agencys jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasadena calif 
one flaw the panel found echoed a finding of the investigators 
of the 1986 challenger space shuttle accident the hubble report 
said the management structure at perkinelmer raised a strong 
block against communication between people doing handson work 
and higherlevel experts 
in the aftermath of the challenger disaster a lack of 
communication between engineers and upper management was cited as a 
contributing cause 
the telescope launched last april from the space shuttle 
discovery cannot be focused properly because its 
945inchdiameter primary mirror is too flat in the center 
the investigators determined quickly and reiterated in their 
final report that an optical test used in the manufacturing 
process was not set up correctly and thus the surface was 
polished into the wrong shape 
the report said there were clear indications of the problem 
from auxiliary optical tests made at the time but that both 
indicators of error were discounted at the time as being themselves 
flawed 
it said the distortions in the mirror were seen during tests but 
that the manufacturer believed the test was not reliable when in 
fact it was quite accurate enough to detect the gross error and 
indeed did so 
perkinelmer design scientists as well as management for both 
the company and for nasa failed to follow the fabrication process 
with reasonable diligence and were unaware of the flaws the 
report said it did not single out any individuals 
efforts to reach company officials for comment on the report 
were not immediately successful 
the firm which was a leading manufacturer of telescopes used in 
space by the military assigned its most capable optical scientists 
to producing a small demonstration mirror and the design of both 
the hubble mirror and the test apparatus the report said 
but the fabrication of the mirror was the responsibility of the 
optical operations division which operated in a closeddoor 
environment and used neither the optical design scientists or 
available skills outside of the division 
during the testimony it was indicated that some technical 
personnel in the optical operations division were deeply concerned 
at the time that the discrepant optical data might indicate a 
flaw the report said there are no indications that these 
concerns were formally expressed outside this division 
in the grinding of the hubble mirror as in all large telescope 
mirrors a device known as a reflective null corrector is used to 
measure the accuracy of the polishing process the corrector had 
been preserved exactly as it was during the manufacture of the 
mirror and the board found its lens was incorrectly spaced the 
amount of the error would account exactly for the blurred images 
recorded by two cameras on the hubble 
nasa plans to put corrective lenses on the cameras during an 
astronaut visit scheduled for early in 1993 and experts believe 
that will solve the problem even without the corrections the 
hubble has returned some spectacular pictures from space many with 
better resolution than ever seen by groundbased cameras

lech walesa appealed tuesday to supporters 
of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki to help him stop a 
dangerous outsider from becoming polands president 
one of walesas sharpest critics agreed today walesa is the 
only candidate worth cosidering wrote editor adam michnik a 
veteran solidarity activist and perhaps walesas most determined 
political foe 
a victory by walesa would involve high risk for poland but a 
victory by stanislaw tyminski would bring the absolute certainty 
of extreme degradation michnik said in a frontpage editorial in 
gazeta wyborza the countrys largest newspaper 
the election success sunday of the wealthy emigre businessman 
tyminski denied walesa an absolute majority triumph and eliminated 
mazowiecki from the dec 9 presidential runoff 
the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister then 
announced late monday he would resign along with his 15monthold 
government 
tyminski who had only just returned from a 21year sojourn in 
peru and canada mounted a freespending campaign characterized by 
sharp attacks on the government and promises of quick economic 
improvement 
at a news conference in warsaw the darkhorse candidate praised 
gen wojciech jaruzelskis 1981 imposition of martial law to crush 
solidarity he said the country at the time was under unusual 
danger from within 
walesa asked mazowiecki backers during a news conference at 
solidarity headquarters in gdansk to help him defeat tyminski 
we are doomed to be together the solidarity chairman said 
we should pull this common polish wagon together 
you cannot put poland into hands that have not been checked 
lacking any background he said what is happening now is 
dangerous 
walesa polled 40 percent of the electorate sunday compared to 23 
percent for tyminski and 18 for mazowiecki 
walesa said he had warned the prime minister that the movement 
was losing the support of the masses 
those people who were with mazowiecki who really worked so 
hard did not want to understand he said this cold shower 
will wake us all up and we will think seriously about reforms in 
poland 
jaruzelski the lame duck president formally asked mazowiecki 
on tuesday to head a caretaker government until the next president 
nominates a prime minister 
walesa told a news conference that he would maintain the 
mazowiecki economic program but with certain corrections 
walesa said he planned to telephone mazowiecki and appeal for 
not multiplying the tension 
there was no confirmation from mazowieckis office but aides to 
walesa in gdansk said talks were being carried out with the 
highest officials in warsaw 
tyminski at his news conference attacked sacred cows of polish 
political life he praised jaruzelski and criticized mazowiecki for 
his economic policies and for alleged cooperation with communist 
authories as a journalist in the early 1950s 
of jaruzelskis martiallaw decision he said i hope that 
this country understands now how much has been done for it by 
president wojciech jaruzelski because at that moment in 1981 the 
country was in unusual danger from within because the hand 
that did the injury for so many years was always our own 
they are very irresponsible tyminski said referring to the 
governments shock economic reform program instituted in january to 
almost universal praise from the world financial community even 
if nothing had been done there would not be destruction on such a 
scale 
mazowiecki said in his resignation statement monday night that 
he had been brought down by lack of public patience for the 
sacrifices required to improve the economy 
society made its choice said the taciturn prime minister 
who took office in august 1989 after decades as a writer in the 
catholic opposition 
meanwhile zdzislaw najder a historian and former head of the 
polish section of radio free europe told the state pap news 
agency that he could not exclude being named prime minister and 
forming a government under walesa najder heads walesas national 
citizens committee movement 
i know that there are people of greater authority and 
experience my trump is a considerable familiarity with the 
world at large pap quoted najder as saying

the agriculture department projected on 
tuesday that consumer food prices will climb more slowly in 1991 
and that farmers will see nearrecord incomes as production 
increases 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said there are still some 
trouble spots but the situation has changed for the better from 
the financial crunch of the mid1980s 
the overall economic health of this industry is infinitely 
improved over what is was five years ago yeutter told the 
departments annual outlook conference 
james r donald chairman of the departments world agricultural 
outlook board said the 1991 forecast calls for an average food 
price increase of 2 percent to 5 percent compared with almost 6 
percent this year 
projected record meat supplies higher dairy product output 
and the likelihood of bigger citrus crops this season will moderate 
food price rises he said 
donald also said food marketing costs will rise more slowly if 
overall inflation eases to around 45 percent instead of this 
years 55 to 6 percent 
donald said farmers will expand 1991 plantings of several crops 
to take advantage of more flexibility under new farm program 
provisions 
globally he said commodity production will increase 
substantially in 199091 and that production of livestock 
products will reach a new record as red meat recovers and poultry 
supplies continue to increase 
some us products will face rising competition from other 
countries particularly for wheat and us meat export increases 
probably will slow as japan cuts back on imports 
the big news next year will be grains and plenty of it 
donald said for the last three years the world has been 
consuming more grain than it produced working down stocks 
but production shot ahead this year while grain consumption 
is rising by another 2 percent production is up 5 percent to a 
new record 
donald said the outlook for 1991 points to a year of 
nearrecord incomes for us farmers as cash receipts rise with 
larger sales and higher prices for a few commodities 
meanwhile farmers will see production expenses increase partly 
because of higher prices for energyrelated items 
but even with those higher expenses donald said 1991 cash 
income of farmers will be in the range of 55 billion to 60 
billion slightly less than this years record high of 59 billion 
net cash income is simply the difference between gross cash 
income in a calendar year and cash expenses 
in another way of accounting 1991 net farm income may be in the 
range of 44 billion to 49 billion compared with this years 
record of 49 billion that takes into account a number of factors 
including changes in inventory values and other adjustments 
a year ago looking at 1990 the departments forecasters 
predicted food prices would rise 3 to 5 percent hard freezes in 
late december helped boost fruit and vegetable prices much faster 
than had been anticipated 
the yearago prediction for net cash income of farmers was in 
the range of 52 billion to 57 billion net farm income at that 
time was forecast in 1990 at 46 billion to 49 billion

believing that reading newspapers and getting 
involved in government are keys to a free society a businessman 
tuesday initiated a scholarship program that encourages high school 
students to do both 
the idea is to get everybody involved said carlos roca 
owner of main line foto inc by bringing in the newspaper we can 
make sure that they understand whats going on and thats the 
first part of the whole process 
rocas pennsylvaniabased company which distributes film and 
other supplies to newspapers is starting the citizenship education 
scholarship program at three san antonio high schools 
the program will start with current events classes using 
newspapers as a primary resource roca hopes the program for 
minorities disadvantaged youths and new americans will spread to 
other schools and cities 
a newspaper is an educational tool just like your school 
book roca said but this one is going to last the rest of your 
life 
ben franklin said it a free press will keep this country 
free roca said but its only a free press if people read it 
i come from a newspaper family so i know how important it is to 
read a newspaper 
roca 28 who is of puerto rican descent said he learned from 
his familys newspaper background the importance of newspapers in a 
democracy 
nowadays one of the problems were having is kids dont read 
newspapers and unless they do were all in big trouble because 
that is what keeps this country free roca said 
his father gaspar roca is president and publisher of el vocero 
de puerto rico the largest hispanic daily in the united states 
following the classroom instruction students will travel to 
washington for a week of seminars and meetings organized by the 
close up foundation a nonprofit nonpartisan education group 
im just a normal student to have something like this i feel 
im going to be a part of the big picture said scholarship 
recipient barry huff a 17yearold senior at east central high 
school 
jennifer berry 16 a junior at east central said shes eager 
to learn how government in washington works 
im very happy that i got a scholarship because otherwise i 
wouldnt be able to go she said 
on tuesday roca presented 1600 to east central he also is 
awarding the same amount to sam houston and sidney lanier high 
schools 
each school is allowed to divide the money among as many 
students as it likes east central picked three students the other 
schools had not yet decided how many students would receive the 
scholarship 
the san antonio independent school district in turn is 
honoring roca with a friend of education award 
the students will raise some of the more than 600 each will 
need for the trip and some of the program money in san antonio 
will be generated by a percentage of main line foto sales to the 
san antonio expressnews 
its a great program and i think its a healthy one said 
expressnews publisher w lawrence walker jr who invited the 
students to visit the newspaper before their trip in february 
roca said he decided to give out the first scholarships in san 
antonio after meeting rep albert bustamante dtexas and learning 
about the area 
roca said he selected the close up foundation because of its 
reputation for allowing students to interact with government 
officials more than 25000 students take part in close up each 
year 
main line foto is a full line professional stockhouse dealer of 
film paper and chemicals the company which carlos roca founded 
in 1983 while in college at villanova university supplies about 
900 newspapers nationwide

president hosni mubaraks national 
democratic party is virtually unopposed in thursdays parliamentary 
elections because of a boycott by major opposition groups 
the 454seat peoples assembly already has gained a reputation 
as a rubberstamp parliament for mubaraks policies because of the 
wide majorities his national democratic party has held in the three 
parliaments since he became president in 1981 
this combines with opposition party charges of voterigging to 
hold down the number of people voting analysts expect even fewer 
voters this time in light of the boycott and the absence of 
campaign issues 
we asked for constitutional changes time after time the 
political leadership never answered our demands said ibrahim 
farag of the new wafd party one of those boycotting the election 
we do not accept that we become an ornament for fake 
democracy he said 
with only token opposition the national democrats have not had 
to defend egypts deployment of 20000 troops in saudi arabia 
following iraqis invasion of kuwait instead national democrats 
have wound up debating pocketbook issues the economy 
unemployment commodity shortages and inflation 
their main campaign asset has been the 62yearold president 
who is apparently enjoying increased popularity because of his 
unflinching opposition to iraqs seizure of kuwait 
the national democrats fielded 444 candidates one for each 
elective seat in the chamber under the constitution mubarak 
appointees take 10 seats 
mubarak suspended the outgoing parliament sept 26 because of a 
ruling by the supreme constitutional court that the 1987 elections 
were unconstitutional 
the president later decreed that parliamentary candidates must 
run as individuals even if they are party members the decree 
invalidated a partyticket system struck down by the court 
egypt has nine opposition groups including the banned but 
governmenttolerated moslem brotherhood 
boycotting the elections are the moslem brotherhood the new 
wafd party the socialist labor party and the liberal party in the 
disbanded parliament the brotherhood and its socialist and liberal 
allies held about 60 seats and the new wafd had 35 
the national unionist progressive party and the moslem 
fundamentalist umma party are taking part in the elections they 
held no seats in the old assembly 
three new parties are campaigning the egyptian greens party 
the young egypt party and the democratic unionists party 
with only 101 candidates the opposition parties pose no problemfor 
the national democrats who include nine cabinet ministers and 
have the staterun news media at their disposal 
more than 2000 candidates campaigned without party ties but 
the government press said more than half are mubarak loyalists 
we expected that parties that said they would boycott would 
run through independent candidates said rifaat elsaeed of the 
national unionist progressive party 
there are at least 68 moslem brotherhood members campaigning 
as independents under the slogan give us your vote so we can 
mend the world with religion as well as a large number of 
wafdists and 23 liberals elsaeed said 
maamoun elhodeiby the moslem brotherhoods secretarygeneral 
denied that more than two members of his group campaigned farag 
said 30 wafdists ran as independents and were expelled from the 
party 
elsaeed said his party is participating because to boycott is 
to give up we feel that boycotting is like admitting it is 
impossible to bring about change through democracy and 
parliament he said 
a key demand of opposition forces is that voters be required to 
produce identification now a voter gives his name and casts his 
ballot after his name is checked off a list 
my father died in 1975 said elsaeed every year since 
then when i go to vote i see on the list that a check has been 
made opposite his name showing that hes voted

the value of us agricultural exports is 
expected to drop 4 percent this fiscal year to 385 billion the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
the value of those exports rose to a nineyear high of more than 
401 billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
the volume of shipments also will drop 6 percent to around 1395 
million metric tons about 154 million short tons as sales of corn 
and other coarse grains decline the departments economic research 
service said 
although the decline in 1991 had been expected by the agency for 
some time it was the first official forecast to include specific 
values and quantities 
lower world grain trade is expected following larger harvests 
by traditional grain importers and the us share of world grain 
trade is expected to fall following increased competitor 
production the report said 
also the report said larger 199091 world wheat output has 
brought sharply lower wheat prices 
corn exports will drop largely because of a onethird cutback in 
the soviet unions corn import needs 
however higher prices are forecast for soybeans and soybean 
meal which will offset declines in the volume of shipments the 
report said 
us agricultural imports were projected to drop slightly to 22 
billion in 199091 from a record 225 billion last year

the supreme court was asked tuesday to free a 
rhode island college from having to pay nearly 44000 to a nursing 
student because it kicked her out for being too fat 
outside the debate centered on alleged discrimination against 
fat people 
but inside the court heard 60 minutes of technical legalistic 
arguments pitting salve regina college in newport ri against 
sharon l russell now a nurse in st petersburg fla 
what the justices must decide by july is whether a federal 
appeals court correctly deferred to a federal trial judges 
interpretation of rhode island common law a ruling that such 
deference was warranted will mean ms russells victory is upheld 
but steven snow a providence ri lawyer representing the 
college argued tuesday that the appeals court should have rendered 
its own interpretation of state common law rather than defer to the 
trial judge 
his contention drew numerous probing questions especially from 
justices sandra day oconnor john paul stevens and byron r white 
at one point oconnor noted that most federal appeals courts 
have shown trial judges the same deference when considering state 
law issues that land in federal court 
edward t hogan the east providence ri lawyer for ms 
russell argued that forcing appeals courts to engage in the type 
of review snow suggested would result in a waste of time 
ms russell who has become a champion in the fight against size 
discrimination weighed over 300 pounds when dismissed from salve 
regina in 1985 
she had entered the coed catholic school three years previously 
and received excellent grades through her freshman and sophomore 
years but after beginning her nursing studies ms russell was 
told by faculty members her weight concerned them 
after being dismissed ms russell transferred to another school 
and obtained her nursing degree she also sued the college and a 
federal jury awarded her 44000 on a breachofcontract claim 
now a pediatric nurse at all childrens hospital in st 
petersburg ms russell did not attend the court hearing 
the facts of her legal case barely were mentioned tuesday snow 
the schools lawyer was about five minutes into those facts when 
chief justice william h rehnquist told him there wasnt much point 
to continuing 
taking the chief justices cue snow quickly delved into the 
sole legal point being studied by the court but in those five 
minutes snow managed to state that ms russells size did become 
a problem during the clinical training and that her severe 
eating disorder had resulted in morbid obesity 
outside the court building ms russells lawyer told reporters 
his client hoped to win the case and have her victory be seen as 
supportive of the rights of other fat people 
they were wrong in pressing the issue of her weight hogan 
said shes just as big as she ever was and is functioning well 
as a nurse he said 
actually ms russell now weighs about 285 pounds she recently 
was the keynote speaker at a convention of the 3000member 
national association to advance fat acceptance 
the case is salve regina college vs russell 891629

mayor richard arrington backed a 
citywide curfew for youths under age 17 then decided to delay 
presenting it to city council 
arrington had said he would make the proposal tuesday but he 
told the council more research was needed he said he plans to 
submit the proposal and other measures to halt an increase in 
youth violence in two weeks 
the curfew would be similar to one that went into effect 
recently in atlanta 
like that curfew the birmingham proposal is being attacked by 
civil libertarians as an infringement of young peoples 
constitutional rights 
in addition to the curfew a task force formed by arrington 
proposed stiff new laws against guns and drug possession with 
parents liable for children who become repeat offenders 
arrington who is black called on birminghams black majority 
to support the curfew and crackdown 
in the past these measures have not been supported by blacks 
because they believe they are racist he said he added that a 
disproportionate amount of young people involved in crimes are 
black but the victims are also black and somehow weve got to get 
that across we need to support these tough measures 
neil bradley associate director of the southeastern regional 
office of the american civil liberties union said the proposed 
curfew would be unconstitutional and would be challenged in court 
if enacted 
the task force was formed in the wake of the fatal shooting of 
an 11yearold girl by a 14yearold boy outside a public school

the united states hasnt had as 
many ships in one region in the last 45 years 
but to face iraq and saddam hussein the aircraft carriers 
america roosevelt and ranger and their estimated 240 aircraft are 
set to join the kennedy the saratoga and the midway ringing the 
arabian peninsula and the battleship missouri is to join the uss 
wisconsin already in the gulf 
the united states is busy bringing together the most naval 
forces that weve had in any one location since world war ii 
according to rear adm daniel p march commander of the seventh 
fleets battle force 
but march 51 does not anticipate serious problems coordinating 
all the various vessels in the persian gulf region including those 
from many other allied nations 
from a command and control standpoint a lot of forces do 
make things a little bit more complex but were used to joint 
operations he said 
march pointed out that three carrier groups and two battleship 
groups exercised in the pacific last year in what then was the 
largest naval deployment since the 1940s 
the admiral spoke to reporters from his base aboard the midway 
the navys oldest and smallest carrier 
boatswain john smith called it a volkswagen in comparison to 
the cadillac it just relieved the uss independence 
because the midway is shorter and lighter march acknowledged 
the ship cant carry as many bombs missiles shells fuel or 
supplies 
but he and other officers said the united states only 
foreignbased carrier fosters a special esprit de corps 
midway attracts a kind of a unique breed noted lt dave 
myer 37 of orlando fla we never go home we dont go back to 
the states so were out here operating all the time and i like 
that 
march described the air wings responsibility the mission is 
to put aircraft over the beach in support of the objectives in 
support of troops in the field in support of interdiction in 
support of targets 
the commodore of the carriers destroyer squadron said iraq is 
keeping a low profile in the area 
we check out about a hundred ships a day coming in or going 
out of the gulf said capt jw parker we havent had 
occasion to board any it sort of indicates that the iraqis have 
changed their procedures a little bit 
after the multinational force boarded vessels to enforce the 
un sanctions against trade with iraq following the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait parker speculates that baghdad decided against 
challenging the naval blockade at least on the gulf side of the 
arabian peninsula 
there are no iraqi ships coming he said

a strike that has paralyzed rail traffic in 
eastern germany spread to freight lines and more passenger trains 
tuesday but workers agreed to talk with management and resume 
international service 
the union of german rail workers seeking higher pay and 
guarantees against layoffs has staged the first major work 
stoppages since the two germanys unified on oct 3 
the threeday strike also has severely disrupted rail traffic 
with neighboring poland and czechoslovakia 
the union said it would seek exploratory talks wednesday with 
the reichsbahn the name of the rail system of former east germany 
negotiations could begin immediately to end the strike if the union 
believed management was prepared to meet workers terms said rudi 
schaefer head of the union 
earlier workers had said no talks would be held until 
management offered an acceptable compromise 
claudia ruttmann spokeswoman for the reichsbahn in berlin said 
officials were prepared to discuss workers demands for higher pay 
and guarantees against layoffs 
the walkouts began in berlin on sunday evening and spread 
throughout all of eastern germany forcing international passenger 
trains to halt in czechoslovakia and delaying thousands of 
passengers 
in germany the strike first affected intercity trains it 
spread tuesday to freight and passenger trains in the berlin area 
about 260000 reichsbahn employees voted to strike after 
negotiations broke down last week 
strike leaders fear up to 68000 workers in the former east 
germany will be laid off as the railroad and the economy undergo 
capitalist restructuring similar cutbacks are predicted in other 
industries in the former communist nation 
the rail strikers are demanding protection against massive 
layoffs and recommend reduction of the work force gradually through 
attrition 
union officials say the eastern workers are aid 675 to 945 a 
month about 675 less than their counterparts in former west 
germany the union wants salaries to reach 60 percent of western 
scales in january but its primary demand is no mass layoffs 
the german adn news agency said more than 150000 travelers were 
delayed on monday and that train traffic to and from poland also 
was suffering long delays 
the rail line carried an average of 16 million passengers a day 
in 1989 
meanwhile members of the public service and transport union 
working for nato forces based in western germany held a second day 
of warning strikes to force an agreement for new work contracts and 
layoff provisions 
with a reduction of military forces in europe up to 23 percent 
of the approximately 100000 civilian employees working for us 
british and other nato forces are expected to be laid off in the 
near future union officials say 
among the strikers demands are guarantees of retraining and job 
placement in case of layoffs and adequate severence pay for those 
who cannot find new jobs 
the union said up to 12000 civilian workers at military 
installations throughout germany took part in warning strikes of up 
to two hours on tuesday 
the union says the the strikes are not intended to interfere 
with military operations involving deployment of troops to the 
middle east 
a spokeswoman for the us air force european headquarters at 
ramstein air base said the air force on tuesday did experience 
some vehicle traffic delays at zweibruecken and bitburg air 
bases

the american civil liberties union charged in a 
lawsuit tuesday that the fbi illegally kept files on the leader of 
a group that supports human rights activities around the world 
the lawsuit contends the fbi maintained files on j roderick 
macarthur foundation and its president lance lindblom since 1985 
and has released only heavily blackedout copies of 22 pages of 
material in those files under a freedom of information act request 
i am outraged that my own country engages in such insidious 
police state tactics of keeping files on lawabiding organizations 
and people lindblom told reporters 
the lawsuit was filed in us district court in washington dc 
the aclu contends the fbi files violate the constitutions first 
amendment freedom of speech rights and the privacy act which 
restricts the government from keeping such files on ordinary 
citizens 
the aclu said the fbi material has a chilling effect on lindblom 
and the foundation 
its chilling because its this kind of surveillance that 
created the blacklists in the 1950s and its chilling because it 
forces people to conform said harvey grossman legal director of 
the illinois aclu chapter 
lindblom said the fbis involvement has affected the 
foundations business 
i think it affects people dealing with us he said and 
how do you tell your 5 and 6yearold sons which i had to do 
last night why the fbi is investigating you that was chilling 
enough 
in washigton fbi spokesman carlos fernandez said the bureau 
does not comment on pending litigation 
the fbi cited an exemption under the privacy act in order to 
protect the national defense for not providing lindblom more 
information grossman said 
the lawsuit seeks unedited copies of all material in the file 
destruction of the file an admission that the fbi acted unlawfully 
and monetary damages to be decided by a jury grossman said 
grossman said the material the fbi supplied was so heavily 
edited it was impossible to determine anything about the probe 
except for a newspaper column about lindblom traveling with a south 
korean political dissident 
lindblom said he often travels overseas and his foundation helps 
defend political dissidents on trial in sensitive areas of the 
world but my action is above board 
the foundation is based in suburban niles it has no connection 
with the john d and catherine macarthur foundation although it 
was founded by their son roderick and the two groups support some 
of the same projects lindblom said 
it has made grants totaling 26 million since its founding in 
1976 to other charitable organizations to champion social justice 
lindblom said 
he said the foundation has supported such social action 
documentary films as the 1989 movie roger and me about the 
impact of the closing of general motors plants on the lives of 
michigan residents

house speaker thomas s foley on tuesday 
welcomed freshman democrats to congress and advised them to take 
junkets and miss votes 
but not a lot of votes 
figure out within the first month some matter of generally 
nonconsequence on the floor and sit through a vote miss a vote 
miss a couple foley a washington democrat advised two dozen 
incoming lawmakers 
for heaven sake do not make the mistake of getting a 100 
percent voting record it is a great sentence of life in prison 
living in uneasy terror that the house could hold a sudden vote 
and ruin that record 
he recalled a member who kept a perfect record for years only to 
have it ruined by a quick unexpected vote that member the 
speaker said wept on the floor 
foley himself just returned from the persian gulf told the 
group that whenever you get a chance travel 
i think its well worth the governments expense for members 
to see the matters on which we legislate he said 
foley addressed the democratic members at a luncheon on one side 
of capitol hill while republicans were meeting with their own at a 
nearby hotel 
the official bipartisan orientation for new members was 
scheduled to begin wednesday 
the 102nd congress will include 18 freshman republicans and 25 
incoming democrats plus independent socialist bernie sanders of 
vermont overall barring any election reversals before jan 3 the 
lineup at the swearingin will be 167 republicans and 267 
democrats plus sanders 
sanders attended the democratic party sessions on tuesday and 
was applying to organize with the democrats to obtain his committee 
assignments 
most of the orientation meetings tuesday were held in private 
except for foleys address the topics for the sessions run from 
the persian gulf and the federal budget to the mundane items like 
office computers personnel practices and financial disclosure 
requirements 
overlaying all of the specifics was a sort of intellectual 
indoctrination into the culture of the capitol 
foley first elected to congress in 1964 spent much of his time 
telling tales of how bad it used to be for freshman members 
once a junior congressman was even declared dead by a 
committee chairman and barred from all participation until 
colleagues pleaded for a reprieve 
in another case a chairman was confronted by a committee member 
with an amendment and became annoyed the chairman asked his top 
aide who the lawmaker was and how long hed been on the committee 
fourteen years mr chairman was the proverbial reply 
nowadays foley said the chairmen and women know new members 
names within a matter of days perhaps a week or so and nobodys 
going to declare you dead

historians feng youlan has died the official xinhua news agency 
reported tuesday he was 95 
xinhua said feng died monday of an unspecified illness 
feng a former beijing university professor wrote history of 
chinese philosophy a multivolume set of books on the countrys 
political past 
in an interview in 1986 with the associated press feng said 
chinas future does not depend on who succeeds senior leader deng 
xiaoping but on how communist party factions settle their 
differences 
he also said the communist party would remain the sole political 
force in china for at least 20 years because economic conditions 
will not support a multiparty state 
but there will be factions in the party now the party says 
there are no factions but everybody knows thats not the truth 
feng said 
when asked to comment on who would succeed deng as chinas top 
leader feng said personalities are not as important as political 
methods

country will be thrown into confusion he said at present

be in the future

growth in world trade is unlikely to be seriously 
affected by the conflict in the persian gulf according to a report 
from the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
industrialized countries are now better able to cope with high 
energy prices than during the last oil shock according to the 
report from the secretariat of the 100nation trade forum 
economic activity is less dependent on energy than in the 
1970s the inflation rate is less than half what it was in 1979 
and policymakers have learned the lesson that monetary 
accommodation of a real price shock has persistent inflationary 
effects it said 
the report released wednesday pointed out that current crude 
oil prices of 30 to 35 a barrel were lower than the peak of 1981 
when crude reached the equivalent of 50 a barrel 
while the general situation remains highly uncertain gatts 
economists believe that the growth in the volume of world trade in 
1990 is unlikely to be seriously affected by the gulf crisis it 
said 
the report estimated the volume of world merchandise exports 
will expand 6 percent this year down from a 7 percent increase in 
1989 
but the report warned that third world countries highly 
indebted nations and eastern european economies would be hit 
hardest by the oil price rises 
the report also said a successful conclusion next month of the 
uruguay round of trade talks would likely create a stronger basis 
for the world economy in the 1990s 
it said competition is the best path to rising living 
standards 
the report made no predictions on what would happen if the 
complex negotiations collapse they are now held up over 
disagreements on the size of cuts in farm subsidies 
the report said the value of world merchandise trade in 1989 
rose 75 percent to a record 31 trillion exports of manufactured 
goods outperformed those of farm products which rose by 4 percent 
in volume and 5 percent in value 
world trade in commercial services like transportation and 
telecommunications rose an estimated 9 percent to 680 billion 
services now account for nearly onefifth the total value of world 
exports 
the report said the volume of world trade in the 1980s rose by 
50 percent while its dollar value increased by threequarters

marc kolodners lego city a miniature 
metropolis constructed with plastic blocks during his hyperactive 
teenage years has been given a permanent home in a museum 
the 4by8foot city complete with a furnished hotel and a 
functioning drawbridge took six years to build it took three 
years to find it a permanent home 
the baltimore public works museum agreed this summer to display 
kolodners masterpiece after he called the mayors office for help 
the museum opened the exhibit sunday 
kolodner 22 used the thousands of lego pieces his parents gave 
him to channel his excessive energies in middle school and high 
school 
lego pieces he received for birthdays holidays and good grades 
were added to the city and became an aiport police station 
hospital homes and even a twodeck cruise ship 
he was a hyper little kid he just couldnt sit still said 
kolodners mother phyllis i had to find somewhere to channel 
that energy so first i put him on the tennis court and then i 
gave him legos 
kolodner said about three quarters of the city was constructed 
according to instructions included with legos kits the rest he 
improvised he cant estimate the number of blocks used 
its a lot of money thats for sure he said 
like building the city finding it a home proved to be a tedious 
task 
a firstyear graduate student in physics at georgia institute of 
technology in atlanta kolodner said his city was too big for his 
familys apartment schools libraries and hospitals said they 
couldnt handle its size either 
lego city was on display more than two years ago at a baltimore 
toy store while kolodner was an undergraduate at tulane university 
in new orleans but the store returned it after about six months 
because it took up too much space 
the city was stored in giant pieces in his familys apartment 
until this summer when kolodner reconstructed it in the museum

shuttle columbia got a clean bill of 
health tuesday and nasa set the launching of its longpostponed 
astronomy mission for sunday 
columbia is to carry four major astronomical instruments 
including a telescope designed to investigate the content of stars 
and the history of their formation in a mission that was 
originally planned for 1986 
the shuttle team has worked very hard to get columbia ready to 
fly said shuttle director robert crippen with the hydrogen 
leak resolved were ready to end the year with the astro1 mission 
which will extend our knowledge of the universe 
columbia and its 150 million payload were scheduled to lift off 
between 128 am and 358 am est sunday for a 10day mission 
scientists who have waited years for the flight would prefer to 
wait a little longer to take advantage of better celestial viewing 
in middecember certain astronomical targets such as the 
brightest visible quasar will be farther from the sun than they 
will be during the full moon sunday astronomers prefer dark skies 
the ultraviolet imaging telescope which studies the content and 
history of stars takes photographs of its celestial images 
explained nasa mission scientist ed weiler he said shooting photos 
into the scattered light of the moon is not preferable just as no 
photographer would shoot into the sun by choice 
three other major instruments will also be aboard columbia they 
are the hopkins ultraviolet telescope which will study quasars 
active galactic nuclei and supernova remnants the wisconsin 
ultraviolet photopolarimeter experiment which will measure the 
polarization of ultraviolet light from hot stars galactic nuclei 
and quasars and the broad band xray telescope which will 
determine the amount of energy in electron volts of xrays 
emananting from clusters of galaxies supernova remnants and stars 
the astronomy mission was originally planned for march 6 1986 
but the challenger explosion jan 28 that year grounded all space 
shuttles 
after flights resumed astro1 was rescheduled for launch march 
1 1990 the mission slipped to may 9 then to may 30 six hours 
before launch a liquid hydrogen leak was discovered in columbia 
and the launch was scrubbed 
three more launch attempts failed two of them because of 
hydrogen leaks and one for a minor problem with the payload before 
an oct 30 leak check cleared columbia 
by then workers were busy readying atlantis for its secret 
pentagon mission nov 15 nasa held off scheduling a launch for 
columbia until atlantis returned and was thoroughly inspected 
tuesday after a 5hour readiness review officials gave the 
goahead for the sunday liftoff 
the missions countdown was set to begin one minute after 
midnight wednesday the astronauts were due to arrive from houston 
on thursday 
columbia will be commanded by astronaut vance brand 59 making 
his fourth trip into space the others in the sevenmember crew are 
usaf col guy gardner the pilot mission specialists john mike 
lounge jeffrey hoffman and robert parker and payload specialists

so far suffered only minor damage in the form of relatively few 
flooded streets wet basements and small mudslides rice said 
compared to many other areas of the state seattle has been very 
very lucky so far 
but rice noted that hillsides throughout the city are saturated 
and more rain or a freeze and thaw in the next few weeks could 
trigger serious mudslides ironically the city also faces a 
drrinking water shortage he said in calling for conservation

the cedar river which is the major source of fresh drinking water 
for much of our region rice said right now the cedar river

john major endorsed by margaret thatcher as the 
politician closest to her heart was elected by the conservative 
party tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister 
major 47 fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting 
among the 372 coservative party members of parliament but his two 
opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed major as 
the winner 
mrs thatcher ending 11 years in power intended to submit her 
resignation to queen elizabeth ii on wednesday morning and major 
would then be called to lead the government 
major the chancellor of the exchequer emerged from his 
official residence at 11 downing st tuesday night smiling and 
holding hands with his wife norma inside mrs thatcher who came 
next door from the prime ministers 10 downing street residence 
embraced major i am thrilled and delighted that john major is to 
succeed me the iron lady said in a statement released by 
aides 
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the 
conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow 
one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever 
had major said 
our job now i think is quite clear we are going to unite 
totally and absolutely and were going to win the next general 
election said major who will be the youngest british prime 
minister in this century 
major received 185 votes two short of a majority former 
defense secretary michael heseltine received 131 and foreign 
secretary douglas hurd had 56 
hurd and heseltine conceded within minutes and party officials 
declared major elected 
the party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership 
challenge by heseltine who last week stopped mrs thatcher short 
of victory in the first round of the leadership race 
mrs thatcher had not wanted to leave office but she decided to 
resign last week after she was unable to put down heseltines 
challenge 
she said she resigned to let someone from the cabinet stand 
against heseltine major and foreign secretary douglas hurd both 
joined the race but before the vote her aides spread the word that 
she was backing major 
the son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare 
recipient major personifies the values of selfreliance and hard 
work that mrs thatcher had preached to the nation 
his election climaxed a month of british politicsturnedupside 
down and the western worlds longestserving head of government 
was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks 
heading a government that was trailing the opposition labor 
party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local 
parliamentary elections mrs thatcher lost control of events after 
her deputy sir geoffrey howe resigned on nov 1 
howe the fourth cabinet member to resign because of disputes 
over policy toward the european community shocked the house of 
commons on nov 13 by calling mrs thatcher a threat to britains 
vital interests 
the next day heseltine announced he would challenge her six 
days later with mrs thatcher at a 34nation summit in paris 
officially ending the cold war heseltine polled enough votes to 
deny her reelection as leader 
two days later she decided to resign after party leaders told 
her she could not win 
heseltine 57 said majors election lays the basis for the 
unity of our party 
hurd said the party needed to unite and john major is the 
right leader for this task 
opposition leaders derided majors election as thatcherism 
with a different face the conservatives main rivals the 
socialist labor party demanded a general election 
john major is a thatcherette that is how he sought election 
and that is how he got elected said labor party leader neil 
kinnock it means that the policies that brought the poll tax 
recession heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on 
during his fiveday campaign major had aaid he would review the 
poll tax an unpopular local tax brought in by mrs thatcher 
but he gave no other hints of differing with her 
while adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of 
britains involvement in europe he shares her opposition to a 
single european currency and shares her belief in tight restraint 
on government spending 
however he insisted over the weekend i am not running as 
son of thatcher i am running as myself with my own priorities 
and my own programs 
majors victory ended a patient fouryear campaign by heseltine 
to promote himself as a future leader of the party 
tomorrow always dawns he said smiling after conceding 
defeat 
major was elected to parliament in 1979 was appointed foreign 
secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year 
he moved up quickly in the leadership race by the weekend 
opinion polls showed that major was nearly as highly regarded by 
the public as was heseltine who has been prominent for a decade 
major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the 
conservative party although his friends insisted majors own views 
were more liberal than many supposed 
he described himself as conservative on economic issues but 
liberal on social issues

top administration officials expressed concern 
tuesday over the prospect that a fouryear effort to reform the 
global trading system could end in failure because of a deadlock 
over the issue of farm subsidies 
the socalled uruguay round of talks are scheduled to wind down 
next week in brussels with a marathon bargaining session in which 
trade ministers from 107 nations will attempt to resolve remaining 
disputes 
we must not let the uruguay round fail president bush said 
in a speech in monterrey mexico 
however back in washington other administration officials were 
expressing the belief that unless the european community retreats 
from its current position on farm subsidies the talks could 
collapse 
i came back very pessimistic about the outlook and im still 
pessimistic said agriculture secretary clayton yeutter it 
seems to me the position of the european community is so far from 
that of essentially the rest of the world that i see no way to 
bridge that gap in the few days that remain 
yeutter and us trade representative carla hills recently 
visited european leaders to urge compromises on agricultural issues 
confronting uruguay round negotiators 
the united states is pushing for a 75 percent reduction in 
tradedistorting internal farm supports and a 90 percent cut in 
farm export subsidies over 10 years 
however the european community seeking to protect millions of 
small family farms has only offered to cut internal supports by 30 
percent from a 1986 base a position the united states has termed 
closer to an actual 15 percent cut from current levels and 
completely unacceptable 
japan which wants to continue protecting its domestic farmers 
by banning rice imports is the only country that is at all 
supportive of the ec position yeutter said 
the ec members are belgium denmark france germany greece 
ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands britain spain and 
portugal they have more than 4 times as many farmers as the 
united states in a population about a third larger and the farmers 
are a powerful political force 
another administration official briefing reporters on condition 
that he not be named rejected the idea that the deadline for 
completing the trade negotiations would likely be extended if the 
farm issue is not settled next week 
he said if the european community does not indicate a 
willingness to compromise on the farm subsidies then it is 
unlikely that a complete trade package can be achieved he said 
developing countries would be unwilling to agree to removal of 
their barriers against foreign investment and trade in services 
without a promise of expanded markets for their agricultural 
products 
it is only through a large package that you can achieve the 
critical mass needed for an agreement said the senior trade 
official 
if the talks fail and everyone goes home without liberalizing 
global trading rules it will mean a fullblown reappraisal of us 
policies yeutter told the agriculture departments annual outlook 
conference 
well have to determine how best to protect our own 
interests yeutter said in essence well have to determine 
how to get the most bang for the buck in a more confrontational 
environment in international trade in agriculture and perhaps in 
international trade in all the other spheres of economic activity 
as well 
yeutter said he hoped such a gloomy development does not emerge 
and that were certainly going to go to brussels next week with 
an open mind for the final showdown 
but he added were not going to negotiate with ourselves in 
brussels next week were not going to come back with an agreement 
that we do not believe is in the best interests of this country 
and im certainly not going to come back with an agreement that i 
do not believe is in the best interest of american agriculture

chinas foreign minister will make an official 
visit to washington on friday the first such encounter here since 
before chinas crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in june 
1989 
but the state department said the visit does not signal any 
change in the us policy of barring high level exchanges with 
china the policy does not preclude contacts but does rule out 
exchanges of a formal and ceremonial nature a spokesman said 
foreign minister qian qichen will be in new york on wednesday 
and thursday for the un security council deliberations on the 
persian gulf he will travel to washington on friday on monay 
china announced that a vice minister of trade will visit washington 
next month 
as a member of the security council china has been the target 
of a us campaign for support for a resolution authorizing the use 
of force against kuwait it reportedly has agreed to support the 
proposal along with the four other permanent council members 
chinas vote on the un security council resolution will be 
based on its own national interest determination said state 
department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
to date china has consistently held to the security council 
consensus on the gulf crisis and has voted for every one of the 10 
security council resolutions on iraqs continuing aggression 
boucher said that since the june 1989 rights crackdown there 
have been four meetings between qian and secretary of state james 
a baker iii there were two in new york one in paris and one 
three weeks ago in cairo 
while minister qian is in washington we intend to explore ways 
to strengthen cooperation on global and regional issues and seek 
understandings on ways to achieve improvement in bilateral 
relations including further progress in the area of human rights 
that would permit a gradual return to normal highlevel 
exchanges boucher said 
he said the us approach is consistent with the policies of the 
european community japan and other friends and allies 
the types of bilateral gatherings which no longer take place 
boucher said include cabinet level exchanges under the joint 
commission on commerce and trade and the joint economic 
commission highlevel military exchanges continue to be banned as 
well in addition us companies which invest in china are 
ineligible for a us government insurance program that protects 
such investments 
boucher cited chinas recent decision to place sedition charges 
against two dissident journalists as a motivation for speaking 
directly to chinese officials about our human rights concerns 
one of the dissidents was the publisher of the nowbanned 
economic studies weekly and the other was the editor they were 
charged with plotting to overthrow the government a crime 
punishable by death

bulgarias government of former 
communists began talks with opposition leaders tuesday on resolving 
the standoff over how to run this balkan country of 9 million 
people state television said 
they met during the nations worst political and economic crisis 
and on the second day of a general strike meant to bring down 
premier andrei lukanovs socialist government made up of members 
of the renamed communist party 
petar beron chairman of the main opposition alliance the union 
of democratic forces said tuesday the udf would urge an end to the 
strike because of the agreement to talk with the government the 
state news agency bta reported berons group had given the strike 
lukewarm support earlier 
podkrepa the opposition labor federation called the walkout 
and said in a broadcast statement tuesday that 790000 bulgarians 
were on strike including 220000 in sofia 
podkrepa spokesman kiril vladimirov said large trucks blocked 
several intersections in downtown sofia early tuesday in solidarity 
with the strikers 
police used tear gas to disperse the truckers and students who 
also blocked streets with sitin strikes he said 
but government representative danail danailov said the number of 
strikers had not grown from monday and actually declined in places 
the main union organization did not support the strike although 
some of its members took part 
in bulgaria electricity and many goods are rationed or 
unavailable and many people have become impatient with the 
political infighting 
after the walkout began monday bta reported about 500000 
workers or roughly 11 percent of the work force were on strike 
the government said only one worker out of 100 struck 
leaders of the socialist party and the udf had met late monday 
at the suggestion of president zhelyu zhelev to try to ease the 
deadlock 
these were the most constructive consultations in the last few 
months udf deputy chairman dimitar ludzhev told radio later 
chavdar kyuranov deputy chairman of the socialist party said 
both sides agreed to set up a group representing the various 
political parties to work out what he called a draft political 
accord 
opposition leaders said the accord should also involve trade 
unions and should set a timetable for key economic and 
constitutional reforms 
the major obstacle appeared to be an opposition demand that it 
hold the prime ministers job it claims a swing in its favor 
following june elections in which the socialists gained 211 of 400 
seats in parliament 
an opposition representative speaking tuesday on condition of 
anonymity said lukanov now seems ready to step down if this could 
be done in a dignified manner 
the crisis has been complicated by splits within socialist and 
opposition ranks 
at a sevenhour meeting tuesday of its leadership and 
parliamentary bloc of 144 deputies the udf failed to agree on a 
common stand in parliament 
the alliance walked out of parliament after lukanov narrowly 
survived a noconfidence vote friday

a pigeon you might not want to return to the baroque monument 
a lowvoltage electronic field to repel pigeons has been 
installed at the fountain following a twoyear 28million 
scrubbing project city art officials said tuesday 
the wires dont harm the birds but emit enough current to 
discourage them from setting on the fountain a similar system has 
been used successfully for several years on milans spiretopped 
cathedral to keep birds excrement from collecting 
according to romes superintendency of art and antiquities 
restoration of the fountain will be completed in early 1991 trevi 
receives its water via the same aqueduct that supplied roman baths 
in the days of the emperors but that water is heavy in calcium 
which forms crusty deposits on the monuments restorers are now 
working out a treatment system to reduce the deposits

nearly 40 relatives of americans held hostage in 
iraq met with state department officials tuesday in sometimes 
heated discussions about the bush administrations policies in the 
persian gulf 
daryl watley son of hostage donald watley said talks were 
tense as some family members argued about bushs decision to send 
an additional 200000 troops to the region to provide an 
offensive military option 
relatives often disagreed with the hotheadedness of the bush 
administrations policies and the rapid escalation toward war 
in the fifth of seven sessions with families nationwide state 
department officials avoided discussing bushs policies and 
discouraged family members from visiting iraq said watley who is 
from tomball 
for many of the hostages families the main topic was whether 
to go to baghdad to help free their loved ones following the 
release tuesday of three american hostages whose wives had come to 
visit them 
they just said that after you leave amman jordan they cant 
ensure your safety said lynda parker who still plans to visit 
her husband hostage bobbie parker 
my children need their father home said mrs parker who 
lives in vidor i am going with the assumption i will get him if 
thats my only chance to get my husband back i will risk it 
freed americans whose families had pleaded with iraqi president 
saddam hussein for their release told reporters at the amman 
airport that the bush administration had ignored their plight 
i was not released with help from my government said john 
stevenson of panama city fla it was my family who did it 
its a very difficult decision for anyone to make said bill 
schaub oge drillings coordinator for kuwait after the meeting 
ended schaubs company has six employees held in iraq and kuwait 
women want to do anything they can to help their husbands but 
its risky and the husbands dont always want them to come theyre 
also worried that they may play into the hands of the iraqis by 
going he said 
most of the families of hostages taken since iraq invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 refused to talk to reporters as they left the meeting 
which began monday 
donnita cole of odessa said she plans to visit iraq next week 
and was heartened by the release of the americans on tuesday she

jewish leaders reacted angrily tuesday to 
two temple firebombings the latest in a twoweek wave of hate 
crimes 
police said it was too early to tell whether the attacks on 
jewish gathering places in the san francisco area were related 
its sick and its sick people who do this said dave karp 
mayor of san leandro and a member of the beth sholom temple which 
was firebombed monday 
rabbi ira book of beth sholom said there was fear among his 
congregation damage from the bomb was limited to a broken window 
and some scorched floor tiles 
most of the reaction however was anger that it could happen 
in this day and age book said 
the firebombing at the temple in san leandro about 20 miles 
east of san francisco occurred about a half hour after a firebomb 
was tossed into the temple beth abraham about 10 miles away in 
oakland that bomb burned a carpet and damaged a wall 
last week firebombs were tossed at the jewish community center 
and congregation beth israel both in san francisco the week 
before that police said three shots were fired at beth israels 
windows the synagogue was firebombed in august 
the damage in all the attacks was minor and there were no 
injuries police said the temples did not receive threats or 
warnings and there were no antisemitic graffiti or messages 
while temple members said they believed the bombings were part 
of a string of antijewish acts law enforcement officials said 
they had not made a definite link 
its a little too early to make any determination said ed 
gleba spokesman for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
which was examining bomb parts recovered from the latest incidents 
karp said police in oakland san francisco and san leandro were 
sharing information but had only slim leads 
scott ury of the antidefamation league a group that tracks 
antisemitic activities said he wasnt surprised by the attacks 
he said such incidents have reached record levels in the san 
francisco bay area 
in 1988 the adl counted 25 incidents of harassment assault and 
attempted firebombings on jews or their institutions in the san 
francisco area in 1989 the number was 48 the highest number 
since the adl began its count 11 years ago 
and 1990 is unfortunately already above the 1989 level ury 
said this makes 54 incidents and we have another month to go 
the city council in san leandro doesnt meet until dec 17 but 
karp was busy tuesday contacting council members urging that a 
special meeting be held to approve the posting of a reward 
the alameda county board of supervisors on tuesday approved a 
5000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction 
of those responsible the adl has also offered a 2000 reward 
rabbi joseph schonwald of temple beth abraham said the rewards 
were important to demonstrate that the whole community not just 
the jewish community cares it sends a message that this wont be 
tolerated

the conservative party elected john major as their 
leader but only queen elizabeth ii can make him prime minister 
the queen certainly will confirm the treasury chief on wednesday 
morning in a private audience at buckingham palace 
also wedesday outgoing prime minister margaret thatcher will 
leave 10 downing st for the last time and meet with the queen 
alone 
about 45 minutes after mrs thatcher drives away major will be 
admitted to the same room on the second floor of the palace for a 
private audience 
the room has walls of duckegg blue and cream silk curtains 
there are two paintings of venetian views by antonio canaletto and 
two portraits by thomas gainsborough of king george iii who lost 
the american colonies and his consort queen charlotte 
during mrs thatchers 11 years as prime minister she met the 
queen most tuesdays to inform her about government business 
the new prime minister takes on the post from the moment of 
the audience said geoffrey de deney clerk of the privy council 
a body of nearly 400 royal advisers 
according to tradition the new head of government kisses the 
hands of the monarch the head of state and receives the seals 
of office 
as the audience is private and confidential we wont know 
whether there is any kissing of hands or hand and there are no 
seals of office for a prime minister there never were de deney 
said 
it is the title of first lord of the treasury not prime 
minister that will give major the right to live at 10 downing st 
deney said it is a firm convention that conversation with 
the monarch at a private audience is never repeated 
the convention has not always been observed in the memoirs of 
some former cabinet ministers he added 
as chancellor of the exchequer majors official title as 
treasury chief in margaret thatchers cabinet his official 
residence has been 11 downing st 
after seeing the queen major will move next door to no 10 to 
start forming his cabinet 
mrs thatcher will go to her new house in dulwich a southeast 
london suburb 
majors annual salary as prime minister will be 131700 up 
from 108800 he received as treasury chief he is due for a raise 
to 142900 on jan 1 
mrs thatcher chose to draw the same salary as her fellow 
cabinet ministers forgoing the extra for prime minister 
her salary will now fall to that of a rankandfile house of 
commons member 52600 then to 57000 in january 
the governing powers of the british monarchy in practice have 
been assumed by parliament since the early 19th century but 
sovereignty remains with the throne 
under the royal powers major could appear at the palace to be 
told by the queen that she had chosen someone else as prime 
minister said harold brooksbaker an expert on british royalty 
and publishing director of burkes peerage 
the result would be the most terrible turmoil it would be 
amusing but impractical although perfectly possible he said

americans set a longdistance calling record 
this week that broke the one set the day after last years san 
francisco earthquake atampt said tuesday 
american telephone and telegraph has only theories to explain 
why 1484 million longdistance calls were made on its lines 
monday 
on oct 18 1989 the day after the san francisco earthquake 
atampt handled some 1447 million longdistance calls said spokesman 
herb linnen said on an average day the company handles 115 
million to 120 million calls 
traditionally the monday after the thanksgiving weekend is 
busy although there has never been one like this linnen said 
it was the busiest calling day in the history of atampt 
linnen speculated that people were trying to catch up on 
business or perhaps discussing the the possibility of war with 
iraq 
but then there were a lot of calls to tollfree 800 numbers 
and that could mean people were doing more christmas shopping by 
phone he said 
atampt handles 70 percent or more of the nations longdistance 
calls there was no similar announcement from the other two major 
longdistance companies us sprint and mci and no answer at their 
washington offices

government troops in chad suffered substantial 
losses in battles with rebels waging one of the most serious 
challenges to president hissene habre since a 1987 libyan invasion 
french officials said tuesday 
the officials described the 2weekold desert war in eastern 
chad as an internal conflict contradicting claims by chads 
government that the rebels are mercenaries backed by libya and 
sudan 
libya and sudan deny involvement 
foreign ministry spokesman daniel bernard said both government 
and rebels suffered significant casualties without giving figures 
he said government losses were notable 
another french authority speaking on condition of anonymity 
talked of the seriousness of the rebel challenge the source said 
there appeared no overt libyan or sudanese role in the fighting 
the daily le figaro said 1270 troops were killed by rebels in 
one battle 
it said rebels led by habres former military adviser idriss 
deby massacred a column of chadian troops in bloody weekend 
fighting habre had gone to the front to take personal command of 
his troops and almost was captured in fighting along the border 
with sudan according to le figaro 
chads information minister adoum moussa seif said tuesday 
that habre was in the capital ndjamena he refused comment on 
reports that the president had gone to the front 
chads embassy in paris said habre was in complete control of 
the political and military situation throughout the country 
le figaro said the rebels trapped a mechanized column of 5000 
troops near iriba 
with loyalist forces bogged down in a minefield guerrillas of 
debys patriotic salvation movement opened fire with heavy machine 
guns and antitank rockets killing 1270 men le figaro said 
surviving government forces fled le figaro quoted the rebels as 
saying leaving behind 20 destroyed armored vehicles 200 light 
trucks equipped with machine guns and 12 heavy trucks 
among the captured vehicles were two airconditioned command 
cars apparently belonging to habre le figaro said 
the reports could not be independently confirmed but were the 
most detailed since renewed fighting in the chad civil war broke 
out nov 10 
government radio claimed monday that loyalist troops had retaken 
the towns of iriba guereda and adre but the rebels claimed 
victories at iriba and tine 
chad claims that libya supports the insurgents libya denies it 
claiming th problems is among chadians 
deby who helped habre take power in 1982 was accused in april 
1989 of involvement in a coup plot and fled to sudan 
libya which once occupied the northern half of the country 
signed a peace treaty with chad in 1989 despite an outstanding 
border dispute 
france maintains a force of about 1000 soldiers in chad as part 
of a defense agreement with its former colony about half the 
troops are deployed in abeche about 150 miles south of the combat 
zone 
bernard said france has no intentions of entering the conflict 
the rebels are based in sudans sparsely populated darfur 
province in sudan over which sudanese authorities exercise little 
control

claims about accident rates and performance 
problems used to justify preemployment drug screening may be 
exaggerated say medical researchers who studied thousands of 
postal workers 
the study didnt distinguish between occasional drug users and 
chronic abusers who almost certainly would xxhibit problems at 
higher rates said a drugabuse specialist not involved in the 
study 
drug users have been reported to be involved in 200 percent to 
300 percent more industrial accidents to sustain 400 percent more 
compensable injuries and to use 1500 percent more sick leave 
the researchers said 
but the studys findings suggest many such estimates used to 
justify preemployment drug screening have been exaggerated the 
researchers reported in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association 
we found that those with marijuanapositive urine samples have 
55 percent more industrial accidents 85 percent more injuries and 
a 78 percent increase in absenteeism the researchers wrote 
for those with cocainepositive urine samples there was a 145 
percent increase in absenteeism and an 85 percent increase in 
injuries they said 
the researchers cited as examples of exaggerated accidents rates 
a 1986 manual from the us office of personnel management and 
articles in the journal psychiatry letter and the american 
psychologist 
peter bensinger a consultant on workplace drug and alcohol 
abuse wrote one of the articles he said he stands by his figures 
we have clients who had great reductions in absenteeism 
accidents with drug testing bensinger said 
vice president dan quayle wrote the american psychologist 
article in 1983 when he was a senator 
the lead researcher for the ama journal study was dr craig 
zwerling former medical director at the us postal service in 
boston and now with the university of iowa college of medicine at 
iowa city 
he and his colleagues performed urine drug tests on almost 5000 
job applicants in boston for positions of letter carrier postal 
clerk computerforwarding system clerk and maintenance worker 
including skilled technical worker 
the studys authors tracked the new hires between 1986 and 1989 
to compile data for their report 
the marijuana test was sensitive for up to four weeks after use 
the test for cocaine was sensitive up to 72 hours after use 
positive tests were confirmed and only confirmed tests were 
reported 
of the 2537 new hires 2229 or 879 percent tested negative 
198 or 78 percent were confirmed positive for marijuana 55 or 
22 percent confirmed positive for cocaine and 55 or 22 percent 
confirmed positive for other nontherapeutic drugs or multiple 
drugs the study found 
but nothing in their protocol distinguished the occasional user 
from the chronic abuser said an editorial accompanying the study 
postal employees in the sample were classified as 
druginvolved solely on the basis of a single preemployment urine 
test said eric d wish of the center for the prevention and 
control of substance abuse at the university of maryland in college 
wish said if the researchers could have differentiated between 
employees with chronic abuse problems from those who were 
infrequent users the observed differences in job performance would 
have been larger 
regardless he said the overall rate of drug abuse was small 
12 percent twothirds of which was marijuana use such a rate is 
dwarfed by the 50 percent to 60 percent rates of abuse among people 
arrested for drug and nondrug crimes he said 
wish suggested that society may benefit more by investing 
resources in testing and treating drug abusers coming through the 
criminal justice system than in finding the comparatively small 
number of mostly marijuana users in the primarily lawabiding 
employee populations

of 22500 tuesday by the national football league for taking part 
in the sexual harassment of a female reporter in their locker room 
in addition the new england patriots was ordered to pay 25000 
for instructional materials on how to deal responsibly with the 
news media and 25000 because they never vigorously sought the

wrote in a letter to patriots owner victor kiam 
the sept 17 incident involved reporter lisa olson of the boston 
herald and patriots players zeke mowatt michael timpson and former 
patriot robert perryman 
mowatt was fined 12500 for verbally harassing olson and 
exposing himself to her the nfl said timpson and perryman each 
were fined 5000 timpson was accused of shouting encouragement 
and perryman was accused of exposing himself 
none of the players was suspended 
the fines were levied by tagliabue after special counsel phillip 
heymann of the harvard law school submitted a 60page report 
tagliabue called the players actions and statements completely 
uncalled for and improper 
kiam who has been widely criticized for playing down the 
incident said the team would abide by tagliabues judgment 
we regret that the incident occurred kiam added the team 
and i had previously expressed our apologies and we repeat them 
once again the decision has been rendered now its time to get on 
with playing football 
the team said the players would have no comment 
perryman who has since gone to the dallas cowboys denied to 
investigators any involvement in the incident the report said 
olson who now covers the boston celtics said my 
satisfaction with the investigation and subsequent sanctions is 
surpassed only by my wish the disgraceful incident had never 
occurred in the first place

conservative lawmakers heard the vote count 
roared their approval then wondered what they had done 
more than 100 tory lawmakers crowded into a committee room at 
the house of commons to hear the totals in the leadership race 
john major 185 michael heseltine 131 douglas hurd 56 
their delighted bellowing reverberated through the ancient 
woodpaneled corridors of the palace of westminster home of both 
houses of the british parliament 
but wait nobody won major was two votes short of the majority 
needed 
we were starting to bang the tables as we do on occasions 
like this but then we held our hands back as we realized what had 
happened said legislator david shaw 
one hundred and eightyfive sounded like an outright victory 
but then we remembered the reality of the numbers 
then as they surged out into the corridor to meet waiting 
reporters legislators learned that former defense secretary 
heseltine and foreign secretary hurd had conceded defeat 
a week ago many of these same tories produced a split vote that 
toppled prime minister margaret thatcher 
it had been a heady two weeks for the backbenchers as the 
rankandfile legislators are known most of the time they vote as 
they are told by leaders but in the leadership election they had 
a secret ballot and were avidly courted by all three camps 
lawmaker jeremy hanley said the wooing could have been more 
intense i had to pay for my own lunch he said they cant 
be that keen 
the result capped a day of buzzing activity in the usually 
sedate committee corridor a long walkway leading to dozens of 
committee rooms where the daytoday business of parliament is 
done 
early voters at committee room 12 included hurd a parttime 
writer of fiction who quipped that the threeway tussle for the 
leadership has given me a plot for my next novel 
major flashed an enigmatic smile and said nothing 
heseltine voting shortly after lunch time teased the media by 
reporting i confirm that at 213 pm i had three votes because 
i have two proxies 
mrs thatcher cast her vote after making her 698th appearance at 
question time when she fields queries from lawmakers she took 
7501 questions in her 11 years as the head of the government 
whoever the lawmakers supported they all said afterward that 
the party would go forward united behind major 
thats exactly as predicted earlier this week by lord st john 
of fawsley a former conservative member of the house of commons 
tories believe in unity lord st john said they would support 
major hurd or heseltine 
theyd rally around a broomstick he said

army officials said there was no 
evidence to support a former senators allegations that atrocities 
were committed by us forces whenthey ousted manuel noriega from 
panama last year 
col joseph s panvini director of public affairs for the us 
southern command in panama said allegations that us forces paid 
6 per body and buried slain noncombatants in mass unmarked graves 
was absolutely unfounded 
he said there was no evidence to support other allegations made 
by former us sen donald stewart of alabama stewart toured 
panama in late august 
stewart said about 100 panamanians he spoke with told story 
after story of innocent citizens including children and the 
elderly being killed and buried in mass graves he said official 
figures on casualties appeared to be far short of the actual 
numbers 
there has been no attempt on the part of the us government 
to hide the reporting of panamanian fatalities as a result of 
operation just cause panvini said in a letter responding to the 
allegations 
panvini is saying things contrary to what the people in panama 
told me stewart said in a telephone interview if they dont 
have anything to cover up an investigation will reveal that i 
would love to know it wasnt true 
as for panvinis denial of the 6perbody claim stewart said 
he may be absolutely correct that they didnt pay 6 a body but 
that was what i was told by more than one panamanian 
stewart toured panama in late august on a trip related to 
mission work with the united methodist church he said he hopes for 
a congressional investigation into the claims 
stewart an anniston lawyer won a special election to fill a 
senate vacancy in 1978 but lost in the democratic primary seeking a 
full term in 1980 after his sixday trip to panama he told 
methodist church officials that he received report after report 
of those who saw the atrocities 
panvini said that since jan 11 inquiries concerning casualties 
of the december 1989 operation have been referred to panamas 
institute of legal medicine similar to a coroners office he said 
that as of nov 7 that agency had identified 65 military and 155 
civilian remains with another 50 bodies not yet identified he 
said some of the 50 may be among the 75 unsolved reports of missing 
persons 
prior to jan 11 he said the southern command in conjunction 
with the agency estimated there were 202 civilian fatalities he 
said it also estimated 315 military fatalities based on reports 
from combat units 
stewart said such figures on civilian deaths do not correspond 
with the accounts given to him by panamanians 
as for mass graves panvini said 123 panamanian nationals were 
buried in a common grave at panama city and 18 were buried at 
colon he said the burials and the previously reported exhumations 
were conducted by panamanian authorities not by us personnel 
stewart however said panamanians told him the interments in 
the common unmarked graves were paid for by us authorities 
panvini did not immediately return a telephone call concerning that 
allegation 
in his nov 21 letter panvini said regarding alleged 
atrocities by us forces only 24 reports of alleged misconduct by 
us troops during operation just cause have been received by us 
military authorities all 24 have been investigated 
as of aug 31 he said the army review cleared nine and found 
the remaining 15 warranted formal review by the department of the 
army

prime minister margaret thatcher facing the house 
of commons while her colleagues voted for her successor said that 
her 698th appearance for question time on tuesday would be her 
last 
i dont believe in making a career of positively last 
appearances said mrs thatcher who announced last week she 
would resign after 11 years in power 
she wished her successor well and predicted i am sure he will 
continue the policies which have been so successful for britain and 
he will continue to defeat socialism 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party and her 
principal antagonist for the last eight years asked mrs thatcher 
which of the policies that you leave to your successor you now 
think should be scrapped 
mrs thatcher replied i am happy that my successor will carry 
on the excellent policies that have finished with the decline of 
socialism and brought great prosperity to this country which have 
raised britains standing in the world and brought about a truly 
capitalowning democracy 
she told another questioner that since she became prime minister 
in 1979 she had appeared 698 times in the house of commons for 
question time and had fielded 7498 questions including his 
she answered three more before leaving the chamber and going to 
a committee room to cast her secret ballot in the conservative 
partys leadership election 
mrs thatcher seemed in good spirits but with none of the 
exuberant fury unleashed five days earlier when she led a debate 
hours after deciding to resign 
a labor legislator asked mrs thatcher whether she found it 
nauseating and hypocritical to be praised by her colleagues in 
the party considering what happened to her last week 
no i dont find it nauseating i find it very refreshing 
she said

a former top federal regulator testified 
tuesday that sen dennis deconcini improperly offered him a deal on 
behalf of savings and loan owner charles h keating jr and that 
three other keating five senators acquiesced in the proposal 
edwin j gray a star witness at the senate ethics committees 
hearings into the five senators relationships with keating said 
deconcinis offer at a 1987 meeting will be etched in my mind 
forever 
i considered it improper he declared the whole setting 
was an intimidating one 
he said deconcini apparently speaking for the other three 
senators as well asked that regulators not apply to keatings 
embattled lincoln savings and loan association a rule limiting 
risky investments 
deconcini dariz referred to keating during the meeting as 
our friend from lincoln said gray the former chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board 
none of the five senators was present for his testimony 
keating was the chairman of the nowfailed lincoln sampl when the 
evening meeting took place in deconcinis office on april 2 1987 
the committee is trying to decide whether the five senators 
intervened improperly for keating a political donor who along with 
associates contributed 13 million to the senators campaigns and 
causes 
the hearing recessed for the day just after deconcinis lawyer 
james hamilton began crossexamination of gray his examination 
followed a contentious crossexamination by thomas green lawyer 
for sen donald w riegle jr dmich 
charles f c ruff attorney for sen john glenn dohio 
briefly questioned gray john dowd representing sen john mccain 
rariz declined to crossexamine the witness and william taylor 
representing sen alan cranston dcalif awaited his turn 
all the senators except riegle attended the meeting with gray 
and all have denied that a deal was offered for lincoln which was 
in deep trouble with grays regulators 
gray testified deconcini asked that the riskyinvestment rule 
not be applied to lincoln and added if you do that well get 
our friend from lincoln to make more home loans 
i said we had gone through the administrative processes and 
im not going to do that gray testified he said they were 
there for their friend at lincoln 
gray said we did not succumb to that pressure and the 
riskyinvestment rule was not withdrawn nothing was speeded up 
nothing was slowed down in the lincoln investigation as a 
result of the senators intervention he said 
gray testified he did not protest to the senators after the 
alleged deal was offered because he feared they would not back 
legislation to provide moneyraising authority for the hardpressed 
federal savings and loan insurance fund 
gray was responsible for the fund as chairman of the federal 
home loan bank board 
calm under direct examination from special counsel robert s 
bennett the witness whose testimony is crucial to the case not 
only insisted that deconcini offered the deal but added every 
time he said anything he said we i assumed he was speaking 
for cranston glenn and mccain 
while riegle was not at that meeting gray said the michigan 
democrat was instrumental in organizing it something that riegle 
the senate banking committee chairman has denied 
gray said that on march 6 1987 riegle told him you know 
there are senators out west who are very unhappy about the bank 
boards regulation of lincoln and you ought to talk to them 
gray said he resisted because he thought the matter was simply 
a continuation of keating accusations that the chief thrift 
regulator was out to get lincoln despite that protest gray said 
riegle told him i think youll be getting a call 
the exregulator said he was shocked when he learned that riegle 
was at a meeting april 9 1987 between all five senators and the 
san franciscobased regulators who were examining lincoln 
since riegle was from michigan and lincoln was based in 
california gray said i couldnt figure out for the life of me 
why he would be there 
when he later learned from a reporter that shortly before the 
meeting keating had hosted a fundraising dinner for riegle gray 
said his reaction was youve got to be kidding 
in his crossexamination green read from a news story that 
characterized gray as an autocratic executive who was obsessed with 
personal security and argued constantly with his fellow regulators 
gray attorney leonard garment forced an end to that line of 
questioning by protesting to chairman howell heflin dala that 
green stop reading from materials not in evidence and accounts with 
lurid descriptions 
riegles lawyer also asked the former regulator why he sent the 
senator a copy of a transcript of the april 9 1987 meeting with 
the san francisco regulators a favor that gray had not extended to 
the other four senators 
gray said he acted as a matter of courtesy to someone who had 
been friendly and sympathetic to me the five senators have said 
they had not been aware that a record of the meeting was being kept 
by one of the regulators gray also said of riegle i bore no 
malice against this man whatsoever

defense minister dmitry yazov on tuesday said 
troops may use force to prevent attacks against soldiers defending 
military installations he also warned that nuclear weapons must 
remain under the control of the central government 
yazovs statements in a nationally televised address gave new 
urgency to tensions in the 15 republics and president mikhail s 
gorbachevs efforts to hold the splintering soviet union together 
they also appeared to be the toughest official reaction yet to 
fears that nuclear weapons could fall into nationalist hands 
illegal actions in a number of republics endanger the 
defense capacity of the country he said after the evening news 
in some republics their own army units are being formed 
voices are heard about handing nuclear weapons over to some 
republics decisions are taken requiring relocation of armed forces 
units including strategic units yazov said 
attempts are made to defame and dishonor officers and 
soldiers and members of their families there are armed assaults 
against military installations he said 
yazov listed eight points including one that said nuclear 
forces must remain under national control and that the president 
has final authority on deployment of troops 
earlier this year a russian republic deputy prime minister 
called for the vast republic to possess its own nuclear weapons 
and some nationalists in the restive southern republics reportedly 
have tried to storm nuclear weapons facilities 
yazov said commanders of military district around the country 
have directives to take installations and systems under the guard 
and protection of armed units if local officials shut off their 
water power or other services 
he said soldiers have orders to use weapons if any 
serviceman or military installation is attacked commanders have 
orders to prevent acts of vandalism and counteract the 
construction of monuments and other forms of glorifying fascists 
and their henchmen and eliminate the existing symbols of this 
sort he said 
hours earlier gorbachev used his broad presidential powers to 
say he would hold local officials personally responsible for any 
failure to register servicemen or their families on lists for 
receiving services and goods 
refusals to register officers and noncommissioned officers 
and members of their families arriving to the place of service have 
lately become more frequent gorbachev said according to the 
official news agency tass 
it leads to illegal limitations in job placement medical and 
other social service he said he gave officials until jan 15 to 
resolve the problems 
the orders revealed a widespread resistance to red army presence 
in the country nearly all of whose republics have declared some 
form of sovereignty however it was unclear whether the orders 
would be enforced short of harsher military action 
gorbachev has used his presidential powers to issue several 
decrees on the economy but his hands have been tied in a power 
struggle for economic control with the republics led mostly by 
russia

the secondranking democrat in the house said 
tuesday night he would oppose a resolution authorizing the early 
use of force to throw iraq out of kuwait 
rep richard gephardt dmo the majority leader of the house 
spoke in a telephone interview after some senate democrats 
questioned the need for offensive action right away 
the disclosure of gephardts position was the first public 
opposition among party leaders in congress to the use of force 
something the united nations is expected to endorse soon 
gephardt who will outline his views further in a speech on 
wednesday said in a telephone interview i think we should stay 
the course with sanctions 
i would not be in favor of authorizing force at this point 
im not ruling it out gephardt said 
the question is not whether military action is justified it 
is said sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services 
committee which began several days of hearings on the gulf 
crisisthe question is whether military action is wise at this 
time and in our own national interest 
nunn said he supported the resolution to come before the un 
security council later this week authorizing member countries to 
use all necessary means to restore kuwait 
the hearings were called after congress adjourned for the year 
in reaction to bushs decision to send an additional 200000 
troops to the gulf to provide an offensive military option 
with the administration seeking un approval for the use of 
force in the gulf some committee members said the president also 
must make the same request of congress 
house speaker thomas foley in remarks to newly elected house 
democrats underscored the point i would personally want to have 
some assurance from the administration that no action would be 
taken prior to this congress meeting or it would be necessary to 
think seriously about calling in the previous congress he said 
neither foley nor his senate counterpart majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine has indicated whether he would support a 
congressional resolution authorizing offensive military action 
the opening day of the session also was marked by the 
conspicuous absence of the administrations top military officials 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff the two will testify monday morning 
sen bob kerrey dneb said the policy change to underline a 
us attack capability undermines the nations attempts to maintain 
international support for the sanctions by declaring through its 
own word and those of the imminent un resolution that our 
patience was almost spent 
kerrey is not a member of the panel but he submitted a statement 
to the committee 
committee member edard kennedy dmass declared if ever 
there is a case for giving peace a chance this is it 
yet another panel democrat alan dixon of illinois suggested 
that the administrations priorities are slightly misplaced 
to the best of my knowledge it is the united states congress 
that declares war for the united states not the united nations 
dixon said 
fighting the tide of criticism republican john mccain of 
arizona declared the issue is not prerogatives it is 
patriotism 
on the question of strategy nunn asked has the president 
limited our options by creating a use it or lose it situation 
with the deployment of such a large us force to the persian 
gulf 
john glenn dohio said the administration has yet to make its 
case for military attack in the gulf arguing that the nation 
cannot get into a war that is not fully understood and backed by 
the american people we need more than soundbite justification 
in the place of senior administration officials the panel heard 
from former cia director james schlesinger who testified that the 
united states believes it will take about a year for international 
sanctions against iraq to take full effect 
schlesinger told the panel that that was an official 
estimate the one time cia director and defense secretary did not 
indicate the basis for his statement 
a year to me seems to be in the right ballpark 
schlesinger said time enough to drain off the cash that is now 
sustaining the smuggling operations that bring in food 
his society is bleeding and its going to get worse with the 
passage of time schlesinger said but it may take somewhat 
longer for those difficulties to lead saddam to change his mind and 
withdraw from kuwait he said 
meanwhile at a separate hearing a treasury department official 
said iraqs central bank and its two primary international 
banks have been effectively cut off from the international 
financial community so that iraqi financial flows have been 
reduced to a mere trickle of their preaugust levels 
r richard newcomb director of the office of foreign assets 
control told the house banking committee the evertightening 
economic embargo against iraq is certain to hamper iraqs ability 
to carry out effective military campaigns and will bring home to 
the iraqi people the futility of saddams aggression against 
kuwait 
newcomb in response to questions from panel members conceded 
that some goods may be reaching iraq overland but he refused to 
identify countries suspected of breaking the embargo 
the hearings come as the united nations security council 
prepares to vote on a resolution threatening to use all necessary 
means to drive iraq from kuwait if it does not leave by january 
nunn indicated his support for the resolution but said it is 
not a substitute for fully informing the american people of our own 
nations objectives and strategy 
kennedy added it is not enough for president bush to go to 
the united nations to get approval for the use of military force in 
the persian gulf he must also come to congress

a ban on cigarette vending machines in most 
public places got final approval tuesday from mayor david dinkins 
a former smoker who said the ban will help keep smokes out of 
childrens hands 
today we have achieved an important prochild prohealth law 
that will save lives dinkins said obviously some children 
will still be able to buy cigarettes but many wont 
the mayor pushed for the ban saying previously that 32000 
children in new york begin smoking each year and 10000 will die 
from complications from the habit 
the ban which takes effect jan 31 1992 allows cigarette 
vending machines only in taverns which must keep them at least 25 
feet entrances and in view of the operator 
dinkins who gave up smoking 28 years ago said he plans to work 
with state lawmakers to restrict overthecounter cigarette sales 
to children and would also like to phase out cigarette advertising 
in baseball stadiums and on cityowned property 
the city already bans smoking in municipal buildings and 
regulates smoking in work places

president hafez assad met tuesday with 
three british parliament members in talks expected to accelerate 
moves to restore diplomatic ties severed four years ago 
the syrian government newspaper tishrin said earlier this month 
that britain should resume relations with syria if it wanted the 13 
western hostages in lebanon freed 
the official syrian arab news agency reported the tuesday 
meeting and said foreign minister farouk alsharaa also attended 
sharaa met monday with the british delegation of robert adley 
and tim rathbone of the ruling conservative party and sir david 
steel of the liberal democratic party 
during the weekend sharaa also met with david gorebooth an 
undersecretary at the foreign office in the first contact between 
the two governments since relations with damascus were cut over 
alleged syrian involvement in terrorism 
sources noted that assad would not have received the delegation 
unless efforts to restore ties gained ground 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity also said that 
resumption of relations was unlikely until after the new british 
government forms in london conservatives late tuesday elected 
treasury chief john major to succeed margaret thatcher as prime 
minister 
mrs thatcher who opposed restoring ties with syria ordered 
relations severed in november 1986 she said her government had 
evidence syria was behind a plot to blow up an israeli jetliner at 
heathrow airport near london in april 1986 
resumption of ties with britain could give new hope for the 
release of western hostages held by proiranian extremists the 
captives include six americans four britons two germans and an 
italian 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was taken hostage march 16 1985 and is the 
longestheld captive 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
based there under an arab league mandate it helped free american 
hostages robert polhill and frank reed in april and irishman brian 
keenan in august 
ussyrian ties improved in summer when damascus sided with the 
alliance against saddam hussein following iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait syria committed nearly 20000 troops to a military buildup 
in the persian gulf 
syria remains on theus state departments list of countries 
that sponsor terrorism but secretary of state james a baker iii 
visited damascus in september and president bush met with assad in 
geneva last week

switzerlands last bastion of male 
supremacy was swept away tuesday by a supreme court judgment that a 
tiny catholic state must allow women to play an active role in 
politics 
the federal tribunal ruled that appenzellrhodes interior state 
violated swiss sexual equality laws by refusing to let women 
participate in its annual legislative assembly 
it said that beginning now women must be allowed to vote at the 
assembly and all local elections and hence be eligible for 
political office in the enclave in northeastern switzerland 
switzerland is a federation of 23 cantons states joined under 
a federal constitution with large powers of local control retained 
by each canton 
swiss women won the vote at federal level two decades ago 
the unanimous decision by one female and six male judges 
followed three separate complaints from appenzellers of both sexes 
challenging the exclusion of women 
its a huge weight off my mind said one of the 
complainants theres rohner sonderegger after the verdict 
the outdoor legislative assembly known as landsgemeinde dates 
to the middle ages traditionally attended by men carrying swords 
to indicate their voting eligibility the colorful ceremony has the 
last say in local affairs 
foreign tourists flocked to the mountainous state with a 
population of just 13000 last april to witness an overwhelming 
no to a proposal for female suffrage

the state senate minority leader must stand 
trial on charges of using public funds to pay four people who 
performed no work new yorks highest court ruled tuesday 
the state court of appeals said in a 61 decision that manfred 
ohrenstein did not have to stand trial on other charges of 
illegally using public funds to pay political campaign workers 
those charges had been dismissed by a lower court and made up 
the bulk of a 564count indictment against ohrenstein a manhattan 
democrat and three associates 
the court of appeals the states highest said that while it 
did not condone using taxpayer dollars to finance campaign work 
the practice was not illegal 
the court ordered ohrenstein to stand trial on socalled noshow 
charges of hiring and paying four people who did no work 
the dismissed charges were considered the central issue in the 
case against ohrenstein because they went to the heart of the 
legislatures operations where government work and reelection 
politics are carefully blended 
the indictment stems from ohrensteins failed attempt to wrest 
control of the state senate from republicans in 1986 some of the 
employees cited in the dismissed charges were fulltime legislative 
staffers assigned to work on campaigns other workers were hired 
for the campaign season paid with taxpayer dollars and fired after 
election day 
ohrenstein 65 was indicted in 1987 with democratic sen howard 
babbush top ohrenstein aide frank sanzillo and former democratic 
senatorial candidate joseph montalto the court of appeals ruling 
left them facing trial for their roles in the alleged noshow 
hirings 
ohrensteins lawyer jack hoffinger predicted that it would be 
difficult for prosecutors to prove the four employees did no work 
or that ohrenstein knew if they did no work 
the socalled noshows were put in to dress up the 
indictment hoffinger said this is not a victory for the 
prosecution if you think it is ask the prosecution 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau who had asked the 
court of appeals to reinstate all the charges said in a statement 
that he would pursue the noshow charges as promptly as 
possible 
it was not immediately clear when a trial would begin 
ohrenstein faces a maximum of seven years in prison for each of 
about 50 charges remaining morgenthau spokesman gerald mckelvey 
said 
ohrenstein a senator since 1961 and babbush would also lose 
their senate seats if convicted of the felonies 
two weeks after ohrenstein revealed that he was under 
investigation the state legislature passed a resolution 
authorizing legislative staffers to engage in political activity as 
long as they had some official legislative duties and performed 
them 
democratic and republican leaders in the state legislature had 
united behind ohrenstein and had asked the court to drop the 
charges assembly speaker mel miller a brooklyn democrat called 
tuesdays decision well reasoned 
ohrenstein again failed to take control of the state senate this 
year and lost a seat to the republicans

a huge jet fuel fire that burned unchecked for two 
days near stapleton international airport was extinguished tuesday 
with help from a team of specialists flown in from texas 
mounting an allout assault firefighters put out the blazes in 
two storage tanks about 230 pm 53 hours after the fire began 
said fire department spokesman mike mcneil 
everybody is relieved its been a long ordeal mcneil said 
there were a lot of smiles on a lot of faces 
a fiveman team from williams boots amp coots of port neches 
texas donned fireproof suits and sealed broken valves on an 
800000gallon tank that was onethird to onehalf full of jet fuel 
and a 350000gallon tank that had only a fraction of fuel left 
the two tanks had been on fire since monday they were ignited 
by a pair of 400000gallon tanks that burned themselves out 
monday the four tanks containing more than 2 million gallons of 
jet fuel were part of a fuel storage farm for stapleton airport 
that includes 12 tanks holding a total of about 5 million gallons 
of fuel 
the storage area is about onehalf mile north of the stapleton 
terminal 
several water and foam sprays were trained on the two 
stillburning tanks to cool them down so the team could move close 
enough to spray the leaking valves with potassium bicarbonate 
mcneil said the blasts of foam and water worked better than 
expected they extinguished the flames 
denver fire officials had planned to let the fire burn itself 
out but they changed their strategy tuesday after a meeting with 
williams boots amp coots executives 
continental airlines which owns four tanks at the fuel storage 
area had flown in the company officials monday night 
we have 38 million worth of product onsite said 
continental spokesman jim monaghan 
the fire diminished markedly in intensity after the 
400000gallon tanks finally burned themselves out monday leaving 
smoldering crumpled metal shells 
all four storage tanks destroyed in the fire belong to united 
airlines the airline experienced a severe fuel shortage sunday 
that caused it to delay and reschedule flights but resolved the 
problem monday by employing tanker trucks and flying in fuel from 
outside denver 
a snowstorm that dusted denver with up to 2 inches of snow 
dropped temperatures below freezing and further hampered the 
efforts of more than 60 firefighters tuesday morning 
the snowstorm temporarily knocked out firefighters pumps and 
froze water on their clothing and equipment warming tents were set 
up for the firefighters who took turns on the fire line 
the snow later ended and the sun came out but temperatures did 
not rise much above freezing 
a broken valve on one of the 400000gallon tanks was thought to 
be what triggered the fire

iraq will have less than seven weeks to withdraw nearly a 
halfmillion troops from kuwait before it faces the prospect of a 
unauthorized military strike the soviet ambassador to the 
united nations said tuesday 
ambassador yuli m vorontsov said the un demand for withdrawal 
would specify jan 15 as the date for the iraqi forces that overran 
kuwait 3 months ago to leave the emirate vorontsov said there was 
a consensus among the five permanent members of the security 
council on the resolution 
but foreign minister qian qichen said wednesday at beijings 
airport that china will not vote for a un resolution authorizing 
use of force to dislodge iraq from kuwait he refused to say 
whether china will veto it or abstain 
meanwhile three americans waving iraqi and american flags 
arrived in jordan after being freed by iraqs leader saddam 
hussein 
and in saudi arabia where the multitude of us troops are 
based facing off against iraq the first rain of the twomonth 
rainy season fell in the north filling jeep tracks with puddles 
and forcing arab forces allied with the west to bundle up against 
the unfamiliar dampness 
us boxing great muhammad ali met for 50 minutes tuesday with 
saddam in baghdad and was promised that a number of americans held 
hostage in iraq would be freed at an unspecified date ali said he 
wouldnt leave iraq until he is handed over some hostages held as 
human shields against possible attack 
as one of the permanent un security council members china has 
veto power over any resolution it has voted for all 10 previous 
resolutions that seek to pressure iraq to end its occupation of 
kuwait but has expressed great reluctance to see force used 
it has always been the position of china to call for a 
peaceful settlement qian told reporters at the airport while 
preparing to leave for the united states to cast chinas vote 
the measure to authorize all necessary means to get iraq 
out of kuwait after that date is to be voted on thursday 
the deadline for an iraqi withdrawal had been the only sticking 
point in a draft un security council resolution 
in a fresh sign that the baghdad government is bracing for war 
the pentagon said iraq is rapidly increasing its troop strength in 
kuwait and southern iraq it said iraq has 450000 troops in the 
region an increase of 20000 over last week 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee meanwhile 
questioned whether it is really in the vital interest of the 
united states to use military force to liberate kuwait which iraq 
seized on aug 2 
some of the freed americans whose families had traveled to iraq 
to plead with saddam for their release told reporters at the amman 
airport that the bush administration had ignored their plight 
i was not released with help from my government said john 
stevenson of panama city fla it was my family who did it 
the united states has demanded the unconditional release of all 
of the hundreds of foreigners held hostage in iraq and the state 
department has discouraged private hostagefreeing missions 
another freed american clyde jesse of buffalo grove ill 
suggested the united states should negotiate with saddam i 
believe it is time we started talking he said 
the third freed american was fred harrington of bellevue wash 
ten britons and five germans were released as well the women in 
the british group carried flowers the americans waved the us and 
iraqi flags 
at the united nations the stage was set for a security council 
meeting to consider the strongest measure yet against iraq the 
resolution calls on iraq to release all foreign hostages withdraw 
its troops and restore kuwaits government or face imminent action 
by unauthorized multinational forces 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze had settled on jan 15 as the deadline for an 
iraqi withdrawal 
britain and the united states had favored jan 1 but had said 
the question was open to negotiations 
the united states had already secured the backing of the other 
permanent members of the security council for the measure the 
permanent members the united states the soviet union britain 
france as well as china have the power to veto council 
resolutions 
altogether nine votes on the 15member council are need to 
approve the resolution it is supported by at least six of the 
nonpermanent council members canada finland romania ivory 
coast zaire and ethiopia 
yemen the councils only arab member is believed likely to 
abstain or vote against it 
malaysia and colombias votes are uncertain colombian foreign 
minister luis jaramillo said tuesday that colombia still has not 
decided how to vote but would prefer a diplomatic solution 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon has said his country could not 
support the resolution the soviet union sent a highranking envoy 
to cuba a longtime client state for talks on tuesday in advance 
of the vote 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev also held talks tuesday in 
moscow with saudi arabias foreign minister prince saud alfaisal 
and said both sides agreed the un measure would promote a just 
resolution of the gulf crisis 
in washington the senate armed services committee opened four 
days of hearings on president bushs gulf policy 
the hearings were prompted by bushs decision earlier this month 
to send more troops and build an offensive military option with 
a force that will total about 430000 in the region by january the 
panels chairman sam nunn said the buildup raises serious 
questions 
is it in our vital interest to liberate kuwait how long can 
we sustain more than 400000 troops has president bush limited his 
options by creating a useitorloseit situation the georgia 
democrat asked 
it is not enough for president bush to go to the united 
nations to get approval for the use of military force in the 
persian gulf said sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the 
committee he must also come to congress 
pentagon pokesman pete williams outlining new us estimates 
of iraqi troop strength said half of iraqs estimated 450000 
troops in the theater of operations southern iraq and kuwait 
are inside kuwait itself the troops are mainly defensive in 
nature but have the ability to go on the offensive if 
necessary he said

tells the story of a terrifying voyage to africa on a clipper ship 
ron charnows the house of morgan an american banking dynasty 
and the rise of modern finance won in the nonfiction category 
during the 40th anniversary awards dinner at the plaza hotel 
the competition was marked by the presence of littleknown 
writers from small publishing houses and acute dividedness 
among the jurors who chose them 
the five fiction works that were up for consideration included 
three books by immigrant authors the first novels of jessica 
hagedorn and ilena castedo and the 42yearold second book of 
felipe alfau who is 88

who wrote two other novels and a collection of short fiction was 
among two established writers in the fiction category the other 
was joyce carol oates

difficult trip as a catalyst for selfdiscovery and also marks a 
passage for africanamerican fiction the title refers to the 
crossing of the atlantic to america from africa by slave ships 
in this decade we will see the emergence of blackauthor 
fiction that will help us as a people and as a culture to move from 
narrow complaint to broad celebration said johnson 42 
one of the fiction jurors writer paul west said there was 
acute dividedness over nearly everything discussed by the 
fivemember panel that chose the nominees he charged that ethnic 
considerations ideology and moral selfrighteousness had 
prevailed over style and merit 
but sonny mehta president of alfred a knopf publishers said 
although the list of nominees was obscure he saw nothing 
sinister in the choices 
it looks as if they were looking around for books that have 
not had their share of praise mehta said

about teaching former president nixon artist jackson pollock and 
roosevelt cabinet member harold ickes

with what was happening in the 1980s said chernow 41 of 
brooklyn heights 
he said 19th century bankers had a very different notion of 
what business was it was a gentlemens club against todays wild 
carnival of greed

the more things change the more this tiny 
town wants to remain the same 
that means the kind of place where people live in old school 
buses or build homes as the spirt moves them a place where the 
town building inspector can take a sixmonth leave of absence to 
help a peace group build a school in el salvador where volunteers 
give away bread on fridays where most of the roads are dirt where 
most of the residents like them that way 
this is a town of rugged individualists who came here because 
we wanted to be free to be ourselves said prudence smith a 
member of the fiveperson town planning board 
and so they are a happy melange of young and old of machinists 
and musicians college professors and farmers sewage workers and 
aging hippies 
isolated and poor with no services to speak of and no intention 
of adding any wendell has always attracted its share of 
truthseekers 
mormon hollow marked by a tiny cemetery on the north side of 
town is named for travelers who left a 19thcentury religious 
caravan and settled here in the 1960s and 1970s wendell became a 
haven for backtothelanders and flower children from the 
university of massachusetts and the other colleges clustered around 
amherst 30 miles away 
not only are some of my best friends hippies but some of our 
best selectmen have been hippies said selectman ted lewis not a 
hippie himself 
but wendell appeared to be falling victim to its own popularity 
with the population more than doubling to 830 in 20 years the 
problem facing children of the 60s in the 1990s was how they could 
all stay in wendell and still retain the town spirit that attracted 
them there in the first place 
for a long time our poverty and isolation protected us but 
no longer smith said the cost of living even here has 
increased to the point where it is becoming difficult for a lot of 
people 
so townsfolk held a sevenhour visioning workshop in which 
they wrote down illustrated and debated things the town could use 
such as a tool collective to share such homeowner necessities as 
mowers chainsaws grass clippers and ladders they drew up lists 
of places of the heart or landmarks they wanted to protect 
ranging from the town common to a heron rookery 
some changes came quickly a volunteer committee called the 
star riders was formed to offer others rides into town the 
result of a discussion about the lack of public transit 
with a 20000 state grant residents hired a small local 
consulting firm to help draw up a master plan the centerpiece of 
which is the proposed wendell works a townsponsored 
commercial organic farm and spinoff cottage industries in a 
typically casual way there is no estimated time of completion 
people dont have much opportunity to spend money in 
wendell said smith noting that the towns commercial 
development is limited to two general stores an egg farm and an 
auto salvage yard 
the fruit and vegetables produced by the farm could be sold by 
subscription to residents who would pay in advance for a share of 
the crop when it ripened she said 
wendellites want to expand the operation beyond produce into 
baked goods milk deliveries firewood sales and other farmrelated 
businesses 
it wouldnt add a lot of property to the tax rolls smith 
said but if we had a soy dairy that would just satisfy the 
towns own needs it would be a way to recycle wendell money in 
wendell and make it easier for individuals to come up with the cash 
flow they need to make it here 
and it would fit wendells tradition of doing its own thing 
this after all is a town that boasts its own troupe of african 
dancers and drummers and a centrally located free box where 
residents are encouraged to take what they need and leave what they 
can spare 
once a month town hall becomes the full moon coffeehouse for 
performances benefiting causes from tax resistance to a group that 
opposed state surveillance flights to ferret out marijuana growers 
all this doesnt necessarily make an impression on folks who 
grew up in wendell 
theres nothing new with the younger people said raymond 
avery a 72yearold native actually they have less sense of 
individuality than the older folks

sitting there stonefaced she just absorbs them somehow without 
flinching 
november was kind of a brad dourif film festival month with the 
release of the exorcist iii stephen kings graveyard 
shift childs play 2 and grim prairie tales 
in addition dourif was seen playing a weasel in sonny 
boy a drama that came and went in a wink not so the 
exorcist and childs play sequels which landed no 1 on the 
boxoffice list grim prairie tales was a bomb 
the actor commented on the films during a recent interview 
graveyard shift it was fun i went down and shot little 
scenes for two weeks and then returned in summer and shot one day 
of a big scene i was working in two other movies at the same time 
i was doing chaindance most of the time when i got a break i 
went to toronto for a film called murder blues 
i met stephen king once i was trying to pick out some 
breakfast cereal and all of a sudden this hand came in and a voice 
said hi steve king like your acting i shook the hand looked 
up and he was gone 
the exorcist iii i was an extremely nasty guy he plays 
the devil people dont come much nastier than that guy the fun 
thing about that character was that he really enjoyed his work it 
was the most intelligently written part of the horror genre that i 
have read william peter blatty is a wonderful writer 
childs play 2 as the voice of chuckie the evil doll 
that is what i call my generic bad guy from the north voice i do 
it off the top of my head without any effort at all when i think 
what does a bad guy from the north sound like chuckie comes 
out 
grim prairie tales its sort of a horror film but i 
dont play a crazy person he and james earl jones sit around a 
frontier campfire and spin yarns of terror 
why do producers of horror pictures think of brad dourif 
well i started my career in one flew over the cuckoos nest 
as a kind of crazy guy the actor said now were in an era of 
horror films thats a field day for actors who can do crazy 
people of course theyre going to think of me get brad he 
does this kind of thing 
dourif 40 spent his early years in huntington wva and two 
movies had a profound impact on him during his youth 
i went through a very difficult time when i was young he 
recalled my father died when i was 3 and i went through a 
period of adjusting to a stepfather my way of dealing with it as a 
child was to kind of escape into a dream world i had a horrible 
time in school because i was always staring out the window 
i saw two films with my grandmother one of them was the red 
balloon the other was the bicycle thief these films really had 
an impact on me they dealt with problems i was going through the 
problem of adjusting was in the red balloon the world was 
against this kid but he has something about him the red balloon 
then there was the fatherson relationship in the bicycle 
thief i learned i wasnt alone i connected bigtime with them 
that was the moment when i wanted to have something to do with 
film 
in 1973 director milos forman saw dourif in the play when you 
coming home red ryder in new york and cast him as the tragic 
billy bibbit in cuckoos nest that resulted in an academy 
award nomination as supporting actor and a host of offers forman 
cast him as the younger brother in ragtime other films have 
included eyes of laura mars wise blood heavens gate 
and mississippi burning 
it would be lovely to say that i made a wise choice by 
choosing to play character parts he commented but lets face 
it all the money and all the screen time is in playing leading 
men you get the girl you get more time on the screen and they pay 
you more of course i would prefer that 
on the other hand if you show people you can play all kinds 
of parts your career is going to last longer

three years ago jay barbree a space reporter 
who has covered more than 60 manned launches in his 32 years with 
nbc went for a run along the beach near his home in cocoa beach 
fla 
it almost was his last he collapsed and suffered what doctors 
call sudden cardiac death he had no pulse for five minutes 
only quick action by neighbors and paramedics saved him 
frightening but a blessing in disguise had it not happened he 
says odds are that he wouldnt have learned he needed a coronary 
bypass operation a few years later he could have had a definitely 
fatal heart attack 
me dropping dead on the beach is what saved my life thats a 
hell of a thing to say but thats it said barbree who has 
written a justpublished book about his experience the day i 
died 
now 56 barbree the son of a georgia farmer had done his best 
to avoid such an attack 
aware that the men of his family had a history of heart 
problems he had quit smoking 11 years earlier watched his 
cholesterol count avoided highsalt foods and exercised regularly 
all that good stuff 
the scary thing about it is that there was no warning he 
said i was always convinced when i was jogging that if i overdid 
it id have pain in my chest something that said hey jay slow 
down 
but theres a hormone i forget its name that protects you 
against pain and you get whats known as a runners high its 
like a drug you get addicted to it 
in retrospect i was a big idiot down there running like mad 
on the beach it put a bigger demand on my coronary arteries to 
deliver blood to the heart organ than they could sustain 
the arteries were partly blocked by plaque he said he suffered 
the attack a ventricular fibrillation due to their condition 
its like a clogged fuel line he said you can have a 
perfect engine but if it cant get fuel its going to quit 
after a period of recuperation reflection and what is known as 
a petscan an electronic test designed to detect heart disease in 
its earliest stages barbree agreed to coronary bypass surgery 
it was done this month last year he didnt lay about 
afterwards though 
although his work was extremely limited and done at home i 
was back on the air within 30 days said barbree who has covered 
the nations manned space launches since alan shepards first 
suborbital shot in 1961 
now hes back at full power still covering space matters for 
nbc news and the nbc radio network he also occasionally reports 
for some nbcowned stations and the networks affiliates 
coming close to final checkout time tends to make a man think 
differently about things barbree is no exception 
now living in a new home 10 minutes from cape canaveral he 
doesnt jog anymore but i walk briskly now old harry truman 
was right you get out there and walk 
another change before i died i was for capital punishment 
the death penalty now im against it i sort of figure that death 
is gods business now no matter how brutal a crime a man or woman 
commits i simply feel he or she should be locked up forever 
another even though i have a black belt in aikido a 
japanese system of selfdefense i dont think i can hurt 
anybody now but i still have a temper im trying to get under 
control 
and perhaps the most important i really appreciate my family 
my friends people im close to now i just feel closer more 
concerned for them than i ever did before 
 
elsewhere in television

the pattern of electricity supply is two 
hours on two off and sofia is even running out of matches 
candles and kerosene 
the periodic darkness and prospects of a cold hard winter are 
symptomatic of bulgarias worst economic and political crisis the 
governing socialists formerly the communists are locked with the 
opposition in an increasingly hostile debate over how to run the 
country 
dimitar sokolov deputy chairman of the committee for power 
generation indicated the electricity supply may be erratic even if 
bulgarias crippled nuclear plant is repaired and brought back into 
normal service 
oil for heating also is a question mark unless soviet crude oil 
deliveries are made as expected the whole district heating 
system would be in danger he said 
sokolov said heating in sofia is provided exclusively by 
oilfired plants and oil storage facilities depots are only 
onethird full 
moscow has supplied most of eastern europes oil for years but 
the soviets are missing deliveries because of their own economic 
problems 
four soviet 440megawatt reactors and a 1000megawatt reactor 
at bulgarias only nuclear power station on the danube river at 
kozlodui provide 30 percent of bulgarias electricity 
the 1000megawatt reactor went down at the end of october for 
the second time in four months because of a mechanical problem 
another 1000megawatt reactor is scheduled to go on stream in 
midjanuary increasing the countrys power supply by 10 percent 
but whether it will is uncertain 
hospitals government offices other public institutions 
industrial enterprises and food shops are exempt from the the power 
cuts sokolov said but the government has imposed power 
restrictions on industry 
stores can operate during the daylight hours but when the power 
is off they close between 5 pm and 6 pm the time most workers 
could do their shopping 
reporters recently happened into a basement restaurant where 
employees were huddled around a kerosene lamp waiting for the 
lights to go on they did and revealed 15 or 20 other customers 
waiting in the dark 
premier andrei lukanov one of a group that ousted hardline 
communist leader todor zhivkov a year ago is urging opposition 
legislators to support his plans for market reform 
his critics say lukanov has exhausted his credit with the public 
during a year of economic deterioration they demand the 
resignation of his government and are supported by growing numbers 
of protesters 
while they wait for something to be done daily life becomes 
more difficult for bulgarias 9 million people 
you have to adapt to the situation as best you can but people 
are growing ever more nervous said valery lazov a sofia taxi 
driver 
people these days seem to think only about all the items that 
wont be available in the shops tomorrow breakfast for our 
thirdgrade daughter has to be prepared the day before because 
there is no light in the morning 
lazov added however that he was better off than many others 
because he has a storage battery to operate the radio and i have 
a lamp from the car he said some people he knew didnt even have 
candles matches are at a premium 
elitsa velichkova a 16year old sofia high school student said 
her family was very angry because there is no television and 
had run out of kerosene for the lamp 
sokolov belittled the technical and personnel problems at the 
kozlodui nuclear plant where experts from the international atomic 
energy agency have been reviewing technical and safety conditions 
in a recent letter kozlodui employees warned of inadequate 
safety precautions and lack of expert personnel for the new 
1000megawatt reactor sokolov said of the letter we did have 
enough personnel by the time the letter arrived but they had to 
take exams and most of them have done so in the meantime 
nearly a dozen specialists from the soviet union were flown in 
to help out for several months he said 
an official at the nuclear agencys headquarters in vienna 
speaking anonymously indicated the small sovietmade reactors were 
outdated and practically impossible to modernize 
its like trying to build high tech into an old truck he 
said

tawfic sofer a retired cloth merchant and 
caretaker of baghdads main synagogue peered through the makeshift 
peephole of an iron gate 10 feet high 
when ordered by two government officials from state security 
and the information ministry the 65yearold iraqi jew unlocked 
the gate and swung it open 
welcome welcome he said several times in arabic his eyes 
on the cars parked outside 
satisfied that the officials were alone except for a foreign 
reporter he guided the group to the synagogue 
president saddam husseins government sometimes allows visits by 
western news media to the synagogue in downtown baghdad but 
requires iraqi officials to accompany them for security reasons 
that are not explained 
reporters are discouraged from visiting the synagogue on the 
jewish sabbath which runs from sundown friday to sundown saturday 
reminders of saddam are omnipresent in iraq and the synagogue 
is no exception his portrait is on two calendars that hang on the 
wall at the entrance 
the square white twostory synagogue was built in 1942 in the 
middle of a bazaar 
its walls are covered with scriptures written in hebrew and 
there are many shelves of old books the synagogues torah scrolls 
the handwritten five books of moses that form the foundation of the 
jewish faith are on a raised platform concealed by a black and 
gold curtain 
it is a very rich collection said sofer a bachelor who 
gave up his business to tend the synagogue after the last caretaker 
died two years ago we are fine and we do not want war we are a 
very small community but we are surviving 
about 600 jews live in baghdad 200 more in the port city of 
basra 100 in the northern city of mosul and 100 or so in other 
areas of iraq he said 
iraq had a flourishing jewish community of doctors lawyers 
professors and businessmen with 65 synagogues when iraq gained 
political independence from britain in 1932 
only two synagogues still function more than 120000 iraqi jews 
moved to israel soon after the jewish state was born in 1948 
sofer said his ancestors and those of most iraqi jews came to 
baghdad from babylon centuries ago more than 2500 years ago king 
nebuchadnezzar of babylon conquered jerusalem and carried the 
captive children of israel back to the land between the tigris and 
the euphrates rivers 
saddam often is compared with nebuchadnezzar in the baghdad of 
today iraqi officials describe the jews of babylon as an ancient 
fifth column who helped persian invaders take the city 
according to the ofttold story which does not appear in the 
bible the babylonian jews advised king cyrus to destroy dams on 
the euphrates thus lowering water levels in moats around the city 
so his troops could enter 
we do have problems sofer said of baghdads remaining jews 
he paused looked at the iraqi officials and continued 
our problems are marriages we dont have enough young men to 
marry we have at least 25 girls ready to marry but there are not 
enough eligible men 
sofer said iraqi jews hav only one shohet the butcher who 
slaughters animals and prepares the meat according to ancient 
jewish law 
it is a big problem but we are trying to solve it sofer 
said he has to work overtime there is no other way when he is 
sick we have a major problem 
we are very lucky that two rabbis serve baghdad he said 
like all iraqis interviewed of whatever faith sofer would not 
say if people live in fear of saddam 
when asked whether he feared persecution if the usled 
multinational force in saudi arabia attacked in an effort to force 
iraq out of kuwait he said we pray there is no war 
the people here do not trust us but we are not bothered but 
if there is war we may face problems sofer refused to 
elaborate 
iraq a predominantly moslem country denies any persecution of 
jews 
we have jewish people studying in university said an 
information ministry official who cannot be named under government 
regulations they are also in business 
he said jewish businessmen like their moslem counterparts were 
free to travel outside iraq 
saddams government however carries on a regular propaganda 
program to expose the zionist movements imperialist goals

though you might never guess it from the way 
they are described recessions arent all bad any more than 
michael milken is totally greedy or completely charitable 
recessions put stocks on sale making them available to ew 
buyers they allow housing prices to drop into the range of folks 
who have waited for years to fulfill their dream they tend to 
bring inflation down 
in contrast expansions generally are praised though they 
sometimes lead to inefficient buying and selling practices 
deterioration of quality poor service inflation irresponsible 
borrowing habits and the like 
experience has demonstrated in fact that some of the nations 
worst economic problems were generated by expansions and corrected 
by contractions a dramatic example of which is the nations 
nagging imbalance of trade 
year after year during the long expansion of the 1980s americans 
imported far more than they exported the economy was strong and 
one consequence of that strength was the ability and desire to own 
foreign manufactured goods 
it cost americans jobs and it cost them the ownership of part 
of their country since the dollars sent abroad were sent back by 
foreigners to buy american companies and commercial real estate 
now that problem is being addressed thanks to the slowdown and 
the threat of recession americans are watching their dollars they 
are importing less and faced with a domestic downturn domestic 
businesses have improved exports 
despite sharply higher prices for imported oil overall imports 
fell 24 percent in september meanwhile exports have been rising 
if you exclude oil the deficit rate has been nearly halved since 
1987 when the economy faltered 
this corrective ability seldom wins accolades for recessions 
just as bad colds that force overactive people to bed are usually 
damned for the postnasal drip rather than praised for the enforced 
rest that avoids a worse breakdown 
recessions it is true inevitably mean layoffs plant closings 
lowered profits dividend cuts and lowered tax revenues they can 
cause a great deal of pain to a great many people especially if 
they persist for a year or more 
they seldom do since world war ii there have been eight 
economic recessions but only two lasted more than a year from 
november 1973 through march 1974 and from july 1981 through 
november 1982 the recession of 1980 lasted a mere seven months 
and that of 19571958 just nine months two lasted 11 months and 
two persisted for a year 
but in each instance they also set the stage for healthier 
economic expansion reflected in job creation new plants higher 
profits better real wages stronger securities and revenue 
increases 
they rearranged the competitive marketplace routing out poor 
products and poorly managed companies encouraging competition 
creativity and improved productivity and discouraging waste of 
human resources money time and opportunity 
to an extent they routed out frivolous activities and 
expenditures and reestablished more sensible priorities 
all recessions hurt but they also give opportunity to prudent 
folks who saved their money to buy a house or who seek a good 
investment and they offer relief to the millions of people whose 
variablerate loans had become onerous 
a recession will always be viewed as an unwelcome guest or even 
as the enemy who seeks to do us in but the real rascal is the 
excess produced by the preceding expansion recessions seek to 
correct those problems 
in that sense recessions are really the launching pads for the 
good days to follow

the curatolas owned a fixerupper with a 
romantic wraparound porch they had a jeepstyle car with the 
requisite two kids in back summer barbecues for friends and 
chirping crickets to serenade them at night 
it was a suburban dream and the new york couple hated it 
we had all these ideals about what we wanted in a home said 
gerry curatola rolling hills and country roads lots of acreage 
it was very romantic but it wasnt reality the suburbs werent 
home 
many middleclass families have chosen to move away from 
manhattan where violence is on the rise and everything else often 
seems in decline but for the curatolas the city was home crime 
dirt noise and all 
the most important element of anywhere you live is time 
together as a family curatola a dentist said recently 
thats the important priority not commuting fixing the house 
doing this or doing that 
curatola and his wife georgia moved back into the city last 
spring after fewer than four years in their westchester county 
dream house they couldnt take the good life any longer 
for every leisurely weekend in their backyard gerry had at 
least 10 new 1hour commutes notched on his briefcase for every 
pleasant morning with her husband georgia endured many long 
lonely afternoons 
i think women in particular are very affected by a move like 
that said mrs curatola whose young daughter and son provided 
her some relief i dont play tennis and i dont do clubs 
without those suburban mainstays she said the isolation 
sometimes was overwhelming her days were taken up in solitary 
journeys to the market the dry cleaners to her 6yearold 
daughters school 
on the upper west side of manhattan where the couple now lives 
neighbors meet on the elevator standing in line at the bank or at 
the deli theres always something to joke about central park is 
the familys backyard 
the curatolas know the streets are dangerous and that the public 
schools are a mess but they also know fifth avenues christmas 
lights the guggenheim museums art and carnegie halls music 
theres nothing like little italys pasta or the charm of greenwich 
village on a blustery fall day 
the curatolas want their children to experience the citys 
wonderful mishmash of ethnicities and eccentricities the very 
things the mitzners miss 
barbara and marvin mitzner both 44 had their child in mind 
when they moved to the new york suburb of pound ridge six years 
ago 
we thought the school systems were so excellent but they 
arent what theyre pumped up to be said mrs mitzner whose 
5yearold daughter is attending private school the local 
kindergarten was appalling 
the unsatisfactory schools wouldnt be so bad on their own mrs 
mitzner said but add in the many meals her huband arrives home too 
late to share the perpetual home repairs aloof neighbors the 
driving everywhere all the time 
pound ridge is a lovely lovely place but it isnt all 
its cracked up to be particularly for a couple that has grown up 
with the excitement of city life said marvin mitzner a partner 
at the new york law firm of davidoff amp malido 
getting out of the city didnt turn out to be what we thought 
it might he said adding that a lot of his friends shared 
similar feelings 
there are no statistics on the number of families abandoning the 
suburbs but the mitzners who have put their home on the market 
are among a group of suburbanites disillusioned by their 
experience 
demographers predicted two decades ago that the baby boomers 
would choose either rural or urban lifestyles this rebellious 
generation sociologists theorized would settle anywhere but in 
the suburbs where they were raised 
the experts were wrong when working couples started families in 
the 1980s many of those who could afford to opted for the suburbs 
as a practical compromise between city and country living 
its a forumula that hasnt worked for everyone 
we were making enough money where we wanted to make an 
investment said deborah hassan who with her husband chose the 
the new york suburb of scarsdale where the median home price is 
535000 within a month after we moved out there our neighbors 
put up a fence it felt so isolated 
before the year was out the hassans and their 3yearold 
daughter were back in manhattan its not easy living in the city 
with a kid said mrs hassan who works part time at american 
express 
but i have this feeling about the city she said theres 
always someone in the park for my daughter to play with

dr glenn fishman and his wife joanne 
wallenstein wanted to stick it out in new york but the city wore 
them down 
their car was broken into eight times in 12 months they were 
mugged hassled by homeless beggars frightened on the subway at 
night they didnt want to witness the final urban terror murder 
more than a home the couple and their two young children 
finally sought a haven here in this gabled suburb about 40 minutes 
from new york by train 
we feel bad abandoning the city said fishman a researcher 
at albert einstein college of medicine but the problems seem to 
be growing at such a clip that a lot of people are finding its 
a good time to make a move 
added his wife joanne its sad for the city 
there is much for the city to mourn statistics usually reserved 
for harlem and flatbush are touching safe neighborhoods it is 
more difficult for people to ignore the violence step over the 
many beggars in their path 
new yorks welfare caseload numbers 830000 greater than the 
population of all but americas 10 largest cities someone is 
robbed every six minutes and an average of 366 cars are stolen 
daily among the subway users about 200000 jump the turnstiles 
and ride free each day 
violence is reaching people it never reached before said 
ellen kaidanow 30 an executive recruiter for the gap inc 
it used to be that there were certain parts of manhattan where 
you felt relatively safe said mrs kaidanow who is looking for 
a suburban home where she and her husband can start a family now 
the violence could be anywhere 
it is this sense of randomness that drives many couples back to 
the secure relatively quiet suburban lifestyle they knew as 
children and in many cases swore off as young adults 
the us census bureau doesnt break down new york metropolitan 
area migration but suburban real estate agents say that weary 
urban couples looking for a change lately have given their slumping 
market a modest boost 
many think the city isnt getting any better and a lot 
think its going to get worse said merritt mitchell president 
of the westchester multiple listings service a lot of young 
couples are looking to get out 
but along with the contents of their apartments many exnew 
yorkers end up bringing a sense of guilt with them to the suburbs 
where homes cost between 175000 and 450000 their consciences 
suggest it would be nobler to stay and fight for the citys future 
but you have to look at it from a standpoint of 
selfpreservation said marc tartell 36 advertising director at 
aampw brands inc things felt out of control 
as the tartells were packing up a moving van bound for 
westchester county in september someone stole two suitcases 
stuffed with their childrens baby clothes the theft was a final 
kick in the pants a reminder of why the longtime new yorkers were 
getting out 
i like city living i just dont like living in new york 
anymore said barbara tartell 31 a vice president at goldman 
sachs amp co the presence of undesirable people is becoming more 
obvious 
jobless angry addicted young people used to hang out near the 
tartells home on the upper west side their 3yearold son already 
was asking about prostitution crack cocaine and homelessness 
their new twostory fivebedroom colonial home is altogether 
different the kids have a backyard now trees to swing from a 
street made for kick the can and neighborhood pals ready to 
play such games 
local taxes are higher but the public schools in scarsdale 
arent overcrowded and underfunded like those in the city and the 
7500 kindergarten tuition the tartells faced in new york was 
anything but cheap 
new suburbanites say they wish their kids could grow up with the 
citys energy culture and diversity but those things mean 
nothing parents say if their children are frightened 
stressedout constantly on edge 
its a fight or flight situation said charlie clough an 
abstract artist who shares a greenwich village townhouse with his 
wife and their two young sons its palpable these are real 
bullets going by 
clough and his wife liz trovato started thinking about a move 
after a sniper opened fire at their 10yearold sons little league 
game 
there i am lying on the street with bullets whizzing overhead 
and my son freaking out said trovato a graphic designer it 
started us wondering whether there isnt a better way to live

zhou lihong seven months pregnant has no home 
of her own and shares a tiny room in a company dormitory with two 
other wome her husband who works for the same firm lives 
upstairs 
the company offered part of an old house that had no gas heat 
or plumbing but the young couple rejected it gambling that a 
better offer would come they have no guarantees 
while the zhous wait and hope suitable apartments are empty 
one is in the name of yan fields a chinese woman who followed 
her american husband to the united states four years ago and rents 
for the equivalent of just 1 a month 
it is too valuable to give up and her parents dont want to 
sublet for fear of attracting attention that might cause them to 
lose the apartment 
housing problems are most acute in the major cities officials 
said onefourth of bee 
government programs have had limited success in improving the 
situation 
in 1988 a few cities began raising rents and selling apartments 
to tenants to finance construction of more housing but the reforms 
have not been applied nationwide many local officials blocked 
them unwilling to pay the higher rents or lose the power they get 
from assigning scarce apartments 
housing officials insist the reforms have not been abandoned 
they say 30 counties and 19 cities including parts of beijing 
shanghai and canton are following the new policies on a limited 
scale 
nearly everyone in china has a roof over his head but he shares 
it with many more people than americans do 
the average living area for a chinese is 81 square feet 
according to government figures in the united states says the 
national association of homebuilders the average person has 755 
square feet 
a shanghai newspaper wrote about a couple who lived in a single 
room with an aging father 
after four years of marriage they remained childless and the 
husband was convinced lack of privacy was the reason they borrowed 
an apartment for five months and the wife became pregnant 
employers determine whether a young couple get their own 
apartment companies distribute housing by seniority and both 
husband and wife have a chance to be assigned an apartment by their 
respective employers 
a worker who has connections to the company housing official may 
get a larger apartment than he needs rents are so low there is no 
reason not to obtain as much space as possible 
rents for an average threeroom apartment in beijing range from 
the equivalent of 34 cents a month to 114 
officials say the average chinese spends less than 1 percent of 
his income on housing compared with 15 percent in the united 
states in the late 1950s chinese spent 6 percent to 10 percent of 
income on rent and officials want to return to that level by the 
end of this decade 
rent is so low that it takes years to recover a new 
buildings cost said zhang yuanduan director of the construction 
ministrys real estate department 
most new buildings soon begin deteriorating because rent often 
doesnt even pay the cost of maintenance and chinese are being 
born at the rate of more than 30 a minute too fast for new 
construction to keep pace 
in outlying parts of beijing and some companies where the 
housing reforms are being introduced rents have risen to the 
equivalent of 630 a month for a threeroom apartment 
the city built 314 new apartments and offered them for sale at 
prices much closer to the real cost an average of 18250 or 40 
times the average annual wage said liu qi deputy director of 
beijings housing reform office 
buyers snapped up the apartments borrowing money from relatives 
abroad or taking out bank loans 
liu said some companies in beijing were following suit and had 
sold nearly 4000 apartments to workers in the past two years 
generally at lower prices than the city proceeds are used to 
renovate old housing and build new apartments 
a local government in liaoning northeastern china earned 
enough from selling apartments and raising rents to build 120 new 
dormitories in less than three years in the past it had been able 
to build only one or two in the same period said zhang of the 
construction ministry

one day in 1979 bismillah kamkai was 
taken from his un development program office in kabul 
afghanistan under armed guard he was never heard from again 
belay melake an ethiopian statistician working for a un 
economic agency in addis ababa disappeared more than 11 years ago 
his colleagues believe his government tortured and killed him 
british journalist alec collett was abducted south of beirut in 
1985 while on assignment for the united nations relief and works 
agency which aids palestinian refugees in 1986 his kidnappers 
claimed to have killed him in retaliation for the us air raid on 
libya but no body was found 
un staff members say 10 of their colleagues have been killed 
including kamkai and melake collett is among 165 listed as missing 
or detained around the world 
ninetynine of those detained are arab relief workers held by 
israeli authorities in the occupied gaza strip or west bank 
according to the un employee union 
much attention has focused on western hostages in the middle 
east but little has been paid to the scores of detained un 
employees most are lowlevel employees of relief and development 
agencies who are citizens of the countries where they work 
these people are working for the world community and its 
surprising that theres not more compassion said lori berliner 
who for a decade has led a committee of international civil 
servants pressing for the release of those detained we worry 
about staff being forgotten 
israel accuses the arab un workers it holds of subversive 
activities said lowell flanders president of the un staff 
union but he added theyre not terrorists many were 
teachers guards or drivers in palestinian refugee camps 
about 20 governments or organizations have been accused of 
killing un employees or detaining them illegally flanders 
described ethiopia as one of the most serious offenders because of 
reports the government has tortured and killed prisoners 
he said he had independent reports that ghennet mebrahtu a 
widow with two children employed by the world health organization 
in addis ababa had been tortured since her arrest in august 
an ethiopian delegate told a un committee in november that 
mrs mebrahtu was arrested for activities not consistent with 
her un duties and would be tried soon he did not elaborate 
the un staff union insists un workers be afforded due 
process open hearings written charges and the right to legal 
counsel as provided for in the 1948 universal declaration of human 
rights 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has demanded 
repeatedly that the rights of un staff members be respected 
at a time when the organization is being called upon to 
undertake greater responsibilities in various parts of the world 
it is totally unacceptable that staff members are subjected to 
arbitrary or unexplained detention abduction or even have their 
lives placed at risk he said recently 
un committees and member states also have said the matter is 
urgent but the staff union wants action 
it has demanded a halt to all un activities except for 
humanitarian aid in any country that illegally detains un 
workers un officials and delegates say there is little chance of 
that 
mahmoud tarjouman a syrian arrested by his government in 1976 
before he could begin work for a un economic commission in 
lebanon said the united nations did not work for his release 
during nine years of imprisonment 
no un official ever contacted his wife and his salary was 
stopped after 1 years tarjouman said 
he said his support for multiparty democracy may have caused his 
arrest by president hafez assads government 
tarjouman was neither charged or tried and returned to the 
united nations after his release he now works as an editor in new 
york and un officials are considering his request for back pay 
un workers accept that their duties involve risk flanders 
said but at the same time they expect that if they do encounter 
difficulties the organization would support them 
reasons for detentions are many 
some un workers simply were caught up in unrest among the 10 
believed slain are fernando olivaresmori and carmelo soria 
espinosa seized in the 1970s in chile under the military regime of 
gen augusto pinochet 
some may have been victims of attempts to frustrate un 
activity in 19871989 the communist government of nicolai 
ceausescu refused to let a professor working for the united nations 
leave romania to report on human rights

the recording sessions were held in quonset 
huts on movie sets in night clubs after hours some of the 
biggest names in show business from oldtimers like al jolson to 
newcomers like frank sinatra performed 
but the records produced in a sixyear period during and after 
world war ii were heard only by american servicemen overseas now 
through the efforts of a retired navy officer who helped oversee 
their production they are on the us market 
nearly 920 12inch 78rpm records were produced by the army and 
navy from 1943 through 1949 as morale boosters they were called 
vdiscs the records 8 million copies altogether were 
accompanied by 125000 springoperated windup phonographs each 
with 100 steel needles 
they were played on ships in foxholes in trenches on 
airplanes in hospitals said edmond p digiannantonio digi as 
he is known ran the navys part of the program and keeps a 
wellpreserved copy of each record in a closet in his lakeside home 
here 
one serviceman wrote a letter saying he and his buddies were 
playing a vdisc as they headed to the dday invasion of normandy 
digiannantonio said 
the program was started after an army musical branch captain 
named bob vincent suggested to army officials in washington that 
they get popular band leaders like benny goodman and artie shaw to 
record for the troops 
the colonel vincents superior said look these guys dont 
want to hear any swing music or any jazz they want marching 
music digiannantonio recalled 
the colonels reluctance was overcome and we went on to 
include all types of music in all releases said digiannantonio 
from toscanini to spike jones all the way 
when the navy started looking for an officer to run the navy 
marine corps and coast guard part of the program digiannantonio 
was in a hospital in boston recovering from wounds he suffered 
when his ship the heavy cruiser vincennes was sunk off 
guadalcanal 
he had played violin piano and saxophone in high school in 
boston and at massachusetts institute of technology held a 
broadcast engineers license and had recorded shaw glenn miller 
goodman and other band leaders when they came to town 
so he got the job 
along with each box of 20 or 30 records went copies of a 
questionnaire asking the servicemen to say what kind of music they 
wanted white christmas was the most requested piece about 60 
percent wanted jazz or swing 20 percent or so classical and some 
country and western or others marches didnt make it 
some of the music came from movie film tracks and transcriptions 
of radio broadcasts but many were live recordings by artists 
donating their services 
during the early years they were the only records made the 
american federation of musicians at odds with the recording 
companies over royalties had banned all recording until the 
dispute was settled union president james caesar petrillo waived 
the ban to permit the recordings for the troops 
we recorded in night clubs hotel ballrooms movie studios 
quonset huts army bases navy bases wherever the artists were 
said digiannantonio now 73 
in those days when you went on a job you traveled by bus all 
night theyd do a session and wind up at one or two in the 
morning and then come to a studio and lug all the instruments and 
record for us 
the services had tried sending shellac records overseas earlier 
but found that most of them were broken before they arrived the 
vdiscs were recorded on more durable vinylite when vinylite 
became scarce because it was critically needed for insulation they 
switched to formvar a product developed in canada 
instructions on changing needles were often ignored so many of 
the records wore out overseas others were left behind when the war 
ended digiannantonio said that when the vdisc program ended 
officials ordered the remaining disks destroyed to prevent 
commercial use 
nevertheless the library of congress has a nearly complete set 
their quality ranges from very good to poor depending on the 
source said music librarian sam brylawski 
remember how heavy those old needles were said brylawski 
that would gouge a record like a vdisc if we got one from 
someone who really liked their recording a lot it could very well 
be beat up 
digiannantonio took good care of his 
they have been transferred to cassettes and compact discs with 
no adjustment of the original sound 
some people said lets enhance it and do this or this said 
digiannantonio but we said this is the way it was and we are 
going to do it that way 
digiannantonio said he has clearance from the defense department 
to market the recordings and is working with the american 
federation of musicians and broadcast music inc about payment of 
royalties 
he said much of the profit will go to the musicians union 
retirement fund or to the artists their families or their 
estates 
the first installment is a threecassette set with 37 numbers 
including glenn miller playing chattanooga choo choo jolson 
singing mammy and connie boswell crooning good night 
sweetheart 
 
editors note the first vdisk installment is available for 
2495 in cassette or 2995 in compact disc from vdisc po box

he flunked trigonometry as a boy 
yet john saxon now presents himself as the savior of math 
education delighted to brand the nations math experts as 
incompetents 
the math establishment the national council of teachers of 
mathematics and top state math officials is to blame for us 
teenagers scoring last in international comparisons of numerical 
skills saxon charges 
it is only in math education where people who are abject 
failures are called experts says saxon whose backtobasics 
math textbooks have been rejected by several states and whose blunt 
personality leaves even supporters cringing 
they can point to no success in math education in 30 years and 
yet they call themselves experts 
many in the establishment do indeed oppose many of saxons 
methods and they dont much like this former test pilot and 
junior college teacher turned math textbook publisher either 
but interviews with teachers around the country make it clear 
that this math maverick from oklahoma has tapped into widespread 
discontent over math education and is causing educators to rethink 
how the subject should be taught in us classrooms 
since 1982 saxon has sold some 20 million worth of his texts 
to 3000 schools around the country from arizona reservation 
schools to affluent suburban schools outside chicago minneapolis 
and metropolitan new york 
and hes done it without the customary sales force most school 
textbook publishers employ 
instead hes run acerbic ads in education trade journals 
offered free texts to schools willing to test them and encouraged 
his legions of teachersupporters to help spread his grassroots 
math movement 
saxons philosophy lies in his fourth grade through high school 
textbook series that he hopes will banish three decades of new 
math and replace it with a practice practice practice 
regimen of basic skills 
or as he put it in an interview i beat math into the little 
buggers 
saxons latest battleground is this affluent long island suburb 
where parents believing that the statemandated math curriculum 
was leaving their kids illequipped for college math overcame 
opposition from state curriculum authorities and won permission to 
become the first in new york state to test saxons approach 
this fall saxons brand of math began a closely watched 
threeyear trial in two beginning algebra classes at south 
huntingtons walt whitman high school 
but here and elsewhere its too early to tell if the saxon 
approach will do all it claims boost test scores keep students in 
math longer and make us students world leaders in math skills 
one of the few serious studies conducted with pittsburgh 
students in 1987 found that saxon yielded no test gains compared 
with other books and all students did poorly on problemsolving 
skills regardless of the texts used 
saxon is hard to categorize his texts blend rote math drill and 
constant repetition of lessons previously learned similar to the 
japanese kumon method that helped make that country a math 
leader 
the algebra i text for example has no chapters but 132 
lessons each focusing on a particular skill graphing 
inequalities for example students work on 30 or so practice 
problems but unlike traditional texts the vast majority of 
practice questions deal with previous lessons learned 
its as if students are reviewing for their math finals from the 
first day of the school year 
unlike many math experts saxon frowns on students using hand 
calculators especially in elementary grades 
and saxon teachers are expected to act as coaches rather than 
lecturers and employ other progressive classroom practices such as 
cooperative learning 
in sum saxon seems to offer a new way to teach the old 
math 
as might be expected leading math educators havent taken 
kindly to being told by this prickly outsider that theyve been 
doing it all wrong for decades 
curriculum officials and some classroom teachers in new york 
minnesota texas california idaho and even his home state of 
oklahoma insist saxon is trying to march mathematics education 
backwards 
saxon may teach students how to compute a square root they say 
but his texts neglect problemsolving skills ignore key areas like 
probabilities and statistics and generally fail to connect 
classroom math to a changing technological world 
it appears saxon wants students to perform quick and accurate 
calculations he has a behaviorist point of view learning through 
constant repeating the rest of us believe that you build knowledge 
through prior understanding said elizabeth stage chairwoman of 
californias curriculum commission 
theres no application to anything in real life students wind 
up more like trained monkeys said nancy guldberg a math teacher 
at eden prairie high school in suburban minneapolis which has used 
the saxon texts for six years but now is almost certain to drop 
them because students disliked the texts and test scores 
languished 
but mel twitchell who has used saxon to teach his four math 
sections at utahs provo high school for the last three years is 
among many others who swear the texts are making students enjoy 
math so much that they stick with it through calculus 
twitchell said its too soon to point to big test gains but at 
provo only two sections of students now take dumbeddown 
consumer math compared with six sections before saxon he 
said and calculus enrollment is up from 38 students before saxon 
to 107 studets 
nine weeks into the saxon experiment at south huntington 
parents teachers and students seem to like what they see 
walk into john cardons algebra i class and youll see a teacher 
who lectures for just 10 minutes then lets his 26 students work 
alone or help each other with long lists of review questions 
cardons students are uniformly positive even though the 
homework load is heavy 
its easier said kerri ball a 14yearold freshman last 
year my grades were in the 70s now im scoring in the 80s 
saxons firstever foothold in new york is in itself an 
extraordinary accomplishment in a state where only two or three 
high school textbooks conform to the unusually rigid high school 
math curriculum 
the new york breakthrough is the more remarkable because it 
happened in a school district where 95 percent of the students 
already were passing their state exams 
but cardon said the staterequired curriculum had students 
glossing over many facets of math while neglecting the skills 
needed to really understand them 
they made the courses so easy in order to attract more kids 
but they wound up learning a little bit about a lot of things but 
knowing nothing he said 
buoyed by such grassroots support saxon shows no signs of 
mellowing as the nations leading math gadfly 
my critics will tell you im not nice and i will say they are 
incompetent he said 
one critic cathy seeley the state director of mathematics in 
texas said saxon refuses to concede there could be more than one 
way to teach math texas rejected saxons texts for state adoption 
in 1983 1989 and again last month 
the establishment is anyone who disagrees with saxon ms 
seeley said in truth there have been many unpleasant people who 
have had good things to offer in education in this case its 
someone whos saying their way is the only way to do something 
its the personal and professional demeaning that i find 
amazing said stage the california official 
what difference does it make if im a horses ass saxon 
responds what difference does it make if they like me i have 
threatened their raison detre the math experts are a lot more 
human than i hoped theyd be 
 
editors note lee mitgang has covered education for the ap 
since 1981

workers in du pont cos fibers 
division who tied their pay raises to profits under a special 
incentive plan had banked on a tidy payout around the holidays 
but the bank went bust and so did the experimental program 
because the division failed to reach its 725 million annual 
profit goal the departments 20000 employees who had as much as 
4 percent of their pay at risk wont see any extra payouts or 
bonuses at the end of this year 
du pont also decided to scrap the innovative threeyear plan in 
its second year after several employees cried foul beginning in 
january employee wages and raises will be paid in the traditional 
way 
james f kearns who heads the fibers division said employees 
werent ready for a payatrisk program 
it was fine when they were getting more back than they put in 
which was the case last year but when they found out they were not 
going to get back as much as they invested it began to come out 
no this is not fair kearns said 
the pay incentive plan was mandatory for nonunion employees at 
the departments 10 nationwide plants four of the five plants that 
have unions also agreed to participate 
heres how the plan worked 
employees this year gambled as much as 4 percent of their 
annual pay that the division would reach its 725 million goal 
last year it was as much as 2 percent on a 670 million goal 
an employee with an annual salary of 30000 this year could 
have received a onetime payout of as much as 1200 if the goal 
was met his regular salary however wasnt touched if the goal 
wasnt met 
last year that same employee with the same salary earned an 
extra 600 since the goal was met plus a small bonus because the 
target was exceeded 
the du pont program was designed to give employees a stake in 
the departments profits to help improve the fibers business the 
theory was that such a plan would make employees feel they owned 
part of the company encouraging them to become more efficient and 
to find costsaving ways to do their jobs 
but the fibers business which represents nearly a quarter of du 
ponts total profits has been hurt by a rise in foreign 
competition and raw materials costs 
through the third quarter of this year du ponts fibers 
division earned 400 million about 100 million off from the same 
time last year the company predicts that fourth quarter net income 
will be lower than the 191 million earned in the 1989 quarter and 
therefore well below the 725 million goal 
under the plan employees also could have received half of what 
was at risk if the department achieved 80 percent of this years 
profit goal or 580 million 
but kearns the fibers division head said it would take a 
heroic effort to reach that goal by years end 
when the pay plan was announced in the fall of 1988 chemical 
industry analysts said it was trendsetting but in a slumping 
economy its not a popular plan 
i thought it was a pretty bold move but workers want 
stability in their job and compensation and from that standpoint 
it may have been too bold a move said james h wilbur an 
industry analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co

dilemma your grandparents cant keep up their big house and 
they dont want to move to a retirement home 
solution a portable factorybuilt fourroom cottage that fits 
in the back yard 
developer j robert gillette says the cottages are americas 
answer to australias granny flats 
the cottages which can be hooked to utilities in the main home 
sell for about 50000 or rent for 600 to 700 a month the 
relatives are nearby but not crowding the family 
gillette wants the first cottages to be built on the grounds of 
senior citizens complexes cottage occupants will have more 
privacy and pay less than residents of the complex itself but 
still have easy access to social events meals and services such as 
laundry 
trial programs in pennsylvania new jersey texas and california 
show that what the american association of retired persons calls 
the elder cottage housing opportunity can work 
its very cozy pauline wessner 85 said from the echo 
cottage shes lived in for two years near belvedere nj 
wessners grandson thought of her when the countys office on 
aging announced an echo trial program he had bought the house 
where she lived for nearly 40 years and she had moved to an 
apartment she said it was too much work for me to mow the grass 
and everything else 
i live right next door to my grandson now about 45 feet from 
his house she said 
the county bought the cottage and leases it to her for an amount 
based on her social security income she has a bedroom bathroom 
parlor and fully equipped kitchen 
probably not more than 100 of the little houses have been set up 
nationally said leah dobkin of the aarp in washington but the 
aarp has published outlines for developers and local governments of 
the zoning parking and other issues the cottages raise 
its better than backing a trailer in dobkin said these are 
specially designed for the elderly and they meet all housing 
codes she said 
gillettes cottage plans show ramps for people who dont want to 
climb stairs wide doors bathtub rails and kitchen sinks minus 
the usual cabinets underneath that keep wheelchair users at arms 
length 
gillette said hell erect four cottages at the american house 
dearborn heights mich complex by spring 
that the cottages are detached is a key for senior citizens like 
wessner who want to live near their families but not in the same 
house 
that wouldnt go wessner said they have two teenagers 
who like loud music grandmas a little too old for that now 
but the cottage avoids the loneliness of longdistance living 
my grandson stops in every morning with the newspaper for me 
they invite me over which i appreciate i go over there on sunday 
for coffee and a bun 
and on holidays she said we eat together unless im invited 
somewhere else

the buyer of us entertainment conglomerate mca 
inc has come a long way since its founder konosuke matsushita 
made japanese home life a bit easier by popularizing the rice 
cooker 
now matsushita electric industrial co ltd has set its sights 
on dominating the promised next generation of electronic 
entertainment highdefinition television with the help of mcas 
rich vault of movies and television shows and studios with which to 
make more 
matsushita pronounced matsoosshtuh needed mca to keep up 
with electronics and entertainment rival sony corp in their 
deadheat battle over the video and hdtv fields analysts say 
the mca buyout is valued at 66 billion compared with the 5 
billion sony paid for columbia pictures entertainment inc last 
year 
unlike sony matsushita is not a household name outside japan 
although its popular brand names panasonic technics and quasar are 
widely known 
matsushita is japans largest home electronics manufacturer and 
thirdlargest corporation with 163 consolidated subsidiaries 
fortune magazine ranked matsushita in 1989 as the 16th biggest 
corporation in the world 
the osakabased company reported holdings of more than 10 
billion in cash alone last year and it earned 148 billion on 
sales of 378 billion 
the influence of legendary founder konosuke matsushita who died 
last year at age 94 is felt in virtually every japanese home where 
an automatic rice cooker takes the drudgery out of preparing the 
nations staple food 
matsushita a man who never went to high school yet became 
japans most famous entrepreneur popularized the electric 
appliance in the 1950s in keeping with his corporate philosophy 
to manufacture items of good quality for daily use in abundant 
supply thereby enriching and improving life for everyone 
that creed in 1932 came less than 15 years after 23yearold 
matsushita left his employer an electric power company to 
capitalize on his own twoway electric socket today the 
matsushita empire has spawned nearly 500 related firms in 37 
countries 
during the 37 years it has operated in the united states 
matsushita has built 12 factories and established seven sales 
companies and a research facility that employ about 10000 people 
matsushitas huge size including its 25000 affiliated 
retailers in japan has proved a disadvantage in switching from 
lowgrowth consumer products which generate 60 percent of its 
sales to more profitable fields 
its inability to produce a new hit product to replace the 
blockbuster video cassette recorder reflects the companys greater 
strength in manufacturing than invention 
seeking to overcome its limitations six years ago matsushita 
launched a longterm plan to focus on seven areas of high 
technology including computers semiconductors and communications 
this year the company invested about 32 billion in liquid 
crystal computer monitor technology computers and semiconductors 
it also is trying to develop profitable movie and television 
cameras for professional use said boris petersik an electronics 
analyst at barclays de zoete wedd securities japan 
so far matsushita has had a hard time cracking sonys dominance 
in the professional video market 
sony also has a head start in the market for entertainment 
software or the movies tv shows and music played in tape 
recorders laserdisc players and vcrs sony achieved this lead 
through its purchase of columbia pictures last year and its 1987 
purchase of cbs records for 2 billion 
the entertainment software market is growing faster than the 
market for the machines that play it most analysts believe that 
control of entertainment software is the key to staying ahead in 
the electronics field 
the mca purchase gives matsushita access to a repository of 
movies and television programs similar to sonys columbia cache to 
be used with the new hdtv format which offers dazzlingly detailed 
images digital sound and wider cinemastyle screen proportions 
with that purchase theres a very good chance theyd get a 
fair share of the hdtv market theyll be glad to have something to 
run on those gadgets petersik says

the story of mca inc reads like a hollywood fairy tale about a 
fledgling company that grew from a tiny jazz promoter into a 
conglomerate of movie studios theme parks a bigname record label 
and a publishing house 
the entertainment colossus now represents a chunk of american 
pop culture churning out movie icons ranging from et to 
jaws and making household names out of musicians like guns n 
roses and bobby brown 
but matsushita electric industrial co ltd of japan which 
agreed to purchase mca on monday also bought a company of creative 
visionaries whose screen business has sometimes faltered whose 
movies have been swept up in controversy and whose studios recently 
were ravaged by fire 
mca lived through economic thick and thin to earn a reputation 
as a survivor today mca owns universal studios one of americas 
biggest record labels a publishing house theme parks and big 
piece of los angeles real estate it is known for extremely stable 
management notable in a business famous for capricious and 
unpredictable excecutive changes 
the companys transformation was stagemanaged over a 65year 
history by a chicago eye doctor the late jules stein and lew 
wasserman a onetime movie usher from cleveland wasserman who to 
this day is mcas chairman and president sidney j sheinberg have 
run the company for decades 
over the years universal has produced academy award winners such 
as the sting the deer hunter and out of africa 
but the last temptation of christ stirred up an 
emotioncharged debate inciting religious groups to protest what 
they called its shameful interpretation of biblical history 
more recently the company faced a devastating fire and an 
uncertain market for its feature films 
early this month an arsonist torched the historic universal 
studios backlot gutting sets for dick tracy back to the 
future and an unfinished sylvestor stallone movie 
while universal television has long been a steady moneymaker 
the film division has endured ups and downs its dry spells 
punctuated by periodic blockbusters like et jaws back 
to the future the sting animal house on golden 
pond and twins 
mcas storied history has its roots in the jazz business stein 
a jazz player himself decided musicians needed an agency to strike 
them better deals with hotels ballrooms and speakeasies 
in 1923 he founded the music corporation of america and by the 
1930s mca represented most of the name bands in the swing era 
then stein set his sights on a bigger talent game hollywood 
steins chief aid wasserman proved a dynamo as head of mcas 
hollywood office and soon the agency represented a long list of 
stars including joan crawford errol flynn and alfred hitchcock 
as the major studios shunned television as an upstart 
competitor mca rushed in with its revue productions grinding out 
series like m squad and wagon train when ronald reagans 
film career faded wasserman found him work as host of general 
electric theater 
until 1959 mca was known principally as the octopus because of 
its farreaching influence as a talent agency then the company 
took a giant step buying the venerable faltering universal 
studio 
under wassermans guidance mcauniversal flourished in the 
1970s and 1980s the company became the biggest supplier of 
television entertainment in addition universal studios tours grew 
to a major tourist attraction

the oak ridge boys may boast that my 
baby is american made but their catalogue and that of most other 
country music artists belong to foreign investors 
the planned buyout of mca inc by japans matsushita electric 
industrial co in a 66 billion deal would leave nashvilles 
country music industry with only one major label under an american 
banner warner bros 
the acquisition covers mca records and mca music a song 
publishing company and some of the biggest names in country music 
reba mcentire george strait vince gill patty loveless the 
desert rose band lionel cartwright the nitty gritty dirt band 
conway twitty the bellamy brothers and steve wariner all record 
for mca 
officials at mca records nashville wouldnt comment on the sale 
or any changes it might bring to their operation spokeswoman janet 
rickman said 
but one industry observer doubts japanese ownership will change 
a note 
historically the nashville divisions have retained their 
creative autonomy after changes in ownership said bill ivey 
director of the country music foundation in nashville 
the foundation which operates the country music hall of fame 
museum is dedicated to preserving the history of country music 
typically the bigger corporations place more emphasis on the 
bottom line and paperwork but leave nashville divisions alone as 
far as artistic vision 
foreign investors usually bring a healthy infusion of cashflow 
for nashville companies they acquire ivey said 
there are some benefits to country music in locally owned 
operations but once a company is owned outside of nashville it 
matters little whether that company is based in new york or 
tokyo 
ed benson of the country music association observed that mcas 
nashville label has been profitable and probably wont see its 
routine change much 
all of the nashville major labels have been profitable and 
successful and one more foreign acquisition probably wont even 
change the players said benson who is the trade groups 
associate executive director 
ivey said the character of the industry is changing its 
getting harder for independent labels to thrive 
opryland records an independent nashville label owned by 
opryland usa inc recently gave up ivey noted 
if you are trying to operate a traditional record company 
signing major acts to multialbum contracts and getting radio play 
and selling records at retail it gets real tough to compete 
said ivey 
theres a niche for small labels to market mail order 
perhaps but there is no room at the top of the charts 
japanese interests control cbs records soon to be renamed sony 
bmg capitolemi and mercurypolydor are owned by germans the 
english and the dutch respectively

concern over a us backlash of antijapanese 
sentiment surfaced tuesday in local media comment on matsushita 
electric industrial cos proposed blockbuster buyout of 
entertainment giant mca inc 
some newspapers and television broadcasters also forecast 
intensifying competition over popular television shows movies and 
other broadcast software 
the nationallycirculated asahi shimbun reported that matsushita 
had been eager to finalize the deal before dec 7 the 49th 
anniversary of the japanese bombing of pearl harbor to avoid 
exacerbating us public opinion 
matsushitas purchase of mca in a 66 billion deal is the 
largest japanese buyout of an american concern after sonys 5 
billion purchase of columbia pictures entertainment last year 
the japan broadcasting corp nhk japans authoritative 
quasipublic television network gave the deal prominent early 
morning air play the broadcast featured onthestreet interviews 
with new york pedestrians whose opinions ranged from approval of 
the purchase to anxiety about the faltering power of american 
companies 
the asahi shimbun played up foreign reaction in a small story 
about the monday news conference in osaka where the purchase was 
announced 
the story focused on a reporters question about possible 
censorship by mcas new owners of films critical of japan similar 
questions were raised last year in response to the columbia 
pictures purchase 
i am confident that such works will not be produced because 
this purchase itself aims to deepen the cooperation between the 
us and japan matsushita president akio tanii was quoted as 
replying 
an analysis article in the newspaper said matsushita paid a high 
price probably to avoid a backlash in american public opinion 
but another major daily the mainichi shimbun carried a story 
from washington dc saying american sentiment was calm in 
contrast to reaction to sonycolumbia transaction 
an analysis in the yomiuri shimbun the nations topselling 
daily said the purchase underlined the inseparable relationship in 
the audiovisual business between the machinery of broadcasting 
from cameras to television sets and what the machines broadcast 
media reports predicted the purchase will fuel competition in 
the audiovisual market which is rapidly expanding due to the 
popularity of rental videos and advent of satellite services 
japanese businesses have their eyes on hollywood at the same 
time that the us film industry is seeking financing yomiuri 
reported 
japanese trading and computer firms meanwhile have begun 
making their own forays into filmmaking yomiuri said 
the quality of films that mca produces in the future will 
ultimately be key to determining public reception of the deal 
according to the yomiuri article matsushita has failed if people 
begin to say mca films have changed because of the purchase an 
unidentified film distributor was reported as saying 
the asahi shimbun quoted unidentified sources in business 
circles as predicting the deal will be the final major overseas 
corporate takeover for japanese companies given the downward trend 
in the nations economy

the former chairman of ashland oil inc is 
negotiating to repay expenses the company incurred from his scheme 
to sell confidential documents to the national iranian oil co 
we do anticipate there will be an agreement john c elam a 
lawyer for ashland said monday 
the former chairman orin e atkins faces sentencing friday in 
manhattan federal court for his role in the scheme a settlement on 
restitution is expected to be announced at the sentencing 
a call to atkins attorney james moss was not returned 
ashland based in ashland ky first made its request for 
restitution from atkins in an oct 9 letter to us district judge 
charles s haight who presides over atkins case 
mr atkins a lawyer held the very highest position at 
ashland oil inc prior to his resignation elam wrote we 
submit that an individual who has held such a unique position also 
has the highest degree of responsibility and therefore has the 
duty to make restitution 
the company did not give a specific amount asking haight to set 
a just and proper figure but did outline the expenditures it 
accumulated and the payments made to atkins during the scheme 
according to the letter written by elam ashland spent 147 
million on an internal investigation of atkins acts and related 
attorneys fees 
additionally elam said that since october 1981 ashland has 
paid atkins more than 25 million in consulting fees and other 
discretionary corporate benefits and more than half a million 
dollars in pension benefits 
atkins 66 of north palm beach fla pleaded guilty in 
september 1989 to conspiracy and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate 
with the government 
he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 500000 
fine when sentenced by us district judge charles s haight 
atkins admitted that after he resigned as chairman in 1981 but 
remained as a paid ashland consultant he obtained confidential 
documents involving the companys decision not to pay national 
iranian for 283 million in crude oil purchased in 1979 
atkins and others involved in the scheme offered to sell the 
documents to the iranian company for use in a possible lawsuit 
against ashland over its nonpayment 
while the iranians never bought the documents they later sued 
ashland and last year obtained a 325 million settlement which 
with interest was worth more than 500 million 
as part of his cooperation with prosecutors atkins testified 
earlier this year at the trial of an attorney charles barnett who 
was accused of participating in the scheme to sell the ashland 
documents to the iranian company 
barnett of palm beach fla was acquitted of all charges 
a third defendant oil broker roy furmark pleaded guilty to a 
role in the conspiracy furmark who was involved in the 
irancontra deal is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court 
next week

an agreement to supply engines for mexicos 
largest heavy truck builder adds stability to navistar 
international corps engine manufacturing schedule but is no 
guarantee against layoffs a spokesman said 
workforce adjustments depend on a number of variables including 
domestic demand for diesel engines said navistar spokesman william 
h greenhill 
this is an engine that primarily goes in our medium trucks 
he said referring to the deal with dina camiones that was 
announced monday 
the domestic market has been sort of soft for both medium and 
heavy trucks greenhill said 
navistar said it agreed to supply dina with as many as 5000 
diesel engines annually and more than tripled its stake in dina to 
17 percent 
chicagobased navistar north americas largest manufacturer of 
medium and heavy trucks did not disclose financial terms of the 
agreement 
navistar previously owned 5 percent of dina a private 
corporation created in 1989 as the mexican government 
denationalized key segments of the automotive industry 
under the agreement navistars dt 466 family of midrange 
diesel engines will become the standard power source for dina 
medium trucks beginning next spring 
the engine supply agreement is expected to add 3000 to 5000 
engines annually to the 50000 engines produced annually in melrose 
park a chicago suburb 
this obviously solidifies the situation out there greenhill 
said 
navistar has blamed soft demand for its poor financial 
performance in the past year the company lost 18 million in its 
fiscal first quarter and had earnings declines of more than 75 
percent in the second and third quarters 
navistar will announce fiscal fourthquarter results in early 
december 
michael bowyer a duff amp phelps inc securities analyst who 
follows navistar called the companys increased investment in 
mexico a good idea 
mexican demand for medium and heavy trucks combined has risen 
from 6500 vehicles in 1988 to a projected 15000 in 1990 and is 
expected to surpass 20000 next year according to navistar 
mexico is presently industrializing its economy and with an 
industrialized society there will be a good demand for trucks 
bowyer said 
but he cautioned that industrialization is typically a slow 
process thats subject to many roadblocks 
for 1990 through october dinas share of the combined medium 
and heavy truck market in mexico was nearly 50 percent navistar 
said

mazda spokesman fred aikins said monday we recognize the value 
of air bags as a supplement to the threepoint seat belt 
nissan said the company will offer driverside air bags in most 
of its us passenger cars by 1992 
mazda will make driver and passengerside air bags standard on 
some us models beginning in the 1992 model year the automaker 
said currently the company provides a drivers side air bag on 
us models of the rx7 and the sporty mx5 miata

the us trade deficit swelled to 2975 
billion in the julyseptember quarter the highest imbalance in a 
year as the persian gulf crisis drove up the cost of foreign oil 
against a drop in demand for american farm products the government 
said today 
the commerce department said that the trade gap in the third 
quarter was a sharp 289 percent higher than the 2310 billion 
imbalance in the apriljune period the second quarter deficit had 
been the lowest in more than six years 
the turnaround occurred because imports shot up 5 percent to an 
alltime high of 12591 billion while us exports edged down 06 
percent to 9616 billion reflecting the drop in demand for 
american farm products the deficit is the difference between 
imports and exports 
the julyseptember imbalance was the largest quarterly deficit 
since a 2980 billion deficit in the same period last year since 
that time the deficit had been on a steadily declining path as a 
boom in us export sales helped to narrow americas huge trade 
deficit and give the economy one of its few bright spots 
however since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait economists had 
been forecasting that a higher foreign oil bill would translate 
into a rising trade deficit adding one more negative factor to an 
economy already flirting with a recession 
the figures in todays report on merchandise trade calculated on 
a balance of payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports 
the monthly report showed the third quarter deficit rose to 
2827 billion the small disparity between the two reports 
reflects the fact that the balance of payments report excludes 
military sales by the us government and makes other minor 
adjustments to the monthly figures 
the higher julyseptember deficit reflected a 61 billion 
increase in imports petroleum imports were up 35 billion to 
157 billion reflecting a rise in both price and volume 
nonpetroleum imports were up as well climbing 25 billion to 
1102 billion as auto imports from mexico and canada rose 
the small drop in exports left them close to their alltime high 
of 9676 billion set in the apriljune period the biggest 
weakness came in a 6 percent drop in farm exports which declined 
to 97 billion reflecting lower sales particularly in eastern 
europe of american corn wheat and soybeans 
the average price of wheat decreased 12 percent while corn 
prices fell by 1 percent the average price of cotton and soybeans 
was each up 1 percent 
a drop in us exports of aircraft also contributed to the 
weakness in exports 
the largest increase in the deficit was with members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries a rise of 25 
billion to 69 billion 
the trade balance with western europe which had been in surplus 
in the second quarter dropped back into a deficit of 06 billion 
as usual the largest deficit was with japan a 97 billion 
deficit which was still 07 billion below the second quarter 
imbalance and the lowest deficit with japan since the first quarter 
of 1985

asias socalled little dragons taiwan hong 
kong south korea and singapore enjoyed explosive growth in the 
80s thanks largely to soaring exports to a thriving american 
market 
but the persian gulf crisis and a looming us recession have 
the region worried because both factors are likely to shave 
economic growth next year analysts say 
still unlike the deep us recession of the early 1980s 
analysts predict those nations should fare better this time around 
because they managed to diversify their export markets 
the us recession surely will be a big blow to taiwans 
economy but we are not as vulnerable this time said wei 
chiling an international trade professor at national taiwan 
university 
so far slackening demand from the united states was cited as a 
major factor behind hong kongs decision to halve its projected 
economic growth rate for this year to 25 percent the united 
states is the british colonys second largest trading partner after 
neighboring china 
softening us demand also is cited for slower growth in 
singapore taiwan and south korea however all three countries 
have predicted growth rates of 6 percent to 8 percent for this year 
and 1991 
although the united states remains among the largest export 
markets for much of the region many asian countries have managed 
to reduce their dependence on us consumer demand for their 
textiles electronics and other goods 
for example 33 percent of taiwans exports were to the united 
states last year compared to nearly 50 percent in 1985 in hong 
kong trade with other countries in the region grew eightfold 
between 1979 and 1989 
japan the economic powerhouse of asia also has been picking up 
the slack in demand created by the sluggish us economy 
the japanese economy is now playing a socalled absorber 
role for the asian neighboring nations although they are 
still dependent on the us market to a great extent said 
nobuyuki ueda senior economist at the longterm credit bank of 
japan 
bangkok bank researcher nimit notapantawart agreed saying the 
diversification strategy may bring only limited benefits he notes 
that many southeast asian countries manufacture similar products 
and will face fierce competition 
also diversifying markets analysts say cannot erase more 
fundamental problems faced by some asian economies among them a 
crisis of confidence in hong kong before it reverts to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 and the labor unrest and spiralling wages in 
south korea 
elsewhere in asia japans economy is expected to lose some 
steam with most analysts predicting growth of between 4 percent 
and 5 percent next year after four years of roughly 5 percent 
annual growth 
a severe labor shortage the gulf crisis and tighter money 
policies designed to fight inflation are more to blame for japans 
slowdown than lagging exports to the united states experts say 
japans growth is more heavily dependent on domestic demand 
so even if export demand goes down there will not be much 
impact said seiji shinpo head of the overseas research 
department at the governments economic planning agency 
china also might ride out a us recession without major 
disruption analysts say 
although the united states is chinas third largest trading 
partner after japan and hong kong the generally low price of 
chinese manufactured exports could keep the country insulated from 
a recession across the pacific said thomas chan a college 
lecturer specializing in the chinese economy 
chinas low wages also are drawing investment from southeast 
asia 
the asian nation likely to feel the worst economic blow in the 
coming year is the philippines where the government recently cut 
1990 economic growth projections by nearly half to 35 percent 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait sent thousands of philippine 
workers home jobless the loss of their foreign exchange 
remittances also depressed the value of the philippine peso and 
higher oil prices triggered a nationwide strike

the supreme court today gave federal energy 
regulators more power to set electricity rates for 49 million homes 
nationwide 
by an 80 vote the justices overturned a ruling that barred the 
federal energy regulatory commission from slashing rate hikes to 
customers in 15 ohio communities 
the court agreeing to do what ferc requested sent the case 
back to a lower court for further study to determine whether the 
ferc orders are just and reasonable 
at issue in todays ruling is the authority shared by ferc and 
the security and exchange commission over public utilities and 
their subsidiaries 
the court said a provision of the federal power act governing 
overlapping authority between ferc and other agencies does not bar 
the energy regulators from seeking to control rates in the ohio 
case 
ferc said it is trying to prevent public utilities from passing 
on to consumers allegedly inflated costs of buying coal and 
possibly other goods and services from the companies subsidiaries 
the bush administration supported an appeal by the ohio 
communities 
the dispute stems from rate hikes first proposed by ohio power 
co in 1982 the utility asked ferc to approve higher rates to 
cover the companys cost of buying coal from its subsidiary the 
southern ohio coal co 
the commission concluded that ohio power from 198286 paid its 
subsidiary between 25 percent and 33 percent more for coal than the 
prevailing market prices 
ferc ordered the utility to refund 134 million to its 
wholesale customers for that period 
but a us circuit court of appeals here which has authority 
over such actions by federal regulators overturned the 
commissions decision last year 
the appeals court interpreted the 1935 federal power act to give 
the sec primary authority to regulate sales contracts between 
holding companies and their subsidiaries 
justice antonin scalia writing for the supreme court today 
said the appeals court was mistaken 
scalia said the case now must go back to the appeals court for 
further study of the ferc orders 
in urging high court review of the case the justice department 
said effective regulation of utilities serving 49 million 
households nationwide could be at stake 
justice david h souter did not take part in the case 
the ohio communities that challenged the appeals court ruling 
most tiny villages are arcadia bloomdale carey cygnet 
deshler greenwich ohio city plymouth republic shiloh 
sycamore wharton bryan st clairsville and wapakoneta 
the case is arcadia vs ohio power co 891283

president suharto has warned the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries of a possible oil 
glut if the persian gulf crisis ends mines and energy minster 
ginanjar kartasasmita said tuesday 
suharto called on opec to reapply the quota system to control 
production when the situation has returned to normal in the gulf 
kartasasmita told reporters after a meeting with the president 
we hope and everyone hopes that the gulf crisis will be over 
as soon as possible and we must be ready to cope with the 
difficulty in putting things in order again as it is not easy to 
cut output after enjoying large production kartasasmita said 
he said currently without iraq and kuwait opec produces 226 
million barrels of oil per day exceeding its self imposed quota of 
225 million barrels per day set last july 
iraq and kuwait produced about 4 million barrels per day before 
the gulf crisis that began with the iraqi invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 the global community immediately boycotted oil from iraq 
and kuwait and some opec nations began producing more than their 
quotas of crude oil to make up for the shortfall 
analysts have said producing nations will be reluctant to cut 
back on the oil they pump once iraqi and kuwaiti crude is put back 
in the marketplace particularly since prices are likely to be 
depressed at that point 
kartasasmita predicted the production may rise further to reach 
23 million barrels per day as demand for opec oil will rise from 
225 million barrels in the third quarter to an estimated 23 
million or 235 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 
this year 
indonesia currently produces about 13 million barrels of crude 
oil per day and exports about 780000 barrels 
kartasasmita said the country will raise its output to 14 
million barrels per day next month

the european community commission asked 
procter amp gamble co of the united states and italys finaf spa on 
tuesday to suspend a plan to cooperate on making diapers and other 
personal hygienic products 
the companies said in september they plan to create joint 
ventures in italy spain and portugal for their paper products 
businesses notably diapers and sanitary napkins also procter 
said it would buy all of finafs activities in britain 
the commission asked the companies to hold off until it is 
satisfied there is no breach of ec fair competition rules 
a commission official said the accord could create or strengthen 
dominant positions by the two companies and received a complaint 
about the planned venture from peau douce sa a french diaper 
maker 
peau douce argued procters deal with finaf would violate 
competition rules and asked for interim measures to stop the 
agreement from taking effect 
the ec treaty bans undertakings that prevent restrict or 
distort fair copetition in the 12nation trade bloc 
procter amp gamble which is based in cincinnati ohio and finaf 
have been in touch with the commission since before they announced 
plans for their linkup 
david veitch a spokesman at procter amp gambles european 
headquarters here said it has always been our intention not to 
implement this agreement until the competent authorities have been 
heard 
the ec commission official said discussions with the two 
companies were continuing and if these go satisfactorily we can 
resolve the problem without going further to law 
veitch said under the deal with finaf the two companies were 
to merge their paper product business in italy spain and 
portugal 
procter amp gamble the maker of pampers is a leading diaper 
producer but veitch said the company was a relatively small 
player in europe in sanitary napkins and other personal hygiene 
paper goods 
the purpose of the agreement with finaf was to accelerate 
our entry into those products in europe he said

marets adjusted to indications there may be no large us grain 
sales to the soviet union in the coming year

will have filled their food needs from other sources by then

hyundai motor co marked a milestone 
tuesday when its auto exports to the united states surpassed the 1 
million mark the biggest south korean automaker said 
the company said it has now exported 1000021 cars to the 
united states since it entered the market in february 1986 
the exports to the us account for twothirds of hyundis 
global auto exports of 15 million cars during the past four years 
and 10 months 
hyundai entered the american market in 1986 with subcompact pony 
sedans 
hyundais annual auto exports worldwide peaked at 408000 in 
1988 but declined to 209000 last year with a loss of price 
competitiveness and due to sluggish demands in some foreign 
markets 
hyundai expects its global auto exports to rise to 230000 cars 
this year because of a pickup in sales in europe including 
eastbloc countries which are emrging as new markets for korea

for gail edwards getting down to business means 
roving the central maine countryside with her four young children 
in search of wild herbs and flowers to blend into natural teas and 
tonics 
annual sales of her homemade potions amounted to a mere 200 
last year but this spring edwards expects to sell 20000 worth of 
products thanks to a 5000 loan secured with the help of womens 
world banking 
the nonprofit group has helped at least 250000 women worldwide 
get started in business over the past decade through counseling or 
by securing loans 
it brought my business from essentially a dream into a 
thriving business said the 41yearold edwards a single mother 
who had little hope of getting a bank loan before womens world 
bankings maine affiliate took up her cause 
although it pales in size to other global lending institutions 
the new yorkbased group has had a profound economic and 
political impact in clearing the way for many businesswomen 
in thailand the group helped 100 women start a dairy 
cooperative by helping them get loans totaling 1 million and the 
groups affiliate in india has grown into an active savings and 
loan program for about 60000 women many of them from the lowly 
regarded untouchable caste 
thanks to negotiations by the group the governments of japan 
and kenya have stricken regulations that required women to have 
their loans guaranteed by their husbands or fathers 
in most countries of latin america and asia the cultural 
barrier has been broken said group president nancy barry 
ironically the united states is the final frontier for the 
global organization she said 
focusing on developing countries since its inception 10 years 
ago the groups five us affiliates thus far only have the power 
to help women draw up business plans write loan applications and 
suggest alternate funding routes but before the end of the year 
at least one branch the akron ohio affiliate expects to start 
guaranteeing bank loans like its overseas counterparts 
its a significant step despite notions of the united states as 
progressive in womens rights old ways sometimes die hard in the 
nations predominantly male lending industry 
credit isnt without bias which is different than 
discrimination said barbara lange executive director of womens 
entrepreneurial growth organization wego the akron branch a 
part of the lending process has to do with the comfort level of the 
banking officer 
for example when physical therapist claudia miller set out last 
year to get a loan to start her own practice in akron the single 
woman had no idea her marital status would become a liability but 
the banks loan officer essentially ignored the financial case 
shed built and instead insisted on checking out the income level 
of her parttime partners husband 
miller 42 decided to seek an alternative method of funding 
working with wego not yet set up to guarantee loans miller 
developed a cohesive business plan that led to a creative 
alternative instead of outright buying the 75000 hightech 
business equipment her practice required miller agreed to lease it 
with an option to buy later on 
such creativity is repeated throughout the 40 countries in which 
womens world banking has branches 
in the case of edwards the potion purveyor womens world 
banking helped her write a business plan that convinced a local 
economic development agency to loan her 5334 she spent the money 
on newspaper advertisements a 12page mailorder catalog and 
spiffy packaging 
her business plan already has shown positive results edwards 
said she was working 16hour days to meet the surge in requests for 
her wildgathered potions of comfrey colts foot and other 
medicinal herbs and this fall the west athens maine woman was 
able to achieve a nearly 20fold jump in sales from the previous 
year a windfall since her only other source of income was food 
stamps and 80 a month in child support 
with her newfound income edwards who left hoboken nj 20 
years ago hopes to turn an outside shed into a new drying area for 
her herbs 
barry the womens world banking president said women generally 
are good loan risks because they tend to be very practical and 
have their feet on the ground know how to juggle a lot of 
balls at a time and are balanced with a sense of the 
possible 
all of those skills are precisely what it takes to make a 
small business work explained barry 41 a former world bank 
employee who pioneered that groups projects in small business 
development in 1975 
barry a harvard mba graduate spends her weeks girdling the 
globe to make sure things are running smoothly 
during a recent workday ten floors above the screeching 
congestion of midtown manhattan barry filled her corner office 
with smoke from her freshly lit marlboro taken from a 
10cigarette pack she pocketed from a airplane from tokyo the night 
earlier she noted that her november itinerary called for stops in 
no less than seven countries 
i actually got to sleep in my own bed last night it was kind 
of exciting she said as she prepared to leave malaysia in two 
days

the soviet union and its former allies are likely 
to face the hardest winter since world war ii as recession 
compounded by rising oil prices continues to deepen un 
economists said tuesday 
the economists drew a grim picture of increasing food shortages 
in the soviet union bulgaria and romania soaring unemployment 
rates throughout the region and doubledigit inflation these 
threats could stall the whole reform process of moving from a 
command to a market economy 
the consequences of such a failure are incalculable and would 
not only be economic they warned in a 147page report which 
also pointed to increasing signs of social unrest in the east 
one certain effect would be to raise enormous pressures for 
emigration from the east to the west said the survey compiled 
by experts of the un economic commission for europe it noted 
that new soviet legislation would soon allow unrestricted travel 
abroad 
there seems to be little ground for contradicting the view 
that the people of eastern europe and the soviet union are facing 
their hardest winter since the end of the second world war it 
said 
the survey also said slower economic growth in western europe 
and fears that the united states could slide into recession may 
have an impact on financial and technical support for the east 
moscows former eastern european allies depend on the soviet 
union for about 80 percent of their oil transmission breakdowns 
have already reduced soviet exports by more than a fifth the 
survey noted 
starting jan 1 1991 payment for soviet oil will have to be in 
convertible currency and at world market prices under the regions 
comecon trading system to be dissolved on that date moscows 
partners have paid the equivalent of about 750 per barrel in 
transferable rubles this compared with an average 18 paid on 
world markets before iraqs invasion of kuwait 
if eastern europe has to buy oil at 35 or even 40 a barrel 
then the price shock is much larger than the ones faced by the 
west in the 1970s the survey said 
the comecon trading system based on bilateral agreements has 
already effectively collapsed the survey said 
during the course of this year a chaotic mixture of barter 
deals clearing agreements and hardcurrency transactions have 
emerged it added to avoid accumulation of rubles the survey 
said moscows partners have resorted to avariety of trade 
restrictions that led to retaliations and a virtual trade war

one giant economy stretching from above the 
snowy arctic circle to below the sunbaked yucatan peninsula 
thats the dream of promoters of a north american trade bloc 
the united states canada and mexico need to form a common 
market to counter emerging freetrade zones in europe and asia say 
these boosters who count president bush among their numbers 
also supporters say it only makes sense for the united states 
to ease trade restrictions with its southern neighbor and 
thirdlargest trading partner mexico since it did so with its no 
1 partner canada two years ago 
following a usmexico agreement a north american freetrade 
zone could be created by a companion pact between canada and 
mexico an idea already backed by canadian officials 
that could mean products made in any one of the three nations 
could be freely sold in the other two creating a vast consumer 
market of more than 360 million people 
bush endorsed a north american common market in his presidential 
campaign two years ago he was in mexico on monday and tuesday for 
talks with president carlos salinas de gortari on establishing a 
usmexico freetrade pact the next step in creating such a 
trading zone 
supporters say such an accord would bring a number of benefits 
to americans including cheaper goods made by us companies in 
mexico an expanded market for us products in mexico and a 
counterbalance to the barrierfree europe planned by the end of 
1992 as well as moves by japan toward forming an asian trade bloc 
given the competition of the asian countries and japan 
especially the united states has to have access to cheaper labor 
in order to be able to compete internationally said abel 
beltrandelrio chief economist for ciemexwefa an economic 
consulting firm specializing in mexico 
for mexicans a pact should boost the nations troubled economy 
by luring us investment in plants and technology it also should 
open up the us market to more mexican products particularly 
agricultural goods boosters say 
for both countries a pact could ease friction over illegal 
mexican aliens in the united states 
supporters say there should be less reason for mexican laborers 
to migrate to the united states if there are more jobs at home in 
addition mexican officials want the pact to include provisions 
making it easier for mexicans to enter and work in this country 
despite these factors favoring a freetrade pact dont expect 
dutyfree tequila anytime soon detractors especially organized 
labor are expected to fiercely fight any agreement that could 
result in a weaker bargaining position for us workers and a loss 
of us factory jobs 
who gains from the agreement are us or multinational 
companies that can take advantage of very very low wages along 
with minimal environmental and workersafety rules in mexico said 
candice johnson a spokeswoman for the aflcio 
she said an idea of the outcome of a trade pact can be seen by 
examining the maquiladoras the thriving us assembly plants 
located just over the mexican border there mexican workers toil 
for as little as 290 a day under conditions resembling sweatshops 
of the late 19th and early 20th centuries the union coalition 
contends 
ms johnson said a north american freetrade agreement would be 
a disaster for us workers and ultimately canadian workers 
because everythings going to be made in mexico 
mexican officials and other boosters say any loss of us jobs 
would be offset by an increase in us exports to its southern 
neighbor 
for each incremental dollar mexico would receive through the 
pact about 15 cents would end up going to the united states 
through the purchase of us goods said edgardo mendoza valdes an 
official of the mexican stock brokerage probursa and a 
representative of the mexican financial sector to the trade talks 
under a freetrade agreement each nation would manufacture what 
it does best or cheapest he said 
there will be losses in some us sectors and there will be 
gains in other sectors from exporters said beltrandelrio the 
economist 
he also predicts us exports to the rest of the world would be 
boosted by the use of mexican labor bolstering the us economy 
i dont see why the united states cannot grow like it used to 
grow when its cost structure was more competitive in the world 
but mexico has its own critics of a freetrade agreement among 
their concerns is the sanctity of mexicos vast oil reserves 
nationalized in 1938 after accusations that us oil companies were 
exploiting the nation 
these critics dont want any freetrade pact to include the 
right for us oil companies to gain control of mexican oil fields 
since salinas took office in december 1988 mexico has lowered 
tariffs and joined the general agreement on trade and tariffs 
which his predecessors strongly opposed 
the united states shipped 2497 billion worth of goods to 
mexico in 1989 and imported 2719 billion in mexican goods for a 
us trade deficit with mexico of 22 billion

pan american world airways said tuesday it would 
offer cheap winter fares to london in hopes of attracting more 
passengers during the slow winter travel season 
the cashstrapped carrier said passengers who buy tickets by 
dec 7 can get a oneway fare of 149 from new york to london 
based on a roundtrip purchase with fares slightly higher from 
other cities served by pan am 
two of pan ams competitors on the transatlantic flights trans 
world and british airways had no immediate comment on whether they 
intended to slash any fares in response 
airlines usually move quickly to match cheap fares offered by 
rival carriers for fear they could otherwise lose passengers in the 
highly competitive industry 
the pan am fares which are nonrefundable and available on only 
a limited number of seats are good for travel between jan 7 and 
march 21 but the trips must begin by march 14 
the softening of air traffic demand expected during the first 
quarter of 1991 due to weakening economic conditions has prompted 
us to offer winter salfe fares to europe said john bloodworth a 
pan am spokesman we are confident that the fares will stimulate 
traffic during the traditionally slow winter travel period 
pan am is also offering some sale fares to most of its other 33 
destinations in europe

the cineplex odeon movie theater chain said 
tuesday it had reached an agreement with its banks that allows the 
company to defer principal payments until mid1992 
the preliminary fouryear agreement also allows the company to 
hold on to assets that were to be sold under a previous loan 
agreement 
cineplex had been committed to selling 160 million us in 
assets by sept 30 the company had raised 120 million us by 
selling us theater properties 
the new agreement also combines the companys banks in two 
separate syndicates with three outside banks to form a single bank 
group 
cineplex odeon is one of the largest theater operators in north 
america with 1700 screens in 415 locations 
the company has been struggling recently because of a large debt 
load amassed in an aggressive expansion by former chairman garth 
drabinsky 
in an effort to turn things around cineplex has been peddling 
assets not connected to its main cinema business 
the company has been loaned 100 million us by the claridge 
group controlled by montreal financier charles bronfman and the 
us entertainment conglomerate mca inc which was bought monday 
by the japanese electronics firm matsushita electric industrial co 
ltd 
the new banking deal requires that this debt be converted to 
cineplex stock by may 31 1991 
in addition mca and claridge have agreed to provide the company 
with a 35 million us line of credit 
the new banking deal should help the companys restructuring 
campaign said peter legault an analyst with the brokerage thomson

economists say that if corporate america is to 
succeed in the midst of recession and increasing global 
competition workers must become more productive in the first of a 
threepart series examining the new workplace sharon cohen 
looks at how more and more companies large and small are turning 
bored workers into effective bosses and getting dramatic results 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when ralph stayers workers botched sales 
orders mislabeled products and even smashed a forklift into a 
wall he didnt moan he didnt groan he just changed bosses 
stayer put his workers in charge yes the same bored people who 
made careless costly errors he decided could run his company 
make it more profitable and turn it into a bigger better business 
thats precisely what happened at johnsonville foods a family 
owned sausage company where workers reign supreme they hire and 
fire each other buy equipment write budgets they are their own 
bosses 
everyone looks at what were doing and says god thats knd 
of flaky thats kind of goodygoody warm and fuzzy said 
stayer johnsonvilles chief executive officer and owner it 
isnt a soft or crazy deal im a real hardnosed pragmatic guy 
teach people to do for themselves this way you get a far better 
performance 
this runityourself philosophy in place for eight years at 
johnsonville is spreading across corporate america from small 
companies to fortune 500 heavyhitters such as ibm general mills 
and goodyear the rank and file are taking charge like never 
before using brains not brawn on the assembly line 
nowadays steel and auto workers sausage stuffers cereal 
packers engine makers and others work in teams without bosses set 
profit goals write schedules develop products meet customers 
design assembly lines even pore over financial records 
its not a social experiment it makes good business sense 
said pat mcnulty who manages a new workerrun general mills cereal 
plant in georgia nobody knows the job as well as those doing it 
if you empower those people to make the decisions they make good 
ones 
the payoff reduced costs better quality greater efficiency 
mcnulty expects productivity to be 30 percent to 40 percent higher 
than traditional plants johnsonville sales have increased more 
than 20 percent annually since the changes were made and 
productivity has increased 50 percent since 1986 
its one of those rare situations where everybody wins said 
john zenger president of a california consulting firm companies 
become more competitive the employees learn more skills the 
more you have a sense of autonomy the happier a camper you are 
you feel like youre going to your own business not like 
youre going to do something for somebody else said general 
mills worker rhonda lunsford 
though some companies started this approach long ago much of 
the growth has occurred in the past few years a recent survey of 
476 fortune 1000 companies found 46 percent had some employees in 
selfmanaged work teams compared with 27 percent three years ago 
and more than half say theyll use more teams in the future 
said ed lawler a university of southern california management 
professor who conducted the survey 
the motives increasing global competition and greater profits 
the success of japanese businesses and japans muchtouted 
management style has helped to spark changes in this country 
companies dont change because theyre nice lawler said 
they change because they want to make money if it wasnt for 
japan inc i dont think a lot of this would be happening 
though this philosophy wont work everywhere its pointless in 
factories with simple repetitive tasks changes are occurring in 
paper mills oil refineries chemical plants and elsewhere usually 
in nonunion settings 
consider 
at chaparral steel in midlothian texas production workers 
have traveled to japan europe and canada to evaluate and decide 
what kind of equipment should be purchased one lathe operator 
found a machine for half the 15 million budgeted for it he 
knew more about the machine than anyone else said dennis beach 
vice president of human resources 
if youre not going to be responsible you might as well be a 
monkey on an assembly line said millwright mike glenn 
at goodyear tire amp rubber cos hose plant in mount pleasant 
iowa there is no seniority no time clock no supervisors just a 
manager and teams with rotating coordinators 
its nothing like a factory said worker danny pulse 
youre actually in on everything from making it to sending it 
out the door its not th same old grind every day you dont get 
burned out youre making your own decisions you actually get to 
use your own judgment 
workers too determine if colleagues deserve raises 
sometimes the sparks fly said human resources manager dave 
smith you have to take constructive criticism and not everyone 
can 
at general mills plant in covington ga workers or 
technicians do their own maintenance scheduling and clerical 
jobs make quality checks handle disciplinary problems and 
participate in interviewing and selecting new employees 
you have to want to take a leadership role said mcnulty 
the plant manager thats kind of different from the person who 
wants to come in and be told what to do 
at ibms rochester minn plant as in many other places 
workers can shut down production lines one did this year when she 
spotted a defect on a device built into a computer storage product 
saving money and customer inconvenience workers there recently won 
the coveted malcolm baldrige national quality award 
at the springfield remanufacturing corp workers in the 
missouribased privately owned company have access to financial 
records learn how to read income statements and can start spinoff 
businesses sharing profits 
if it all seems more democratic robert bies an associate 
management professor at georgetown university warns the 
rhetoric is far ahead of the reality 
many of the companies havent woken up to the call of 
competition he added people have to give up authority and 
they dont like it 
this approach has drawbacks too such as reducing promotion 
possibilities eliminating seniority rights and creating new 
pressures 
if for the last 10 years youve been telling people what to 
do then they say youre not going to do this anymore you 
think what am i going to do said robert kelley management 
professor at carnegie mellon universitys graduate school of 
industrial administration

at johnsonville everything didnt click immediately 
do you think we had people doing budgets the first day they 
walked in we spent five years at that stayer said 
workers dubbed members also train one another decide how 
much to spend on equipment cut their hours when necessary and 
choose which associates those hired during busy seasons 
become fulltime employees there are no supervisors just coaches 
initiative is required one team designed an assembly line a 
bookkeeper suggested a mailorder business and shares the profits 
they feel like they own it and therefore act like owners 
said linda honold a former coach who works with stayer advising 
other companies 
things werent always so smooth said lori lehmann 
johnsonvilles statistics and hiring coordinator who recalls how 
she used to call in sick to avoid work 
there was no direction no communication with the supervisors 
you didnt express ideas she said youd punch in do your 
job punch out 
stayer knew something was wrong despite strong sales in the 
novemberdecember issue of the harvard business review he 
describes how workers mislabeled products sprayed water on them 
and made other mistakes 
people didnt care he said they didnt invest much of 
themselves in their jobs i had to change to make them be more 
important so their jobs would be more important 
this approach begun in 1982 is flourishing 
i dont get a lot of pressure from above said worker 
michelle stock im not just standing there doing my thing im 
paying attention youre thinking about whats going on youre 
thinking about the results 
johnsonville has no costofliving increases or seniority 
raises members receive more money only if they assume more 
responsibility bonuses tied to the companys performance amount 
to 28 percent of pretax profits 
thats what its all about 
theyre far more valuable people stayer said these 
people have skills that they can take anywhere thats real 
morality

pepsico inc on tuesday won a court battle to break 
its business relationship with source perrier and take direct 
control of its soft drink operations in france 
the paris commercial court officially recognized that the 
franchise bottling relationship between pepsico and a unit of 
source perrier sa will expire at the end of this year 
the decision clears the way for pepsi cola france sa to take 
direct control of bottling and distributing pepsi brand beverages 
in france at the beginning of next year 
officials at perrier the maker of the wellknown sparking 
mineral water had no immediate comment it was not known whether 
the court ruling would be appealed 
pepsico announced a year ago that it intended to end its 
franchising agreement with perrier stuart haugen managing 
director of pepsi cola france said pepsis market share in france 
had fallen over a decade from 18 percent to 9 percent 
haugen blamed inadequate distribution efforts by perrier 
asserting that pepsi cola clearly wasnt a priority business for 
them he said pepsi cola accounted for only 1 percent to 2 
percent of perriers annual revenue 
perrier said the steady decline in pepsi sales was due to 
insufficient publicity by the us group and its refusal to launch 
diet pepsi a lowcalorie cola on the french market 
perrier said pepsi colas announcement that it intended to break 
off its contract was timed to coincide with a bid by the us 
company to buy perriers softdrink business outright 
perrier sold its softdrink assets to cadburyschweppes plc of 
britain in march 
in may 1989 pepsi colas arch rival cocacola co agreed to 
buy its french bottler from its parent pernodricard sa ending a 
bitter feud between those companies

soybean futures prices rose tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade rebounding late in the session after 
selling that was linked to dimming prospects for soviet purchases 
wheat and corn futures closed slightly lower 
market analysts said the late surge in soybean prices appeared 
to have been prompted by technical signals because there was no 
fresh news to spark a rally 
the strong finish erased mondays moderate losses which had 
reflected disappointment in the outlook for new soviet purchases of 
us agricultural products statements made monday and early 
tuesday by us and soviet officials indicated the soviet union may 
not be a large buyer of us grain in the coming year 
richard feltes research director with the commodities brokerage 
refco inc said the recent volatility in the soybean market 
suggested prices have bottomed out 
this is a wild choppy time and its difficult to take a stand 
and be committed for very long but my longterm view is that were 
headed higher he said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 242 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 218 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to 2 cents higher with december at 107 a 
bushel soybeans were cent lower to 6 cents higher with january 
at 583 a bushel

advertising agencies owned by wpp group plc the 
worlds largest ad and marketing services agency group have 
decided to cut more than 40 jobs because of the loss of two major 
accounts a spokesman said tuesday 
at the same time a company source said wpp chairman martin 
sorrell has issued an internal company memo pressing department 
heads to cut costs when they draw up their budgets next month 
the memo follows wpps warning last week that its annual pretax 
profit wouldnt match analysts forecasts of 110 million pounds or 
217 million 
forty employees are leaving j walter thompsons 490member 
london staff due to the loss of the national westminster bank 
account said a wpp spokesman who asked not to be identified 
the spokesman also confirmed a published report that another wpp 
agency scali mccabe sloves is cutting jobs in new york because of 
the loss of the volvo car account he did not say how many jobs 
were being cut but the wall street journal said about 35 people 
were being cut from a staff of 260 
marvin sloves who heads the agency was said to be involved in 
meetings and was unavailable for comment on the report 
the agency recently resigned the volvo account amid controversy 
over an advertisement that purported to show a volvo surviving 
relatively intact while other cars were crushed by a monster 
pickup truck with oversized wheels 
it turned out that the volvo was reinforced with steel and wood 
while other cars were structurally weakened before the ad was shot 
wpp has vaulted to the top of the advertising world in terms of 
billings in the past five years 
it bought the parent of the j walter thompson ad agency and the 
hill amp knowlton public relations agency in 1987 and bought the 
parent of another venerable agency ogilvy amp mather worldwide two 
years later 
in addition it has acquired dozens of smaller marketing 
services agencies that specialize in areas such as packaging and 
design 
but in the process the company has accumulated a debt which 
totaled 325 million british pounds at the end of 1989 
as the growth of ad spending has slowed in recent months some 
analysts expect that sorrell will take aggressive action to cut 
costs possibly including asset sales

trading was light but volatile said dudley eppel a managing

its all over the place its really a minutetominute 
game he said 
eppel said there was no economic news to affect the market and 
not much conviction either way prices went 
but he said there were some pockets of strength among stocks

as britains next prime minister john major is 
expected to pursue kinder gentler versions of margaret thatchers 
freemarket policies 
major the nations top treasury official for the past 13 
months was the financial markets popular choice the pound rose 
strongly tuesday on word that he defeated two challengers to become 
the new leader of the conservative party 
the pound rose to 19790 after the news from 19750 before it 
closed at 19655 on monday 
the stock market which closed for the day before majors 
victory was announced was expected to rise when it reopened 
tuesday 
its as good a result as we could have hoped for we have a 
former chancellor of the exchequer leading the country said 
derek scott chief economist at the london investment firm barclays 
de zoete wedd ltd 
keith skeoch chief economist at james capel and co said 
the financial markets quite rightly see major as a continuation 
of thatcher 
major is a regarded as a freemarketeer who is expected to 
continue the thatcherite policies of privatization prudent tax 
cuts and tight fiscal spending i intend to build on the 
policies we have he said when he began his campaign last 
thursday 
opponents have accused him of being nothing more than mrs 
thatchers poodle but supporters insist he is his own man 
mrs thatcher said she was thrilled he won 
major is expected to continue current economic policy of high 
interest rates to fight 109 percent inflation although he is 
expected to cut the 14 percent base lending rate soon 
the aim would be to maintain the conservative partys upward 
momentum in the opinion polls which showed the tories surging 
against the socialist labor party during the twoweek leadership 
struggle 
major said thursday his priorities were uniting the conservative 
party and defeating the labor party in the next general election 
which must be called by mid1992 
david owen a british economist at the london investment firm 
kleinwort benson ltd said the next 18 months or so of uk 
economic policymaking will certainly depend on when they hold the 
next election all the tories want to do is win the next 
election 
major he has pledged to review the highly unpopular per capita 
community charge or poll tax suggesting it might be linked to 
taxpayers ability to pay 
i have become increasingly convinced that we cant leave 
things as they are major said about the tax in no sense would 
i be afraid to make changes in government policy when i think it is 
wrong 
he also said he would make the biggest tax cuts at the lower end 
of the tax brackets high earners got the biggest breaks under mrs 
thatcher 
he is expected to be slightly more enthusiastic about european 
monetary union than the hostile mrs thatcher but still cautious 
major took the pound into europes exchange rate mechanism on 
oct 8 a move mrs thatcher fought for years he also wants 
britain to be better represented in europe discussions 
however he has said he wouldnt agree to a single currency and 
a single european bank being forced on britain prematurely 
major who has served as chancellor for a little more than a 
year must deal with an economy that its expected to shrink a 
quarter to a half percentage point next year after growing 1 
percent this year 
major might call an election as early as this coming spring to 
capitalize on the improved showing in the opinion polls owen said 
hell want to get a clear mandate from the electorate for the 
next five years owen said he was only elected by the 
conservative party not the electorate

japan will fall short of complying with a us 
trade agreement covering computer chips by the time the pact 
expires next year but progress has been made a trade group said 
tuesday in a report to president bush 
overall the report concludes that the trade agreement has 
succeeded in containing instances of dumping and in moving toward 
a more open market for foreign semiconductors in japan said wilf 
corrigan chairman of the semiconductor industry association 
dumping is the sale of products in foreign markets below 
production costs 
however despite the recent progress that has been made japan 
will not have fully complied with the terms of the agreement when 
it expires next july said corrigan who is chairman and chief 
executive of chip maker lsi logic corp 
he added in his statement that the trade group believes a new 
chip pact is needed to ensure that the objectives of the 1986 
agreement are achieved 
the semiconductor industry association released the statement 
with its annual report to bush on the progress of the chip 
agreement 
in a letter to bush accompanying the report sia president 
andrew procassini said progress was hurt by the fact that japan 
did not begin its initiatives in earnest until almost three years 
into the agreement 
the report discusses two key elements of the 1986 pact 
preventing japanese chip makers from dumping their semiconductors 
on the us market and creating an open market for semiconductors 
in japan 
the report says marketaccess efforts finally are under way and 
are making progress foreign market share for semiconductors in 
japan increased from 85 percent when the agreement was signed to 
133 percent in this years second quarter it said 
us companies are aggressively pursuing opportunities in the 
japanese market the trade group said 
the safeguards against dumping have encouraged new investment in 
the united states in two categories of chips that were most 
severely affected by the practice dynamic randomaccess memory 
chips and erasable programmable readonly memory chips the sia 
said

baseball owners are doing better than ever 
increasing their operating profits by 75 percent in 1989 to a 
record 2145 million according to financial figures obtained by 
the associated press 
the 26 teams took in a record 1241059000 in 1989 a 23 
percent increase from the previous season their operating expenses 
were 1026550000 a 16 percent increase from 1988 
that left them with a pretax operating profit of 214509000 
or an average of 83 million per team the previous record profit 
of 1216 million was set in 1988 on earnings of 1007519000 
baseballs first billiondollar season 
the figures were obtained by the ap from two baseball sources on 
the condition they not be identified 
it was the sixth consecutive season baseball teams increased 
their operating profits because of the accounting practices of the 
various teams financial figures for 1990 will not be available 
until next year 
chuck oconnor the head of managements player relations 
committee said the figures showed that baseball on an overall 
basis was doing quite well 
the difficulty with it he said tuesday is that you have 
to get below the aggregate figures to determine the level of health 
of the individual parts that make up the game the 26 clubs 
there theres a different story you cant look at the overall 
industry profits and say therefore my team in pittsburgh is in 
great shape or my team in kansas city is in great shape 
oconnor said that four clubs lost money in 1989 but that the 
figure would become nine based on an apportioned share of the 
tentative 280 million collusion settlement 
baseball has boomed since the mid1980s according to figures 
released by the commissioners office in the past the 26 teams 
lost 666 million in 1983 on revenues of 5216 million then cut 
the losses to 41 million in 1984 and 71 million in 1985 
the teams made 115 million in 1986 the season after began 
shunning free agents two arbitrators found the conspiracy 
depressed player salaries and the profit soared to 1033 million 
in 1987 
in the four years following the start of the conspiracy the 
teams made a total operating profit of 4509 million 
however as part of the tentative settlement of the collusion 
cases owners have agreed to give the major league baseball players 
association a payment that would amount to 280 million as of jan 
2 interest will be added if the payment is made after that date

the head of the us small business 
administration chided parker brothers inc tuesday for showing 
insensitivity to modern realities in a game that lists 
supermom and schoolteacher as key careers for girls 
parker brothers is sending the wrong message to young girls 
said sba administrator susan engeleiter even barbie dolls come 
with business suits these days 
careers for girls is a new board game targeted for girls 
ages 812 players select from six careers super mom 
schoolteacher rock star fashion designer college graduate and 
animal doctor 
instructions for the game packaged in a hot pink box include 
show us how you slow dance with your main squeeze describe 
your dream husband tell us the names of your eight children 
and burn all your chocolate chip cooies 
engeleiter said the game shows an insensitivity to modern 
realities in a society where women are making breakthroughs in 
almost every profession im amazed that as we enter the 1990s 
the game doesnt include such careers as business executives 
government leaders astronauts scientists or moms without the 
prefix super 
there are no leadership or policymaking careers on this parker 
brothers game board there are no careers requiring physical daring 
or strength she added noting that women now own 30 percent of 
all businesses in the united states and that the sba projects they 
will own 36 percent by the turn of the century 
company spokesman patricia mcgovern stressed the game is purely 
for entertainment and is certainly not to communicate that only 
certain careers are limited to women the game was designed by a 
woman art was managed by a woman and the product manager was a 
woman she said 
so everyone that was involved with bringing this game to 
market is female said mcgovern were really disappointed to 
hear the objections 
the first to register a complaint with parker brothers about the 
game was washington attorney marna tucker 
i called them up and was infuriated about it said tucker 
i think that right before the holiday season that parker brothers 
is about to step into something very smelly 
tucker said she and a few womens organizations are writing a 
letter demanding that parker brothers either withdraw the game from 
the market or contribute their profits from that to women 
education groups 
they could do a lot of things with the profits that would be 
helpful to women to assist women in breaking down further 
barriers said tucker 
actually careers for girls is an update of a 1957 version 
that listed as professions big business prospecting politics 
going to sea expedition to the moon farming hollywood and 
college mcgovern said the careers were changed in 1971 to include 
ecology space sports teaching and arts career changes were made 
again in 1979 
the game was discontinued in 1984 because it had unfortunately 
lost its mass market appeal said mcgovern we decided to 
reintroduce the game for the 1990s and target it to preteen girls 
because that is a growing niche in the market preteen girls have 
returned to playing board games

is no longer seeking buyers for two of its investment information 
subsidiaries datastream international and interactive data 
the company cited current conditions in financial markets 
worldwide for pulling the two companies off the sales block 
they generated a combined 155 million in revenue in 1989 and 
had been put up for sale in march as the company decided to shed 
some of its noncore businesses 
company spokesman reid gearhart declined to say whether there 
were any bids for the two companies or whether bids were too low 
he said dun amp bradstreet intended to continue to manage the 
companies at their current levels 
he noted that in the third quarter the parent company said 
datastream had generated higher revenue than a year ago while 
revenue was down at interactive data largely because of the 
termination of certain services that had been provided under 
previous owners 
datastream international based in london provides investment 
information principally on international securities interactive 
data based in lexington mass provides securitiesrelated 
information to the us investment community 
the two subsidiaries were among seven that dun amp bradstreet has

confidence in the economy has sunk to levels 
near the depths of the 1982 recession and consumers are paring 
spending plans entering the christmas shopping season a survey 
released tuesday said 
the conference board said its survey of consumer confidence in 
november found more people expecting higher unemployment and weaker 
business conditions in the coming months 
fabian linden a conference board economist said consumer 
confidence has dropped to recession levels and is now only 
marginally above the figure recorded during the lowest point of the 
1982 economic downturn 
the business research organization said its monthly consumer 
confidence index continued to decline in november falling to 615 
from 626 in october 
the index which registered 1151 in november 1989 edged down 
as the economy has weakened earlier this year then tumbled after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait in august it stood at 1017 in july and 
then plunged to 847 in august 
the survey aso found consumers continued to scale back plans 
for major expenditures in november including cars appliances and 
vacations 
the conference boards survey results supported the predictions 
of economists and retail industry analysts who said consumers would 
spend less this christmas because of concerns about the economy and 
the middle east 
higher unemployment and higher prices for oil and other energy 
sources have left americans with less money to spend on what are 
called discretionary items clothing appliances furniture and 
gifts 
some retailers reported their holiday seasons began well but 
others found consumers were already cutting back their giftbuying 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said many 
shoppers appeared to be looking rather than buying over the 
thanksgiving day weekend and many appeared reluctant to commit 
themselves to big purchases sears said its sales were somewhat 
below expectations 
even smaller retailers and stores that sell toys and other 
merchandise popular this time of the year have been affected 
tonja little manager of the huggable hut a stuffedanimal shop 
in atlanta said tuesday that sales have fallen off sharply 
compared to last year at the same time 
people are coming in and looking but theyre not buying 
she said adding it has a lot to do with the economy slowing 
down 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group in washington 
dc described the christmas season as off to a slow start 
she said it was not so much a lack of confidence that has made 
consumers hesitant but more a reflection of whats happened in 
the economy directly jobs have been lost since the summer and 
wages have not been keeping up with inflation 
elizabeth armstrong a retail industry analyst with prescott 
ball amp turben characterized christmas sales so far as mixed to 
somewhat disappointing she said warm weather in many parts of 
the country was another factor working against consumer spending 
the conference board survey found that americans have a dim view 
of the future of those asked 344 percent said there would be 
fewer jobs available in six months 97 percent said there would be 
more and 559 percent predicted employment would be the same 
when asked what business conditions would be like in six months 
112 percent said they would be better 295 said they would be 
worse and 593 said they would be the same 
the consumer confidence survey was conducted by national family 
opinion inc of toledo ohio which questioned 5000 households 
across the country the conference board is a businesssupported 
research group

daily settlement for spot copper since june 27 
the drop extended a decline from levels near 130 a pound just 
one month ago 
analysts said signs of easing supply tightness in london 
prompted tuesdays early selling interest which in turn triggered 
profittaking and new selling by large speculative funds 
bette raptopoulos senior metals analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said an expected squeeze in supplies of copper for 
delivery against the soontoexpire november contract did not 
materialize and also spurred selling 
both she and analyst fred demler of painewebber inc noted that 
tuesdays fundamental developments a slight rise in the stock 
market and little change in crude oil prices were bullish for 
copper 
nevetheless raptopoulos said underlying it all are concerns 
about recession even though that did not surface today

dull trading that reflected a lack of new developments in the 
persian gulf standoff

cents a gallon 
soybean futures prices rose on the chicago board of trade 
rebounding late in the session after selling interest faded with 
dimming prospects for soviet purchases wheat and corn futures 
closed slightly lower 
the strong finish in soybeans erased mondays moderate losses 
which had reflected disappointment in the outlook for new soviet 
purchases of us agricultural products statements made monday and 
early tuesday by us and soviet officials indicated the soviet 
union may not be a large buyer of us grain in the coming year 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents lower with december

booksquaring and selling ahead of first notice day wednesday for 
the december live cattle contract first notice day is the first 
opportunity for traders to declare their intention to deliver a 
physical commodity against a futures contract

lighterthanexpected cash hog sales that may have been due to 
winter storm conditions in major hogproducing states

7910 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 77 cent lower

the dollar fell against most major foreign 
currencies tuesday as the british pound boosted by the election of 
john major as the countrys next prime minister dominated the 
foreign exchange markets 
gold prices slipped lower 
the pound surged higher after major chancellor of the exchequer 
the british equivalent of the us treasury was assured of 
becoming the next british prime minster 
major who had the support of outgoing prime minister margaret 
thatcher fell just short of winning election as head of the 
conservative party tuesday but his challengers withdrew from the 
race and conceded defeat to major effectively giving him the prime 
ministers job 
the pound rose to 19775 in new york from 196895 late monday 
in london trading before majors election was assured the pound 
rose to 19750 from 19655 late monday 
foreign exchange traders had hoped major would win because they 
were familiar with his policies and expected little change if he 
succeeded mrs thatcher 
mike faust a currency market annalyst with money market 
services in chicago said sterlings fortune might be shortlived 
he said there was speculation among traders that the british 
government would lower base lending rates to 135 percent from 
their current 14 percent 
currencies are supported by higher interest rates so a drop in 
british rates would make that countrys investments less attractive 
and could send the pound lower 
faust said the dollar fell against other currencies amid the 
belief that the big industrial nations are satisfied with the 
dollars low levels 
in overseas trading the dollar was hurt by a widening of the 
us trade deficit the commerce department said the deficit 
swelled to 2975 billion in the julyseptember quarter up 289 
percent from 2310 billion in the apriljune period 
traders believe the us government will be more inclined to 
keep the dollar lower as a means of narrowing the trade gap a 
lower dollar makes imports into the us more expensive and this 
countrys exports cheaper for overseas buyers 
the dollar fell to 12835 yen in new york from 12905 yen late 
monday in tokyo earlier the dollar rose to 12895 yen from 12795 
yen at mondays close and in london the us currency fell to 
12830 yen

oil prices were down slightly in uncertain 
trading tuesday as traders awaited action later this week on a 
united nations resolution authorizing a military strike against 
iraq 
clearly the traders yesterday and today are betting that there 
will be a war and theres some probability of that now said 
philip dodge oil analyst at nomura research institute 
light sweet crude oil settled down 9 cents a barrel at 3286 
for january delivery on the new york mercantile exchange the 
contract had been off as much as 60 cents earlier in the day 
partly in response to reports that un diplomats would make jan 
15 instead of jan 1 the deadline for iraqi troop withdrawal 
from kuwait 
the later deadline would push back the likelihood of war the 
un measure which would authorize all necessary means to get 
iraq out of kuwait after that deadline is to be voted on thursday 
prices had been unchanged at midday when an annual fire drill 
closed the trading floor for one half hour the session turned 
bearish when it reopened 
buyers enthusiasm also was dampened by news that indonesias 
president suharto warned the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries of a possible oil glut if the persian gulf crisis ends 
we have a very narrow trading range even with all the news 
said brian tagler a broker at lehman brothers inc 
contracts for delivery of crude in later months all closed 
higher 
home heating oil settled 89 cents lower at 9149 cents a gallon 
for december delivery contracts contracts for later months were 
mixed mainly due to seasonal factors 
unleaded gasoline settled up 52 cents at 8472 cents per gallon 
on december deliver contracts with other delivery months mixed 
natural gas futures were off for the day with january delivery 
contracts falling 78 cents to 254 per 1000 cubic feet february 
contracts dropped 47 cents to 2423 per 1000 cubic feet with 
all later delivery months down as well 
after the market closed the leading oil industry group released 
weekly figures showing that the nations supply of crude oil 
remained below 1989 levels 
the us stockpile of crude dropped to 3371 million barrels 
last week compared with 3412 million barrels a week earlier and 
3440 million barrels a year earlier the american petroleum 
institute reported 
the stockpile of distillates which include home heating oil 
were slightly higher at 1348 million barrels compared with 1345

a federal bankruptcy judge tuesday granted 
eastern airlines a lifesaving 135 million infusion to keep it 
flying through winter and avoid repeated requests for money that 
have sapped public confidence in the carrier 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland said he approved the 
emergency request in part because of government statements that 
chaos could occur if eastern closes down during the holiday season 
eastern said it sought the money because bad publicity had 
worsened its financial outlook spooked potential passengers and 
made creditcard companies nervous about doing business with the 
carrier 
the emergency cash request from eastern was far more than it had 
anticipated asking for only a few weeks ago when the judge 
permitted the ailing airline to withdraw an immediate 15 million 
from an escrow fund at the time the judge said eastern could get 
another 15 million if it met certain cash projections as of dec 
3 
in the latest grant lifland went ahead and gave eastern the 15 
million plus 120 million more the judge placed 15 million in a 
contingency fund to be used if creditors demand the airline put up 
cash deposits before customers do business with it 
the money is intended to keep eastern alive through march 
avoiding the need for repeated requests for additional money 
under all these circumstances it seems inappropriate to 
constantly come back at these short intervals where the adverse 
publicity will be repeated again and again lifland said 
the judge also chastised the unsecured creditors committee for 
creating tension in easterns business through comments to the 
media that their goal is to close and liquidate the carrier he 
said the committees had a fiduciary duty to eastern 
easterns courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue jr 
praised the judge for giving eastern a vote of confidence 
the latest eastern request for cash fanned the anger of 
unsecured creditors who have been demanding that the court close 
down the airline which has been in financial distress since a 
crippling strike in march 1989 
a liquidation of eastern is inevitable creditor attorney 
joel b zweibel said in a court filing opposing the cash infusion 
it should begin now before further funds are wasted and while 
christmas holiday travelers have several weeks to rearrange their 
plans 
after the judge approved the request zweibel said creditors 
would meet to determine their next move 
shugrue said the airline needed to know that it would have 
access to a much larger supply of cash so it could make longterm 
plans 
we simply cannot run the business on a rolling 15day time 
frame he testified at the hearing in manhattans federal 
bankruptcy court 
shugrue said bad publicity from easterns previous requests for 
money caused passengers to shy away from the airline moreover he 
said credit card companies were starting to demand that the 
airline provide millions of dollars up front for charged tickets in 
case eastern goes out of business 
the unsecured creditors who are owed about 1 billion by the 
airline say eastern has virtually no chance of becoming a viable 
airline amid industrywide troubles brought on by higher fuel costs 
and sluggish demand for air travel 
shugrue has said eastern stands a good chance of reaching the 
breakeven point early next year through a marketing strategy that 
offers firstclass seats at coachclass prices 
but he told the judge tuesday that eastern not only needed the 
15 million lifland had agreed to release in early december but 
another 120 million to keep eastern operating through the first 
quarter of 1991 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceramsak said seeking money from the 
court a little at a time would lead to relentlessly bad publicity 
hinting that the airline was almost dead which could become a 
selffulfilling prophesy if travelers decide to fly with the 
competition so eastern decided to take a stab at getting operating 
funds through march at once ceremsak said 
we think its necessary to restore consumer confidence and 
build advance bookings she said we sustained significant 
damage as a result of the liquidation talk 
at the hearing earlier this month shugrue had told the judge 
that eastern would need a total of 80 million in a series of 
payments from the escrow fund through early january after that 
eastern did not believe it would need to tap any more cash from the 
fund and instead hoped to quickly repay the money he said 
but eastern officials said tuesday that talk of easterns 
possible liquidation cost it unforeseen cancellations and other 
problems that could cost 70 million 
miamibased eastern one of the industrys oldest and most 
troubled airlines filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and 
reorganization march 9 1989 after unions crippled the airline 
with a strike 
the airline is now smaller than its prestrike size staffed 
with strike replacements and some unionists who returned to work 
but the machinists union remains on strike 
shugrue was appointed trustee last april after creditors lost 
faith in easterns management

the big television networks are using the latest 
foreign buyout of a hollywood studio to bolster their effort to 
trash federal rules they say leave them at a disadvantage in the 
global entertainment market 
cbs abc and nbc each cited mondays announcement that japans 
matsushita electric industrial co had agreed to buy the american 
entertainment giant mca inc in a 66 billion deal as evidence 
that foreignowned companies have a head start on them in 
marshaling resources for quality programs 
the deal comes only three weeks before the federal 
communications commissions dec 14 hearing on the financial 
interest and syndication rules 
the 20yearold finsyn rules prohibit the three major tv 
networks from having financial interests in shows they dont own 
and from getting into the lucrative business of selling network 
programs in the 3 billion syndication market for reruns on local 
tv stations cable networks and foreign markets 
the rules have effectively barred the networks from bidding for 
production companies even as foreign companies have swooped in to 
buy four of the seven biggest us studios including three in the 
past 14 months 
laurence a tisch president and chief executive at cbs inc 
said the mca deal accelerates the dizzying pace of consolidation 
in hollywood 
this has happened under the financial interest rules that give 
foreignowned studios competitive advantages over the three 
american networks there is no more eloquent testimony for repeal 
of these rules than these transactions and the consolidation they 
have fostered he said 
sony corp of japan bought columbia pictures entertainment inc 
in september 1989 and italiancontrolled pathe communications corp 
recently completed a buyout of mgmua communications inc rupert 
murdochs news corp based in australia has owned 20th century 
fox corp since 1985 
there was some indication that policymakers in washington are 
hearing the networks complaints 
fcc chairman alfred sikes said the deal will almost certainly 
affect the debate and added the commission must consider the 
trend toward vertical integration in the entertainment business 
in concluding what restraints the networks should face if any in 
their efforts to integrate 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee which oversees the fcc and telecommunications 
policy said the mca deal is an event of considerable 
significance and said his committee would be interested to see 
what comes of the fcc examination of the finsyn rules 
entertainment is one of the few areas in which the us enjoys a 
trade surplus the congressman said 
our regulatory system should not protect foreignowned 
companies at the expense of american enterprise he said 
hollywood studios and producers support the rules because they 
fear that the networks as gatekeepers of the airwaves would 
have too much power if they could also have a stake in programs 
the three major national networks say whether a show goes on 
the air or not said jerry leider chairman of the caucus of 
independent writers producers and directors it doesnt make a 
difference whether mca is owned by a foreign interests or not 
he said without the finsyn rules the networks would soon 
dominate the production business by demanding concessions on 
syndication sales from producers trying to get a show on the 
network 
but the networks argue their power over programming has been 
diluted by the proliferation of alternatives such as independent tv 
stations and cable tv 
richard cotton general counsel for the national broadcasting 
co said the mca deal leaves only three major usowned hollywood 
studio companies paramount communications inc walt disney co 
and time warner inc 
the great irony in this development is that us regulatory 
policy is actually contributing to the demise of us 
competitiveness in the global entertainment sector cotton said 
at capital citiesabc inc spokeswoman julie hoover said the 
deal showed the anachronism of rules that prevent the three 
domestic network companies from competing effectively in the global 
and domestic environment 
leider who was cochairman of the committee representing the 
studios and producers in unsuccessful talks with the networks last 
summer over changes in the finsyn rules said he expects the rules 
will be modified 
we have an an enlightened fcc that sees the wisdom of 
safeguards he said i dont think chairman sikes has indicated 
in that statement that the rules will be repealed

the 22 billion point arguello offshore 
oil facility which has been dormant since its completion two years 
ago will begin pumping crude within a few months chevron corp 
announced tuesday 
the san franciscobased company the largest of 18 partners in 
the project also said it would build a new multimillion dollar 
underground pipeline to ship oil to refineries in the los angeles 
area completion of that project would take at least three chevron 
spokesman mike libbey said 
the point arguello project is about 10 miles off point 
conception which is about 150 miles northwest of los angeles 
the consortium wants to ship heavy crude via doublehulled 
vessels to refineries in the los angeles area however santa 
barbara county officials on nov 12 rejected a proposal by the us 
department of energy to use tankers for interim hauling of 40000 
barrels daily while a pipeline was being built 
the consortium then decided to begin producing 20000 barrels 
per day and send it to northern california via the allamerican 
pipeline which needs a fivemile connection to a unocal refinery 
near santa maria libbey said 
unocal would use about 10000 to 15000 barrels per day and the 
remainder will be shipped to refineries in the bakersfield area or 
in contra costa county near san francisco he said 
the ultimate preferred destination is los angeles because 
thats where the need is its the biggest gasoline market in 
the world libbey said 
he also said the company preferred to transport the highsulfer 
or sour crude via pipeline not tanker but that the consortium 
would still push for using ships while the los angeles pipeline was 
being built 
an appeal of the santa barbara county decision was filed tuesday 
with the california coastal commission he said and a hearing is 
expected within a few months 
point arguello is permitted to produce up to 100000 barrels of 
heavy crude per day 
the project was built in the early 1980s on the assumption that 
oil prices would be between 40 and 80 per barrel earlier this 
year when oil prices dropped below 20 per barrel chevron 
officials said the partners would have lost money on every barrel 
produced and the company took a 445 million writedown against 
its fourthquarter 1989 profits 
however chevron officials said that bringing in any amount of 
cash from the point arguello project would help defray its costs
