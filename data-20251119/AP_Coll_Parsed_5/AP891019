a throng of gate crashers trampled spectators and 
nearly brought the roof of the dilapidated moscow conservatory 
crashing down in their desperation to hear the italian opera

the government newspaper gave no account of casualties however 
moscow police refused comment thursday evening and managers of the 
concert hall did not answer the telephone 
in an article headlined requiem one moment from tragedy 
izvestia said in its thursday editions that thousands of fans 
yearning to hear the la scala orchestra and chorus perform verdis 
requiem broke through a small cordon of police and rushed past 
the old women ushers into the hall trampling the bodies of fallen 
spectators 
a brawl erupted between the ticketholders and those without 
tickets claiming their seats pirate connoisseurs of bel canto 
it said 
the newspaper blamed the crowd of unruly spectators for the 
neartragedy but also noted that the downtown moscow conservatory

deadly roulette wheel it said

films youll never get rich and you were never lovelier in 
which the famous dancer starred 
she also seeks columbias accounting records regarding the 
films distribution 
mrs astaire alleges that since at least 1987 columbia has 
breached a contract under which astaire was to receive 5 percent of 
all net receipts in excess of 100000 up to 5000 and 10 percent 
of all net receipts in excess of 200000 
mrs astaires attorney joseph f hart said thursday his 
client does not know exactly how much money she is owed because

the first negotiations between the boeing co and 
union officials since nearly 60000 workers went on strike fizzled 
wednesday after only four hours and no new talks were scheduled 
both sides said 
boeing negotiators told the union through a federal mediator 
that they would not expand the economic package rejected by union 
members oct 3 but were willing to make adjustments within the 
framework of the original wage offer boeing said in a news 
release 
sounds like doubletalk said union spokesman jack daniels 
after the talks ended our people want more money and less 
overtime 
the talks were the first since oct 2 two days before the 
strike by members of the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers began 
daniels said machinists district lodge 751 members werent 
surprised by the lack of movement wednesday 
we figured after a couple of weeks of strike that the first 
meeting would have to serve as a door opener to successive 
meetings daniels said today the company was kind of doing its 
tough guy act 
the machinists represent about 57800 boeing workers nationwide 
including 43300 covered by district lodge 751 in the puget sound 
area 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and a few 
hundred others at scattered sites in california hawaii montana 
utah and other states 
asked if union members were feeling financial pressure tom 
baker president of district lodge 71 replied i would think the 
companys feeling the pressure pretty good since nobodys in there 
the airplane factories 
for boeing there have been growing reports of concern about 
delayed aircraft deliveries to malaysia airlines america west 
airlines and british airways boeing the worlds largest 
commercial airplane builder has delivered seven planes during the 
strike the company has refused to say how many planes it would 
have delivered normally 
eightyfive percent of the machinists voted to strike rather 
than take a threeyear contract with wage increases of 4 percent 3 
percent and 3 percent bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the 
first year and 3 percent the second costofliving boosts 
virtually matching inflation a cut in mandatory overtime to 160 
hours a quarter from 200 hours and higher benefits 
baker said a new offer would have to provide more money 
benefits and cuts in mandatory overtime 
an agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations at 
boeing and traditionally sets the standard for the nations 
aerospace industry

amnesty international says its concerned over the 
fate of about 40 east timorese reportedly arrested after a 
proindependence protest while pope john paul ii was visiting the 
former portuguese colony last week 
according to reports some of those detained have been 
subjected to illtreatment including electrical shocks by members 
of the indonesian security forces amnesty said in a statement 
issued in rome on wednesday 
amnesty international believes that in view of the consistent 
and recurrent pattern of torture and illtreatment of political 
detainees in east timor those now in detention may be in serious 
danger of illtreatment 
the londonbased human rights organization said the reports came 
from previously reliable church and journalism sources in east 
timor an indonesian territory and australia 
on oct 12 as the pope was finishing his blessing to a crowd of 
100000 people in dili capital of east timor about 20 young men 
shouting viva independence and viva il papa unfurled 
banners in front of the altar 
one banner read fretilin welcomes you in portuguese 
fretilin is the independence movement that has fought indonesian 
rule since annexation of east timor in 1976 
plainclothesmen flogged the demonstrators and seized their 
banners the crowd scattered and about 100 more young men joined 
the fray hurling chairs at policemen 
indonesian authorities made no announcement about arrests 
according to amnesty five east timorese who feared arrest 
reportedly took refuge at the home of roman catholic bishop carlos 
belo apostolic administrator of dili belo has criticized 
indonesias human rights record in east timor and called for a 
referendum to decide its political future 
the vatican was closed for the day and the chief spokesman 
joaquin navarro was not available for comment on the amnesty 
statement 
he expressed skepticism this week about a report in a portuguese 
weekly that some of those arrested had been executed

police said rescuers using dogs 
jackhammers and muscle found no survivors wednesday in the rubble 
of interstate 880 the elevated road turned into a giant concrete 
pancake and gnarled girders by the earthquake 
more than 250 rushhour commuters were feared buried in the 
section of the nimitz freeway which collapsed during tuesday 
evenings devestating 69magnitude quake 
seven bodies were recovered by midday and police said at least 
86 people still were reported missing 
at about 6 pm mayor lionel wilson was telling reporters that 
a search had found no survivors when police lt kristina wraa 
interrupted to say one had been discovered 
we have confirmed that there is one person alive apparently 
in a car underneath the top level wraa said adding that rescue 
workers had heard a voice and established physical contact with the 
victim 
that report was later dismissed as erroneous by oakland police 
capt jim hahn who attributed it to a garbled communication 
between officers 
there were noises coming from the area we have located 
several individuals none of whom are alive so there are no 
survivors at this point hahn said 
gov george deumejian claimed the collapse of i880 was the 
result of substandard construction although state transportation 
officials said the freeway one of the oldest in the area had been 
reinforced and was considered earthquakesafe however they said 
further upgrading had been planned 
rescue workers searched for victims in the twisted metal and 
concrete and used a concrete saw to cut throug cement to each 
automobile search dogs covered all but two sections of the 
collapsed freeway and found no survivors wraa said 
a helicopter brought in a remotecontrol backhoe late wednesday 
afternoon officials planned to shore up the freeway with steel and 
wood piles to protect workers from a possible aftershock 
the search was moving slowly and meticulously because the 
collapsed highway was like a house of cards that could crash 
down at any time kyle nelson of the california department of 
transportation said earlier 
shortly before dawn a hookandladder truck moved alongside the 
flattened section of i880 it stopped periodically to allow 
firefighters to shine bright lights into gaps between the 
northbound upper deck and the southbound lower deck 
screams and the crash of metal brought bystanders to the scene 
on tuesday 
you could hear it crunching down but you couldnt see 
anything it was just a big white cloud said witness leroy 
fitzgerald you could hear people screaming for help 
when the 18block stretch of highway caved in workers from 
businesses in the heavily industrial area ran to help many 
bringing tall ladders and forklifts 
rescuers were able to pull one man alive from a car that was 
crushed to a height of 18 inches said passerby patrick macintyre 
emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of another 
automobile the fate of her parents and brother was unknown 
a threemember surgical team had to amputate the right leg of a 
7yearold boy who was trapped in a car for seven hours at 1215 
am he finally was carried down a 20foot ladder and taken to an 
ambulance 
there were many heroes 
darius brewer a 26yearold cook joined an impromptu rescue 
party the group crawled as far as possible under the crushed road 
to help injured motorists they used crowbars to pry open one car 
and tied ropes around an elderly man to lower him 20 feet to safety 
then we went on top of the second deck and just mostly got 
everybody down we could he said people were yelling and 
screaming 
i880 was built in 1957 and was reinforced in 1977 in the first 
phase of a threephase antiearthquake program department of 
transportation officials said in the work the road deck was tied 
to its supporting columns 
the columns themselves collapsed and the deck did not slip off 
the columns transportation department chief engineer bill schaefer 
said in sacramento 
further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had been 
deferred pending an engineering study schaefer said 
asked whether the freeway had been considered safe from 
earthquakes schaefer said theres no such thing as an 
earthquakeproof structure but added he was shocked by the 
collapse 
we thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake 
we could have in this area anything that would happen in this 
area he told reporters 
deukmejian called for an investigation of the collapse i had 
assumed that the freeways were constructed with adequate 
standards so that they would be able to withstand a quake of this 
severity he said

just in time for halloween the oxford university 
press is publishing a dictionary of superstitions with 1500 
entries including stepping on cracks and knocking on wood 
moira tatum said she and coauthor iona opie found in seven 
years of research that many of todays superstitions are universal 
and harken back thousands of years beyond written history 
although we know it goes back 4000 years to nature worship 
the earliest written reference to knocking on wood is a 
19thcentury childrens game ms tatum said 
but the actual knocking on wood or touch wood as the 
british say to save oneself after saying a boastful thing 
originated in germany where they always knocked the underside of a 
table and said may i not be bewitched 
ms tatum said putting together 494 pages of superstitions cured 
any fears she had of bad omens after all that work i am totally 
converted from those pagan ways 
the superstition to avoid stepping on cracks dates back to the 
ancient greek mythological character persephone who was taken to 
the underworld by hades she said 
ms tatum said superstitions are especially common in tightly 
knit communities 
the small communities of seamen or miners in ireland or 
scotland are full of superstitions she said thats where you 
find the more obscure or arcane superstitions

hud programs said us attorney deborah daniels 
named in separate indictments were zionsville real estate agent 
joseph w cirillo and indianapolis businessman garry w newman a 
former hud official 
daniels said cirillo 37 made false statements to help 
applicants for lowincome housing assistance obtain hudinsured 
mortgages for properties for which cirillo was the broker 
once the loans were approved cirillos company received profits 
from the sale of the properties and brokerage fees the indictment 
said in each of seven cases the loans went into default costing 
the government about 200000 daniels said 
if convicted cirillo could face up to 19 years in prison and a 
fine of 2 million 
newman 36 is charged with embezzling 54425 from february

space shuttle atlantis soared into 
orbit wednesday and its astronauts started the galileo probe on a 
sixyear roundabout journey to jupiter for the closest look yet at 
the colossus of the solar system 
galileo is on its way to another world its in the hands of 
the best flight controllers in this world said atlantis 
commander don williams 
earlier concerns about galileos nuclear power supply were left 
behind as atlantis lifted off flawlessly on its mission to carry 
the 15 billion space probe into orbit on the first leg of its 
trip 
after atlantis had made five trips around the world galileo was 
ejected from the cargo bay by springs at 715 pm edt precisely 
on schedule over the gulf of mexico east of brownsville tex the 
shuttle quickly moved away to put distance between itself and the 
space probes rocket 
the burn was an hour later over borneo first for 2 
minutes then for a minute 45 seconds giving the 6700pound 
galileo the initial push toward venus its first planetary 
portofcall 
on time and on schedule said mission control 
it achieved earthescape velocity and is now heading outbound 
toward the sun said brian welch spokesman for johnson space 
center in houston a spacecraft can escape the earths gravity when 
traveling faster than 25000 mph 
the five astronauts spent their first hours in space giving a 
final electronic checkout to galileo a probe so sophisticated that 
one nasa official dubbed it the rollsroyce of spacecraft 
everything looks real good said astronaut shannon lucid a 
oneflight veteran from bethany okla who had charge of the probe 
deployment 
the crew members reported a few problems with their own ship as 
it orbited 184 miles above the earth one was with a cooling system 
that might cause them to have to return slightly earlier than 
planned in what a flight director called a worstcase scenario 
you looked marvelous going up mission control told williams 
as the winged spacecraft reached orbit after two launch 
postponements 
i feel a lot better said williams 
galileo named after the 17th century discoverer of jupiters 
moons will use the laws of physics to get to jupiter the largest 
planet in the solar system in 1995 flying by venus will cause it 
to gain momentum and so will two subsequent close encounters with 
earth 
although concern over the galileos 494pound plutonium power 
supply was argued in court it drew no protesters to the kennedy 
space center on launch day environmentalists had argued that a 
challengerlike accident could scatter deadly plutonium238 over 
florida 
nothing like that happened wednesday and even the weather 
cooperated clouds and rain threatened to halt the launch until the 
last minutes of the countdown but the clouds suddenly dissipated 
and the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky trailing a 700foot 
geyser of fire 
the 132ton atlantis has a crew of five for the mission that 
ends monday with a landing at edwards air force base in california 
at 238 pm edt 
the 15 billion mission already was seven years behind schedule 
when atlantis was grounded by rain at the last minute tuesday and 
by a faulty engine computer last week 
it feels great said nasa chief scientist lennard fisk after 
liftoff its been a long time 
apart from lucid williams crew consists of pilot mike mcculley 
and mission specialists ellen baker and franklin changdiaz 
the liftoff was the start of a voyage that will take the probe 
on a looping path past venus in february back to within 620 miles 
of earth in december 1990 and past earth again at a 200mile 
altitude two years later the craft will arrive at jupiter in 
deceber 1995 for a twoyear orbit 
as part of the mission a robot will separate from the galileo 
spacecraft and plunge through jupiters gaseous atmosphere 
scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of the solar 
system by studying jupiter which holds original material from that 
event 14 billion years ago the planets diameter is about 11 times 
that of earth and its mass 318 times greater 
the mission originally was to have started in 1982 but money 
ran out then came the challenger explosion in january 1986 
delaying all shuttle flights for three years and prompting a change 
in the rocket to propel the galileo 
the mission originally was budgeted at 425 million it will 
climb to 19 billion by the time galileo finishes a 10orbit trip 
around jupiter in 1997 
the sweeps past earth and venus will take advantage of the 
planets gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed 
to reach its distant target small onboard motors will finetune 
the flight path 
the galileos electricity will be generated by decaying 
radioactive pellets of plutonium238 which causes cancer and death 
in humans if inhaled in minuscule amounts 
environmental activists feared not only a launch accident but 
also mishaps during the two flybys nasa convinced a federal judge 
that the plutonium containers could withstand such pressures and 
that even if there were a release of radioactivity there would be 
no appreciable health effects 
the government had hundreds of experts in the launch area just 
in case to monitor any radioactive release 
more than 200 guards on foot in helicopters and boats patrolled 
the launch center for protesters who said they might try to stop 
the launch by infiltrating the launch zone and sitting on the 
launch pad 
weve succeeded in a small way calling attention to the 
escalating plan to put nuclear energy into space including in star 
wars said bruce gagnon of the florida coalition for peace and 
justice 
the real fundamental point is that people havent been doing 
much more than oooing and ahhhing at the launches they havent 
been considering the moral and ethical issues of what is in these 
things where they are going and what they are doing

and shaped like the state of alabama was unveiled wednesday at 
the local fairgrounds before 6000 people the country band 
alabama who hail from fort payne sang happy birthday 
ed henderson cut the cake with a sword and helped serve pieces 
gary gengozian editor and publisher of the local newspaper the 
times journal came up with the idea of baking the birthday cake 
because the earthgrains inc bakery is the towns largest employer 
with 750 workers 
he set a goal of topping a 90000pound cake baked in austin 
texas for the texas sesquicentennial in 1986 the guinness book of 
world records lists that cake as the heaviest ever made 
guinness approved construction plans for the fort payne cake but 
still must verify it as a record 
gary gilbert who supervised the baking of cake by earthgrains 
said it contained 33238 pounds of cake flour 21980 pounds of 
sugar 11799 pounds of corn syrup 608 pounds of vegetable oil 
161 pounds of vanilla flavoring 1206 pounds of baking powder 568 
gallons of powdered milk 19250 pounds of water and 429 pounds of 
salt 
the icing added another 33354 pounds of ingredients mostly

gets teased about being replaced by a dog in norman rockwells 
famous picture breaking home ties 
ive been razzed about this quite a bit said mrs 
mccormick 84 i knew that he changed the faces of the people in 
his portraits but this was a little drastic 
according to a rockwell exhibit at the old corner house the 
artist had initially envisioned both a grieving mother and a father 
in his 1954 painting of a young boy leaving home for the first 
time but only the father and son made the final version 
mrs mccormick said was delighted when her late husband joseph 
a groundskeeper at the stockbridge country club came home and told 
her that the artist wanted both of them to sit for the painting 
i was so excited mrs mccormick recalled i made a dress 
for the picture i told everybody we were going to be on the cover 
of the magazine 
the couple sat for several photos in rockwells studio with the 
artist himself playing the anxious son 
but when rockwell finally got around to painting he replaced 
mrs mccormick with a big collie 
she said one of her friends attempted to console her with the 
advice dont feel so badly dear its a beautiful dog

to higher ground i was 7 you didnt know where to run 
the memory of a stronger jolt didnt make tuesday any less 
terrifying mrs keating said 
i was sitting in a rocking chair it started to swing and 
sway finally it gave a big jolt like a ship on the sea she 
said 
she fell from the chair hurting her wrist fingers knee and 
leg her screams alerted the manager of the senior citizens 
apartment complex who helped carry her to her bed she spent the 
night without electricity in a dark frightening city 
it was horrifying she said every two hours an 
aftershock a fear a terrible feeling to think everything will be 
destroyed 
on wednesday morning her daughter jeanette williams and mrs 
williams husband took her into their home 30 miles northeast of 
san francisco to recover 
the daughter of immigrants from austria and hungary she was 1 
when her family moved from new yorks long island to san francisco

theaters here

openended richter scale was followed by an even more destructive 
fire the temblor was more than 10 times as powerful as tuesdays

earth and has gotten used to periodic earthquakes but when 
tuesdays quake began she said i said to myself this has gone 
too far

need to pick up some helicopters light 
armored vehicles and tank ammunition for your countrys defense 
the easy answer is onestop shopping military style with the 
association of the united states army 
with the blessing of the defense department the association is 
holding its annual meeting this week featuring the customary 
bigname speakers such as former defense secretary frank c 
carlucci and information panels on topics like soviet forces and 
national security 
the main attraction however is the approximately 200 defense 
industry and army exhibits on every imaginable aspect of weaponry 
the exhibits reflect the latest in military doctrine 
technological advances and hardware improvements says the 
association which has held what it touts as the largest 
landpower forum in the free world for the past 35 years 
among the items on exhibit in the bowels of a washington hotel 
were a fullscale light armored vehicle a handful of howitzers and 
several hightech videos promoting helicopters m16 machine guns 
and nightvision goggles 
beribboned officers freshfaced cadets and defense industry 
officials created traffic jams as they grabbed glossy brochures 
closely examined the rifles and handguns and questioned the 
hundreds of company representatives 
some sat transfixed as they watched a sophisticated video on the 
lhx helicopter displayed on 16 television monitors it was a 
combination of james bond and top gun 
time to smell the coffee sucker said the helicopter pilot 
as he maneuvered his aircraft through mountain ranges and green 
valleys and located his target with the help of a britishsounding 
female voice 
have a nice walk home ivan the pilot said after a 
successful hit 
but beyond all the glitz there was serious business as 
officials from general motors mcdonnell douglas general electric 
itt defense and john deere briefed representatives from foreign 
countries and the united states on their latest wares 
for the buyer who cant afford to fly from one company to the 
next the meeting provides a great place for networking in a 
marketing environment said joe obrien an official with general 
motors as he stood in front of the companys 14 12ton light 
armored vehicle equipped with a 25mm gun 
the meeting according to obrien is strictly for the buyer who 
wants to browse 
no contracts we dont even talk about contracts if we did 
the defense secretary could not endorse it he said those 
types of things are verboten 
instead the companies tout the advantages and successes of 
their products with the hope that a telephone call or meeting at a 
later date will result in a sale 
general motors light armored vehicle is ideal for lowintensity 
conflicts and in fact 14 of them were flown into panama when the 
rebel forces led a failed coup against leader manuel antonio 
noriega according to the general motors official 
the vehicle has great acceleration a low silhouette when 
its smaller its harder to hit great mobility obrien said 
like in a car showroom where prospective buyers kick the tires 
people have come up and knocked their knuckles on the vehicle and 
said oh boy this is it he said 
on the other side of the room in front of a large video screen 
representatives of bell helicopter textron praised the v22 osprey 
the aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but flies like a 
plane 
defense secretary dick cheney in his budget for the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 proposed killing the program the move was met 
with opposition on capitol hill where the marine corps aircraft 
enjoys a great deal of popularity 
house and senate conferees hammering out a final defense bill 
have not yet reached a decision on the aircraft but dick spivey of 
bell helicopter textron is convinced the osprey is key to the 
nations defense 
noriega may be here in jail now if we had the v22 the 
company official said

her in a new london show to star gertrude lawrence lets face 
it who stays in paris miss welch asked 
she sang porters solomon in nymph errant in london in 
1933 and sang it at weill recital hall on wednesday her voice 
wavered on the title word which is held long and on the exposed 
long lines of september song her voice wavered again somehow 
in an endearing way 
the singer made the cabaret staple miss otis regrets 
unusually amusing she said of helen morgan songs seemed to come 
from her inner depths she had a great sadness about her she 
sang a jerome kern specialty of miss morgans why was i born 
and made it strong but not very sad

a drug that improves the success of kidney 
transplants also helps reduce medical bills by shortening the 
length of hospital stays according to a study published today 
among patients receiving new kidneys hospital bills totaled an 
average of 28649 for those receiving the antirejection drug 
cyclosporine and 37895 for those who did not a 24 percent 
difference according to the study 
patients receiving the drug were discharged from the hospital in 
three weeks rather than five according to research directed by 
jonathan showstack at the university of california san francisco 
the drug keeps the body from rejecting the foreign organ the 
study said the medicine improved the chances of a successful kidney 
transplant from 60 percent to 80 percent 
the research published in the new england journal of medicine 
was based on studies of 702 patients who received transplants 
between 1982 and 1986 the period during which cyclosporine became 
widely available 
doctors from the university of pittsburgh meanwhile said 
wednesday a new drug code named fk506 appears to be even more 
effective and less toxic than cyclosporine dr thomas e starzl 
who pioneered the use of cyclosporine said the new drug could make 
transplants cheaper still by speeding recovery and reducing the 
need for tests 
in a separate report in the journal dr catherine c cowie of 
social amp scientific systems in bethesda md directed a study 
showing that black people with diabetes are more likely than whites 
with the disease to suffer kidney failure 
diabetes is the underlying cause of about onequarter of all 
cases of kidney failure in the united states and blacks are about 
three times more likely than whites to have diabetic kidney 
failure however it was unclear whether this was simply because 
blacks are more likely to get diabetes 
the new study based on 470 blacks and 861 whites in michigan 
found that the incidence of diabetic kidney failure was 26 times 
higher among blacks even when their higher prevalence of diabetes 
was taken into account 
an accompanying editorial by dr stephen g rostand of the 
university of alabama said the increased risk may result in part 
from racial differences in kidney function however better control 
of blood sugar and blood pressure could improve blacks chances of 
escaping kidney failure

the house ethics committee says rep jim 
bates dcalif could face house disciplinary action if he repeats 
harassment of female staffers or permits any more campaign 
activities in his office 
bates was informed by the committee wednesday that he violated a 
house rule prohibiting sexual harassment and an ethics guideline 
barring campaign work in a congressional office 
your improper conduct and concurrent violations of relevant 
standards deserve reproval the fourterm san diego democrat was 
told in a letter from committee chairman julian c dixon dcalif 
and ranking republican john t myers of indiana 
the panel declined to recommend disciplinary action by the full 
house which could range from a reprimand to expulsion in the most 
extreme cases 
but the committee warned bates that any further violation by 
you in the areas which were the subject of the inquiry may 
result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered 
by the house 
the panel began a preliminary inquiry against bates after a 
complaint last october by two women who had worked in his 
congressional office 
the women who had left bates office before filing their 
complaint said he sexually harassed them while they were employees 
and pressured congressional staffers to do campaign work 
the committee acknowledged bates has apologized to anyone who 
may have been offended by his personal conduct but deemed that 
action insufficient 
bates was directed to write the women karen dryden and dorena 
bertussi apologizing for behavior which was sexual harassment 
copies of which should be provided to this committee 
bates told reporters he allowed a campaign employee to make 
fundraising calls from his office and later hired the worker for 
the congressional staff 
bates told reporters 
i accept the committees judgment he said adding times 
are changing members of congress are going to be scrutinized for 
their personal and professional behavior 
sexual harassment is very serious and not to be taken lightly 
i did not know what sexual harassment meant until this came up 
the rule cited by the committee states a member officer or 
employee of the house of representatives shall not discharge or 
refuse to hire any individual or otherwise discriminate against 
any individual with respect to compensation terms conditions or 
privileges of employment because of such individuals race color 
religion sex or national origin 
the ethics committees manual for members states official 
allowances may not be used to defray any personal political or 
campaignrelated expenses

the new longrange trade pact with canada 
should help boost consumer demand for fresh vegetables on both 
sides of the border perhaps by 25 percent overall says 
agriculture department economist amy sparks 
the uscanada free trade agreement which took effect last 
jan 1 removes many trade restrictions between the two countries 
a major benefit down the road will be the elimination of all 
agricultural tariffs within 10 years 
sparks who works for the departments economic research 
service took a look at the trade agreements impact on vegetables 
her findings are reported in a forthcoming issue of farmline 
magazine 
why focus on vegetables when there are other larger and more 
glamorous export commodities such as grains and meat to study 
everybody asks that question sparks said wednesday in a 
telephone interview dont feel that i take it personally 
but something totally different had to be found for her 
doctoral dissertation and vegetables were it she said 
also international trade in vegetables is growing quite a 
bit sparks said while its not one of our major crops like 
soybeans or corn its growing in importance and is something that 
needs to be looked at 
the united states and canada are each others largest export 
markets overall the report said more than 18 percent of last 
years total us imports were from canada while almost 22 percent 
of all us exports went to canada 
but agriculture makes up only a small portion of us trade with 
canada the report said and of the us agricultural export total 
only about 5 percent went to canada in the 1980s 
according to the departments foreign agricultural service 
canada imports around 3 billion in us agricultural products 
annually including an average of about 450 million worth of 
vegetables and 650 million worth of fruit 
the usda forecasts 198990 agricultural exports to canada at a 
value of 22 billion but adds that in recent years these figures 
have been underreported by an estimated 1 billion annually 
and is officially recognized by both governments 
agricultural imports from canada in 198990 are forecast at 
about 28 billion according to current usda figures 
the departments official estimate of total us agricultural 
export value in the year that began oct 1 is 40 billion japan is 
the biggest singlecountry market at 81 billion followed by the 
soviet union 35 billion south korea 25 billion mexico 24 
billion and canada 22 billion 
with the complete elimination of tariffs us demand for 
canadian vegetables would increase about 80 percent from todays 
levels and canadian demand for us vegetable would go up 30 
percent according to sparks study

the share of commodity marketings by farm 
cooperatives has declined from levels of the early 1980s according 
to an agriculture department report 
in 1987 the most recent year examined coops accounted for 25 
percent of farm marketings down from 27 percent in 1985 and 28

grain marketings by cooperatives were reported at 29 percent of 
the total down from 33 percent in 1985 and 36 percent in 1982 
that includes sales of oilseeds except for cottonseed 
much of the decline has been the result of less cooperative 
involvement in grain and oilseeds marketing the report by the 
departments agricultural cooperative service said wednesday 
the coop share of milk marketed was 76 percent in 1987 
compared with 78 percent in 1985 and 77 percent in 1982 cotton 
marketings were 38 percent 33 percent and 36 percent 
respectively and livestock at 7 percent 8 percent and 11 percent 
fruit and vegetable marketings by coops accounted for 23 
percent of the total in 1987 up from 8 percent in 1985 and 11 
percent in 1982 
cooperative shares of production supplies sold to farmers also 
dropped by similar percentages to 25 percent in 1987 from 27 
percent in 1985 and 28 percent in 1982 the report said however 
not all items declined accordingly 
supplies included fertilizer 43 percent of the total in 1987 
44 percent in 1985 and 42 percent in 1982 petroleum 37 percent 
44 percent and 36 percent farm chemicals 28 percent 29 percent

the powerful earthquake that jolted the san 
francisco bay area forced a holiday on tens of thousands of people 
who poured into the rubblelittered streets to gawk at natures 
might 
amid the balmy weather that encouraged throngs clad mostly in 
shorts and tshirts there were scenes of devastation and others 
like the soup line of 1000 outside glide memorial church in the 
seedy tenderloin district emblematic of more permanent 
misfortunes 
the disaster brought out the spectator in many but others 
pitched in to help the homeless and distraught 
this is an incredible coming together an act of the brotherly 
love that san franciscans were famous for in the 60s 
selfdescribed exhippie chuck rosen said as he helped people 
clear rubble from a collapsed building 
the dawn of a flaming sun colored through wisps of fog in the 
hills east of san francisco painted streets in rose tones as 
residents and hundreds of stranded visitors awoke a day after the 
quake unsure of what awaited them 
thousands arose from a night in emergency shelters hundreds 
more from makeshift tents in city parks and rural lots most had 
spent more than 12 hours without heat or light 
but the vast majority of the regions 6 million residents made 
it through the night in largely undisturbed comfort as they 
mingled on the streets by the hundreds in cities ranging from the 
pacific coastal community of santa cruz to oakland they became a 
portrait of contrasts 
in san franciscos golden gate park joggers huffed in the 
bright highnoon sun temperatures reached the high 70s by late 
afternoon a couple walked their two dogs a lone man sunbathed on 
a knoll near the towering band shell 
while sprinklers in the welltodo marina district saturated 
expansive manicured lawns many residents of collapsed sections of 
the neighborhood were forced into a red cross shelter where they 
quickly ran out of water a mendocino water company donated a 
truckload of bottled water 
the traditional daily crowd of tattered homeless people at 
tenderloin churches was swelled by hundreds of elderly hotel 
dwellers and southeast asian refugee families they came to the 
church hoping to eat their first meal since the quake 
the marina at the northern end of the city inside the golden 
gate is renowned for its narrow curving streets with such names 
as alhambra cervantes and mallorca the streets are lined with 
neat handsome homes and apartments most finished with 
lightcolored stucco and many with tile roofs 
but the area built on fill land was the hardest hit of san 
franciscos neighborhoods 
on wednesday it contained scenes like this next to the 
crumpled charred rubble of a threestory apartment complex an 
elderly woman gingerly dusted a delicate crystal lamp 
a helicopter tour of the bay area beginning at daybreak revealed 
billowing smoke pouring from a block of the marina nearly flattened 
by a fire that broke out after the quake two joggers ran by 
trying to step over firehoses without breaking stride 
the grand sandstone structure of the palace of fine arts built 
for the 1915 panamapacific international exposition was draped in 
smoke from the devastated buildings two blocks away the 
neighborhood of bungalows and victorians looked as if a giant 
invading creature had taken two steps and then turned back 
the silver strand of the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
gracefully cut through the foggy haze marred only by lines of 
orange hazard cones blocking traffic 
a collapsed 50foot section of the upper level looked like 
nothing more than one pasteboard in a fallen house of cards on 
either side of the bridge the greenandyellow pennants of the 
oakland athletics and the blackandorange of the san francisco 
giants flapped at each other in the light morning breeze with no 
motorists to cheer them on 
on the oakland side of the bridge a collapsed section of 
interstate 880 looked like it had melted in a scorching sun on the 
nearby beaches of alameda scores of sun bathers took advantage of 
canceled school or work 
at santa cruz the historic boardwalk amusement park was 
spotless but without visitors while hundreds of people stood in 
blocklong lines at the few supermarkets open to the public in a 
city largely devoid of power and potable water

the senate is scheduled to vote nov 3 on a bill that would 
exempt north from the penalty which was imposed after he was 
convicted july 5 on charges of shredding government documents and 
two other felonies north is appealing the convictions 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said 
he will draft a report for the full senate that outlines the 
arguments on both sides of the politically divisive issue 
weve got to solve this thing weve got to make this thing 
square for everybody biden told reporters after a hearing on 
wednesday on the matter 
biden suggested lawmakers should deal not just with norths 
case but with the pension rights of any federal official 
including members of congress convicted of a felony 
norths retirement pay was 23000 a year he is reportedly 
getting 25000 for each speech he gets on the lecture circuit 
the law under which the pay was revoked provides that anyone 
convicted of shredding protected government documents shall 
forfeit his office 
the general accounting office which has jurisdiction over 
federal pay matters ruled norths status as a retired military 
officer came under that provision of the law and that forfeiting 
his office meant he no longer qualified for retirement pay 
some conservatives who view north as a hero who bore the brunt 
of blame for the irancontra scandal were outraged at the decision 
hatch sen charles grassley riowa and sen strom thurmond 
rsc have said the retirement pay should be restored 
but sen howard metzenbaum dohio said norths sentence was 
too lenient and the gao was right to deny him retirement pay we 
are sending the wrong message when people violate the public trust 
and get off with only a slap on the wrist he said 
legal scholars told the judiciary panel congress should answer 
whether the law meant for office to include military positions 
technically military retirement pay is not a pension based on past 
service but a reduced salary for an officer who continues to hold a 
commission and remains subject to recall to active duty 
north very well may be entitled to his pension biden said 
whatever we do there should be a basic equity with other cases 
but he acknowledged its not going to be divorced from 
politics

two men convicted in alaskas longest 
and costliest criminal trial for a conspiracy to wring millions 
from a billiondollar arctic construction binge have been sentenced 
to seven years in prison 
lobbyist lewis dischner and businessman carl mathisen also will 
forfeit more than 11 million as a result of their convictions 
earlier this year on extortion racketeering and fraud charges 
the advisers to former north slope borough mayor eugene brower 
pocketed millions in kickbacks and sent construction contracts to 
companies they secretly owned prosecutors said the construction 
program was aimed at providing 20th century comforts for the 
nations northernmost communities 
any mistakes ive made im really sorry dischner said 
wednesday before he was sentenced i hope i havent hurt 
anybody 
mathisen stopped short of apologizing saying if they the 
jury were right and i was wrong then im truly sorry 
former alaska us attorney mike spaan urged us district judge 
james fitzgerald to sentence each defendant to 15 years in prison 
he said the stiff sentence might deter other wouldbe whitecollar 
criminals 
spaan said he was pleased with the sentences adding i think 
the judge tempered the sentence with mercy 
dischners lawyer douglas pope had asked that his 71yearold 
client receive a threeyear sentence to be served at a 
minimumsecurity prison 
a 15year sentence as we all know and we should not kid 
ourselves is a death sentence for lewis dischner he said 
laurence finegold mathisens lawyer asked that his client 
receive probation because of his poor health or that he serve his 
term at his home 
but fitzgerald said he considered dischners age and mathisens 
medical condition which includes a heart ailment and ulcers when 
fashioning their sentences he recommended that the two serve their 
terms in a minimumsecurity prison 
he said he did not order restitution because it would have cost 
the government too much and taken too long to determine how much 
the two owed the borough the judge said the borough could pursue 
payment through the courts 
dischner a democratic activist and labor commissioner in former 
gov bill egans administration was convicted may 22 on 21 counts 
including racketeering extortion and wire and mail fraud the 
jury acquitted him on four income tax counts 
mathisen 56 a businessman with close ties to the north slope 
dating back to the early 1970s was convicted on 22 counts 
dischner and mathisen each received seven years on a pair of 
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy counts and five years 
each on the other counts fitzgerald ordered all terms to run 
concurrently 
the federal racketeering statute under which the two were 
convicted allows the government to seek forfeiture of money and 
property obtained illegally that would require a second trial but 
the two waived their right to another day in court 
dischner agreed to forfeit 58 million mathisen 57 million 
prosecutors said dischner and mathisen used lavish gifts to 
manipulate brower who pleaded guilty to tax evasion in exchange 
for his testimony brower was sentenced to 30 days in jail and 
fined 5000 
prosecutors said payments to dischner and mathisen added 73 
million to the minnesotasized boroughs billiondollar building 
boom they said the two men pocketed 21 million while brower was 
mayor from 1981 to 1984

the president of the federation of american 
scientists says the bush administration is violating the law by 
providing military supplies and advisers to allies of the khmer 
rouge 
jeremy stone at a news conference wednesday said the khmer 
rouge is still run by pol pot who killed 2 million cambodians when 
he controlled the country from 1975 until 1978 these people are 
beyond the nazis he said 
stone who met last month with thai leaders said thailand may 
be prepared to reduce its support to the khmer rouge and indonesia 
and malaysia two other members of the association of southeast 
asian nations are not in favor of the old line against 
cambodian prime minister hun sen 
we should support hun sen as the main bulwark against the 
khmer rouge stone said 
secretary of state james a baker iii at a peace conference in 
august in paris supported an interim role for the khmer rouge in 
the transition to a new government in cambodia but the conference 
collapsed and stone warned the fighting is likely to increase with 
the onset of the dry season 
we think that the department of state has to confront the 
chinese government publicly over its support of the khmer rouge 
stone said we fear president bush is taking his interest in 
maintaining good relations with the chinese too seriously the 
chinese are oppressing democracy in china 
stone said vietnamese troops that backed hun sen have left 
cambodia and the soviets will cease their support of the government 
if the united states and china stopped assisting a threeway 
coalition of troops loyal to prince sihanouk the khmer rouge and 
son senn 
stone said asean still formally supports a hard line against hun 
sen because it prefers unanimity on foreign policy issues 
but he said the frontline state of thailand has invited 
hu senn to bangkok three times and met with him in friendly fashion 
and exchanged friendly messages the indonesian and malaysian 
governments are not in favor of the old line of freezing out the 
hun sen government the unanimity of asean on this issue is no 
longer real and it is something the us government has to 
recognize 
thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan is due to visit 
washington nov 1416 for talks with bush and baker 
stone said the bush administration violated the foreign aid 
authorization bill by providing military advisers uniforms and 
other supplies to sihanouk forces and by helping son senn in his 
forays into cambodia 
the us government is supporting the khmer rouge in violation 
of the law he said we say we are not supporting the khmer 
rouge we say we are only supporting sihanouk and son senn but 
they are in a coalition with the khmer rouge to support part of a 
coalition with the khmer rouge is to support the khmer rouge

panamas roman catholic leaders are 
becoming increasingly vocal in challenging strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega even at the risk of seeing some priests expelled 
from the country 
the latest sign of troubled relations between church and state 
involved the deportation tuesday of sister elsa marie schaus the 
peruvianborn principal of a catholic girls school 
sister schaus who had lived in panama for 26 years was told by 
immigration officials she was being expelled for state security 
reasons and for her own safety 
some church officials also said officials mentioned problems in 
her treatment of the daughters of government and military officials 
whatever the reason there is no relationship between a matter 
of school discipline and the expulsion from the country of the 
schools director said the rev fernando guardia vicar of the 
panama city archdiocese 
the churchs relations with the government have been prickly 
since the early 1970s 
in 1971 the rev hector gallego a colombian priest 
disappeared while organizing peasants in western santiago de 
veraguas province church officials say he was slain and blame the 
defense forces which noriega now commands 
most church schools have traditionally served middle and 
upperclass civilian families where opposition to noriega is 
concentrated 
however growing numbers of affluent military and government 
officials have been sending their children to these schools in 
recent years 
making matters more complex 220 of panamas 297 catholic 
priests and 424 of its 482 nuns are foreigners mostly from europe 
government and military officials are in many cases especially wary 
of the foreign clery 
the government regards the church as an enemy said guardia 
because of the large number of foreign priests it is a direct 
threat to the church when the government threatens to expel the 
foreign priests 
however guardia said the church will not be deterred in its 
campaign against noriega even though sister schaus expulsion 
would seem to indicate the beginning of another campaign against 
the church 
but the church will continue its campaign to make people aware 
of their diginity as human beings of their human rights because 
the gospel is a message of liberation he added 
noriega has been cracking down on his opponents since federal 
grand juries in florida indicted him on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges february 1988 
he survived a second military coup attempt on oct 3 and has 
renewed efforts to eliminate opposition and consolidate power 
noriega has been closing down opposition news media and canceled 
may 7 national elections when the returns showed that opposition 
presidential candidate guillermo endara was winning by a 31 
landslide 
panorama catolico the panama city diocese weekly newspaper is 
the only opposition medium left in the country it is sold at 
churches every sunday 
last week it printed in a black box on the front page a prayer 
for the dead the wounded and their families it was a clear 
reference to the rebels from the latest attempted coup 10 of whom 
were killed 
and in a letter in panorama on sept 17 the nations bishops 
noted with sadness that the peoples will expressed in the 
presidential elections has been ignored and the problems of our 
people get worse every day 
archbishop marcos mcgrath then angered the governmentcontrolled 
news media with an article deploring institutionalized violence 
and the violation of human rights he urged a dialogue 
between the countrys political forces 
government newspapers and radio have been calling mcgrath a 
servant of the rich and contrasting him to noriega who is extolled 
as a religious man and friend of the poor

commerce secretary robert mosbacher says 
mexico is leading the way among latin american nations trying to 
strengthen their economies and assume a greater role in world trade 
he told a senate banking subcommittee on wednesday the 
administration has high hopes mexico will be the first olive out 
of the jar in a succession of latin economic successes and said 
the longrange goal perhaps in 20 years should be a western 
hemisphere with no trade barriers 
mosbacher said informal talks have already been held with 
mexican officials about working toward a free trade arrangement 
similar to what the united states has with canada 
they are cautious he said we should not push them too 
hard too fast but they are interested very interested 
mosbacher told the senate banking international finance and 
monetary policy subcommittee that mexicos new political leadership 
is highly energetic and has taken significant steps to set a new 
economic course 
he said the nations inflation rate has fallen to an annualized 
rate of about 13 percent in the past few months and debt relief 
agreements worked out with world lenders have freed up money for 
domestic investments that are spurring the economy 
he called mexicos economic progress the best evidence that the 
plan treasury secretary nicholas brady outlined for restructuring 
third world debt can work 
i agree the brady plan will not work by itself but its part 
of the puzzle he said in response to skepticism from several 
democratic committee members 
mosbacher said a willingness by american businesses to put 
longterm investments into latin america is a key part of 
administrations strategy in the region 
despite the discouragement of the debt problem he said 
we are seeing our major competitors making large new investments 
in latin america particularly south america and putting together 
very competitive packages to capture major projects in sectors 
where we have traditionally been preeminent 
mosbacher said japan is being particularly aggressive in moving 
into chiles mining sector and venezuelas aluminum industry 
france is pushing hard in telecommunications in brazil and italy is 
moving aggressively in argentina he said 
these moves suggest that other industrial countries are taking 
the long view looking ahead to a brighter economic situation in 
south america said mosbacher

the governments latest report on poverty 
shows the gap between rich and poor is widening as the wealthy reap 
a disproportionate share of the nations record peacetime 
expansion advocates for the poor say 
the poverty rate fell from 134 percent in 1987 to 131 percent 
last year and the number of impoverished people declined from 323 
million to 319 million the census bureau reported wednesday but 
it said neither change was big enough to be statistically 
significant 
robert greenstein of the private center on budget and policy 
priorities said the report provides disturbing evidence of the 
unevenness of the economic recovery 
its economic benefits are disproportionately going to those at 
the top of the income spectrum and missing many at the bottom he 
said 
the poorest fifth of the population received 46 percent of 
total national family income in 1988 the lowest percentage since 
1954 while the richest fifth received 44 percent the highest ever 
recorded he said 
the census bureau however chose to highlight a 17 percent 
jump in real per capita income last year to a new high of 13120 
blacks made bigger gains than whites but still lagged far behind 
income for whites rose 15 percent to 13900 income for blacks 
increased 39 percent to 8270 and the figure for hispanics was 
virtually unchanged at 7960 
its a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or 
improved said william butz the agencys associate director for 
demographics 
greenstein said the per capita income figures are averages that 
were pulled up by big gains for the richest americans he said 
median household income showed no significant gains overall 
registering 27230 in 1988 up from 27140 a year earlier after 
adjusting for the rise in consumer prices 
diana pearce director of the nonprofit women and poverty 
project said the census report contained troubling new evidence 
that women are being left behind for example she said 53 percent 
of poor families in 1988 were headed by women alone the highest 
proportion on record 
we are once again experiencing the feminization of poverty 
she said 
the annual release of the poverty report once again revived the 
debate over the accuracy of the census bureaus figures 
the conservative heritage foundation said census overstates the 
extent of poverty and underestimates the financial wellbeing of 
millions of americans 
the 1988 census data though still deficient thus show steady 
and significant improvement for most americans said kate walsh 
obeirne a visiting fellow at heritage 
census for the first time this year issued an alternative set of 
poverty figures based on an experimental price index that it said 
was more accurate 
the alternate numbers published in an appendix to the official 
report would cut the poverty rate for 1988 by 15 percentage 
points to 116 percent and reduce by 36 million the number of 
people classified as living in poverty 
the congressional joint economic committee criticized those 
alternate figures as inaccurate and issued a report saying if the 
poverty rate were calculated by what it said were more realistic 
methods the figures would be far higher 
for example while the official census figure for 1987 was 135 
percent two better methods of calculation would have put the 
poverty rate at 161 percent or 241 percent in 1987 the committee 
said 
this study indicates poverty is not declining rather more 
americans are poor today than at any time since the 1960s the 
committee said in a statement

new tests show widespread contamination of 
private homes in eight states with cancercausing radon gas the 
environmental protection agency says in urging all homeowners to 
test for the gas 
radon is one of the most serious environmental health problems 
today epa administrator william k reilly said wednesday 
radon can really be found anywhere 
radon contamination is said to cause as many as 20000 lung 
cancer deaths year second only to the number caused by smoking 
the agency released test results showing that in eight states 
about onefourth of 11000 randomly tested homes had radon readings 
considered unhealthy nearly three of four homes tested in iowa had 
significant radon readings 
the results mirrored findings over the last two years in 17 
other states overall said the epa about onefourth of the 37000 
homes tested in 25 states so far have shown unhealthy indoor radon 
levels 
radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally 
by the decay of uranium in soil and rocks while levels found 
outdoors normally pose no health concerns concentrations of 4 
picocuries per liter of air indoors are considered unhealthy 
among the 25 states iowa was found to have the most widespread 
radon problem seventyone percent of the 1381 homes tested had 
more than 4 picocuries per liter and 8 percent showed more than 20 
picocuries per liter 
reilly estimated that as many as 10 million homes may have 
yearround average radon levels that exceed 4 picocuries per liter 
of air so far only 2 million homes have been tested for the gas 
in an effort to boost radon testing the epa and the advertising 
council announced a national public service advertising campaign to 
warn about the dangers from radon and urge testing of all homes 
ruth wooden the councils president said research conducted in 
connection with the ad campaign showed that even when people are 
aware of a potential radon health problem they are reluctant to 
test a survey of 1000 people showed twothirds believe radon to 
be a health concern but only 14 percent said they plan to do 
anything about it 
people believe they are safe in their homes she said 
radon often seeps into a house through cracks and foundation 
openings the epa estimates that correcting the problem is often 
relatively simple perhaps as easy as creating additional venting 
of the gas to the outside 
test kits cost about 20 and corrective action normally costs 
from 200 to 1500 according to the epa 
the latest tests covered iowa georgia maine new mexico ohio 
west virginia vermont and alaska as well as three indian health 
service regions aberdeen in north dakota south dakota iowa and 
nebraska bemidji in michigan minnesota and wisconsin and 
albuquerque in colorado and new mexico 
here are the percentages of homes found with radon levels of 
more than 4 picocuries per liter iowa 71 percent maine 30 
percent ohio 29 percent new mexico 23 percent west virginia 
and vermont 16 percent georgia and alaska 8 percent 
results in the indian health service regions aberdeen 35 
percent bemidji 20 percent albuquerque 17 percent 
a year ago 46 percent of the homes tested in minnesota and 63 
percent of those in north dakota exceeded the epa guideline for 
healthy air 
ten locations this year showed radon above 100 picocuries per 
liter of air which according to epa is equivalent to more than 
2000 chest xrays each year or smoking four packs of cigarettes a 
day 
the highest reading was at a house on the lower brule indian 
reservation in south dakota 316 picocuries per liter

angolan anticommunist rebel leader jonas 
savimbi says he believes the truce with angolas leftist government 
can be revived within the next two weeks even though a ceasefire 
attempt four months ago was unsuccessful 
savimbi also said in a telephone interview wednesday from the 
ivory coast that a mutual prisoner exchange with the angolan 
government is possible 
after reaching a high point last june the angolan peace process 
has been bogged down by a resumption of fighting between government 
and rebel forces as well as disagreements between savimbi and 
zairean president mobutu sese seko the chief peace mediator 
savimbi also angered his principal foreign patron the united 
states when he declined to attend talks last month designed to 
reinstate the ceasefire which had been agreed to last june 
on wednesday savimbi sounded upbeat following his weekend talks 
in france with mobutu and his earlier discussions in washington 
with president bush at one point recently savimbi was concerned 
that mobutu had abandoned impartiality and was siding with the 
angolan government 
savimbi made no reference wednesday to a resumption of direct 
talks with the angolan government but said he was optimistic a 
ceasefire could be back on track during this month of october 
he raised the possibility that some african nations might 
contribute troops to monitor the ceasefire if it is revived 
but even if a truce is agreed to the mpla government and unita 
face the challenging task of reaching a political settlement with 
us support unita is calling for free and fair elections to be a 
key ingredient of the peace process 
the angolan government has a much narrower view of national 
reconciliation insisting the existing constitution remain 
unchanged 
but savimbi said recent statements by senior angolan officials 
suggest a more flexible attitude on reconciliation 
they are not so intransigent as they were before said 
savimbi who stopped off in the ivory coast while en route to his 
home base in rebelheld southeast angola 
discussing the possibility of a prisoner exchange savimbi said 
there are between 3000 and 5000 mpla prisoners in unita hands he 
said the government has refused to disclose the number of rebel 
prisoners it holds 
while the government receives substantial backing from the 
soviet union unita has been getting about 40 million annually 
from the united states unita has been at war with the mpla 
government for 14 years

even as residents of northern california 
begin the process of rebuilding scientists are launching research 
efforts in hopes of learning something from tuesdays earthquake to 
help them warn people the next time 
and there will be a next time scientists can predict that and 
say approximately where the tremor will strike 
its when that troubles them 
the loma prieta area where tuesdays quake was focused for 
example was singled out as a region where a quake was considered 
likely but scientists couldnt pin down the time except to say 
sometime between 1988 and 2018 
like weather forecasters a century ago geologists today look at 
what has happened in the past and try to use that information to 
predict what will come in the future 
but while todays weather satellites allow meteorologists a 
birdseye view of the approaching weather geologists still 
struggle to analyze events miles below the land surface 
its difficult to make shortterm predictions of 
earthquakes admitted robert wesson chief of the office of 
earthquakes volcanoes and engineering at the us geological 
survey 
i would say there was a successful longterm prediction of 
this quake he said pointing out the survey report issued last 
year 
unfortunately we didnt have any warning of this earthquake 
last night said wesson 
really we dont know how to make shortterm predictions of 
earthquakes either little ones or big ones he admitted 
sometimes smaller shocks foreshadow a major quake and that may 
have happened in this case too 
the region had remained relatively quiet for several years 
until a quake estimated at 51 on the richter scale occurred on 
june 27 1988 and another rated at 52 struck on aug 8 of this 
year 
those events prompted the agency to pay increased attention to 
the loma prieta region and to notify california officials wesson 
said but little could be done beyond that because there was no way 
to tell if the tremors were foreshocks or just individual quakes on 
their own 
using historical records of quakes measurements of ground 
motion and other analyses scientists are able to single out places 
where they believe tremors will strike much as they were able to 
predict that the mount st helens volcano would erupt but not 
when 
such predictions are not useful in evacuating dangerous 
buildings but they are useful in land use planning and resource 
allocation in anticipation of future events said wesson 
dave russ assistant chief geologist at the survey explained 
that quakes occurring along faults in the earth release stress that 
builds up over time when this movement releases stress in one area 
the strain can be increased in other spots but whether that would 
induce major quakes in those areas cannot be predicted he said 
a strong quake does trigger thousands of smaller aftershocks as 
the many rocks along the fault line adjust themselves and there 
remains the chance of strong aftershocks he said 
russ said officials are looking for any unusual 
characteristics in their studies of the quake measured by 
sensitive equipment that calculates the movement of land changes 
in the strain on rocks and uplift of the earth among other things 
they hope their findings will help them understand and thus 
predict future quakes

atlantis astronauts are trying 
their hands at cinematography growing corn and photographing 
lightning as they orbit earth 
the crew completed its main task about six hours after the 
shuttle soared into orbit wednesday dispatching the galileo probe 
riding in its cargo bay on a sixyear journey to jupiter 
during their fiveday mission the astronauts will be busy 
completing several new experiments and some that were conducted on 
earlier shuttles 
one experiment will measure sections of the earths protective 
ozone layer with an instrument that calculates the amount of solar 
irradiance from the sun and how much irradiance is scattered back 
never reaching the earth 
that information will be compared to data taken by nearly 
identical instruments on three satellites researchers want to 
calibrate data from the satellites with measurements taken on the 
shuttle said michael braukas a spokesman for nasas goddard space 
flight center in greenbelt md 
theyre curious to see whether or not the readings from the 
satellites are true braukas said nasa plans to fly the 
experiment on several more shuttle flights 
ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the suns harmful 
ultraviolet radiation when the ozone layer is intact it prevents 
damaging levels of ultraviolet radiation from reaching earth 
atlantis five astronauts also planned to monitor corn seedlings 
in four special canisters as part of an experiment aimed at 
determining how gravity affects developing plants the plants were 
to be frozen after four days of growth and then studied on earth 
researchers hope the experiment one day will help them devise 
ways to grow food in space and improve crops on earth 
astronauts plan to conduct several more experiments including 
testing the effects of microgravity on three materials 
polyethylene nylong and a polymer blend when they are heated and 
then cooled 
placing purified water on two copper plates to see how crystals 
develop in microgravity and at what temperature they form the 
experiment is designed to learn more about how ice forms and better 
determine development of clouds and weather conditions 
tracy l peters 25 a physics student at the university of 
california berkeley designed the experiment he was a high school 
senior in walnut creek calif when his experiment was among the 
student projects selected by the national aeronautics and space 
administration to fly on shuttle missions its nice to see it 
finally getting ready to go peters said 
photographing lightning at night researchers hope the 
experiment will lead to better understanding of lightning systems 
and possibly learning more about predicting the weather 
using the powerful imax camera to take footage for two planned 
films called exploring the blue planet and to the stars 
imax film taken on three previous flights was used in one film 
about shuttle missions for the giantscreen theaters around the 
world 
several medical experiments also were to be conducted including 
measuring the natural radiation background of the atmosphere said 
patrick air force base spokesman capt dave thurston

parents trying to ban a childrens book 
about witches lack a sense of humor british author roald dahl said 
dahls book the witches should be removed from the library 
at broadwater elementary school in billings because it refers to 
witches parents sue and monte mutschler said wednesday 
the fact is that there are such things as witches they are 
part of the satanic church monte mutschler said 
this book is a fantasy and an enormous joke dahl responded 
in a telephone interview from his home in england we all know 
that witches dont exist not the way ive written about them they 
are parents without any sense of humor at all 
dahl the author of several popular childrens books including 
charlie and the chocolate factory which was made into the 
movie willie wonka and the chocolate factory suggested that 
the school district let the children help decide the books fate in 
the school library 
the last chap i heard of who banned books was hitler dahl 
said the banning of any book you know especially a childrens 
book is unforgivable 
jim strecker the schools principal said he will head a 
committee of educators to consider removing the witches from 
the school library 
the book has been used in the school for several years without 
complaints strecker said adding that dahl is wellknown and 
this particular book is widely read 
the witches published in 1983 is being made into a movie 
by muppets creator jim henson dahl said 
the effort to ban the book comes a week after parents in 
maryland and texas urged school officials to limit observance of 
halloween because they said the holiday is linked to devil worship 
several maryland school officials canceled traditional halloween 
costume parties opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations 
instead while officials in that state and texas said they would 
take a look at the role of halloween in the schools

federal disaster officials said they 
would not siphon off hurricane hugo relief to help the san 
francisco area and charleston showed its sympathy to earthquake 
victims by sending a planeload of water 
we are in the process of recovering from a disaster so we 
will feel what is occurring there more deeply than any community in

hurricane was heartwarming and reminded him of his pledge that 
if ever another community in the united states was hit with a 
disaster we would want to respond he set up a california 
earthquake disaster relief fund to raise money for earthquake 
victims 
the air force c141 transport that left wednesday carrying 
potable water also carried police chief reuben greenberg and 
several charleston police officers to help with emergency 
operations in california 
hugo smashed into charleston with 135 mph winds on sept 21 
prompting a nationwide outpouring of supplies and food for disaster 
victims 
riley just returned from the san francisco bay area where he 
attended the first two games of the world series 
officials of the federal emergency management agency meanwhile

of the agencys operations in south carolina 
coordinating officer paul hall said the 11 billion earmarked 
by congress for the hugo recovery will be replenished as needed to 
address other disasters 
they must have learned some lessons said sen ernest 
hollings dsc a critic of the fema response in south carolina 
he said fema responded quickly to the earthquake 
i just hope for one thing they wont take two weeks to 
declare it a 100 percent disaster area he said

the center for population options says massive 
public education and prevention programs are imperative to stem the 
rapid spread of aids among teenagers 
the center said schools churches community organizations and 
parents must do a better job correcting misinformation about aids 
helping teenagers delay sexual intercourse ensuring that those 
who do have sex use condoms and warning teenagers about the 
dangers of drug use 
our children have a right to straightforward accurate 
information about hiv infection and how to prevent it said a 
report issued wednesday by the nonprofit educational center the 
center is partially funded by the centers for disease control 
the number of aids cases among teenagers jumped by 43 percent 
to 398 between july 1988 and july 1989 according to the cdc 
but because the time between infection and the onset of aids can 
be as long as 10 years public health officials believe that many 
people with aids who are now in their 20s may have picked up the 
virus when they were teenagers

development is seeking to recover about 700000 from a former 
reagan campaign adviser and his partners in a georgia project and 
also has a dispute with the group over another development

lung disease and even lung cancer 
inspector donald white of nassau county police department said

put it in an area which they thought could hurt someone

tuesday at the county police headquarters and an underground 
emergency operations center behind police headquarters 
no problems had been found in the ventilation rooms when they 
were checked by the same engineer on routine rounds 24 hours

guerrilla leader jonas savimbi says 
he is ready to resume negotiations with angolas marxist government 
and hopes a new ceasefire can be signed within a month 
we are ready to talk anywhere he said wednesday in a 
telephone interview during a stop in abidjan i think the 
ceasefire will be signed this month because the mood is good 
he said his side wants the new truce to include monitors 
provided by other african countries and release of all prisoners 
through the international red cross 
the guerrilla chief who has us support said he was in 
abidjan to brief president felix houphouetboigny on weekend talks 
in france with president mobutu sese seko of zaire savimbi leads 
the national union for the total independence of angola known as 
unita 
mobutu has mediated negotiations toward ending the 14yearold 
war in the former portuguese colony and was host for four days of 
talks on the french riviera with angolan south african and us 
officials 
he negotiated a ceasefire in the conflict between unita and the 
ruling popular movement for the liberation of angola known as the 
mpla during a meeting june 22 at his home village of gbadolite 
but it broke down within days 
savimbi subsequently rejected mobutus mediation accusing the 
zairean leader of siding with the angolan government he refused to 
attend a meeting of african heads of state last month in kinshasa 
capital of zaire aimed at reviving the negotiations 
at issue were the claim of several african leaders that savimbi 
had agreed to go into exile and the integration of his guerrillas 
into angolas armed forces savimbi said no such an agreement 
which he described as a defeat had been made at gbadolite 
the united states which has supported mobutus government 
despite criticizing his human rights record was caught between two 
allies 
some congressional supporters of savimbi said mobutu the main 
conduit of 40 million in annual us aid to unita had blocked the 
flow of weapons 
after the kinshasa meeting mobutu savimbi and angolan 
officials went to the united states where president bush met 
separately with mobutu and the guerrilla leader urging new 
negotiations 
the french riviera meeting was held a few days later and savimbi 
declared wednesday it was a success 
president mobutu has reassured us that the basis of our work 
in negotiations will be and will remain the gbadolite agreement 
he said 
so we are reconciled on that savimbi said he has been 
our friend in the past and i think we can consider our relations 
with him very good and we have renewed our confidence in him as a 
mediator 
mobutu has said recent interviews in which foreign minister 
pedro van dunem loy of angola said savimbi should discuss the 
issues of exile and integration were encouraging 
savimbi said wednesday when they mpla say exile has to be 
discussed good i think they are coming along mobutu has also 
said once the ceasefire is signed the rest of the political 
problem will be discussed by unita and the mpla face to face 
because it is an angolan problem others should be called in only 
if we have problems

the strongest typhoon to strike the 
philippines this year lashed the east coast of luzon island today 
with 127 mph winds after residents of areas in its path were told 
to seek higher ground 
advance winds from typhoon elsie struck land at midday near 
casiguran 130 miles north of manila and the center of the storm 
was expected to come ashore a few hours later according to the 
manila weather bureau 
storm warnings were issued for all of luzon the main 
philippines island and at us military installations 
any typhoon of this strength is capable of massive 
destruction said forecaster vicente manalo 
elsies westward path would take it across the rugged mountains 
of northeastern luzon and across the northcentral agricultural 
heartland about 100 miles north of the capital 
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage but 
manila radio stations said they received sketchy reports of 
flooding and landslides in the north 
manila radio station dzxl said its affiliate in bayombong 
capital of nueva vizcaya province 130 miles to the north was 
knocked off the air by a power failure 
us officials said all six american military installations on 
luzon had been placed on maximum typhoon alert 
us air force forecasters predicted the storm would pass about 
50 miles north of clark air base but near the us john hay air 
station in baguio 130 miles north of manila 
the storm was reported moving about 12 mph and was expected to 
weaken as it crossed the sierra madre mountains of northeastern 
luzon 
philippine airlines canceled flights from manila to northern 
luzon and the coast guard ordered ships to stay in port in the 
affected area 
us air force officials said some jets had been moved to air 
bases in japan and south korea until the storm passed 
the far east network which broadcasts to the 40000member us 
military community advised residents at clark john hay and the 
usrun wallace air station to stock up on fresh water 
flashlights candles and other emergency equipment 
residents at the usrun subic bay naval base 50 miles 
northwest of manila were also advised to take precautions 
base spokesman lt cmdr kevin mukri said there were relatively 
few warships in port so were not going to have a very big exodus 
if the conditions worsen 
the navy routinely sends warships into the south china sea when 
storms threaten subic 
elsie was the third major storm to strike the philippines in two 
weeks 
typhoon dan hit manila and southern luzon on oct 10 killing at 
least 59 people on oct 6 typhoon angela killed at least 119 
people in northern luzon 
an average of 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the 
philippines annually elsie was the 17th of 1989

near the crest of california street jane 
and richard springwater watched the marina district burn fearing 
their young children might be wandering in the stricken area 
the emotional trial of the springwaters was just one of many in 
the bay area quake catastrophe but their story shares a common 
thread with all families who struggled to find each other across a 
disrupted urban landscape 
you could see large plumes of smoke coming from the marina 
richard said wednesday i tend to look on the bright side but it 
didnt look good we knew something catastrophic had happened 
there 
said jane for our childrens babysitter tuesday is usually 
the day they go down to the marina and my mom had said earlier in 
the day they were going but i had no idea if my kids were in a 
car if they were walking 
not until we reached nob hill could we see the smoke she 
said and it looked bad it looked like a huge fire 
like many working couples the springwaters were at their 
offices away from their children when the quake struck tuesday 
evening 
jane a 33yearold attorney sat at her 39thfloor desk as the 
shock wave rumbled through 
for a moment or two she said she thought only of moving away 
from her window into the hall 
and then all i could think of was oh my god my kids i 
have no idea where my kids are 
but she had a clue on tuesdays benjamin 4 and hannah 1 
usually went to the marina with their babysitter and their 
grandmother visiting from new york said that that was where they 
were going to go tuesday 
i called my husband as soon as the quake hit his receptionist 
picked up the line i asked for him and the lines went dead 
with no link to her family jane turned to the trickle of news 
reports on radio and television they were sketchy but one thing 
seemed pretty clear the marina was taking a beating the area was 
devastated by fire 
richard 37 worked in his office five blocks from janes in the 
financial district 
since im an architect i went into the elevator core he 
said 
the area between elevators is a buildings most solid component 
he said i dont really trust buildings 
i wasnt worried about the marina though he said recalling 
his feelings when hearing on the radio that the district was 
flattened i didnt know the kids were in the marina 
the springwaters had talked a lot about putting together an 
earthquake contingency plan but they never quite worked out the 
details 
so richard started walking moving past dazed disoriented 
financial district regulars shuffling along on the sidewalk jane 
didnt show up at the front of her building the elevators werent 
operating so he opened the door and started up 39 floors 
his wife already was well on her way down the same escape route 
had i left 10 minutes earlier he would have climbed 39 floors 
to find i wasnt there she said 
jane shared her fears about their children 
benjamin hannah and gramma had left the marina just minutes 
before the quake though to go shopping 
in fact they scarcely knew they were in the middle of the 
seconddeadliest quake in us history 
when the springwaters arrived at their pacific heights 
neighborhood two hours after the initial jolt everything looked 
perfect 
their centuryold house a survivor of the 1906 catastrophe 
stood in place brick for brick 
when i got home and opened the door jane said everyone 
was there they had eaten dinner and my son was excited that there 
were no lights

even while asserting it seeks no confrontation 
with israel the bush administration is accusing prime minister 
yitzhak shamir of hampering mideast peace efforts with unhelpful 
and disappointing remarks 
meanwhile in another development a us official said plo 
chairman yasser arafat had sent word to the state department that 
he did not intend to apply for a visa to attend a un general 
assembly debate next month on the middle east 
intermediaries had informed arafat that seeking entry would be 
controversial and then word came back that he did not intend to 
ask for a visa said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the reagan administration last year denied arafat a visa and the 
united nations responded by moving its middle east discussion to 
geneva switzerland 
since then the united states has opened talks with the plo 
fourteen plo officials were permitted to attend the un general 
assembly session this fall 
chastising shamir from the state department press room podium 
us officials insisted their overriding goal was to arrange talks 
between israel and palestinian arabs 
that effort is running into roadblocks in jerusalem and also 
within the palestine liberation organization which rejects it 
outright 
in a speech delivered wednesday night to a gathering of 
fundamentalist christians in jerusalem shamir again went on the 
offensive this is our land from the dawn of history and it will 
be so always he said we will not be pushed or pressured 
the prime minister in a closed meeting tuesday with legislators 
from his likud political coalition said israel might be entering 
a period of tension with the united states israel radio reported 
he also said the battle is hard its a miracle that thus far 
we have held our own against the world where no element supports 
our position 
shamir again rejected secretary of state james a baker iiis 
attempt to arrange negotiations between israelis and palestinians 
in cairo prior to holding elections shamir said the meeting would 
be a trap to make israel slide into recognition of a palestinian 
state 
the prime minister also was quoted as saying israel was without 
friends in the united states 
bakers spokeswoman margaret tutwiler described that remark as 
ludicrous and added the united states and israel are good 
friends and good allies and have been for many many years and 
thats very well known 
asked about shamirs other remarks the spokeswoman read this 
prepared statement 
weve said all along that all sides should refrain from 
statements that make it harder to advance the peace process the 
statement he made yesterday was unhelpful and we are disappointed 
we are not looking for a fight or a confrontation with israel 
everyone knows that our only purpose is to help the government of 
israel to advance its own peace initiative 
however ms tutwiler said that baker did not mention shamirs 
criticism of us strategy once during a long telephone 
conversation with israeli foreign minister moshe arens 
if this was such a burning issue with secretary baker it 
seems to me it would have been the first thing he brought up this 
morning on the phone tutwiler said i am telling you it did 
not come up once 
ms tutwiler also had some criticism for the plo whose central 
council on monday rejected bakers fivepoint plan for 
israelipalestinian talks farouk kaddoumi head of the plos 
political department was quoted on tuesday as saying the us 
stance did not reflect a serious move toward a just settlement in 
the region 
if palestinians want to participate they must find a way to 
engage practically in a dialogue with israel statements out of 
baghdad also were unhelpful the spokeswoman said

up to volunteer they established medical help as soon as 
possible eade said i didnt see one instance of a citizen 
that didnt cooperate 
west oakland has a bad image as a dope haven but there was a 
lot of community effort said richard reynolds a car repair shop

mcelroy estimated they evacuated 40 to 50 people off the 
highway twentyone were injured and had to be taken off on gurneys 
reynolds said the community where former black panther leader 
huey newton was slain recently has suffered from a bad reputation 
theyve got a lot of good people who are trapped here by their

china today called the selection of dissident 
fang lizhi for the 1989 robert f kennedy memorial human rights 
award a provocation against the chinese people and wanton 
interference in chinas internal affairs 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing at a weekly briefing 
said the 53yearold astrophysicist is a criminal wanted by the 
chinese public security organs and the award represents open 
support to fang lizhis criminal activities aimed at subverting the 
legal chinese government 
li said we express our utmost regret and strong indignation 
at this fallacious decision 
fang was chinas bestknown and most eloquent advocate of 
democratic reform before the june military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement silenced all dissent 
shortly after the military shot their way to studentoccupied 
tiananmen square on june 34 fang and his wife physicist and 
political activist li shuxian sought refuge in the us embassy 
where they remain today 
although fang and his wife did not take an active role in the 
student movement this spring the government has accused them of 
inciting counterrevolution and demanded that the united states turn 
them over to police 
the award announced in washington on wednesday honored fang 
for his commitment to speaking out against injustice and tyranny 
at grave personal risk

the soil conditions landuse patterns and 
construction quality of an area often have more bearing on the 
deadliness of an earthquake than the proximity of the quakes 
epicenter 
that lesson was demonstrated again during the catastrophic quake 
that struck the san francisco bay area tuesday with a magnitude of 
69 on the richter scale geologists and engineers said wednesday 
the oakland freeway that collapsed killing an estimated 250 
people was 50 miles from the center of the quake by contrast 
some places just a few miles from the epicenter were hardly scathed 
damage was relatively light and casualties were few in san jose 
only 18 miles north of the center and in santa cruz a scant 10 
miles south of the epicenter only a few deaths were reported 
despite extensive damage 
santa cruz experienced the kind of damage it did because it 
was in the earthquake epicentral area said ronald scott a civil 
engineering professor at the california institute of technology in 
pasadena 
but there isnt a big nimitz freeway running through santa 
cruz the biggest concentration of large structures is around san 
francisco 
tuesdays quake was the same magnitude as the quake that ravaged 
soviet armenia last december the armenian quake killed at least 
25000 people more than 90 times the number of deaths reported in 
the bay area by early today 
the major difference in toll is a result of better design and 
construction in california us geological survey officials said 
generally the intensity of ground shaking is strongest near the 
epicenter which explains why many buildings and roads collapsed in 
santa cruz watsonville los gatos and hollister 
san jose may have escaped catastrophic damage because much of 
the city sits on stream deposits somewhat firmer than bay mud and 
fill said geologist douglas hamilton president of earth sciences 
associates a palo alto consulting firm 
but the severe damage to the freeway and the marina district of 
san francisco near the waters edge seems to mainly be a 
function of ground conditions either artificially filled ground or 
not very stable natural deposits around the margins of the bay 
hamilton said 
the nimitz freeway built in 1957 a more primitive period of 
earthquake design apparently rests on soft fill and bay mud 
which produces more of a rolling effect that goes on longer than 
bedrock which shakes at high frequencies short sharp jolts 
scott said 
the catastrophic earthquakes centered on mexicos pacific coast 
in 1985 caused the worst damage and most of the 4000plus deaths 
in mexico city which rests on soft sediments of an old lakebed 250 
miles from the epicenter 
the change in seismic waves as they spread from a fault along 
with softer soils give the waves longer vibration periods scott 
said that can make them more damaging to large structures such 
as the nimitz freeway or the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
which had a 50foot section collapse than to small ones

a jury found two oklahoma lawmen innocent 
of charges they plotted to kidnap and torture a suspected drug 
dealer to obtain evidence on drug laboratories 
jurors returned the verdicts wednesday for love county okla 
sheriff wesley liddell jr and his soninlaw roger ray hilton a 
marietta okla police officer 
liddell who suspended himself after his arrest by fbi agents on 
may 18 said he will return to work today 
i just voluntarily unsuspended myself said liddell 47 
the officers were accused of conspiring to abduct pearl 
sonny cornett and torture him to obtain evidence on drug 
laboratories in southern oklahoma and northern texas 
oklahoma state sen darryl roberts who represented hilton 27 
said several jurors had indicated to him they had felt all along 
the governments case was weak 
the trial was a circus from the very beginning there was not 
enough evidence said juror rebecca ray 
assistant us attorney hs bert garcia said the jurys 
verdict was based in part on the fact that in this case no one 
was tortured or hurt or harmed 
during the trial defense lawyers claimed liddell and hilton 
were framed by marietta police lt tom hankins the prosecutions 
lead witness they said hankins wanted liddells job hankins has 
denied the claim 
hilton testified that the kidnapping plot was a hoax devised by 
liddell to see if hankins would leak the information to drug 
dealers 
the fbi taped nine hours of conversations between the defendants 
and hankins through a wiring device attached to hankins the jury 
heard a condensed threehour version

his arrest in texas 
arlan seidon 59 repossessed the elephants after a dispute with 
two men who bought them from him seidon claimed the buyers 
mistreated the animals and fell behind on their payments 
i dont think im crazy seidon said wednesday in an 
interview from jail in jefferson texas broadcast on television 
station wwor in secaucus its a very serious thing 
seidon was arrested tuesday on a fugitive warrant after one of 
the men richard drake tracked him down drake has said he has 
spent thousands of dollars searching for seidon around the country 
seidon told wwor he would not fight extradition back to monmouth 
county nj where he faces charges of thirddegree theft if 
convicted he would face up to five years in prison and a 100000 
fine 
seidon sold the indian elephants tory and duchess to drakes 
son edward in 1981 for 80000 the drakes owned a nowclosed

drakes fell behind in their payments he also said that while 
waiting for money from the drakes at a new jersey farm he 
discovered the animals had wounds from hooks used during training 
the drakes denied abusing the animals 
a monmouth county judge in may 1984 ordered seidon to return the 
7foottall elephants instead seidon fled with them in a truck 
and has hid them ever since 
he pursued an appeal through telephone contacts with new jersey 
lawyer isabelle strauss an animalrights activist but the state 
appeals court rebuffed seidon in january saying he failed to show 
the animals had been abused and provided no reason to believe the 
court had erred in 1984 
seidon has said he raised the animals now in their late 20s 
from their infancy he told a newspaper in 1988 that he left his 
fordland mo farm and his career preparing animals for circus and 
television appearances to care for the elephants which eat about 
200 pounds of hay a day he also said he hadnt seen his four 
children or met his only grandson since he took off with the 
animals 
the elephants are in a barn in texas the drakes are trying to 
have them returned to new jersey

budget cuts in a demonstration that grew unruly when several 
hundred students tried to enter the statehouse and blocked an 
entrance 
many students wore dunce caps that read state skool and 
chanted no more cuts many urged legislators to support new 
taxes to pay for education 
capitol police capt dennis sullivan said four were arrested 
two for assault and battery and two others for disorderly conduct 
sullivan said a window was broken and a drainpipe knocked down 
and officials estimated repairs could total 20000 
the higher education system already strapped by earlier cuts 
faces an additional 25 million in trimming during the next round 
of budget reductions 
state police cpl joseph howley estimated the number of 
demonstrators to be 15000 
one person was removed from the house when he repeatedly yelled 
down from the visitors gallery to ask house speaker george 
keverian if he intended to discuss the cuts 
the statehouse lawns flower beds were trampled and more than 
100 state boston capitol and metropolitan district commission 
police closed the front entrances and patrolled the halls 
from his chair keverian asked members to remain in the chamber 
called in police reinforcements and addressed a large gathering of 
students outside 
everything that is being done here is not helpful and is in 
fact disgraceful he said trampling down doors breaking the 
law and breaking windows is not what we expect from our young 
people and will not be helpful to you 
higher education chancellor franklyn jenifer board of regents 
chairman paul tsongas gov michael s dukakis education aide 
robert schwartz and others came to counsel the students to remain 
orderly 
students swarmed over the capitol steps carrying signs that 
read stop killing my college and we want mikey one simply 
read arrrgh other students paraded with a coffin 
the protesters began to disperse after they were informed their 
buses were leaving but one man made a dash for the house lobby 
door state police arrested him and pushed through the crowd to 
take him away 
about 200 students had gathered in front of dukakis office 
earlier in the day and schwartz spoke to the group 
the fact of the matter is that we with you believe no more 
cuts is exactly the right thing schwartz told them 
the students were divided on whether to believe the 
administration and some loudly jeered schwartz 
no more lies one young man yelled 
schwartz pressed on telling the students they had to convince 
legislators and voters that new taxes were needed to pay for higher 
education and other state programs this cannot be a oneday 
rally he said 
dukakis who was out of the building throughout the afternoon 
said he was pleased by the students show of solidarity but not by 
the rowdy behavior

more than 50 lawsuits have been filed 
against the owner of a softdrink delivery truck that ran a red 
light and knocked a school bus into a waterfilled pit last month 
killing 21 students and injuring 59 
families of victims survivors and students who came to the 
crash scene shortly after the sept 21 accident in alton seek 
unspecified damages from valley cocacola bottling co the trucks 
driver also was named in some of the suits 
the driver had told authorities the trucks brakes failed before 
it struck the bus carrying mission high school students sending it 
over a 40foot cliff into a roadside pit but the national 
transportation safety board concluded the trucks brakes worked 
well enough to halt it at the stop sign 
some of the lawsuits accuse the company of conscious 
indifference for the rights and wellbeing of the public 
a lawyer designated as spokesman for lawyers representing valley 
cocacola was not in his office wednesday and did not return a 
phone call by the associated press 
families for at least 15 of the 21 dead students are represented 
in the lawsuits other claims were filed on behalf of survivors 
and at least five were filed on behalf of students who said they 
suffered mental anguish after arriving at the scene and seeing 
their friends and relatives drowning 
one suit states that normalinda perez was at the scene of the 
accident in question and observed the bus under the water in the 
pit as her daughter veronica perez still trapped in the bus 
drowned 
most of the cases are consolidated in 275th district court in 
edinburg others have been filed in three of the other state 
district courts in hidalgo county where alton 15 miles from the 
mexico border is located 
one survivors family accused a lawyer of trying to bribe them 
with 700 to keep him on their case the family of 12yearold nora 
manriquez which hired san antonio lawyer roberto guerra on oct 4 
but chose to hire another lawyer oct 9 last week filed for a 
temporary restraining order to prevent guerra from contacting them 
guerra said wednesday the 700 was a loan the manriquez family 
had asked him to provide and he speculated they were unhappy 
because he did so a day late 
if thats what they are calling a bribe well you know i hope 
my side gets heard guerra said its a lot more sensational to 
say an attorney offered a bribe to pursue a fat case than to say he 
honored a commitment on an advance no ruling has been issued on 
the restraining order

two air force security guards pleaded 
guilty to stealing f16 jet engines and selling them to undercover 
fbi agents 
prosecutors said the airmen at hill air force base agreed to 
sell pratt amp whitney f100pw200 engines to fbi agents posing as 
operators of a mock military surplus store 
the arrests were part of operation punchout a threeyear 
undercover investigation that eventually should result in charges 
against more than 100 people according to us attorney dee benson 
the sting involving the air force pentagon and fbi was 
based out of a mock military surplus store in the town of roy 35 
miles north of salt lake city 
airman 1st class brian david roth 22 of chesterland ohio 
pleaded guilty wednesday to five of 22 counts alleging theft of the 
three engines and other military equipment from the northern utah 
base 
senior airman danny joe stroud 24 of newton kan pleaded 
guilty to one count of stealing the engines 
the two who authorities said began selling the stolen goods in 
1987 were arrested july 10 
under the plea arrangement another count charging stroud with 
the theft of 64000 worth of computers and the remaining 17 
charges against roth are to be dropped when the pair are sentenced 
dec 12 
strouds wife kimberly 22 also is charged with stealing the 
engines but assistant us attorney bruce lubeck said the charge 
likely would be dropped 
benson said the mens sentences would depend in part on the 
value of the engines a matter that would be settled at an 
evidentiary hearing 
the penalty for each of the theft counts is up to 10 years in 
prison and a 250000 fine 
two sergeants have been acquitted of theft charges in 
courtsmartial four other enlisted men are awaiting trial and 
prosecutors are deciding whether another man will be tried hill 
spokesman len barry said

solution to the war but he refrained from directly blaming a 
particular sector 
representatives of the government and the rebels on wednesday 
wound up three days of peace talks in costa rica the talks

both electrical generators failed on a 
northwest airlines dc9 forcing it to land at a small airport an 
investigator said the darkened jet skidded about 1000 feet off 
the runway and into a muddy field 
none of the 104 people aboard was seriously hurt in the 
emergency landing at unattended monte vista municipal airport in 
the mountains of southern colorado early wednesday 
the cabin filled with smoke after the landing and a crew member 
had to use an ax to hack open a window and relieve cabin pressure 
so the doors could open northwest spokesman kevin whalen said 
the pilot suffered minor cuts and bruises and one of the 99 
passengers was treated at a hospital for shock and minor injuries 
officials said flight 109 had been flying from minneapolis to 
phoenix 
after landing the pilot used a pay telephone to summon help 
the jets left generator apparently failed in flight late 
tuesday and the pilot tried unsuccessfully to start the auxiliary 
power unit said bob johnson the national transportation safety 
boards regional director in denver 
the right generator failed soon afterward johnson said and the 
plane was left with battery backup power which would have lasted 
only 25 minutes 
passengers said there was no panic even though the captain 
could not talk with them over the intercom 
we didnt have any warnings said passenger tina borgmann 
24 of waseca minn all we were told is fasten our seatbelts and 
put our trays in an upright position 
i just kept thinking whats next is this thing going to 
catch fire said arlene sevilla of milwaukee who held her 
monthold daughter 
then we hit the ground and i just hugged my daughter closer 
and thought here we go 
passenger todd curtis 28 of thatcher ariz said when the 
tires blew the rims just sort of dug into the pavement and slowed 
us down i was afraid that we were going to start cartwheeling but 
the runway was apparently soft enough that the wheels just dug in 
the runway at monte vista is 6000 feet long johnson said 
under ideal conditions that would be acceptable but in an 
emergency situation its marginal the investigator said 
judy sciola a 49yearold passenger from edina minn said 
that after the plane landed the pressure was just awful the 
little baby next to me was just screaming 
after the crew managed to open the door the pilot found a pay 
telephone to summon help 
there we were in the middle of a field sciola said we 
wandered around these buildings and there was a pay phone the 
pilot called and said excuse me weve landed out here in this 
field and were going to need some emergency vehicles 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons would not release the pilots 
name saying company policy prohibits releasing crew names unless 
there is a fatality 
compliment that captain curtis said 
aside from the broken cabin window the only apparent damage to 
the plane was flat tires said johnson airline officials said they 
did not immediately know the cause of the generator malfunction

parliament today legalized opposition 
parties and banned political organizing in the workplace a 
further move toward making a westernstyle democracy of a country 
under communist rule for 41 years 
legislators voted to banish parties from the shop and factory 
floor despite opposition from the ruling socialist party 
at a congress last week that dissolved the communist party and 
replaced it with the socialist party that embraced democracy 
delegates overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the right to 
organize party cells in the workplace 
under authoritarian communist rule such organizing has allowed 
the ruling party to maintain political control over industry it 
was thus vigorously opposed by newly created opposition groups that 
are preparing for hungarys first free national elections since the 
communists consolidated power in 1948 
the law passed today also seeks to define what the socialist 
party owns by drawing the line between legally acquired funds and 
property and other assets its marxistleninist predecessor merely 
control or may have seized illegally 
the political opposition claims much of the partys wealth was 
seized illegally after 1948 
under communist rule the party had controlled the government 
at least in theory the new law opens the way for people who 
contend the government stole their property to seek its return 
the socialist party which claims to embrace democratic ideals 
but remains in power at least until the national elections agreed 
wednesday to discuss the disposal of some of its wealth with 
parliament and the government 
constitutional amendments laying down the right of political 
parties to be freely established and to freely function 
were approved wednesday 
but the party law passed during a nationally televised session 
today is more specific formally outlining those rights as the 
country prepares for next years multiparty elections 
legislators approved some sections of the party law separately 
with 279 voting for a ban on parties at the workplace 44 against 
and 12 abstaining 
the section specifying socialist party assets was approved by 
259 parliamentarians with 44 against and 27 abstentions 
some present did not vote accounting for the different totals 
the bill is specifically geared to political parties wishing to 
field candidates in the upcoming elections it specifies for 
example that no party may accept contributions from a foreign 
state 
among other legislation enacted today was a law creating a 
supreme court 
on wednesday parliament established the office of president of 
the republic who will replace the 21man collective presidency 
but the parliament sidestepped a controversy over when and how the 
president would be elected 
the current arrangement calls for the president to be chosen in 
a direct election for which nov 26 is the tentative date 
opposition forces are calling for a delay until after the 
parliamentary elections that are to be held by june and want the 
new parliament where the opposition hopes for an overall majority 
to choose the president 
the opposition fears the ruling party would be at an advantage 
if the elections are held next month that it will not have enough 
time to organize an effective campaign 
parliament has not acted on a petition calling for a referendum 
on when to hold the election

striking boeing machinists say the aerospace 
giants latest offer is no better than the contract they rejected 
before walking out oct 4 and theyre holding out for a better 
economic package 
the first postwalkout talks between boeing co and 
representatives of 58700 workers in the international association 
of machinists and aerospace workers union fizzled wednesday just 
four hours after they began 
through a federal mediator boeing negotiators told the union 
they would not expand the economic package union members rejected 
oct 3 but were willing to make adjustments within the framework 
of the original wage offer the company said in a statement 
they might be willing to move the numbers around a little bit 
but thats not what its all about said tom baker president of 
iam district lodge 751 its about improvement 
any further talks will be scheduled by federal mediator douglas 
hammond he said he will maintain contact with both sides daily 
but he held out little hope for an immediate resolution 
if the parties continue to agree to disagree theres nothing i 
can do about it hammond said 
the talks were the first since oct 2 two days before iam 
members struck to press for a bigger share of boeings record 
profits 
boeing chief negotiator larry mckean on wednesday defended the 
companys wage offer as fair equitable and the best threeyear 
offer in recent american industry history 
the machinists voted 85 percent to strike rather than take a 
contract with annual wage increases of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 
percent bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 
percent the second costofliving boosts virtually matching 
inflation a cut in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from 
200 hours and higher benefits 
baker said boeings unwillingness to budge didnt surprise the 
strikers and he viewed the brief meeting as just a start 
well take it a day at a time he said adding he planned to 
join the picket line today thats where the fight will be won 
on the picket line 
rather than rush to a settlement baker added union negotiators 
planned to move cautiously to avoid a second rejection vote that 
could leave both sides more entrenched 
the machinists represent 43300 boeing workers in the puget 
sound area 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and a 
few hundred others at scattered sites in california hawaii 
montana utah and other states 
for boeing there have been growing reports of concern about 
delayed aircraft deliveries to malaysia airlines america west 
airlines and british airways boeing has delivered seven planes 
during the strike 
an agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations at 
boeing the worlds largest commercial airplane builder and 
traditionally sets the standard for the nations aerospace industry

president bush said today he will visit 
northern california on friday to get a firsthand look at 
earthquake damage and to provide encouragement to victims 
we will stay on top of it the president vowed 
he announced his travel plans at a picturetaking session in the 
oval office as he met with vice president dan quayle and 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner just back from their 
own inspection tour of the stricken san francisco bay area 
white house aides said bush would spend about three hours in the 
bay area 
the visit will include a helicopter survey of the affected areas 
and the president will also meet with local officials said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the president cited an allout federal effort in responding 
to the earthquake 
our hearts go out to the victims of this disaster and i will 
be going out there tomorrow to take a look and to provide 
encouragement to people the president said 
he voiced special praise for the red cross and other volunteer 
efforts saying thank god for the volunteers 
he said volunteers helping in the earthquake effort exemplified 
what he meant in various speeches by a thousand points of light 
bush thanked quayle and skinner for visiting the stricken area 
the president also said he had spoken by phone wednesday night with 
california gov george deukmejian who the president said expressed 
satisfaction with federal efforts 
he praised volunteer organizations for responding with this 
concern for their neighbors that just exemplifies the volunteer 
concept 
bush said the visit by quayle and skinner did signal very much 
of a concern on the part of the federal government 
we will stay on top of it we will be in touch with the state 
officials who in turn are dealing with the local officials 
therewere doing what we should do bush said 
he said that there was a preparation here that was very very 
sound noting earthquake simulation exercises conducted by the 
federal emergency management ageny last august 
asked by bush in front of reporters and cameras to give his own 
evaluation of the situation quayle said i think volunteerism 
and preparation are the two important lessons 
skinner told bush that as far as he could determine there were 
no outstanding requests from california state or local officials 
that werent currently being met by the federal governmemnt 
as he met with the officials the president held in his lap 
several bay area newsapers topped by a san jose mercury with the 
huge headline massive quake 
the president whose administration came under criticism from 
congress and local officials for not responding faster when 
hurricane hugo devastated south carolina last month has been 
making forceful promises over the past two days of federal aid to 
earthquake victims 
on wednesdsay he declared his administration will take every 
step and make every effort to aid the san francisco area

three strong aftershocks rattled northern 
california today as relief poured into the earthquakedevastated 
bay area from throughout the world 
workers dug into a 1milelong slab of collapsed freeway in 
oakland with fading hopes that anyone might be alive authorities 
fear more than 270 people were killed most in the highway cavein 
there were signs of life slowly returning to normal power was 
restored in the citys financial district early this morning 
setting off thousands of alarms airports were open and ferries 
from southern california steamed north to bolster the overburdened 
bay area commuter fleet 
the third game of the world series which was within minutes of 
the opening pitch when the quake struck was rescheduled for 
tuesday at candlestick park in san francisco 
still many offices remained closed the bay bridge the 
lifeline that links oakland and san francisco was expected to be 
closed at least one or two more weeks while a collapsed section is 
repaired 
an aftershock that measured 50 on the richter scale of ground 
motion struck at 315 am and was centered near watsonville 10 
miles south of santa cruz according to the state office of 
emergency services 
it was real strong said kelly johnston an admitting clerk 
at ami community hospital in santa cruz i ran to the doorway 
most people were just standing there frozen 
no one is really sleeping around here watsonville resident 
john murphy said 
two other aftershocks measured 45 the aftershocks collapsed 
the damaged steeple of a watsonville church and further damaged 
buildings in santa cruz near the epicenter of tuesdays 69 quake 
state officials said 
as of early today more than 1400 aftershocks were recorded 
the strongest 52 on the richter scale struck within 40 minutes 
of initial jolt according the us geological survey 
on wednesday bart the bay area rapid transit subway system 
reopened and then closed again when a train operator reported a 
leak in the tube beneath the bay 
gov george deukmejian demanded an investigation into the 
collapse of interstate 880 in oakland saying it should have been 
built to withstand the devastating force of tuesdays earthquake 
the collapse raises troubling questions for the entire state 
in terms of the construction of our freeways oakland mayor 
lionel wilson said 
largely because of the collapse of i880 known as the nimitz 
freeway the quake was the seconddeadliest in us history it 
killed an estimated 270 people 250 of them in the rubble of the 
nimitz and crippled transportation electric power and commerce 
in the nations fourthlargest metropolitan area a region of more 
than 6 million people 
besides the commuters crushed in the freeway collapse at least 
21 people died in san francisco san mateo santa clara and santa 
cruz counties state officials said 1400 people were injured 
throughout the bay area although hospitals said they treated 2750 
people many for chest pains 
in santa cruz closest to the quakes epicenter police arrested 
at least five people wednesday night after distraught friends of a 
woman missing in the rubble marched to protest authorities 
decision to stop searching for her several buildings in the citys 
historic downtown district were destroyed 
san francisco mayor art agnos said the quake caused 2 billion 
worth of destruction in his city alone 
president bush sharply criticized in south carolina for his 
response to hurricane hugo quickly declared the san francisco 
region a disaster area and directed an initial 273 million in 
relief efforts white house officials said he would tour the area 
friday 
more relief began to flow in from places as far afield as south 
carolina japan and great britain israel and france offered to 
send disaster teams experienced in finding victims trapped beneath 
wreckage 
officials in los alamos nm dispatched a device used to 
locate survivors of last years earthquake in soviet armenia 
hope was fading however that anyone would be found alive 
beneath the devastation in san franciscos marina district or under 
the crushing weight of i880 
in the affluent marina district two bodies were spotted in the 
rubble of a fourstory apartment building their hands were 
clutched in an embrace said dr charles saunders of the city 
health department 
there were no signs of life he said its very unlikely 
anyone else will be found alive 
across san francisco bay in oakland crews searched round the 
clock for victims amid the tons of steel and concrete that had been 
the nimitz freeway 
we have located several individuals none of whom are alive so 
there are no survivors at this point oakland police capt jim 
hahn said 
earlier rescuers freed a 6yearold from a car by cutting 
through the body of his dead mother the boy was in critical 
condition 
seven bodies were recovered from the nimitz and police said at 
least 86 people were officially reported missing the quake hit at 
rush hour and state officials estimated there were 250 cars caught 
in the collapse based on an optimistic assumption of one person 
per car 
a remotecontrol backhoe was flown in by helicopter to dig out 
the rubble but couldnt begin operation until workers shored up 
the 1mile stretch of collapsed roadway 
sen alan cranston dcalif got an overhead view of the 
crushed freeway from a helicopter and offered a horrific 
description it looked like a snake hacked with an ax it was in 
bits and pieces 
the nimitz built in the 1950s was reinforced in 1977 in the 
first of a threephase program to earthquakeproof state highways 
the second phase begun on other roads in the last year had 
been delayed at the nimitz pending an engineering study according 
to bill schaefer the chief engineer for the california department 
of transportation 
still schaefer said he was shocked by the collapse we 
thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake we could 
have in this area he said 
deukmejian said the cavein appeared to be the result of 
substandard construction i think we should have a full 
inquiry to determine why there were failures deukmejian said

less on reducing earthquake hazards than it spent a decade ago even 
though scientists predict more major temblors not only in 
california but in the south and northeast 
weve had essentially no funding for several years rep 
doug walgren dpa said wednesday its hard for the public and 
government to be serious about something that may or may not happen 
next year 
president bush asked congress this year to cut 31 million or 
about 5 percent from the earthquake research and emergency 
preparedness programs of four key agencies 
us geological survey experts told the house subcommittee n 
science research and technology that tuesdays quake in the san 
francisco bay region raises their concerns another one of similar 
size will occur closer to the city but not in the near future 
were talking about decades rather than days or weeks said 
robert wesson of the usgs it might be slightly more likely we 
could have an earthquake along the fault but in an area to the 
north 
but wesson said he doubts the bay area faces an earthquake that 
would rival the 1906 san francisco quake which experts calculated 
at an 83 magnitude on the laterdeveloped richter scale 
i dont think we expect a magnitude 8 earthquake in the san 
francisco area he said 
tuesdays quake registered a 69 on the richter scale close to 
the power of last decembers earthquake in soviet armenia 
the usgs had warned the house subcommittee in june to expect an 
earthquake of least 65 magnitude in the san francisco area in the 
next 30 years 
other officials have said areas alog active faults in the east 
also may face a quake greater than 7 magnitude in the next 20 
years they said charleston sc buffalo ny and memphis 
tenn are possible sites 
meanwhile a draft presidential executive order prepared by an 
interagency task force to improve the safety of federal buildings 
in quakeprone areas has languished in the white houses budget 
office since 1986 
sen albert gore dtenn blames inertia in congress and the 
reagan and bush administrations for a failure to earthquake 
response capabilities even though the technology is readily 
available 
its partly the case of not thinking about fixing the roof 
until its raining and then not fixing it because it is raining 
gore said wednesday 
congress in 1977 established the national earthquake reductions 
hazard program to coordinate research into quakes and improve 
preparedness 
but annual federal spending on the effort has dropped from 944 
million to less than 66 million in fiscal 1989 this year bush 
asked congress to cut the program to 629 million 
as a result according to the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee regional seismic networks covering the 
central and eastern states have been cut back sharply along with 
programs to develop safer buildings roads and highways 
supporters of the program also say the federal emergency 
management agency has been languid in carrying out its designated 
lead role for implementing the 1977 law 
the agency coordinates its quakerelated activities with the 
geological survey the national science foundation and the national 
institute of standards and technology 
a committee of outside experts appointed by fema concluded in 
1987 that femas performance was unacceptable it recommended 
switching the leadership role to the usgs but also called for 
tripling to 199 million annually what the government spends on 
earthquake preparedness 
that panel said much of its recommended increase should go 
toward developing supercomputers that might enable scientists to 
better predict when and where earthquakes will occur and enhance 
emergency response capabilities

saudi arabias foreign minister met with 
president hafez assad today to work out a plan for the withdrawal 
of syrian troops from lebanon as part of a settlement of that 
nations civil war 
in taif saudi arabia sources at the meeting of the lebanese 
parliament said the saudi government also was trying to satisfy 
christian demands for withdrawing syrias 40000 troops withdraw 
from lebanon 
in beirut an aide to christian leader gen michel aoun today 
urged christian lawmakers to leave the conference if there is no 
agreement by friday 
we demand clear guarantees that the syrians would withdraw 
said farouk abillama secretary general of aouns foreign ministry 
and one of the generals closest advisers 
abillama after a meeting with the christian leader told 
reporters that maronite christian parliamentary deputies have 
agreed to political reform that would shift some power to the 
moslems 
so let them give us something in return he said the 
christian deputies should return in 24 hours if they fail to 
reach agreement he said at midday 
arab diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said saudi 
foreign minister prince saud arrived unexpectedly in damascus late 
wednesday carrying a letter from king fahd on the issue 
presidential spokesman jibrane kourieh said syrian vice 
president abdulhalim khaddam and foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
also attended the meeting 
saud was expected to meet with lebanese christians in taif later 
today to discuss results of the trip 
the lebanese parliament has been meeting in taif under the 
auspices of the arab league for the past 20 days to try to settle 
that nations 14yearold civil war 
talks have been at a standstill for days over the christians 
call for guarantees that the syrians will withdraw 
the syrians have been in lebanon since 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate and have become the main power brokers in the 
country 
the christians led by aoun charge that damascus violated its 
mandate by siding with the moslems and have declared a war of 
liberation against the syrians 
conference sources said saud has advised the christians that the 
guarantees they seek would be contained in amendments to a peace 
accord 
they also said syrias agreement to the proposed amendments 
would cool opposition from lebanons moslem lawmakers and allow the 
taif conference to move ahead to discussion of a new powersharing 
agreement 
the 33 christian and 30 moslem lawmakers have agreed to 
political reforms that would give some of the power of the 
traditionally dominant christians to moslems 
but aoun has insisted that without guarantees of a syrian 
pullout a peace settlement cannot be completed any peace accord 
worked out in taif must be approved by the militia commanders in 
lebanon 
an arab league mediating committee of saudi arabia morocco and 
algeria has proposed a twoyear phased withdrawal of the syrians 
from the beirut area 
the troops would be redeployed in lebanons eastern bekaa valley 
until a strong central government were established and the nation 
signed a security pact with syria 
aoun however has insisted that syrian troops begin leaving 
lebanon as soon a charter for national reconciliation is ratified 
by a parliamentiary session in beirut

authorities searching for missing 
transients have continued digging at a farm where they found the 
bodies of three unidentified men buried in a barn 
members of a police task force formed last week used a backhoe 
wednesday around a well between a farmhouse and the barn where the 
bodies were found monday in shallow graves 
investigators searched two other sites in the livingston county 
northeast of kansas city but would not say exactly where 
sheriffs deputies began digging last week at the 40acre farm 
of ray and faye copeland after arresting the couple oct 9 and 
charging them with conspiracy to steal in an alleged cattle swindle 
the bodies were found on another farm about 12 miles south of 
the copeland home neil bryan owner of the farm said the 
75yearold copeland had worked for him doing odd jobs for 20 years 
a man who said he rented the farm until about a week ago john 
hovey said copeland warned him and his four children to stay out 
of the barn 
asked if he noticed anything hovey said just the stench it 
stunk in the barn i thought an animal had crawled in there and 
died 
authorities declined to say if the copelands were murder 
suspects no charges have been filed except the conspiracy to steal 
charge but the squad has said that the search was for several 
missing transients who have worked for them 
bryan is not a suspect authorities said 
the charge against the copelands alleges they bought cattle with 
a check that bounced then sold the cattle without making good on 
the check 
copeland and his 68yearold wife remained in jail on bonds of 
25000 each

an appeals court today refused to release 
a palestinian wanted in the united states for the fatal 1982 
bombing of a pan am jet over hawaii 
the threemember council that rules on requests for the 
temporary release of people held in pretrial custody said that it 
had no jurisdiction over the matter because mohammed rashids 
extradition was in the hands of the justice minister 
american officials have said rashids case is a test of greeces 
willingness to fight terrorism 
rashid 39 has been held by greece since his arrest on a false 
passport charge in may 1988 the supreme court last may upheld a 
us request for his extradition but also said the final decision 
rests with the justice minister 
the greek government put the matter on hold after the june 
elections when the country was ruled by a conservativecommunist 
coalition the present caretaker government has a mandate only to 
lead the nation to elections on nov 5 and will not make any 
foreign policy decisions such as one on rashids extradition 
the palestinian is accused of planting a bomb on a pan am jumbo 
jet in 1982 a japanese teenager was killed and 15 other people 
injured in the blast over hawaii 
on sept 14 rashid asked a public prosecutor to present his 
case to the appeals court council saying that his continued 
detention after the supreme court ruling stretches out my 
detention indefinitely thus violating basic human rights 
rashid was first held for entering greece on a false passport 
the palestine liberation organization claims that rashid is one 
of its members and that he is the victim of a conspiracy intended 
to present palestinians as terrorists

the soviet interior minister today branded boris 
n yeltsin a liar and defended a government investigation into an 
alleged assassination attempt of the maverick lawmaker 
the comments by minister vadim bakatin came less than 24 hours 
after yeltsin accused president mikhail s gorbachev of staging a 
political farce in an attempt to scuttle yeltsins political 
career 
bakatin maintains that yeltsin appeared at a police post sept 
28 dripping wet and reported that men had assaulted him and 
thrown him off a bridge into the moscow river yeltsin however 
told the supreme soviet legislature this week he never reported 
such an incident and that no such attack occurred 
i have presented only the official information i had from the 
policeman i stated only what comrade yeltsin told the policeman 
bakatin told reporters at a news conference called especially to 
discuss the affair 
the interior ministers appearance before reporters showed the 
government was eager to deflect yeltsins accusations quickly 
bakatin said yeltsin lied publicly when he told his story to 
the supreme soviet in remarks later shown on nationwide television 
and a second time a day later when he issued a statement to the 
press accusing gorbachev trying to undermine him 
in my view this is becoming particular to comrade yeltsin 
saying something then afterwards calling it persecution bakatin 
said 
he also accused yeltsin of making a false report when he arrived 
at the police station 
there was no attempt on his life the minister said these 
rumors are false 
yeltsin denied making a formal report of an assassination 
attempt but has not addressed whether he appeared at a police post 
soaking wet 
in the statement to the supreme soviet yeltsin called the 
affair a new attempt to ruin my health and to knock me out of the 
sphere of political struggle 
gorbachev had brought yeltsin into the leadership but had him 
fired in 1987 for criticizing the slow pace of reforms he has 
gradually made a political comeback winning 89 percent of the vote 
in march to become a member of the new soviet congress 
bakatin said yeltsin had recaptured a position in the government 
because of his criticism of authorities casting himself as a 
victim and exploiting slogans popular with people 
asked if yeltsin would be prosecuted on charges of filing a 
false police report bakatin said there were no such plans 
besides he said yeltsins status as a lawmaker means his fellow 
legislators would have to sanction any criminal investigation 
involving him 
 
the interior minister defended gorbachevs conduct in regard to 
his former protege 
any nonpartisan observer would see that the general secretary 
of our party comrade gorbachev has very loyally and correctly 
reacted to the declaration or conduct of comrade yeltsin bakatin 
said 
bakatin also claimed yelstin asked him in a telephone 
conversation not to investigate the incident further but the 
interior minister told reporters i could not give this 
promise he maintained that contrary to what yeltsin claimed in 
his statement the investigation had not touched on his private 
life

some looting occurs but disaster is far more 
likely to bring out the best in people than the worst say experts 
on how people behave during calamities 
generally overall criminal behavior drops off at the height 
of the emergency says enrico quarantelli of the disaster 
research center at the university of delaware commenting on 
reports of scattered violence and looting in the aftermath of the 
northern california earthquake tuesday 
if you are an idiot before an earthquake youre an idiot 
after an earthquake adds russell dynes a sociologist at the 
same research unit but he agrees that the evidence in situations 
like this is that looting is very minimal 
looting and violence were also noticed in new york city on july 
1314 1977 during a 25hour power failure and in the caribbean 
and charleston sc after hurricane hugo 
st croix was the scene of reckless looting this fall but that 
was more an expression of political discontent than simple greed 
said psychiatrist peter steinglass of the george washington 
university school of medicine who does research on family 
responses to natural disasters hugo was just an excuse to allow 
an outpouring he said 
the earthquake in armenia too triggered alienation toward the 
kremlin accused of denying aid in retaliation for the areas 
attempt to assert its independence from moscow steinglass said 
paradoxically he said disasters become a rewarding memory to 
those who survive them 
often people who have been through these experiences look back 
upon them as events that had a very positive influence on their 
lives he said the survivors are proud to have coped and 
survived 
looting gets a bigger role in accounts of disasters than it 
deserves the experts say 
there are lots of reports of it based on expectations says 
dynes if one looks at new york on any given night there are a 
certain number of arrests and the question is whether those 
incidents go up or down during disasters by and large they go 
down 
psychologist justin schulz of englewood colo says television 
exaggerates the looting that does occur you see one angry face 
smashing a car and it becomes something bigger in your own mind 
thomas courtless a sociologist and law professor at george 
washington university says what happens during a disaster is that 
criminals take advantage of the special circumstances the police 
are tied up in rescue work 
i dont know when the stock market crashed whether this didnt 
open some opportunities for some pretty sharp operators too 
courtless says what these situations have in common is the sense 
that im not going to get caught 
far more common in disasters than criminal behavior is heroism 
says andrew baum a health psychologist at the uniformed services 
university of the health sciences who has done research on peoples 
behavior in floods tornadoes and other disasters 
people help each other and engage in rescue attempts 
disasters tend to bring out the more positive side of human 
nature he says 
as far back as roman times there have been accounts of people 
looting and rioting notes david silber a psychologist at george 
washington university 
theres a theory called frustrationinduced criminality the 
idea that those people who are most likely to be avid looters and 
to take advantage of social breakdown will be those who have the 
least he adds 
on the other hand notes schulz who is an expert on posttrauma 
stress thumbing your nose at the adult community is common 
among all young men the same phenomenon sends youths to fort 
lauderdale fla in the spring to get drunk and find a way to 
break the rules

this weeks earthquake didnt damage 
just bridges and buildings it ripped into a california dream 
already frayed by smog crowding and soaring real estate costs 
experts have warned for years that the bay area would be hit 
someday by the big one a catastrophic earthquake they say will 
be worse than tuesdays quake even the telephone book has 
instructions on what to do after an earthquake 
the warnings have done little to slow a population explosion 
fueled by californias famous sunny weather and a healthy economy 
you hear about californians being so blase about earthquakes 
well they have been said karen anderson a berkeley native who 
recently returned to the area after 10 years in indiana 
but this is different she said the weathers really nice 
here but something like this makes you question whether its worth 
it ive thought about leaving this area because of the rising cost 
of real estate and congestion i guess this is one more reason 
if she goes shell be in the minority said real estate agents 
the quake produced a temporary lull wednesday in residential sales 
people had other things on their minds said oakland real 
estate agent jon shahoian 
but he predicted sales will be brisk again by next week in this 
overheated market where a typical threebedroom house costs more 
than 250000 
its not as if people have been unaware of the potential for 
earthquakes here shahoian said 
indeed many bay area residents seemed to be trying to live up 
to the laidback image of californians in the quakes aftermath 
the order of the day in all but the hardesthit zones was business 
as usual 
even as rescue workers dug through rubble to look for quake 
victims tourists jockeyed for position to take snapshots of the 
damage 
and just a few miles from where a section of interstate 880 
collapsed killing an estimated 250 people few shoppers at a 
berkeley supermarket were stocking up on supplies in case an 
aftershock should hit 
most of them were just buying dinner 
you take it in stride said vera hogan whose purchases 
included candles to light her apartment which was still without 
electricity wednesday night 
she needed the candles so she could see to clean up the broken 
glass and dishes that the quake had jarred loose in her apartment 
and she was just getting to it wednesday because the quake had 
stranded her across the bay in san francisco the night before 
still she thinks california living is a breeze its better 
here than in louisiana where i come from there you get 
hurricanes tornadoes and no opportunities to boot 
many who survived the earthquake with no injury or property 
damage may take it as a sign that their lack of concern is 
justified 
real estate agent jean sinel of albany said she knows many 
homeowners on the hayward fault a likely spot for earthquakes in 
the bay area who dont bother to spend the extra 200 a year for 
quake insurance 
they figure the gamble is worth the risk she said 
when was our last big one 1906 she asked referring to 
the catastrophic quake that killed hundreds or perhaps throusands 
natives dont seem to be as frightened as the 
outofstaters she said earthquakes are something we live 
with here

the military said an 
investigation completed today proved communist rebels were 
responsible for killing two americans the day vice president dan 
quayle arrived on a visit last month

buchner 44 who were gunned down by six assailants who sprang from 
a passenger jeep and opened fire on the victims car near capas in

opposition leaders today criticized east germanys 
new leader egon krenz for his dedication to hardline 
conservatism that has caused dissent across the country a 
prodemocracy protest was reported hours after krenz was appointed 
krenz who took over from erich honecker on wednesday made it 
clear in a speech that the communist party will resist 
prodemocracy movements like those under way in hungary and poland 
the change in leadership was praised in other east bloc 
countries but opposition leaders here said krenzs style will not 
end dissatisfaction that has caused street protests and driven tens 
of tens of thousands of east germans to flee west 
activists said today that about 1000 people held a peaceful 
protest in the northern city of greifswald hours after krenz was 
named party chief the protesters reportedly demanded democratic 
reforms and the release of those detained during demonstrations 
earlier in the month 
reinhardt schultz a cofounder of the new forum opposition 
group said today i dont think that the protest movement will 
settle for a few cosmetic changes 
another government critic east german author rolf schneider 
told west berlins rias radio in an interview wednesday the 
crisis will keep dragging on 
egon krenz doesnt enjoy any particular trust among the 
people said baerbel bohley another new forum leader he blamed 
the 52yearold leader for unleashing police forces that attacked 
prodemocracy demonstrators in east berlin on oct 7 and oct 8 
communist party sources have said krenz ordered security forces 
to use more restraint in later demonstrations 
the communist partys central committee named krenz to succeed 
his hardline mentor 77yearold honecker who ruled the nation 18 
years krenz the youngest member of the ruling politburo also 
will assume the duties of head of state and head of the military 
replacing honecker in all three roles 
honecker said he stepped down because of health reasons but 
rising public opposition to his authoritarian rule had fueled 
pressure for his resignation 
more than 53000 east germans have fled the west in recent weeks 
via hungary poland and czechoslovakia in austria authorities 
said today that more than 1000 east german refugees crossed from 
hungary into austria since wednesday morning most have gone on to 
west germany where they are granted automatic citizenship 
addressing east germans on television a few hours after his 
elevation krenz said discussion of change is important and 
promised the ruling party would initiate a new course 
but he stressed that without the communist party there would 
be no german democratic republic and indicated he does not intend 
to enter dialogue with opposition groups agitating for a more open 
society free elections and a free press 
our society already has enough democratic forums in which 
different interests from various parts of the population can 
express themselves krenz said 
he hinted that rigid restrictions on travel abroad could be 
modified or lifted the difficulty of getting permission to travel 
outside the country has been a chief complaint of protesters 
the new leader also accused west german officials of meddling in 
east germanys affairs 
the statecontrolled der morgan newspaper in east berlin said 
today that at the center of the demands and suggestions for 
change is the longing for deeds and decisions 
the newspaper called for open productive and democratic 
discussions of the nations problems but said they should take 
place within the current socialist structure 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher speaking at 
an eastwest security conference in frankfurt urged krenz to make 
fundamental reforms in the troubled nation and to make good on 
a pledge to talk to all levels of society 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose reforms have been 
rejected by east german leaders but embraced by much of the 
populace expressed confidence in a telegram published today that 
krenz will find solutions to the problems facing his country 
polands communist president wojciech jaruzelski commended the 
contribution of honecker to the development of polisheast german 
relations but said the new leadership will benefit the country 
however polands prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza said 
krenz may be a disappointing change for those who want greater 
change 
poland has the east blocs first government not led by 
communists the 24member cabinet has only four communist ministers 
hungary which also is moving toward democratic reforms 
predicted that krenz may only be a transitional leader until a 
party congress due in may 
the magyar nemzet daily one of the more outspoken staterun 
newspapers said that meeting could bring a breakthrough for more 
outspoken reformers 
two other politburo members who had been heavily criticized 
within the party lost their jobs wednesday 
they were joachim herrmann 60 who ran the countrys news media 
and guenter mittag 63 who made the east german economy the envy 
of its east european neighbors but had come under criticism for a 
lack of innovation

the nuclearpowered galileo probe 
raced across space today on its long voyage to jupiter while the 
five orbiting atlantis astronauts who released it began a day of 
other experiments 
zipping along at about 9600 mph the probe was more than 
150000 miles from earth at midmorning nasa said galileo was 
deployed wednesday night about six hours after the space shuttle 
thundered into orbit 
galileo is on its way to another world atlantis commander 
don williams said shortly after the 6700pound probe was gently 
ejected from the shuttles cargo bay by springs 
the shuttle crew today ran some checks and pronounced the 
primary cooling system healthy it had shut down automatically 
wednesday when it became overheated shifting to a backup 
nasa said the problem was associated with the power needs of 
galileo when it was in the cargo bay 
mission control awakened the space travelers today with a 
musical tribute to williams and pilot mike mcculley both naval 
aviators and graduates of purdue university reveille was 
sandwiched between hail purdue and anchors aweigh 
i liked the first song better than the second williams 
responded 
the successful deployment of galileo occurred as planned at 615 
pm cdt over the gulf of mexico near brownsville 
galileo looks absolutely super radioed mission specialist 
shannon lucid who was in charge of the deployment its too bad 
you all cant be here to see it 
after williams and mcculley maneuvered the shuttle a safe 
distance away a twostage rocket attached to the probe fired the 
initial stage the second burn occurred about five minutes 
later and the national aeronautics and space administration said 
both were successful 
it achieved earthescape velocity and is now heading outbound 
toward the sun mission control commentator brian welch said 
wednesday night a spacecraft can escape the earths gravity when 
traveling faster than 25000 mph 
shortly after 8 pm cdt mission control reported that the 
twostage rocket and the probe had separated and that galileo was 
on its own 
galileo is powered by two electrical generators that are fueled 
by highly radioactive plutonium antinuclear activists opposed the 
use of plutonium but lost a lawsuit to block the launch 
although jupiter is the probes destination galileo also will 
swing around venus the earth and sun during its 24billionmile 
journey gravity from earth and venus will help the spacecraft gain 
momentum for its trip 
during the sixyear voyage galileo also will provide the first 
closeup data about asteroids passing within 600 miles of gaspra 
and ida 
scientists hope the 15 billion galileo the most expensive 
unmanned space vehicle ever built will give the best look yet of 
another planet and find clues to the universes origin when it 
reaches jupiter 
they believe the giant planet still holds much of the material 
in its original state from which the universe formed more than 15 
billion years ago 
a robot on galileo will dive through jupiters hydrogenrich 
atmosphere and radio back readings during the 75minute plunge but 
galileo itself will continue a wide orbit around the planet for 22 
months keeping track of changes in its weather for the first 
longterm study of an outer planet 
atlantis liftoff wednesday was delayed twice once last week 
because of a faulty engine computer and then on tuesday because of 
rain but on wednesday atlantis found a calm between two storm 
systems and blasted off from cape canaveral fla 
the antinuclear activists who were fearful a challengerlike 
accident could spread radioactive contamination over florida had 
threatened to infiltrate the launch site to stop the liftoff but 
there were no incidents wednesday 
during the rest of the mission scheduled to end monday with a 
landing at edwards air force base calif the astronauts will 
conduct several scientific and medical experiments 
other projects include an experiment to grow corn plants to see 
how they develop without gravity one to heat and cool plasticlike 
materials to determine how they react in space and a student 
experiment designed to grow ice crystals in microgravity 
in addition an instrument in the cargo bay will measure 
sections of the earths protective ozone layer in an attempt to 
calibrate that data with readings taken by nearly identical 
instruments on satellites 
the other atlantis crew members are mission specialists ellen 
baker and franklin changdiaz

computer controls and improved construction 
techniques are dramatically improving the ability of the nations 
telephone network to withstand natural disasters such as hurricanes 
and earthquakes telephone officials say 
during tuesdays earthquake in northern california millions of 
callers simultaneously went to their telephones to inquire of 
friends and relatives are you ok or did you see the 
earthquake on tv 
that huge upsurge in longdistance calling more than 2 times 
normal nationwide between 8 pm and midnight eastern daylight time 
could have caused chaos 20 or 30 years ago 
this time computers rerouted calls and selectively blocked 
others to keep the system from experiencing gridlock said jim 
nelson director of atampts network operations center in bedminster 
nj 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company received a record 
1447 million longdistance calls nationwide between midnight 
tuesday and midnight wednesday 
approximately 1236 million calls were completed wednesday 
linnen said 
volume early today in northern california has diminished but 
continues to be above normal linnen added 
thanks to improved phone equipment we are able to manage the 
volume to at least not bring the system to a halt much more 
effectively than ever before we dont allow that extra load to 
bog the system down nelson said 
when hurricane hugo slammed ashore in south carolina last month 
people in charleston sc received longdistance calls from 
relatives during the worst of the storm ted creech a spokesman 
for southern bell said wednesday 
the reason they had that capability is that some 80 percent of 
our cables are underground creech said much of that cable is 
fiberoptic which creech said is much less susceptible to 
moisture or corrosion 
of southern bells 1 million customers in south carolina 13523 
remained without service wednesday mostly because of water damage 
to inside wiring or downed lines to their homes creech said 
by far especially in this kind of situation underground 
cable has proved to be the best in terms of service reliability 
creech said 
solidstate components reinforced buildings underground 
fiberoptic cable and redundant systems have improved the phone 
system dramatically from the days when high winds snow or ice 
could knock out service for days 
the physical construction has improved dramatically just like 
the building construction on the highrises in california nelson 
said 
equally powerful is atampts network of computers that sense where 
backlogs are developing and reroute traffic through other parts of 
the country 
unlike 20 or 30 years ago where you had very defined routing 
paths that could easily overload and congest we essentially 
have a spider web around the country nelson said 
the computers are smart enough to use any of the capability 
anywhere in the country we can talk to those computers to make 
sure they allow enough of those calls through without gridlock 
nelson said 
sue galloway district manager for pacific bells network in 
southern california said pacifics phone network has been designed 
to withstand the largest earthquakes 
weve done an awful lot of reinforcing at our central 
office locations and weve done a lot of changes of our network 
she said 
to keep the phone system operating atampt blocked 60 to 70 
percent of the incoming calls to the san francisco area and 30 
percent of the outgoing calls nelson said 
us sprint the nations no 3 longdistance carrier doubled its 
volume of calls immediately after the earthquake tuesday night 
said al butson sprints director of network management and control 
in kansas city mo 
calls were running 40 percent above normal on wednesday butson 
said 
sprint spokesman phil hermanson said the sprint network 
functioned very well no losses no outages we werent hit 
mci officials said their system was functioning at capacity but 
with no breakdowns 
like atampt mci and sprint were blocking many calls to the san 
francisco area

a 15second earthquake caused a 
transportation nightmare that will last for months as bay area 
residents cope with collapsed freeways damaged bridges landslides 
and twisted rail lines 
with major arteries closed between san francisco to points south 
and east freeways jammed up starting at dawn today in the populous 
southern section from from hayward in the east to gilroy in the 
west traffic in the northern part of the ninecounty region was 
lighter but gridlock was expected by midday 
this is just a nightmare this is something nobody ever 
believed would happen to cut san francisco off from the east 
bay said andrew nevin 41 of oakland who got up at 3 am to 
drive into san francisco 
nevin who normally commutes 18 miles had a circuitous 45mile 
trek 
the bay area rapid transit line between san francisco and 
oakland closed wednesday because of a reported leak in the tube 
under san francisco bay but it reopened later the load today was 
slightly less than the normal 50000 said spokesman mike healy 
we expect people will be coming in a little later than usual 
because theyre trying to figure out how best to get into the 
city 
that link had become especially vital after the quake cut off a 
main route the san franciscooakland bay bridge where a 50foot 
section collapsed the subway closing left ferries as the only 
remaining direct link between the cities ferry service was 
bolstered from southern california vessels 
motorists still may get across the bay using bridges north or 
south of the bay bridge but each is at least 25 miles out of the 
way 
california department of transportation officials said the 
collapsed section of the bay bridge was to be lifted today so they 
could estimate how long repairs will take 
the quake also collapsed a 1mile section of interstate 880 a 
major artery near the bridge in oakland authorities estimated 250 
people were killed when the highways upper deck fell onto the 
lower level during rush hour 
us transportation secretary samuel skinner who viewed the 
wreckage wednesday from the air said repairs could take 18 months 
one of the things you are going to have to do is to plan how you 
are going to in the next year or year and a half deal with the fact 
that 880 is not going to be operational 
in an effort to ease the burden for commuters los angelesbased 
catalina cruises sent four 700passenger vessels to supplement 
ferry service said terry koenig general manager 
closer to the quakes epicenter about 55 miles south of san 
francisco a landslide closed highway 17 linking the bay area with 
santa cruz del corral of raisch construction said it will take 
at least two months to clear 
repairing the crippled highway network will cost at least 500 
million caltrans officials told the state transportation 
commission caltrans also said surveyors were inspecting about 
1500 bridges within 50 miles of the epicenter 
quakedamaged rail lines into oakland from los angeles stopped 
amtraks northbound coast starlight at salinas about 60 miles from 
san francisco said spokeswoman sue martin amtrak provided buses 
to either martinez or sacramento where other trains continued the 
trip into the pacific northwest 
there were no immediate estimates on when the amtrak lines would 
be fixed 
the historic amtrak passenger terminal in west oakland likely 
will be torn down because it was so damaged officials said 
san francisco international airport was open but some airlines 
cut operations due to quakedamaged terminals united airlines joe 
hopkins said the quake forced the carrier to cancel 16 of 136 daily 
flights wednesday 
oakland airport also was open but its main runway was closed

the bush administration is considering a 
speedup of its withdrawal of us military dependents from panama 
the white house said today 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said that since last spring 6300 
defense department personnel had either been relocated onto us 
bases in panama or sent home but there are still roughly 11000 
dependents in the country 
the washington times reported today that the newly appointed 
us military commander in panama gen maxwell r thurman has 
asked his superiors to evacuate most dependents from panama 
the newspaper citing military sources in panama said thurman 
wanted the dependents evacuated to heighten the sense of war among 
his troops in panama where the united states has pressed for the 
removal of gen manuel antonio noriega as leader of the central 
american country 
noriega is wanted in the united states on indictments charging 
drug trafficking he recently quashed an attempted coup that 
received minimal support from us forces 
fitzwater told reporters the administration was reviewing 
whether the withdrawal of dependents should be accelerated and 
whether there should be any special efforts made 
the ultimate purpose he said has always been to have 
people leave panama and return to the united states 
we have been reviewing this matter since the spring and we 
announced a program in may which called for the return to the 
united states of many of the dependents in panama he said 
as of july 1 he said 6300 defense department employees and 
their dependents had either been sent home or relocated from 
civilian housing into us military installations in panama 
currently he said the united states has 10000 soldiers 
permanently assigned to panama 2500 military people there on 
temporary duty 7700 military dependents 2700 us civilian 
pentagon employees and 3300 civilian dependents 
asked whether the white house considered the situation in panama 
akin to a state of war fitzwater replied 
we have always said that there is a status involving some 
danger in panama that was the reason for our first actions to try 
to move people certainly dependents of military people back onto 
the base 
youll recall incidents of harassment people in some cases 
being assaulted physically and so there has always been a 
dangerous situation there that we were trying to alleviate he 
said 
but pressed on whether it was amounted to war fitzwater said 
we havent used that term

commonwealth leaders today said 
nations should put more financial pressure on south africa and 
criticized an agreement by international banks to reschedule part 
of the countrys foreign debt 
prime minister bob hawke of australia said commonwealth leaders 
were disappointed that foreign banks agreed to reschedule 8 
billion of south africas 20 billion debt 
in south africa finance minister barend du plessis welcomed the 
debt rescheduling as one of the most important international 
events for south africa this year 
news of the bank deal came as leaders of the 49nation 
commonwealth met in closed session to debate sanctions against 
south africa which quit the commonwealth in 1961 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain the sole opponent 
of sanctions in the association of britain and its former colonies 
insists embargoes now would be irresponsible 
mrs thatcher defended her stand today and accused the 
commonwealth of promoting poverty through embargoes our course 
is constructive we want to help the people of south africa she 
said 
australia is proposing a sanction plan for south africa that 
calls on international banks to toughen lending conditions 
including limiting maxium credit terms to 90 days 
it also calls for setting up a monitoring agency to scrutinize 
south africas links with the international financial community 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia at a news conference on the 
second day of the biennial summit said bloodshed threatened to 
engulf southern africa 
bankers are sucking at that blood by supporting south africa 
they are bloodsuckers he said 
commonwealth leaders apart from mrs thatcher had planned to 
launch a new drive to try to stymie south africas efforts to 
reschedule the 8 billion of its foreign debt that is due next june 
on wednesday canadian officials said a threenation 
commonwealth team of representatives from canada australia and 
india has been lobbying major international banks and received what 
he called a favorable response 
but within hours the south african reserve bank announced it 
has reached a deal with the creditors mostly american and european 
banks 
on wednesday mrs thatcher arguing that south african president 
fw de klerk deserves encouragement urged the commonwealth not to 
rebuff the most helpful sign for many years that progress was 
possible 
she cited de klerks release this week of eight black 
nationalist leaders relaxation of restrictions on antigovernment 
demonstrations and his willingness to consult all shades of 
opinion 
canada proposes maintaining existing sanctions but holding off 
on new ones for six months as a challenge to de klerk to get the 
whitedominated parliament to abolish race laws by then 
the laws include regulations that deny the black majority the 
vote and segregate residential areas and health services 
commonwealth officials predicted that the sixmonth moratorium 
proposal was likely to be supported although reluctantly by some 
african and asian countries 
most commonwealth leaders maintain that sanctions although 
unevenly applied have forced south africa to move toward change 
britain a major south african trading partner has long argued 
that sanctions hurt blacks most and increase white resistance to 
change 
a list of commonwealth sanctions drawn up in 1986 included bans 
on air links imports of farm produce and a range of other goods 
as a compromise britain agreed to a handful of the embargoes 
black southern african countries which depend economically on 
south africa have also taken only limited measures

spanish novelist and essayist camilo 
jose cela who used the horrors of the spanish civil war to infuse 
his work with an often grotesque and violent imagery today won the 
nobel prize in literature 
cela 73 was cited by the swedish academy for his rich and 
intensive prose which with restrained compassion forms a 
challenging vision of mans vulnerability 
cela was the fifth spaniard to win the nobel prize in 
literature he said he felt he shared the award with many other 
spanish and latin american writers 
for me this is something im very proud of cela told 
spanish national radio from his home in guadalajara spain i 
offer it to all of literature in spanish i believe that other 
authors spanish and latin american who write in spanish could 
also have won it for the same reasons as i but in the end i won 
it and im very very happy 
celas best known work is the 1942 novel the family of pascual 
duarte in which he created a new literary style known as 
tremendismo emphasizing violence and grotesque imagery 
the novel a firstperson account of a murderer awaiting 
execution was banned in spain but established celas reputation as 
a writer it was considered the most important postwar novel and 
set a new direction for spanish literature toward concise and sober 
writing 
celas masterpiece is considered the hive from 1951 which 
captures three days in the life of madrid four years after the 
civil war 
cela has written 10 novels among his 70 works of travelogs 
short stories and poetry 
the swedish academy called him the leading figure in spains 
literary renewal during the postwar era 
cela is a restless spirit who often expresses himself in 
an old spanish tradition of hilarious grotesqueness it said 
sture allen the academys secretary called cela provocative 
and innovative in both his form and subject matter 
the family of pascual duarte was probably the most widely 
read spanish novel since don quixote the academy said it also 
singled out as a sensation his 1969 novel san camilo which 
describes the weeks before the outbreak of civil war 
cela was the first spaniard to win the nobel since 1977 when it 
was awarded to poet vicente aleixandre cela was chosen from about 
150 candidates allen said the prize this year is worth about 
463000 
as publisher of the literary magazine papeles de son 
armadans from 1956 to 1979 cela also was credited for providing 
a forum for young opposition writers during the years of 
hardship a reference to the dictatorship of gen francisco 
franco 
his writing broadened the range of spanish writing and 
widely influenced latin american literature allen said after 
reading the citation to reporters at the academys 18th century 
headquarters 
cela was born may 11 1916 in the town of iria flavia to a 
middle class family that counted among its forebearers both spanish 
aristocrats and english pirates 
his medical studies were interrupted by the 193639 civil war 
suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis he returned to his native 
galicia district which was controlled by francos nationalists 
forced to join the nationalists as a private he was seriously 
wounded 
after the war he began studying law in madrid but devoted much 
of his time to writing he turned to writing full time after 
producing the family of pascual duarte 
in 1977 king juan carlos appointed cela a senator in the first 
spanish parliament and he assisted in writing the spanish 
constitution in 1978 
he received the 1987 prince of asturias award for literature 
given by a foundation named for the heir to the spanish throne and 
has been a member of the spanish academy literary group since 1957 
other wellknown works by cela include journey to the 
alcarria from 1948 a diary of his walking trip through rural 
castille and jews moors and christians from 1956 an essay of 
the impact of religion on spanish history 
the nobel prize in literature was the last of the six prizes to 
be awarded for 1989 all were worth 463000 this year 
the nobel peace prize was given to the dalai lama the exiled 
spiritual and political leader of tibet for his nonviolent 
struggle to free his himalayan nation from chinese rule 
the prize in medicine went to j michael bishop and harold e 
varmus of the united states for their discovery of a family of 
genes that helped scientists better understand how cancer develops 
trygve haavelmo of norway won the prize in economics for showing 
that mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the 
puzzling shifts in the economy 
american thomas cech and canadianborn sidney altman a us 
citizen since 1984 won the chemistry prize for their work with the 
genetic material rna the physics prize was awarded to american 
norman f ramsey for the atomic clock used as the international 
time standard and to american hans g dehmelt and west german 
wolfgang paul for a method to isolate single atoms

the winner of this years nobel prize in 
literature camilo jose cela is better known in his homeland for 
his love of food travel and women than for his 10 novels and 
numerous short stories and travelogues 
cela received the nobel prize in literature today becoming the 
fifth spaniard to do so 
although his bestknown novels the family of pascual duarte 
and the hive have been successfully translated into films he 
is known to most spaniards for his sojourns through spain in a 
rolls royce for his love of crude expressions and for his 
flamboyant lifestyle 
the 73yearold writer most recently made news when he publicly 
acknowledged a romantic liaison with marina castano a woman half 
his age who is his muse and literary helpmate 
cela is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years 
and has one son camilo jose cela conde who acknowledged last week 
in a radio interview that it was difficult being the offspring of 
such a public character 
ms castano said cela still writes everything in longhand and 
has no idea how to operate a typewriter or a word processor 
cela told reporters he was not really surprised by the news 
he had received the award but said it could just as well have gone 
to many other spanish writers 
but life is like a game of tennis and this time i won he 
said 
he said the 463000 prize will come in very handy 
ill use it to pay my debts and believe me ive got a lot of 
them 
he said spain has been overshadowed by latin america in 
literature for some time because of its foolish provincialism 
the family of pascual duarte from 1942 celas first novel

the vice chairman of the senate panel that 
heard four weeks of evidence against federal judge alcee l 
hastings this summer said today he will vote to acquit the miami 
jurist in his impeachment trial 
on the totality of this record weighing the incriminating 
circumstantial inferences against the exonerating factors and 
giving due weight to his other unblemished lifetime record i 
conclude there is insufficent evidence to convict sen arlen 
specter rpa said of the bribery conspiracy charge against 
hastings 
specter the top republican on the evidence panel also said in 
a 76page paper that he would vote to acquit hastings of charges 
that he lied to a jury that found him innocent of bribery 
conspiracy charges in 1983 
prosecutors in that case told the jury that testimony from 
hastings was false specter said obviously the jury did not 
accept those arguments 
he said impeachment evidence that hastings had improperly 
disclosed information obtained from a wiretap was neither 
convincing nor substantial 
specters comments came as the senate prepared to close its 
doors and deliberate the charges against hastings 
in final arguments the senate was urged on wednesday to 
disregard race as a factor in the case and decide the matter soley 
on the facts 
there have been a lot of cases in our judicial system in which 
race has been a problem rep john conyers dmich told the 
senate on wednesday this isnt one of them or i would be the 
first to tell you 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida history is 
accused of conspiring to get a 150000 payoff and lying to a jury 
that acquitted him of the charges in 1983 
he also is accused of improperly disclosing information obtained 
from a government wiretap 
the senate heard final arguments wednesday and planned to 
deliberate behind closed doors today a vote is expected before the 
weekend 
i wish i could be a fly on the wall for those deliberations 
said the 53yearold hastings as he emerged from the senate chamber 
conviction by the senate on any of the 17 impeachment articles 
approved by the house in august 1988 would immediately remove 
hastings from the us district bench in miami and stop his 89500 
salary 
it would make hastings the sixth official in history removed by 
impeachment the most recent was judge harry claiborne of nevada in 
1986 who fought in vain to remain on the bench while serving a tax 
fraud sentence 
district judge walter nixon of mississippi convicted of lying 
to a grand jury is also currently fighting to remain on the 
federal bench 
conyers a leading house proponent of civil rights legislation 
warned against any notion that race was a factor in the hastings 
case 
he said hastings was given a position of trust but he has 
betrayed that trust and he has betrayed those who looked to him for 
leadership 
we did not wage the civil rights struggle in order to trade 
one form of judicial corruption for another conyers said 
the senate galleries filled about equally with black and white 
faces broke into applause after hastings himself took the senate 
floor and denied he was claiming racial discrimination as part of 
his defense 
i am not guilty of having committed any crime that is my 
defense hastings said please act fairly 
hastings attorney terence j anderson of miami told senators the 
evidence was only circumstantial 
what you have here is swiss cheese he told the senate 
hastings appeared at a miami restaurant at a time set by an fbi 
undercover agent who was part of a sting operation against a 
washington lawyer claiming the power to influence the judges 
actions 
the judge also ordered the government to return 845000 in 
confiscated funds as washington lawyer william borders said he 
would in negotiations with the undercover agent 
both actions were offered by borders as proof that hastings 
would do as he was told and change two prison sentences to 
probation for a 150000 bribe 
house managers rejected a contention that the impeachment trial 
was unfair in light of his previous acquittal 
what if all the facts indicate the judges guilt rep john 
bryant dtexas told the senate we deeply believe that judge 
hastings conspired to obtain a bribe from defendants in his court 
that to avoid conviction for this crime he fabricated evidence and 
lied to a federal jury 14 times

an appeals court today threw out the convictions 
of four people blamed in a 1975 ira terrorist bombing after the 
government said investigators may have faked evidence 
relatives and others in the gallery of old bailey court cheered 
as lord lane the chief justice announced that the convictions had 
been reversed the court also reversed the convictions of two of 
the four in a second bombing 
ive been in prison for 15 years for something i didnt do 
gerard conlon 35 shouted to a cheering crowd outside the court as 
he walked free 
two codefendants also were freed a fourth was freed and then 
immediately arrested in connection with a murder case in belfast 
in addition to conlon the defendants included carole 
richardson 32 patrick armstrong 39 and paul hill 35 they were 
sentenced to life in prison for killing five people in an explosion 
at a pub in guildford southwest of london on october 5 1974 
but new evidence throws such doubt upon the honesty and 
integrity of a number of the surrey officers investigating this 
case in 1974 that the crown now feels unable to say that the 
convictions of any of the four are safe or satisfactory roy 
amlot of the office of public prosecutions told the hearing 
amlot said there was evidence that officers had altered notes of 
interviews and in one case covered up the fact that a defendant 
had been interviewed after being charged a violation of english 
law 
it is clear that a full criminal investigation of these 
matters is called for amlot added 
armstrong and hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the 
london suburb of woolwich on nov 6 1974 which killed two people 
and injured 26 the appeals court also reversed those convictions 
hill who was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a 
british soldier in northern ireland was rearrested as he left 
court he was to fly today to belfast where his attorneys said 
they would ask a court to release him on bail pending an appeal of 
the murder conviction 
the prosecutions case in the bombings was based solely on 
confessions the four repudiated in court the convictions were 
upheld in 1977 even after four members of an irish republic army 
gang made their own detailed confessions in the attacks 
the presence in court of irelands ambassador to britain andrew 
orourke reflected the irish governments efforts to have this 
case and other bombing cases from the 1970s reviewed 
in 1980 lord denning then the chief civil judge in england 
ruled against the six who claimed police had beaten them 
justice a nonpartisan legal reform group led by a former 
appeals judge said in july that false confessions were a leading 
cause of unjust criminal verdicts of which it estimated there were 
15 or more every year in britain

mayor art agnos said he was ticked off 
that vice president dan quayle had time for television cameras but 
not for him during a tour of earthquakedamaged areas of the city 
quayle who promised federal relief for earthquake victims after 
visiting the bay area wednesday today dismissed the liberal 
democratic mayors criticism 
i would hope that the mayor would resist any kind of political 
rhetoric at this time and concentrate all the energies and all of 
our dedication to helping the victims and helping the families of 
the victims and lets get the situation stabilized first quayle 
said on cbss this morning 
and on nbcs today show he said that he thought it was 
very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very difficult 
time i was there to help people 
agnos said wednesday he was ticked off that quayle flies 
around in a helicopter makes a bunch of television spots but 
didnt meet with him the mayor had said before quayles visit that 
he planned to meet with quayle to urge immediate federal help 
i understand he was in the marina and in the shelters and then 
left if he did so without visiting the mayor i have real 
questions about what he was doing here it may have been just a 
publicity stunt agnos said 
president bush said today he would go to the bay area on friday 
and presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said agnos would 
be invited to a session between bush and local officials 
fitzwater denied that the republican vice president had snubbed 
agnos 
agnos was invited to two meetings with quayle and he declined 
to attend both meetings fitzwater said 
furthermore we offered to send a helicopter to pick him up 
wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings and he declined 
that 
white house chief of staff john sununu has been trying to 
reach him on the phone for several days and he has declined to talk 
to us fitzwater said we regret very much that the mayor of 
san francisco has decided not to cooperate with us in this matter 
quayle met with officials in alameda county across san francisco 
bay to assess the need for federal assistance 
on his tour quayle appeared stunned by the magnitude of damage 
and loss of life inflicted by the temblor quayle and his wife 
marilyn spent six hours touring the area by helicopter and on foot 
after president bush authorized federal disaster assistance 
upon his return to washington late wednesday quayle said that 
federal aid would be forthcoming 
quayle accompanied by transportation secretary samuel skinner 
and sen pete wilson rcalif met with mayors of more than half a 
dozen cities around the bay and emergency officials at the alameda 
naval air station 
my impression was one of great sadness for the number of 
people that lost their lives and the families that are impacted 
quayle said after seeing crushed cars on collapsed portions of the 
san franciscooakland bay bridge and interstate 880 in oakland 
you cant help but be impressed by the magnitude of the 
earthquake he said to see 880 flattened like a pancake its 
really a sobering sight

two mannequins wearing the latest 
fashions stood undamaged in the window of fords department store 
around them the rubble of cavedin roofs crumbled walls and 
shattered windows littered the sidewalks 
tuesdays earthquake caused only four known deaths here but the 
damage was among the worst initial estimates were 350 million 
and mayor mardi wormhoudt said 30 percent of the downtown mall 
the citys heart was severely damaged 
the immigration and naturalization service said today it would 
send 15 dogs used to find victims of the mexico city earthquake 
would be flown in to search the pacific garden mall for people in 
the debris 
police arrested at least five people wednesday night after 
friends of a woman missing in the rubble marched to protest the 
decision to stop the search several yelled dont leave her 
there as they gathered by the destroyed santa cruz coffee 
roasting co where the woman an employee of the shop is buried 
police sgt joe haebe said people were arrested after they broke 
through barricades protesters said authorities tried to break up 
the march 
police grabbed people who went by knocking them with billy 
clubs said ericka burchett 
protesters urged officials to continue searching under 
floodlights police spokesman andy crane said the lights would 
create too many shadows for an effective search 
the shop was one of six buildings that collapsed entirely said 
wormhoudt this is as bad a catastrophe as anyone could imagine 
for the city the downtown business district as we knew it with 
many historical buildings is gone it will be built again but it 
will not be the downtown that we knew 
an estimated 20 downtown commercial buildings must be razed 
the heart of the community and its vitality said gary patton 
chairman of the santa cruz county board of supervisors 
the quakes epicenter was about eight miles northeast of the 
city of 45000 people 75 miles south of san francisco 
turnofthecentury stores made of brick bore the brunt of the 
quake as walls toppled onto sidewalks and roofs crashed through 
ceilings onto merchandise below 
one wall of the metropole hotel slammed onto the department 
store roof spewing rubble over the floor a rack of dustcovered 
dresses lay draped on the windowsill and sidewalk near the 
mannequins 
merchants hoping to return to business and residents of 
downtown hotels were kept behind yellow ribbons placed to keep all 
but emergency personnel out until structures were declared safe 
i no longer have a home wailed kathleen madden who lived 
in and worked at the st george hotel 
the towns most popular attraction the beachside boardwalk next 
to monterey bay showed some cracks in its games building there 
was no visible damage to the wooden giant dipper roller coaster 
across the street 25 residents of a senior citizens hotel were 
evacuated to a church because of cracks in the hotel 
everyone is hurt and everyone is going to need help with the 
recovery said county supervisor fred keely 
residents shopped at the few stores that were open stocking up 
on bottled water because officials warned the city supply might not 
be safe and charcoal briquets and batteries in case the 
electricity remained off lights were restored to part of santa 
cruz by midafternoon 
four of those arrested wednesday night would be charged with 
disobeying a police officer and the fifth with hitting an officer 
crane said 
haebe was not optimistic about the womans survival 
we have search and rescue dogs that specialize in finding 
people who are buried but they did not key into any sign of 
life haebe said if there would have been even a hint of life 
we would have taken more extraordinary steps 
the womans friends refused to give up hope 
shes a strong woman and i think she could still be alive

a major earthquake struck rural north china early 
today killing at least 29 people and flattening about 8000 homes 
official reports said 
a threeparagraph report by the xinhua news agency said 34 
people were injured it said aftershocks continued 
the quake was centered about 135 miles west of beijing on the 
border of shanxi and hebei provinces and was felt in the capital 
the epicenter was near datong famous for its yungang caves that 
hold thousands of buddhist paintings and statues dating back to the 
5th century 
it was not known if the quake damaged any of the caves efforts 
to reach datong by telephone were not successful 
the chinese quake came less than 24 hours after a massive 
earthquake hit san francisco but state seismological bureau 
officials said there was no evidence of a link between the two 
temblors 
bureau director fang zhangsun told xinhua that additional 
strong aftershocks were unlikely 
he said transportation and communications in the quake area 
remained intact and that relief work was being carried out but he 
gave no details 
an official at the civil affairs ministry in charge of disaster 
relief said were looking into it now call us back tomorrow 
the affected region is a dry windswept farming area where the 
main crops are wheat and other grains and most people live in 
onestory homes of unfired clay bricks such buildings easily 
collapse in an strong quake 
shanxi also is chinas main coalproducing province and the 
stark brown land is pocked with coal mines 
the seismological bureau said the first quake hit at 1057 pm 
wednesday 1057 am edt and measured 57 on the richter scale 
at least four others registering 5 or above hit in the next six 
hours including a quake of 6 on the scale at about 1 am today 
an aftershock measuring 51 hit at 629 pm xinhua said more 
than 300 lesser aftershocks were recorded 
earthquakes are frequent in china with the most recent serious 
tremor injuring 54 people and destroying 4000 homes in southwest 
chinas sichuan province last month 
five earthquakes measuring up to 67 on the richter scale 
struck western sichuan in a threeweek period in june and july 
killing 11 people 
chinas worst earthquake in recent history leveled the northeast 
city of tangshan in 1976 leaving 240000 dead by official count 
unofficial estimates have put the death toll at three times that 
number its magnitude was estimated at 80 
the richter scale is a measure off ground movement as recorded 
by seismographs the openended scale is logarithmic meaning that 
each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last 
thus the 69 magnitude quake that hit san francisco tuesday 
evening is 10 times stronger than one registering 59 on the scale

the senate today defeated a proposed 
constitutional amendment to ban burning and desecration of the 
american flag delivering a sharp rebuff to president bush on a 
highprofile issue 
the vote was 5148 in favor but constitutional amendments 
require approval by a twothirds margin in both houses of congress 
and the senate vote thus fell far short 
we can support the american flag without changing the american 
constitution majority leader george mitchell dmaine declared 
before the vote 
the measure would authorize the state and federal governments to 
ban burning and desecration of the flag 
eighteen democrats joined 33 republicans in support of the 
amendment while 37 democrats and 11 republicans voted against it 
bush repeatedly called for approval of such a measure saying a 
simple statute such as one approved by the senate last week would 
be inadequate 
critics of the amendment said it amounted to tampering the 
constitutional right of americans to freedom of expression but 
they also expressed concern that opposition could be turned against 
them at election time in view of the power of the flag as a 
political symbol as demonstrated in last years campaign 
those concerns appeared to ease a bit in recent days asked why 
that was mitchell told reporters this morning i think the sound 
judgment of the american people other lawmakers said they 
thought most americans are not very concerned about the amendment 
we in america have chosen not to take the easy way out 
mitchell told the senate we have chosen not to silence those who 
are wrong we have chosen instead to challenge them with the 
truth 
minority leader bob dole rkan making a final appeal for the 
measure declared that the flag stands alone as a unique symbol 
of our hopes and our aspirations and our ideals as a nation 
to say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeply 
enshrined in the first amendment is preposterous dole said he 
said it was wrong in view of law that make it illegal to rip the 
warning label off your own mattress in some states 
to be approved the proposed amendment needed 66 votes equal to 
twothirds of the senators present and voting it thus fell 15 
votes short 
dole was glum in reacting to the vote although it did not come 
as a surprise i think the flag should be flown at halfstaff 
after this vote he said 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee told colleagues that we did good work 
we saved the flag and preserved the constitution he said 
republican sponsors said the measure would end once and for all 
the controversy over whether laws against flagburning are 
unconstitutional 
the supreme court in june threw out the conviction of texas 
flagburner gregory lee johnson ruling that his freedom of speech 
had been violated within days bush called for a constitutional 
amendment 
the house approved last week and sent to the president a bill 
that would ban flagburning by simple statute bush said he would 
allow it to become law without his signature and vowed to press on 
for the amendment 
democratic critics said the amendment amounted to tampering with 
the bill of rights they said a simple statute would be better and 
that amending the constitution should only be a last resort 
some democratic senators said there was concern among lawmakers 
that opponents of the amendment would find their patriotism under 
attack at election time others said most americans were not 
worried about the issue 
democrats also directed fire at bush over his support for the 
measure 
i would have to be naive if i didnt think his motives have a 
political bias said sen dale bumpers dark after the vote he 
predicted the politics will have favored those who voted for 
this illconceived amendment tragic but true 
sen trent lott rmiss said he had heard the theory that 
passions have cooled on the flag issue but said they could be 
reignited 
just wait lott said he told the senate that if there were 
another highprofile flagburning incident the american people 
will rise again 
metzenbaum said the amendment demanded a kind of loyalty 
that is a hallmark of communist countris and rightwing 
dictatorships 
rejecting the amendment would be saying to the nation that 
there is a limit to how shallow our politics can be metzenbaum 
said

ohio were without service between 4 and 430 am but fewer than 
100 remained without power by 830 am said spokesman barrie

the nations 389 million social security 
beneficiaries can count on a 47 percent benefit increase in 
january that will boost the average retired workers pension by 25 
a month the government said thursday 
the annual costofliving adjustment the biggest in 7 years 
will increase the typical benefit check to 566 a month the social 
security administration said 
for someone who retires at age 65 in 1990 the maximum monthly 
benefit will be 975 up from 899 this year 
the raise announced after the labor department released its 
consumer price report for september mirrors the inflation rate for 
urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of 
1988 through the same period this year 
social securitys 39 million beneficiaries including the 
elderly and disabled reliant upon fixed incomes can rest assured 
their buying power will be maintained social security 
commissioner gwendolyn king said in a statement 
the increase will show up in checks delivered jan 3 
representing benefits earned for december 
the government also announced thursday that socalled wage base 
the maximum amount of earnings subject to the payroll tax that 
finances social security benefits will rise from the current 
48000 to 50400 next year 
only about 104 million of the 130 million workers subject to 
the payroll tax had earnings that exceeded the wage base this year 
the social security administration said 
however all workers and employers face higher payroll taxes 
next year since the tax rate rises from 751 percent to 765 
percent an increase that was approved by congress back in 1977 
the two changes higher wage base and higher tax rate mean 
the maximum tax on employees will jump by 25080 to 385560 in 
1990 for workers earning over 50400 employers match their 
workers contributions 
tax rates for the selfemployed rise from 1302 percent this 
year to 1530 percent in 1990 when half of the taxes can be 
deducted as a business expense the wage base is the same as for 
other workers 
next years benefits increase will be the biggest since a 74 
percent raise in july 1982 when high inflation rates translated 
into bigger costofliving adjustments benefits rose 4 percent in 
1989 
the social security administration gave the following examples 
of how the benefit increase will affect average monthly benefits 
aged couple both getting benefits up 43 to 966 
widowed mother and two children up 53 to 1173 
aged widow living alone up 24 to 522 
disabled worker spouse and children up 44 to 975 
all disabled workers up 24 to 555 
of the 389 million people receiving monthly social security 
benefits 62 percent are retired workers 7 percent are disabled 
workers and 31 percent are spouses or children of retired disabled 
or deceased workers 
for the elderly and disabled the increase in social security 
benefits will be partially offset by an extra 2 a month in 
medicare premiums which rise to 3390 in 1990 the premiums are 
deducted directly from social security checks 
the nations 45 million recipients of supplemental security 
income a federal program which provides a minimum income floor for 
poor people who are aged blind or disabled also will receive a 
47 percent benefit increase at years end 
the maximum ssi payment will rise by 18 to 386 for an 
individual and by 26 to 579 for a couple the first affected ssi 
checks will be delivered dec 29 
other changes for 1990 announced thursday include 
beneficiaries aged 6569 will be able to earn up to 9360 a 
year without losing some or all of their social security benefits 
up from 8880 this year congress meanwhile is considering 
raising the limit even higher 
beneficiaries under 65 will be able to earn 6840 a year 
without penalty up from 6480 
workers will need to earn 520 for a quarter of coverage up 
from 500 
the higher social security payments will increase the cost of 
benefits by about 11 billion from this years level of 230 
billion the treasury will have to spend an added 575 million for 
the higher ssi benefits

the chief editor of pravda the nations most 
authoritative newspaper was fired today and replaced by a 
confidante of mikhail s gorbachev as a week of kremlin wrangling 
over the press took a dramatic new turn 
an aide said viktor g afanasyev who has headed the communist 
party newspaper since the days of leonid i brezhnev would move to 
the academy of sciences 
sources said afanasyevs replacement will be ivan t frolov a 
philosopher and former editor of the journal kommunist who has been 
an advisor to gorbachev for the last year 
one wellplaced soviet source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the move would give gorbachev and his reformist 
allies control of pravda whose circulation is dropping as it lags 
behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national 
affairs 
the newspaper recently suffered an embarrassment when it 
published an italian newspapers article claiming the popular 
communist maverick boris n yeltsin boozed and shopped his way 
through the united states during a recent speaking tour a few days 
later pravda apologized to readers saying the story was based on 
hearsay and could not be substantiated 
the aide vasily p popov said afanasyevs replacement would be 
announced in fridays editions of pravda 
tomorrow youll read all that hes going to the academy of 
sciences popov said in a telephone interview 
the replacement of afanasyev 66 follows a special party 
meeting on the press that appeared to be aimed at reformist rather 
than conservatives such as the editor of pravda soviet journalists 
said that at the closeddoor session friday gorbachev tore into 
some of the stars of the glasnostera media 
he reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the 
editor of the countrys most popular newspaper the weekly 
arguments and facts for acting against the party and seeking his 
political downfall the demand triggered a move in the supreme 
soviet legislature and among the newspapers workers to defend the 
editor 
the source characterized the attack on the outspoken 
practitioners of glasnost as a gesture to party conservatives while 
his real goal was to gain control of pravda

diplomats and thousands of others who work at 
the state department risk adverse administration action if they 
fail to wear identification passes on chains around their necks or 
in other ways visible to newly hired guards 
a recent notice did not specify what punishment might be meted 
out to violators but warned keeping the pass in a pocket or 
purse or hanging from a belt does not constitute proper wearing of 
the pass 
the guards who recently replaced other private guards are 
posted at all building entrances and regularly patrol hallways 
they are dressed in policelike uniforms and carry walkietalkies 
which blare out instructions 
as in the past employees will move through turnstiles to enter 
or leave the building passes are inserted in the turnstiles while 
guards stand watch 
the notice said the purpose of the mandatory pass policy is to 
ensure that there are no unauthorized individuals on the premises 
and thus ensure the safety of employees and the protection of 
government property 
employees who do not display their passes after nov 1 will be 
asked to return to their office accompanied by guards to verify 
they are valid pass holders the notice said 
as with other violations of department security procedures 
instances of continued noncompliance by employees may result in 
adverse administration action being recommended the notice said 
the 350word notice told workers they could pick up neck chains 
and clasps for the passes at guard posts

spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez and 
president bush met today and discussed what bush called the 
unique role spain can play in furthering democracy in eastern 
europe and latin america 
both leaders hailed the 90minutes of talks as a reaffirmation 
of close ties between the two nations 
gonzalez also extended to bush an official invitation from king 
juan carlos to visit spain 
bush said they reviewed western efforts to bolster the economies 
of poland and hungary communist states struggling to enact 
political and economic reforms 
spains successful transition to strong and flourishing 
democracy makes it a powerful model for eastern european countries 
now attempting similar transformations bush said in departure 
remarks 
in supporting democratic change in eastern europe latin 
america and elsewhere i am convinced that spain can play a unique 
role for spain provides the world with a very special example 
he said 
gonzalez speaking in spanish said that in reviewing the 
international situation including arms control we agreed that 
the prospects today are encouraging 
we also underlined the importance of making the greatest 
possible effort in disarmament and arms control talks he said 
he also expressed sorrow for the victims of tuesdays earthquake 
in california 
gonzalez was thought to be carrying fresh proposals for bringing 
about an elected government in panama while allowing gen manuel 
antonio noriega to remain in the country the united states wants 
noriega to relinquish power and stand trial here on drug 
trafficking charges 
american officials said bush and gonzalez did not discuss panama 
in their initial talks but it was expected to come up tonight in 
their discussion at a private dinner at the white house 
gonzalez believes a solution might be possible if the focus on 
panama shifts away from noriegas personal fate and emphasizes 
instead the transfer of power to an elected government 
his visit took place 16 days after the failed coup attempt 
against noriega by dissident elements of panamas defense forces 
the administration has been searching for new ideas on how to deal 
with noriega and officials said they were eager to listen to 
gonzalez 
the official who briefed reporters on the condition of 
anonymity said there were some areas of agreement and of 
disagreement with gonzalezs proposal 
the point of agreement is that noriega ought to get out what 
happens after that we have a point of view and perhaps the prime 
ministers got a different point of view and well hear it when 
hes here the official said 
meanwhile a published report said the newly appointed top us 
military commander in panama has requested the evacuation of most 
dependents of american servicemen stationed there 
the washington times reported in todays editions that unnamed 
sources in panama say gen maxwell r thurman raised the subject 
with bush earlier this week at a white house dinner 
the sources told the newspaper thurman made the proposal to 
evacuate some 3500 dependents of us military personnel in panama 
to heighten the sense of war among us troops the times said the 
request is being studied by gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today the 
administration is considering whether to accelerate its plan 
ongoing since spring to get all federally employed civilians and 
military dependents either relocated to us bases or home to the 
united states 
he said that as of july 1 6300 defense department employees 
and dependents had either been sent home or relocated on the bases 
the us population break down in panama he said is 12500 
military personnel 2700 pentagon civilians and 11000 dependents 
under gonzalezs proposal outlined to american reporters in 
madrid in recent days a newly elected president in panama would 
have the power to name a new military commander to replace noriega 
who would have the option to remain in panama 
bush has held out hope noriega could be extradited to the united 
states to face drug smuggling charges he has given no serious 
consideration to determining whether it would be legally possible 
to drop the charges in the interest of promoting democracy in 
panama

nature lovers defending the countrys largest 
colony of rare egrets persuaded officials to halt an assault on 
nesting trees to keep bird droppings from coating parked cars 
from the birds point of view the victory came in the nick of 
time 11 of the huge trees had been ruined scores of the majestic 
birds have died and hundreds of others fled to safer environs 
for more than a century thousands of egrets have made their 
homes in 99 tall eucalyptuses beside cairo zoo and along sharia 
giza or giza street a main boulevard in this cairo suburb 
protected by law as an endangered species the snowwhite birds 
became a familiar sight they flew at dawn to distant fields down 
the nile where they helped farmers control insects then returned 
to their nests as the sun sank over the pyramids in the distance 
just as familiar in recent decades have been the cars parked 
along giza street usually splattered with bird droppings 
this summer owners of luxury apartments overlooking the zoo 
complained to authorities about the droppings and demanded action 
at midnight oct 9 the government sent dozens of men with 
bulldozers and chain saws they spent the rest of the night 
obliterating the foliage of the first three trees 
inadvertantly they also destroyed parts of the zoos antique 
iron wall and flattened an empty bus stop 
they made preparations as if it was a war said mohamed 
hussein amer the zoo official in charge of birds and animals and 
one of several activists who stopped the antiegret campaign 
it took two days for telegrams and phone calls to senior 
officials and police to halt the massacre by then 11 eucalyptus 
evergreens had lost all their branches as many as 200 egrets were 
dead and about 2000 others fled into the zoo seeking shelter 
its not just the issue of 11 butchered trees its harmful to 
egypts reputation amer said 
it was awful children running after the birds the stray 
cats eating the small helpless chicks in their nests it was 
terrible he said 
amer estimated 5000 pairs of egrets live on the 1mile stretch 
of giza street but mindy bahaa eldin a zoo employee from 
indianapolis said a 1987 survey counted 1604 pairs 
mrs bahaa eldin associated with the british international 
council for bird preservation said because the egrets breeding 
period was unfinished most of the chicks were too small to fly to 
safety 
the first day i saw the damage i thought a tornado or 
hurricane had hit at least 100 baby egrets were killed she said 
mrs bahaa eldin said gizas governor omar abdelakher 
insisted that the governorate had broken no law 
we havent killed any birds she said abdelakher told her 
the law bans hunting birds and we didnt do that 
on tuesday the newspaper alahram reported that environment 
minister atef ebeid had ordered abdelakher to stop the 
cleaningup campaign 
egrets tall and thin boast long white plumes spindly legs and 
elongated slender bills they have lived in egypt for thousands of 
years depicted on walls of ancient tombs 
although hundreds of thousands once filled egyptian fields they 
came close to extinction at the turn of the century as plume 
hunters shot them down to obtain feathers for hats a 1912 law 
declared egrets a protected species and their colonies rejuvenated 
but farmers using pesticides killed many of them 
the 99 eucalyptus trees were planted in 1954 alongside trees 
where the freeranging cattle egrets first nested 
the governorates report says that the tree branches were 
being removed because they were old dying and diseased said 
amer these eucalyptus trees live for up to 450 years and they 
are certainly not diseased 
another governorate administration about 10 years ago tried to 
trim the eucalyptus branches to get rid of the egrets but a public 
uproar ended it 
despite the temporary probird victory mrs bahaa eldin said 
she expects the governorate to insist on moving the colony but in 
a more scientific way so as not to harm the birds and without 
dismembering the trees 
a cairo university professor who passes the zoo every day 
waxed lyrical when asked about the assault on the trees and the 
birds 
one day it was like a beautiful woman whose hair was flowing 
in the breeze yesterday it was like somebody had shaved her 
head

northern californias experience should be a 
warning to midwesterners to strengthen buildings and plan for 
temblors on the new madrid fault which has spawned some of the 
strongest us quakes experts say 
the quake that rattled the san francisco bay area on tuesday 
has about a 1in3 probability of happening on the new madrid 
fault in the next 10 years said david stewart of the center for 
earthquake studies in cape girardeau we can watch whats 
happening out there and take a lot of notes 
san francisco is the best prepared city for an earthquake in 
the world what san francisco has been doing for a long time is 
going to pay off 
the california quake measuring 69 on the richter scale has 
been blamed for an estimated 270 deaths and hundreds of injuries as 
well as more than 1 billion in damage to property bridges 
highways and rail lines 
the earthquake that devastated soviet armenia last december also 
had a 69 richter reading but killed 25000 people and did 16 
billion in damage 
armenia was an example of absolutely no preparation stewart 
said were not as bad off as armenia but were certainly not 
anywhere near as well prepared as san francisco was 
quakes are much less frequent on the new madrid fault which 
runs from marked tree ark into southern illinois but scientists 
say there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 63 quake by 
the year 2000 
the new madrid fault is probably the most dangerous fault in 
the eastern half of the united states but there is far more danger 
of an earthquake on the san andreas fault said douglass wiens 
assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at washington 
university but thats not to say that theres not danger just 
less 
the new madrid fault has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4 
almost daily but the last one above 60 was in 1985 said 
brian mitchell chairman of the department of earth and atmospheric 
sciences at st louis university 
in the summer of 1987 a quake of 49 hit along the southern 
illinoisindiana border causing minor damage a series of temblors 
that ripped through the new madrid zone in 1811 and 1812 could be 
felt in boston and washington but occurred in a largely unpopulated 
area and the number of deaths is unknown 
there was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s but 
scientists say the new madrid quakes would probably have been up to 
87 the san francisco earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 83 the 
1985 mexico city quake that killed 10000 measured 81 on the 
richter scale 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude

south africas foreign minister held 
what he called friendly and constructive talks thursday with the 
southwest africa peoples organization the group that has fought 
south african rule of the territory for 23 years 
foreign minister pik botha on a oneday visit to namibia met 
with swapo and the other nine parties competing in preindependence 
elections planned for nov 711 no date has been set for 
independence but it is expected early next year 
botha said the united nationssupervised independence process 
was on track but technical matters still needed to be worked out 
he cited namibias currency telecommunications system and its 
participation in a customs union for southern african nations 
asked about his meeting with swapo leaders including its 
president sam nujoma botha said it was friendly and i would go 
so far as to say constructive 
he said south africa would accept the results of a free and 
fair election and was not interested in the ideology or color 
of the future government 
swapo said south africa was falsely accusing the guerrilla 
movement of detaining dissidents and deploying combatants in 
southern angola 
swapo said there was no evidence to support either claim the 
leftleaning organization also accused south africa of taking 
inadequate steps to demobilize koevoet a police counterinsurgency 
unit active during the guerrillas independence war 
a un team that visited angola and zambia said they found no 
evidence that swapo was still holding prisoners but they could not 
account for 315 people 
a group of us human rights lawyers the commission on 
independence for namibia last week called for a full accounting of 
the missing detainees 
relatives of missing people have taken swapo to court trying to 
get details on all people held by the organization outside namibia 
since 1980 
swapo said the case is an attempt to embarrass the organization 
before the elections the elections are for an assembly that will 
draft a constitution for independent namibia which has about 13 
million people 
the un independence plan stipulates that a twothirds majority 
within the assembly would be required for adoption of a 
constitution 
but one of the minor parties the national patriotic front said 
swapo may be trying to remove the twothirds requirement because it 
fears it wont win such a high percentage 
botha said the head of the un monitoring force in namibia 
martti ahtisaari supported the twothirds requirement 
the united nations will have 1395 poll watchers monitoring the 
elections another 500 police supervisors are expected soon which 
would raise the force to 1500 
the un transition assistance group in namibia also consists of 
4650 peacekeepers and more than 1500 civilians 
south africa which has ruled the territory since world war i 
signed accords in december with angola and cuba agreeing to 
independence for namibia if 50000 cuban troops stationed in angola 
are sent home by mid1991

while modern science provides better answers 
to why earthquakes occur the human response to these disasters 
differs little from that of centuries past 
praying to god was prominent among the answers set forth by 
the writer galesius following tremors in italy in 1570 and that 
was surely the response of many californians on tuesday and since 
that tremor 
galesius also urged coming outside during an earthquake 
which remains good advice and bearing patiently the troubles 
that could not be avoided 
two other recommendations from his pen covered strengthening of 
buildings to better resist future quakes though modern building 
materials and practices differ from what he had available 
his final suggestion was placing statues of saturn and mercury 
at the four corners of buildings 
galesius researched quakes that shook the regions around naples 
pozzuoli and ferrara producing a book that enumerated different 
types of shaking and suggested that earthquakes were portents of 
even more disasters in the future 
in his book galesius listed the many theories of why 
earthquakes occur including the thenpopular concept that they 
resulted from exhalations from inside the earth 
today scientists describe the movement of giant plates deep in 
the earth with quakes occurring most often along the borders of 
those plates where the rocks bind together for a time and then 
suddenly slip past one another when the stress becomes strong 
enough 
ancient scientists and philosophers however produced many 
theories in an effort to explain the shaking of the ground beneath 
their feet they were able to record the quakes over thousands of 
years and observed that tremors were more common in some areas 
than others 
one of the earliest theories was produced by the greek writer 
thales who lived at about 580 bc he conceived the earth as a 
great vessel floating on the oceans and thought that movement of 
the water caused earthquakes 
competing theories were produced by anaximenes who thought 
giant rocks colliding in the earths interior caused the temblors 
writing between 500 and 428 bc anaxagoras contended that fire 
caused earthquakes he thought that caverns beneath the land were 
filled with vapors and when the vapors collided lightninglike 
fire was produced shaking the land above the theory was similar 
to the one common then that lightning in the air was produced when 
clouds collided 
also in the fifth century bc archelaus theorized that air 
became compressed in underground caverns and eventually the 
pressure caused quakes 
perhaps the most important of classical writers on earthquakes 
was seneca who lived from 4 bc to 65 ad he believed that the 
interior of the earth was filled with cold clammy air which caused 
the quakes 
that theory was repeated by many later writers including konrad 
von megenberg in the 1300s who added the possibility that the 
stars stirred up these vapors he also believed that the earthly 
vapors caused the black plague then sweeping europe 
the venerable bede writing in england about 700 ad contended 
that earthquakes were caused by a large sea beast in the ocean with 
its tail wrapped around the world similar beast theories have 
abounded in other cultures 
in the 15th century the writers agricola and cardan expounded 
on the theory of fires within the earth with cardan emphasizing 
the possibility of sulfur and niter causing explosions beneath the 
land 
that theory remained popular for many years with nicholas 
lemery contending in the 18th century that the reaction of iron and 
sulfur was responsible not only for earthquakes but also volcanoes 
and thunderstorms 
as science began to learn more about nature electricity became 
a possible candidate with jeanclaude delametherie comparing the 
earths crust to the muscles of a fish reacting to the shock of an 
electric eel 
by the 19th century scientists were learning more about quakes 
with john mitchell of englands cambridge university discovering 
the movement of waves through the earths surface and domenico 
pignatoro of italy devising an early scale of intensity for quakes

ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam 
in a defiant response to rebel victories that analysts say could 
threaten his government has called on his nation to unite and 
defeat the insurgents 
in a rare hourlong speech broadcast nationwide wednesday 
mengistu accused the rebel tigre peoples liberation front of 
rejecting peace overtures and of being bent on creating an 
immense act of fratricidal war 
he said the insurgents also had joined in a sinister 
conspiracy to facilitate the secession of ethiopias northernmost 
province eritrea which has been the aim of another rebel group 
mengistu said it was for the people to decide whether to allow 
eritrea to secede through the machinations of the tplf or to 
defuse the vile conspiracy by mobilizing all the available 
resources and score a decisive victory 
we await the decision of the people mengistu said 
since august the tplf is reported to have scored a string of 
victories pushing government troops out of the rebels tigre 
province south into the heart of neighboring wollo province and to 
within 155 miles of the capital addis ababa 
diplomats say the offensive presents a strong challenge to 
mengistus marxist government weakened by a bloody attempted coup 
in may waning soviet support and one of the worlds poorest 
economies 
the rebels southern progress appeared to have included the 
taking of dese wollos regional capital over the weekend with 
government troops and bureaucrats fleeing without a shot being 
fired 
but western diplomats said the rebels did not occupy the key 
city and that backed by hundreds of reinforcements government 
troops and personnel started returning to dese on tuesday and 
wednesday 
foreign aid agencies have pulled a dozen or so expatriate relief 
workers from dese back to addis ababa apparently indefinitely as 
they monitor the military situation said the diplomats who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the diplomats said there appeared to be a lull in the fighting 
with the rebels hiding in the hills around dese and the government 
using the time to bring in reinforcements from the eritrean capital 
of asmara 
one of mengistus problems in slowing the rebels advance has 
been his demoralized army observers said after decades of 
fighting the force is principally made up of poorly paid young 
conscripts with little training 
i think above all what mengistu needs in dese is quality 
some trained troops who have proven their ability and their 
loyalty said one of the diplomats who described the forces from 
asmara as just that 
they were instrumental in putting down a may coup attempt that 
saw more than a dozen generals slain and more than 100 other senior 
officers jailed 
mengistu characterized the rebels as treacherous bandits who 
were biting our hand stretched out in peace 
in june mengistu offered to engage in unconditional peace 
negotatiations in the presence of an international observer with 
the rebel groups and the first round of peace talks between the 
government and the eritreans took place last month in atlanta a 
second round of talks is scheduled to begin nov 18 in nairobi 
the tplf in july and august broadcast statements indicating it 
was willing to engage in negotiations and tuesday said it had 
agreed on the basic idea of holding peace talks after a 
monthlong series of meetings in london with government 
representatives 
diplomats however who spoke by telephone from ethiopias 
capital were wary of the rebels statement 
i think the tplf is engaged in a strategy to build wedges and 
cracks in this government said one any talks should be seen 
in this light 
the tplf took up arms in 1974 seeking greater autonomy for the 
province of tigre and mengistus ouster the secessionist eritrean 
rebels have been fighting since 1962 in africas oldest civil war

vice president dan quayle briefed president 
bush today on the california earthquake and declared the federal 
government would put the maximum that we can behind the relief 
effort but members of congress said the emergency funds would fall 
short of what was needed 
bush said he would fly to the san francisco bay area friday for 
a personal inspection of the damage white house officials said the 
president would spend about three hours in the area 
quayle and transportation secretary samuel skinner were in the 
quake area on wednesday and told bush what they had seen and how 
federal relief efforts were progressing 
all federal resources have been marshaled skinner said in 
an appearance on the abctvs good morning america program 
the coordination in california is excellent i spoke to the 
governor and all his requests are being met 
quayle was asked on the nbctv today show if there was 
enough money available for the relief effort he replied we will 
put the maximum that we can behind that working with state and 
local levels of government to clean the situation up 
quayle brushed off criticism from san francisco mayor art agnos 
who said he was ticked off that the vice president did not meet 
with him during his tour of the area 
we invited all the mayors to come and sit down with us said 
quayle i think its very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot 
at a very difficult time 
agnos a democrat said quayle flies around in a helicopter 
makes a bunch of television spots i have real questions about 
what he was doing here it may have been just a publicity stunt 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today that not 
only was agnos invited to two meetings quayle held the white house 
offered to send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was and 
deliver him to the meetings and he declined that 
he said bushs chief of staff john sununu has tried to call 
agnos for several days and he declined to talk to us we regret 
very muth that the mayor of san francisco has declined not to 
cooperate with us in this matter in making sure there is adequate 
federal support for the disaster in his city 
the white house said an initial 273 million will be available 
for the area from a pool of 11 billion that congress appropriated 
after the devastation caused by hurricane hugo 
but rep vic fazio dcalif a member of the house 
appropriations committee said 11 billion isnt enough the bush 
administration will have to cooperate to find more money he said 
i want to do whatever it would take to make those dollars 
available he said no question we would want to take them 
funds out of existing programs 
the day after tuesdays earthquake bush visited the 
headquarters of the federal emergency management agency the office 
responsible for coordinating 25 departments brought in to handle 
the disaster 
words cant adequately convey our sentiments i know but i 
can say that we will take every step and make every effort to help 
the bay area in its hours of need bush said 
quayle said he discussed the importance of preparation with bush 
by telephone from air force two on his way back to washington from 
inspecting the damage in san francisco 
it could have been much worse if we had not had that 
preparation quayle told reporters at andrews air force base near 
washington i do believe its under control and we are making 
progress 
defense secretary dick cheney meantime activated military 
support military hospitals opened their doors to civilians and 
the defense department moved people and equipment into the area 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said 1173 california national 
guardsmen have been called up to help in quake recovery operations 
but he could now say how many active duty military personnel have 
helped since most of their efforts have been so impromptu and ad 
hoc 
williams said the us army corps of engineers has begun 
inspecting federal dams and levees and at the request of the state 
government state and private dams so far he said no damage has 
been reported for structures inspected within 50 miles of the 
epicenter 
also a u2 reconnaissance plane from beale air force base 
overflew the san francisco area late wednesday and fema officials 
in california will be given the pictures williams said the photos 
could be used to detect problems in structures 
two hundred navy seabees specialists in disaster recovery 
headed to the area equipped with backhoes trench diggers and water 
storage equipment to repair water and sewer lines 
heavy lift equipment from the naval air station at alameda 
calif was sent to remove debris from a collapsed section of 
interstate 880 in oakland where some 250 people were feared dead 
a c141 was to transport about 27000 pounds of fema equipment 
and 12 people from shepard field wva to california 
fema which set up a temporary headquarters in dontown san 
francisco prepared to open a permanent office as well as satellite 
offices in the seven counties where officials will process aid 
applications the smaller offices may begin operating in a few days 
federal assistance can include temporary housing grants of up 
to 10000 per family and lowcost loans to cover uninsured private 
and business property losses 
the american red cross operated temporary shelters for people 
left homeless by the earthquake even the internal revenue service 
came to the aid of residents volunteering to forgive penalties on

joe eszterhas says that michael ovitz head of creative artist 
agency threatened to damage eszterhas reputation in the film 
industry if he left the agency the los angeles times reported 
thursday ovitz denied the allegation 
what you were threatening me with was a twisted new version of 
the oldfashioned blacklist eszterhas wrote ovitz in an oct 3 
letter quoted in the times plain and simple cutting out all 
smiles and friendliness its blackmail 
in response caa released a letter ovitz wrote to eszterhas to 
deny the allegations 
when i received your letter this morning i was totally 
shocked since my recollection of our conversation bore no 
relationship to your recollection ovitz wrote 
the times said the fourpage eszterhas letter had circulated 
throughout the hollywood community which for years had speculated 
that the agency put pressure on people who wanted to switch agents 
the newspaper did not specify where it got a copy of the letter 
ovitz would not comment further on the letters or the charges 
but caa agent ray kurtzman issued a statement to the press calling 
eszterhas a very talented writer who had every right to change

ovitz has become a super agent in the industry using an 
extensive client list to exert influence over projects some

careers the times reported

more than half of the students at metamora 
high school students are boycotting the lunch program because the 
school board decided to offer only a pronutrition no junk 
food menu 
the rebellion is hitting the school financially and the 
students are getting backing from a local radio station and a major 
corporation which is offering free twinkies 
particularly rankling to students has been the administrations 
recent ban on the sale of soda and candy during lunch at the 
student council store that has put a significant dent in the 
student councils fund raising cutting projected annual revenue 
from 35000 to 6000 
protesting students have been bringing bag lunches for over a 
week instead of paying 125 for the schools hot lunch business 
has dropped in the cafeteria from 550 students daily to about 250 
students are old enough to choose what they want to eat 
said student council president stephanie smith a proud brown 
bagger 
we just want to get the candy and sodas back said brent

for and won a salad bar and milk shake machine for the 
cafeteria last year kids get addicted to it almost 
superintendent ken maurer who claims to admire the students

that addiction even if it means running a deficit in the lunch

just spinach pasta and high protein to each life a little 
enjoyment thats what hostess cake products are all about

the conservative editor of the communist party 
daily pravda the countrys most authoritative newspaper that has 
lagged behind glasnost was removed thursday and replaced by a 
confidant of president mikhail s gorbachev 
it was the most dramatic development in a week of kremlin 
wrangling about the staterun press that focused new attention on 
the information explosion spawned by gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness 
the departure of pravda chief editor viktor g afanasyev 
announced by the official news agency tass and staterun tv also 
marks a further attempt by gorbachev to clean house of 
conservatives in high positions 
last month three conservatives on the ruling politburo were 
retired 
the pravda editorship is seen as an important position 
afanasyev was allowed to sit in on closed meetings of the politburo 
and is a member of the partys policymaking central committee and 
ideological commission 
tass said afanasyev who has headed the party newspaper since 
the era of former soviet leader leonid i brezhnev now condemned 
as a period of stagnation would be moving to scientific work 
it said said afanasyevs replacement is ivan t frolov a 
philosopher and former editor of the partys theoretical monthly 
journal kommunist who has been an adviser to gorbachev for the 
last year 
a wellplaced source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the move would give gorbachev and his reformist allies control of 
pravda 
pravda which means truth and blares the marxist appeal 
workers of the world unite atop page one is still the place 
to seek texts of official speeches and articles about kremlin 
policy 
but its circulation now 96 million is falling as it lags 
behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national 
and international affairs 
many soviets turn instead to publications such as arguments and 
facts and ogonyok which are filled with breezily written 
criticisms of the system the arguments and facts weekly has a 
circulation of 26 million more than double last years figure and 
is the countrys most popular newspaper 
pravda last month suffered an embarrassment when it reprinted an 
italian newspapers article claiming popular communist maverick 
boris n yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through the united 
states during a recent speaking tour 
a few days later pravda apologized saying the story could not 
be substantiated 
afansyev aide vasily p popov said afanasyevs replacement will 
be announced in fridays editions of pravda 
tomorrow youll read all that hes going to the academy of 
sciences popov said in an interview 
the replacement of afanasyev 66 followed a special party 
meeting on the press that appeared to be aimed at reformers rather 
than conservatives like the pravda editor soviet journalists said 
that at the closeddoor session friday gorbachev tore into some of 
the stars of glasnost 
the kremlin chief reportedly called specifically for the 
resignation of the editor of arguments and facts vladislav a 
starkov 
soviet lawmakers the weekly newspapers workers and an 
international organization the committee to protect journalists 
rallied to defend the editor 
in an interpretation of gorbachevs tactics the wellplaced 
source characterized the attack on the outspoken practitioners of 
glasnost as a gesture to party conservatives while the real goal 
was to gain control of pravda 
another soviet observer said gorbachev was taking a middle 
course by trying to get rid of one editor who has angered 
conservatives and another widely viewed as an obstacle to reform 
on thursday members of starkovs staff said they had formed a 
work committee and elected him head in a bid to protect him from 
being fired the staff members speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the publisher of arguments and facts the znaniye public 
lecture society also supports starkov 
afanasyev has been pravda editor since 1976 in addition to his 
party posts is head of the official union of journalists although 
he has spoken out for glasnost afanasyev is closely identified 
with the brezhnev era when the press helped hide the countrys 
problems he favors keeping government processes under strong party 
supervision rejects political pluralism and has warned against 
allowing criticism of party policy to go too far 
last summer a deputy to a nationwide party conference listed 
afanasyev as among four top officials who actively pursued the 
policy of stagnation and should be fired of the others mikhail 
s solomentsev andrei a gromyko and georgy a arbatov only 
arbatov head of a kremlin think tank on the united states still 
has his job 
popov said afanasyev has wanted for some time to devote his 
attention more fully to the academy of sciences where he is a 
member of the section on philosophy and law and asked to leave 
pravda 
frolov 60 headed kommunist the central committees 
theoretical and political journal until 1987 and is credited with 
formulating gorbachevs foreign policy that places priority on 
fostering values common to all mankind rather than encouraging 
class struggle 
like afanasyev frolov is a full member of the central committee 
and its ideological commission and a member of the academy of 
sciences philosophy and law department

about 8 million poor children are being shut 
out of medicaid threatening their health and leaving them 
vulnerable to chronic and disabling conditions later in life a 
childrens hospital association said thursday 
skimping on medicaid for children is shortsighted public 
policy said robert h sweeney president of the national 
association of childrens hospitals and related institutions 
medical care denied poor children now can result in larger 
expenses in later years when they need treatment for illnesses and 
conditions that could have been prevented with proper care in the 
early years he said 
but a report released by the association said poor children are 
being forgotten as state governments balance their budgets by 
chipping away at medicaid benefits and tightening eligibility to 
limit enrollment in their programs 
the result the report said is that nearly half of the nations 
children living under the federal poverty level are not served by 
the federalstate healthcare program for the poor 
why must children be the ones excluded in this spasm of fiscal 
integrity asked sweeney theyll be paying off this deficit 
for years to come shouldnt they get some of the benefits now 
to ensure that theyre healthy enough to suport this 
responsibility 
jon e vice chairman of the association and president of 
childrens hospital of wisconsin said that after 25 years of 
public neglect medicaid is nothing short of uncle sams poor 
stepchild 
the association called for reforms that would ensure coverage 
for all children and pregnant women to 185 percent of the federal 
poverty level allow those with higher incomes to buy into medicaid 
and expand benefits for eligible children 
the group also said physician reimbursements should be raised to 
ensure that beneficiaries have access to care and enrollment 
procedures should be eased 
the changes would cost the federal government and the states 10 
billion and would add coverage for 75 million of the nations 
estimated 11 million uninsured children in fiscal 1988 the 
federal government spent 30 billion and the states spent 20 
billion on medicaid 
the report said medicaid coverage is denied to an estimated 8 
million poor children 
income limits vary from state to state this year an average 
income of 407 per month about 48 percent of the federal poverty 
level disqualifies a family of three from medicaid the report 
said in alabama the limit for a family of three is 118 per 
month ten states deny medicaid coverage to children who live with 
two parents regardless of income 
many children who are eligible dont receive benefits because 
parents are unable to complete the complicated application and 
documentation forms the report said

antarctic wilderness preserve accused washington officials of 
wasting their time defending a lost cause 
the united states britain and new zealand want a meeting to 
work out details of accident liability under an international 
minerals convention that would open antarctica to regulated mining 
and replace the existing voluntary moratorium on mining 
the convention worked out after six years of tough negotiation 
was initialed in june 1988 in wellington new zealand 
the united states says the convention is the best way to protect 
antarctica and a member of the us delegation who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said negotiations were proceeding smoothly 
nobody here wants to go home without an agreement he said 
but australia and france say mining and environmental protection 
are like oil and icy waters they dont mix both countries have 
refused to sign the mineral convention effectively stopping it 
and they have been joined in the last few weeks by italy belgium 
india greece austria and bulgaria 
australia and france want a meeting dedicated to discussing an 
ambitious proposal to declare antarctica a wilderness park 
where mining would be prohibited and human activity carefully 
controlled 
the meeting has made very little progress since the united 
states the uk and a couple of others had refused to stop pushing 
the minerals convention said an environmentalist with observer 
status to the conference we could end up without any agreement 
at all it would be tragic 
the minerals convention does not assign responsiblity for 
cleaning up and paying damages in the event of accident 
the argentine ship bahia paraiso ran around and sank near the 
us palmer station in january spilling 70000 gallons of diesel 
fuel into one of the most delicate ecosystems in the world 
argentina chile and the united states cooperated on the cleanup 
but the ship continues to leak 
to date no one has assumed responsiblity for plugging the leak 
or for the damage done to 22 years of american research measuring 
antarcticas unpolluted environment against global pollution levels 
delegates at the 15th antarctic treaty consultative meeting also 
were busy hammering out compromises on rules governing waste 
disposal and specially protected areas

despite dramatic rescues authorities had 
little hope today that more survivors could be extricated from 
between massive slabs of concrete sandwiched together on interstate 
880 
an army of construction workers maneuvered cranes around the 
fallen 18block section of the elevated doubledecker freeway 
while rescuers used dogs and electronic sensors to search for signs 
of life 
woodandpipe supports were placed under rubble along a portion 
of the collapsed freeway so workers could safely map the locations 
and conditions of smashed cars police sgt alan white said today 
it will take several days to place hundreds of supports and the 
mapping cant be completed until then 
as darkness fell wednesday police capt jim hahn said no one 
had been recovered during the day and he doubted there were more 
survivors 
more than 250 rushhour commuters were feared crushed to death 
between the decks of i880 the nimitz freeway which collapsed 
during tuesdays quake 
the search was moving slowly and meticulously because the 
highway was like a house of cards that could flatten at any 
moment said kyle nelson of the california department of 
transportation 
mayor lionel wilson was telling reporters wednesday evening that 
the search had found no survivors when police lt kristina wraa 
interrupted to say one had been discovered hahn later dismissed 
the report as garbled communication 
tuesday night rescuers were able to pull one man alive from a 
car crushed to a height of 18 inches said passerby patrick 
macintyre and emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of 
another automobile 
in perhaps the most dramatic ghastly rescue doctors freed a 
6yearold from a car after firefighters cut through the body of 
the childs dead mother 
dr jim betts lying on his stomach in the car crushed between 
the decks was forced to amputate the boys right leg while 
firefighters struggled to contain blazes that consumed vehicles on 
either side of the car 
it was appalling it was terrible said dr jack ellis one 
of two other surgeons working with betts were used to having 
them brought to the hospital not doing surgery under a concrete 
beam 
the child julio berumen was in critical condition wednesday at 
childrens hospital 
the childs mother and another adult in the car were killed when 
a pillar of the highway sliced through the vehicle during the 
temblor said fire capt ron carter 
gov george deukmejian speculated the highway collapse was the 
result of substandard construction he called for an investigation 
state transportation officials said the freeway one of the areas 
oldest had been reinforced and was considered earthquakesafe 
some years back bumper stickers reading pray for me i drive 
the nimitz appeared in the east bay but were presumed to deal 
more with the highways narrow lanes and concrete barriers than the 
threat of earthquake damage 
during tuesday evenings rush hour screams and the crash of 
metal brought residents of the surrounding neighborhood in 
impoverished west oakland to the scene 
they climbed up on the bridge to take people off they lined 
up to volunteer they established medical help as soon as 
possible police lt larry eade said i didnt see one instance 
of a citizen that didnt cooperate 
dorothy otto said she was driving on the lower deck when the 
quake hit 
suddenly the road started to bounce she said the cars 
were like ping pong balls they were bouncing 
i880 was built in 1957 and was reinforced in 1977 in the first 
part of a threephase antiearthquake program department of 
transportation officials said in the work the road deck was tied 
to its supporting columns 
the columns themselves collapsed and the deck did not slip off 
the columns transportation department chief engineer bill schaefer 
said in sacramento 
further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had been 
deferred pending an engineering study schaefer said 
asked whether the freeway had been considered safe from 
earthquakes schaefer said theres no such thing as an 
earthquakeproof structure but added he was shocked by the 
collapse 
we thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake 
we could have in this area anything that would happen in this 
area he told reporters

us secretary of commerce robert 
a mosbacher said thursday that soviet bloc nations must boldly 
commit themselves to free market economies if they want to solve 
their dire financial problems 
our hope is to see the soviet union and all the countries of 
eastern europe fully integrated into the community of nations with 
their citizens enjoying the benefits of free enterprise 
mosbacher said 
mosbacher was in frankfurt for a conference sponsored by the 
institute for eastwest security studies his remarks came in a 
speech prepared for delivery thursday evening 
the commerce secretary said that much work is necessary before 
east bloc nations that strengthen their economies 
there is no escaping the fact that the easts economic 
problems were homegrown and they can only be solved at home by 
radical and genuine change he said 
mosbacher added only the market place only free enterprise 
can solve the desperate economic problems of the eastern 
countries 
the bush administration official said the leaders of hungary and 
poland are committed to working for a market economy while each 
day soviet leaders come closer 
the leaders of the other eastern economies though are still 
living in the past he asserted 
communist east german leaders including new party chief egon 
krenz have called for a strengthening of an orthodox socialist 
structure east germany has an economy that is the envy of many of 
its soviet bloc neighbors 
mosbacher also addressed the critical question of financing 
changes in eastern europe 
competition in production alone is not enough he said 
independent banks are essential allocating capital on the basis 
of markets and interest rates and offering financial services that 
we in the west take for granted 
mosbacher 62 also referred to his own background as a 
multimillionaire oil company executive 
as a businessman im not accustomed to couching my views in 
the language of euphemism i prefer to speak forthrightly said 
mosbacher and ill say what we all know marxist economics do 
not work 
among the topics at the eastwest security conference mosbacher 
was attending is the integration of the reforming socialist 
countries into the world economy other topics include arms 
reduction and international cooperation 
west german foreign ministerhans dietrich genscher and italian 
foreign minister gianni de michelis were among the approximately 
200 participants

the nuclear regulatory commission on thursday 
turned down a citizen groups request to delay issuing a lowpower 
testing license for the comanche peak nuclear power plant in texas 
the request by citizens for fair utility regulation came just 
days after the nrc opened an internal investigation into 
allegations by an anonymous group of nrc inspectors that senior 
agency officials had covered up problems at comanche peak 
the anonymous inspectors in a letter to commission chairman 
kenneth carr on oct 4 said comanche peak operated by texas 
utilities electric co was far from being ready to safely begin 
lowpower testing 
the commission has not said when it would issue a lowpower 
license but staff members indicated thursday it would be at least 
a few weeks 
betty brink a leader of the citizens group said that as a 
result of the nrcs refusal to put comanche peaks lowpower 
license application on hold her organization would go to the 5th 
us circuit court of appeals in new orleans next week 
the plant is situated near glen rose texas about 40 miles 
southwest of fort worth 
the groups main argument is that comanche peak should not be 
allowed to fire up the reactor until the courts rule on the groups 
existing suit seeking to force a licensing rehearing the hearing 
process was officially closed in july 1988 
mrs brink said her group believed that the plant was not ready 
to operate safely and that even lowpower operation would put area 
residents at undue risk 
in denying the groups request the commission said it was a 
matter for the courts to decide because the commission previously 
had ruled that the group had no legal standing to intervene in the 
late stages of the licensing hearings 
the commission added however that it was ordering its staff to 
look into the groups charges of possible safety hazards associated 
with lowpower operation of the plant 
the owner of comanche peak texas utilities electric co told 
the commission thursday it expected to be ready to request 
permission to load fuel and start lowpower testing early next 
month although it gave no exact target date 
erle nye chairman of the utility said i am confident that 
comanche peak has been built safely

a decade of lobbying for pay equity has 
brought women and minorities in the public sector more than 450 
million in wage and salary gains according to a survey released 
thursday 
the prospects for achieving further pay increases for women and 
minorities in the 1990s are bright the study and its sponsors 
said because of the attention focused on the issue and because 
those groups will represent the majority of new entrants in the job 
market 
what the 1980s have done is establish pay equity as a viable 
way to end wage discrimination said claudia e wayne executive 
director of the national committee on pay equity we have made 
inroads and now in the 1990s we will move forward by focusing on 
grassroots education legislation litigation collective 
bargaining and other means of making additional progress 
the committees study a compilation of the results of state and 
local payequity drives since 1979 found that all but five states 
have studied whether their pay scales are fair to women also 
launching such studies were scores of city county and local 
governments and nearly 200 public colleges and universities the 
report said 
as a result 20 state governments have negotiated pay increases 
totaling more than 382 million in the past 10 years and cities 
counties and school districts have raised salaries more than 72 
million according to the study 
a decadelong movement for pay equity has resulted in bankable 
justice for tens of thousands of public workers said wayne in 
the jurisdictions that made made pay adjustments the costs have 
averaged between 2 percent and 5 percent of total payroll she said 
census bureau data for both public and private sector workers 
shows that in 1988 the average annual pay of women was 17606 or 
66 percent of the 26656 average for men in 1979 women made 59 
percent the amount made by men 
the census statistics show black men averaged 748 percent of 
the wages paid white men last year while hispanic men on average 
were paid 655 percent of what white men were paid 
white women were paid an average annual salary of 17851 last 
year 654 percent of the 27228 paid white men the census 
figures showed black women and hispanic women were paid 607 
percent and 545 percent respectively of the totals for white men 
the committees study was most encouraging for women showing 
that every state except alaska arkansas delaware georgia and 
idaho had studied or were studying how women in the state work 
force are paid but only three states have expanded those reviews 
to study whether minorities receive comparable pay new york new 
jersey and wisconsin 
the tackling of racebased wage discrimination problems has 
come just recently wayne said i think that more and more in 
the future those who are tracking the issue will look at both race 
and sex 
many states that have studied pay equity have yet to implement a 
plan to correct any discrimination the report said suggesting 
that advocates of pay equity also often referred to as comparable 
pay still face a daunting task particularly in states with 
fiscal problems 
to help overcome such obstacles wayne said unions which 
represent a majority of publicsector workers are in most cases 
not seeking back pay adjustments and are willing to receive pay 
improvements for women and minorities through incremental steps 
she said the committee had no solid data on pay equity in 
private businesses but said corporate leaders contacted by the 
organization are of the opinion that pay equity makes good 
business sense

argentina and britain agreed thursday to 
resume normal diplomatic and economic relations seven years after 
they fought a war over the falkland islands 
a joint communique read in spanish and english by argentine 
ambassador lucio garcia del solar and british united nations 
ambassador crispin tickell said both governments noted that all 
hostilities had ceased 
the announcement followed two days of meetings the first held 
between britain and argentina since buenos aires surrendered to a 
british task force on june 14 1982 after invading the windswept 
south atlantic archipelago 
the 74 days of fighting during which neither side formally 
declared war left 1000 dead 
today weve taken a very large step towards normalization of 
relations tickell said but were not there yet 
the agreement includes reestablishment of consular relations at 
the consul general level in london and buenos aires to be 
announced at an early date garcia del solar said that date was 
not too far off 
the agreement to resume consular ties is a precondition to the 
establishment of full diplomatic relations 
spanish sources had described argentina as being more in a 
hurry than britain to come to an agreement because of the latin 
american nations pressing need to normalize economic relations 
with london and desire to establish closer ties with the 12member 
european economic community 
the madrid talks were announced at the united nations aug 18 
they were made possible after argentine president carlos menem who 
took office in july agreed to drop the insistence of his 
predecessors that argentinas claim to the islands which it calls 
the malvinas had to be the first issue considered in any 
discussion of normalization 
tickell said there had been no discussion of the reduction of 
the 2000man british military contingent in the 200island 
archipelago off the southern tip of argentina a move the 
argentines reportedly favored 
i think you can assume there will be no change tickell said 
it remains one of the priorities of the british government to 
protect the security of the islands he said adding the 
maintenance of the british military presence remains important to 
that end 
the two countries also agreed to 
resume air and maritime communications following negotiations 
by competent authorities 
lift all remaining commercial and financial restrictions and 
restrictive practices imposed since 1982 
not pursue any claim against the other including nationals of 
the other in respect of loss or damage from hostilities and 
actions in and around the falkland islands south georgia and the 
south sandwich islands 
exchange views and proposals about measures to build 
confidence and avoid tension 
exchange views on contacts between the islands and the 
continental mainland 
renew normal cultural scientific and sporting exchanges and 
hold the next substantive meeting in madrid feb 1415 
for its part britain said it would send a trade mission to 
buenos aires nov 27 to dec 1 make available shortterm credit 
cover for british exports under irrevocable letters of credit from 
argentine banks and facilitate cooperative links between argentina 
and the 12 member nations of the european economic community 
britain also said it agreed to allow argentine merchant ships to 
enter the 150mile zone of exclusion around the islands and to 
align the limits of the zone with those of a zone designed to 
protect the islands fishing resources 
both countries also agreed to an umbrella clause that protects 
their respective claims to sovereignty over the islands which are 
inhabited by 1800 people most of whom are descended from british 
sailors in the 19th century 
argentine claims to the islands are based on the 1494 treaty of 
tordesillas by which spain and portugal settled conflicts over land 
claimed in the new world and on spanish possession to which 
argentina succeeded after declaring independence from spain in 1816 
british claims are based on continuous and effective occupation 
since 1833

the nuclear regulatory commission ruled 
unanimously thursday that the financial troubles facing the 
seabrook nh nuclear power plant have no impact on whether the 
plant receives a fullpower license 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon opposing the 
license said he will appeal the ruling in federal court seabrook 
officials say the plant could receive a fullpower license by the 
end of the year 
the nrc rejected shannons argument that public service company 
of new hampshire which owns the largest share of seabrook and 11 
other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plants safe 
operation shannon was seeking a waiver of an nrc policy that 
ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions 
in its ruling the nrc said that because seabrook will be 
allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make 
payments on past construction costs consideration of the owners 
financial condition is pointless 
the commissioners found the circumstances of the case didnt 
undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available 
funds adequate for safe operation said commission spokesman john 
kopeck the commission also said that it hasnt been shown any 
other significant link between the applicants financial condition 
and safety 
in january 1988 the utility filed for protection under chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy code a move that allowed the company 
to continue operating while it reorganized 
shannon seized on that development to make the case that the nrc 
should consider financing as a safety concern right along with such 
other issues as evacuation planning shannons case was rejected by 
the atomic safety and licensing board by an nrc appeals board and 
on thursday by the commission itself 
there is absolutely no question that we will appeal this 
said massachusetts assistant attorney general stephen jonas 
completed in mid1986 for 46 billion the seabrook plant has 
continued to run up costs from interest payments on borrowed 
construction money and from operating expenses the total price tag 
to date is 62 billion and rising at the rate of 100 million 
every two months 
seabrook already has a license to conduct lowpower testing and 
went through a battery of tests last spring the nrc citing 
various problems with the plant operation ordered seabrook to 
cease testing but according to plant spokesman ron sher the 
lowpower testing had already been completed

president bush on wednesday called natural gas 
a vital part of americas energy future and said he is 
absolutely determined to reduce dependence on foreign sources 
of energy 
bush addessing nearly 200 natural gas suppliers also appealed 
for support for his clean air bill which he said had emerged 
relatively intact from a house energy subcommittee last week 
the president noting he once had a tiny interest in gas 
wells during his years as a texas oilman said he remains worried 
about growing us dependence on foreign oil despite brighter 
prospects for world peace 
i dont like the ever increasing dependency on foreign sources 
of energy he said 
he said energy secretary james watkins is preparing a national 
energy strategy that will point the way toward bolstering us 
production 
that means not only more hydrocarbons but it also means a 
safe sound use of other energy sources sad bush 
bush recently signed the natural gas wellhead decontrol act a 
long sought industry goal lifting the last government controls on 
prices will both spur production and help consumers over the long 
run said the president 
natural gas is going to be vital to our domestic energy 
security said bush with growing difficulties in oil and gas 
leasing and difficulties in siting nuclear plants were going to 
depend more than ever on balanced energy sources 
with both watkins and environmental protection agency 
administrator william reilly beside him bush said his clean air 
bill is good news for clean burning fuels such as natural gas 
there is no question your industry is going to be in the 
forefront a vital part of this picture said bush 
the united states imported nearly 50 percent of its oil this 
past summer the highest level since the late 1970s one of the 
main concerns is that most of the increase is coming from middle 
eastern countries where political unrest could play havoc with the 
flow of oil 
bush addressed the gas suppliers at a briefing in the old 
executive office building

a 12yearold boy has been charged with 
manslaughter in the accidental shooting death of his 7yearold 
sister who was shot while he was playing with a sawedoff shotgun 
at home 
prosecutors said they determined that marvin williams was 
grossly negligent in deliberately aiming the weapon at the girl 
with his finger on the trigger the gun went off and calandra 
graham was shot in the face 
the shooting in which the boy was charged wednesday occurred on 
sept 13 before the oct 1 effective date of a new state law that 
penalizes adults who leave weapons left where they can be easily 
obtained by children 
the two children were alone at home at the time of the shooting 
and the boy told investigators conflicting stories of what 
happened said state attorneys spokesman randy means 
investigators later determined marvin took the gun from an 
unlocked cabinet in his 18yearold brothers bedroom and played 
with it for a few minutes before returning to his brothers bedroom 
to put it away 
there he saw his sister means said the boy pointed the gun at 
the girl and told her something to the effect of dont worry 
its not dangerous the gun then went off 
prosecutors believe the shooting was an accident but means said 
the boys conduct was so careless that it rises to the level of 
culpable negligence the standard used to prove manslaughter 
marvins mother mattie williams said when told of the charge 
i dont understand it but we will deal with it 
means said prosecutors had not decided whether to charge 
marvins brother efrem bolden with illegal possession of the 
shortbarreled shotgun an outlawed weapon 
in a similar case in orlando in june a 10yearold was shot and 
killed by a 13yearold who was not charged the 13yearold was 
not paying attention to where he was aiming the gun when it went 
off prosecutors said 
that was among a series of similar cases last summer around the 
state in which children playing with guns accidentally shot other 
children injuring or killing them and led to the new law that 
took effect oct 1 aimed at keeping loaded guns out of the hands of 
children 
since that law took effect tallahassee police have filed one 
charge against a man whose 8yearold granddaughter shot herself in 
the thumb with a pistol taken from an unlocked box and a 
prosecutor in palatka has said he would go to a grand jury with a 
case in which a 12yearold was killed by a 9yearold playmate 
showing off a rifle

pennsylvania engineers how to make bridges earthquakeresistant 
when reports of the killer san francisco bay area quake flashed 
across the nation 
lindsay r jones team leader and vice president of dynamic 
isolation systems wasnt surprised at the news but was concerned 
about the safety of his family in lafayette six miles east of 
berkeley where his office is 
we dont consider this a big quake a 69 on the richter 
scale he said at a pennsylvania department of transportation 
office where he had been discussing earthquake technology the 
next one could be the big one an 80 on the scale that would be 
10 times as destructive as yesterdays quake 
nonetheless jones couldnt make contact with his wife until a 
day after the tuesday earthquake that shook northern california 
she was unhurt 
jones also learned wednesday that a bridge on which dis 
installed special shockabsorbing equipment withstood the quake 
the sierra point bridge on route 101 is just north of san 
francisco two miles south of candlestick park 
one of our employees drove over the sierra point bridge 
tuesday night and it performed well this is very significant 
because the freeway bridge was retrofitted three years ago and it 
proves that our technology works he said 
the bridge had been retrofitted with seismic isolation bearings 
designed cubeshaped devices made largely of layers of rubber with 
a solid lead core in bridges the 3footsquare isolators are 
installed between the piers and the bridge deck to absorb 
vibrations caused by an earthquake

britain on thursday accused its 
former colonies in the commonwealth of promoting poverty through 
embargoes against south africa but australia proposed a plan of 
tougher financial sanctions 
our course is constructive we want to help the people of 
south africa british prime minister margaret thatcher said while 
under attack from fellow commonwealth leaders her officials 
reported 
australian prime minister bob hawke expressing disappointment 
at a new agreement by international banks to reschedule south 
african debt proposed the commonwealth press foreign banks to 
squeeze the whiterun governments trade financing 
hawke acknowledging reforms by south africas president fw de 
klerk stopped short of seeking a wider boycott of south african 
exports under his plan that would take effect after six months 
it would be churlish not to acknowledge there have been some 
recent changes hawke said but he added the fundamentals of 
apartheid remained 
the leaders of the commonwealth the 49nation association of 
britain and its former colonies will consider the australian plan 
this weekend south africa quit the organization in 1961 
the debt rescheduling announced wednesday of 8 billion of 
south africas 20 billion debt by foreign banks enraged some 
african leaders zambias kenneth kaunda denounced the banks 
mostly american and european as bloodsuckers 
in zambia the guerrillabacked african national congress the 
main organization fighting the south african government on 
thursday condemned international banks for the rescheduling 
calling it an act of inhumanity and as a means of helping to 
perpetuate the evil system of apartheid 
hawke said his proposal jointly sponsored by canada was 
supported by most of the other heads of government in the largely 
third world organization 
britain the largest foreign investor in south africa agreed to 
join a 10nation committee of foreign ministers charged with 
drawing up the summits final declaration on south africa 
but mrs thatcher the sole opponent of sanctions rejected any 
tougher measures or giving south africa a deadline to end 
apartheid the system which disenfranchises the black majority 
no one in this room would take instructions or accept 
ultimata a british official quoted her as telling the summit 
during the closed debate on south africa 
she said she found it strange to be a member of a conference 
which spent its time trying to increase poverty in so far as 
sanctions work they increase poverty added the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
on the debt rescheduling she commented that banks have a duty 
to their shareholders to recover debts 
without rescheduling south africa may have defaulted or 
suspended repayments 
hawke said the terms of debt rescheduling agreement were harsh 
noting that south africa must repay 15 billion by the end of 
1993 antiapartheid campaigners said south africa had a better 
deal than severely indebted mexico 
under the australian plan the commonwealth would call on 
international banks to restrict south african trade credits to a 
maximum of 90 days and to make it harder for south africa to get 
credit or insurance 
the proposal also endorses an africansupported blueprint for 
change stipulating negotiations with the african national congress 
mrs thatcher objects to that too 
hawke proposed the commonwealth investigate international 
monetary fund help of postapartheid south africa 
he said a commonwealth committee will meet again in april and 
review developments in south africa including whether de klerk 
lifted the state of emergency stopped hanging people for 
politically inspired crimes shown willingness to abolish basic 
apartheid laws and freed black leader nelson mandela 
hawke said the summit did not however set out specific 
conditions that south africa must fulfill by then 
south african foreign minister pik botha said it is 
irrelevant what is decided by such a conference some of whose 
member countries have never seen an election in their whole 
history many of whom dont have independent judiciaries many of 
whom have statecontrolled presses 
the commonwealth in 1986 adopted 11 nonbinding sanctions 
including bans on air links new investment and imports of 
agricultural products iron steel coal and uranium britain 
strongly resisted the idea of a list but eventually applied a 
handful of measures 
countries neighboring south africa including commonwealth 
members zimbabwe zambia and botswana support sanctions by other 
countries but refuse to impose them because south africa is their 
leading trade partner 
the commonwealth countries that impose sanctions tend to be ones 
that never have had extensive contact with south africa such as 
canada nigeria and caribbean and asian nations

the homes of two prominent 
leftists were bombed early thursday continuing violence that both 
the military and leftists say is intended to frustrate a fledgling 
peace process 
two sleeping bodyguards were slightly wounded when a bomb 
exploded at the home of ruben zamora a leader of the democratic 
convergence a leftist coalition 
earlier three grenades exploded on the roof and outside the 
front door of the house next door where aronette diaz vice 
president of the nationalist democratic union lives with her two 
sons 
mrs diaz who is the widow of ruben zamoras brother mario 
blamed the army for the attacks 
the armed forces press comittee coprefa condemned the assaults 
this kind of action serves only to escalate the violence 
generated by those who do not want to live in peace said an army 
communique 
zamora his wife and their five children were shaken up but 
uninjured by the blast the explosion destroyed the roof over the 
front rooms of the house in the southern part of the city as well 
as doors ceilings and walls in four rooms two cars parked in a 
carport in front of the house were demolished 
damage to the front rooms of mrs diazs home also was extensive 
zamora said the attack on the homes is intended to impede a 
political solution to the war he did not accuse anyone 
this is the work of people in the army who dont want dialogue 
and negotiation said mrs diaz they want to start another 
spiral of violence like in 1980 wheh insurgents waging the war 
against a succession of usbacked governments 
representatives of the government and leftist rebels on 
wednesday ended three days of peace talks in costa rica they 
produced no substantive advances toward a ceasefire in their 
10yearold war and managed only to agree to meet again 
but both the guerrillas farabundo marti national liberation 
front known as fmln and the rightist government of president 
alfredo cristiani said the groundwork was laid for greater progress 
in a meeting scheduled nov 20 and nov 21 in venezuela 
the government has proposed an immediate ceasefire while the 
rebels first want a series of economic political and social 
reforms along with guarantees they will be able to participate in 
national affairs as a legal political party 
a major obstacle has been differences on what constitutes a 
ceasefire and on how to establish one

the commander of the us and allied forces in 
europe gen john galvin said thursday that budget pressures force 
the nations military chiefs to haggle over pentagon spending in 
discussions that resemble aztec bloodletting ceremonies 
galvin who is the supreme allied commander in europe and the 
commanderinchief of the us european command spoke of the 
internal negotiations that go on among the nations highest 
military leaders as they grapple with budget cuts 
for the past five years the pentagon has had to deal with 
declining funds 
the fourstar general was asked at a meeting with reporters to 
address the issue that dwindling budget resources means the 
pentagon cant have everything it wants and may be forced to 
cut entire weapons systems 
defense secretary dick cheney currently embroiled in budget 
discussions with capitol hill lawmakers over the pentagons 295 
billion budget has attempted to cut programs such as the v22 
osprey tiltrotor aircraft and the f14d jet fighter but has met 
stiff opposition 
galvin said it is clear that given budget pressures the 
nations military will be pared down 
everybody is looking at this its a big thing for us we 
face an austere future galvin said at the same time we 
are responsible for deterrence and defense and so how are we going 
to do this how are we going to draw up these priority lists 
the fourstar general said he is taking part in pentagon 
sessions over the next two days where a lot of that is being 
discussed 
those are kind of bloodletting ceremonies like the aztecs we 
get up on top of the pyramid and try to work it out galvin said 
told that such ceremonies included trying to pull the other 
guys heart out galvin with a smile shot back thats what 
im talking about this is hard work and hard negotiating among 
service chiefs 
the general who elicited a hearty round of laughter from the 
reporters with his remarks hastily added that such negotiations 
are really done in a good spirit 
the general said he did not want to give the impression that the 
military chiefs are only looking out as far as the end of my 
nose and dont care what is happening the day after tomorrow 
he said that in order to respond to the changes that are 
sweeping the soviet union and the warsaw pact as well as the 
ongoing arms control negotiations the us military chiefs are 
doing a lot of thinking and are trying to draw closer and 
closer together on if you cant have it all what do you give 
up 
galvin said that such infighting among the service chiefs 
always goes on but as you get into more austerity it gets 
worse

a worldwide ban on trade in ivory 
was formally extended thursday to cover hundreds of tons of 
supplies already stockpiled despite arguments that the move will 
increase smuggling 
environmentalists welcomed the decision by the 103nation 
convention on international trade in endangered species which on 
tuesday agreed to a ban on ivory trading to protect the dwindling 
african elephant population 
the conventions secretariat proposed that the sale of existing 
stockpiles be exempt but delegates thursday rejected this and 
endorsed by consensus a decision to apply it to all ivory 
spokesman jeanpatrick le duc said the secretariat made the 
proposal because of fears smugglers will move in to meet demand if 
the sale of legally acquired stocks is outlawed that view was 
echoed by hong kong which is believed to hold the majority of 
stockpiled ivory 
if existing stocks were allowed to be traded under close 
monitoring it would not enhance poaching a ban might pose more 
difficulties a hong kong representative on the british 
delegation said on condition of anonymity 
he said the ban would have a drastic impact on the 3000 
people in hong kong who carve and work ivory many of whom are 
elderly craftsmen 
hong kong a british colony has no separate voting rights and 
officials said britain abstained in the committee vote out of 
respect for hong kong 
on tuesday the conference approved by consensus a formal ban on 
ivory trade with a provision that countries that prove sound 
wildlife management can apply for a resumption of limited trade 
this amounts to at least a twoyear moratorium because any 
exemptions are not likely to be considered before the next 
conference in 1991 
welcoming the decision to include stockpiles in the ban 
environmentalist tom milliken said continued trade in stockpiles 
would have unleashed a nightmare for enforcement of the ban 
steve cobb of the ivory trade review group agreed there is 
far less sympathy for the owners of stockpiles the majority of 
which are of illegal origin than for the african nations affected 
by the ban which manage their herds well he said 
the conference which ends friday was attended by about 400 
government delegates and 400 observers from numerous environmental 
groups 
while considering about 300 endangered animals and plants 
delegates focused on the african elephant whose numbers are 
estimated to have been cut in half to 600000 in the past decade

the senate on thursday defeated a proposed 
constitutional amendment to ban burning and desecration of the 
american flag dealing a sharp rebuff to president bush on an issue 
he had put in the spotlight 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said as the 
senate defeated the amendment we do not serve our national 
tradition by forcing americans to make a false and unnecessary 
choice between the flag and the constitution 
however republican leader bob dole said i think the flag 
should be flown at halfstaff after this vote 
the white house said bush was disappointed at the senates 
action 
the proposal won a slight majority 5148 but that was 15 votes 
short of the twothirds of senators present and voting that was 
needed for approval 
democrats led the opposition but the vote was hardly along 
strict party lines thirtythree republicans and 18 democrats voted 
for the measure while 11 republicans and 37 democrats opposed it 
congress gave final passage last week to a bill to ban flag 
burning by simple statute 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said after thursdays vote 
that bush continued to believe that a constitutional amendment 
offered the only real protection for the flag and that the 
law which he will allow to take effect without his signature 
would not survive constitutional scrutiny 
he had called for the constitutional amendment in june after the 
supreme court threw out the conviction of texas flag burner gregory 
lee johnson on grounds that a texas flagburning law violated his 
constitutional right of freedom of speech 
arguing broke out between the parties even after the vote as 
democrats charged that bush and gop national chairman lee atwater 
had pushed the amendment to put pressure on them he has used his 
high office for a low purpose sen edward m kennedy dmass 
said of bush 
but sen arlen specter rpa noted that 18 democrats had 
supported the measure i do not think this is a partisan matter 
that is being engineered for crass political purposes 
the argument that the issue could be a potent election weapon 
against senators who opposed the amendment appeared to lose steam 
this week 
mitchell told reporters thursday morning before the vote that 
the outcome by then sure was due to the sound judgment of the 
american people other lawmakers said most americans apparently 
are not overly interested in the proposed amendment 
the measure would have authorized state and federal governments 
to ban burning and desecration of the flag critics said the danger 
to the flag was not as great as to the bill of rights 
for 200 years they have protected the liberties of americans 
through economic turmoil civil war political strife social 
upheaval and international tension mitchell said 
despite the worst that fate has hurled at us we have never 
found it necessary to abandon the fundamental principles on which 
our government was founded and by which our liberties are 
secured he added 
we face no sudden or controllable burst of flag destruction 
we face no massive alienation by our people from the symbols and 
traditions of our nation yet we are being asked to believe that 
the flag which neither hitler nor stalin could defeat is now 
threatened by a single misguided person who most americans never 
heard of and dont care about mitchell said 
in a final appeal on behalf of the measure senate minority 
leader dole rkan took the senate floor to invoke the history of 
the flag from iwo jima to the moon landing 
to say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeply 
enshrined in the first amendment is preposterous dole said he 
said it was wrong in view of laws that make it illegal to rip the 
warning label off your own mattress in some states 
the purpose the need for this amendment will not be found in 
a textbook or in a treatise on constitutional law dole said 
no it will be found in the emotions of the heart emotions 
deeply rooted in the real life experiences of millions of americans 
and emotions that are crying out today to give the flag real and 
lasting protection 
the vote came as no surprise to republicans two gop 
cosponsors sens john c danforth of missouri and warren rudman 
of new hampshire dropped their support tuesday and joined the 
ranks of the critics

angry words flew between the white house and 
san franciscos city hall thursday as the bush administration came 
under attack for the second time in a month for steering clear of 
the democratic mayor of a city devastated by a natural disaster 
a publicity stunt was how mayor art agnos characterized 
vice president dan quayles tour of the earthquakestricken san 
francisco bay area 
we regret very much that the mayor of san francisco has 
decided not to cooperate with us in this matter in making sure that 
there is adequate federal support for the disaster white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater retorted 
the spat between quayle and agnos was reminiscent of the 
controversy surrounding president bushs visit to south carolina 
after hurricane hugo 
the president bypassed charleston despite an invitation from 
democratic mayor joseph p riley jr instead bush toured suburban 
summerville a community about 20 miles inland which was not as 
hardhit as the city 
airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice but everything 
is on the ground riley said the buildings are on the ground 
the people are on the ground the stress is on the ground and we 
need a president who is on the ground 
bush flew to south carolina eight days after hugo devastated the 
charleston area with his administration under fire from officials 
including riley and democratic sen ernest f hollings who said the 
federal government was bungling relief efforts 
riley was left at the airport as bush took his whirlwind tour 
republican gov carroll campbell who was bushs southern campaign 
chairman in the last election and sen strom thurmond rsc 
accompanied the president 
asked by reporters at the time why he was left behind riley 
replied i wasnt invited in an interview thursday riley said 
he shook hands with bush at the airport but i didnt really have 
a chance to discuss anything with him i just had a chance to tell 
him the people of charleston were really hurting 
the quayleagnos flap erupted as bush was preparing to fly to 
california on friday to view earthquake damage 
when fitzwater was asked if the president would meet with agnos 
the spokesman at first replied 
the president will meet with mayors and local officials from 
the local area absolutely 
what about that mayor pressed reporters 
everyone will be invited absolutely fitzwater said 
a short time later the white house announced that the mayors of 
san francisco oakland and alameda would accompany the president on 
his tour of the area 
the white house insisted that quayles decision to pass up a 
visit with agnos was not politically motivated 
agnos said he was ticked off by quayles decision not to see 
him separately 
quayle and transportation secretary samuel skinner visited the 
bay area on wednesday met with dozens of local and state officials 
and paved the way for bushs visit 
agnos complained that quayle flies around in a helicopter 
makes a bunch of television spots i understand he was in the 
marina district and in the shelters and then left 
if he did so without visiting the mayor i have real questions 
about what he was doing here it may have been just a publicity 
stunt 
quayle in turn called agnos charge a political shot and 
said we invited all the mayors to come and sit down with us 
interviewed on cbs this morning quayle said i would hope 
the mayor would resist any kind of political rhetoric at this time 
and concentrate on helping victims 
fitzwater said agnos was invited to two separate meetings that 
quayle and skinner held with local officials 
we offered to send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was 
and deliver him to the meetings and he declined that fitzwater 
said 
he also said chief of staff john sununu repeatedly tried to 
contact agnos by phone and he has declined to talk to us

libya has secretly escalated its weapons 
supplies to somalia to replace dwindling us aid but the recent 
arrival of arms and libyan officers to the port of mogadishu was 
witnessed by the american ambassador sources said thursday 
the somali government headed by president siad barre has 
become increasinly desperate to obtain military hardware in the 
face of growing challenges from rebels in various parts of the 
country 
us military aid to somalia has been shrinking for several 
years as a protest against the governments human rights abuses 
but there are still some us military personnel advising the 
somali military 
the united states is currently seeking to renegotiate the 
agreement for use of the red sea port of berbera by us navy 
vessels the us facility is used mostly by sailors on shore leave 
from duty in the indian ocean 
a report commissioned by the state department last summer 
concluded that the somali army murdered at least 5000 civilians 
over an 11month period 
barre who has also been shunned by the soviet union and 
potential allies in the moslem world turned to libyas leader 
moammar gadhafi last year but information disseminated by somali 
opposition groups about the libyan deliveries has been hard to 
verify 
libya is increasing its assistance to the somali government 
to our knowledge this includes military hardware but no troops or 
military advisers said a recent state department statement 
but other sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
libyan ship which docked in mogadishu recently discharged 18 libyan 
officers including 6 pilots the ship also carried 10 tanks and 10 
longrange sovietmade cannons they said 
the ships docking was witnessed by barre himself as well as by 
us ambassador frank crigler said the sources 
a state department official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity confirmed that a libyan ship had docked in mogadishu but 
declined to discuss other details 
he said the libyan aid was not massive and included rifles 
and ammunition but the fact that its libyan is disconcerting 
he added 
dissident somali groups say libya has also supplied the barre 
government with chemical weapons especially mustard gas but 
sources in the intelligence community say there are conflicting 
views about the veracity of the reports 
gadhafi reportedly plans a visit to somalia on oct 21 
somalia which shifted its alliance from the soviet union to the 
west in 1977 has also been buying arms on the open market although 
it is experiencing a cash problem because of a heavy foreign debt 
congress earlier this year turned down an administration request 
to approve 21 million for somalia to pay its arrears to the 
international monetary fund so it can become eligible for 
additional loans the administration decided not to press the 
request saying it could not make a convincing case in light of 
recent events in somalia

the former tanker captain whose ship 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil wants a federal 
court to block his prosecution arguing that his prompt reporting 
of the spill grants him immunity 
in a motion filed wednesday in us district court in fairbanks 
former exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwoods attorneys argue that 
a 1976 clean water law precludes criminal prosecution over the 
nations biggest oil spill 
hazelwood has filed a similar motion in state superior court 
claiming alaska law also grants immunity from prosecution to people 
who promptly report spills they cause 
the state has filed three felony charges and three misdemeanors 
against hazelwood they accuse him of criminal mischief operating 
a ship while intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil 
defense attorney dick madson said state officials are prohibited 
by federal law from using hazelwoods statements to the coast guard 
in any criminal proceedings 
soon after the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef on march 
24 hazelwood called the coast guard by radio to report the 
situation 
within a week the state filed the misdemeanor charges and 
later added the felony criminal mischief counts hazelwood was 
fired by exxon 
the charges have been consolidated for a single trial but the 
case has been postponed repeatedly a hearing on motions is 
scheduled friday a hearing a week from friday will determine where 
his trial is to be held 
there was no indication when the federal courts might consider 
the matter

parliament passed a bill thursday 
allowing opposition parties to compete in national elections and 
it also dealt the ruling socialist party a setback by banning 
politics from the workplace 
the legislators who have amended the constitution to reflect 
democratic ideals rejected an alternative motion by the socialist 
party to restrict political activities to shop and factory floors 
such politicization of the workplace has been a key weapon of 
communist indoctrination and is sharply opposed by opposition 
groups 
the socialist party formed oct 7 to replace the communist 
party that had ruled hungary since 1948 has vowed commitment to 
democracy but many of its leaders were ranking members of the old 
party 
last week it overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the 
right to continue to organize at the workplace 
constitutional amendments formally ending oneparty rule and 
giving political parties the right to be freely established and 
to freely function were approved wednesday the law passed 
thursday formally outlines the rights of parties wishing to field 
candidates in next years elections due by june 
they will be the first freely contested elections here since 
1947 
the bill also places limits on the contributions parties may 
receive and it draws the line between funds and property the 
ruling party legally acquired and other assets owned by the state 
but controlled by the party 
the assets valued at nearly 200 million have been a 
contentious issue between the party and the opposition which 
claims much party wealth was seized illegally 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said hungary has taken yet another historic and courageous step 
toward democracy 
the constitution institutionalizes many of the laws and 
practices implemented in recent months to reform hungary from a 
state controlled by the communist party to one of democratic 
pluralism she said 
a proposed law regulating next years election envisions a 
modified system of proportional representation designed to give all 
parties contesting the elections a chance to win mandates 
interior minister istvan horvath who presented the bill said 
it was evidence of the transition to democracy the franchise 
is a basic political right of the citizens he said 
he pledged that the stateowned media will carry each partys 
manifesto and campaign summary without biased comment 
parliament also approved establishment thursday of a 
constitutional court which will have the power to dismiss laws 
contrary to the constitution 
its 15 members will not be permitted to belong to any party or 
to have recently held any government post 
the constitutional amendments passed wednesday established the 
office of president of the republic who will replace the 21man 
collective presidency still to be decided is when and how the 
president will be elected 
a presidential election is tentatively scheduled nov 26 some 
opposition groups want the president to be chosen later fearing 
the ruling party will have too strong of an advantage if elections 
are held next month the issue is expected to be discussed this 
week

newton hazell found the sweetest treat of all at 
the bottom of his cookie jar a longforgotten lottery ticket 
worth 13 million that would have become worthless just four days 
later 
isnt that something this was down to the nitty gritty 
another week and i would have lost it the metuchen nj 
correction officer said thursday 
hazell 58 bought the new york lotto ticket for the oct 22 
1988 drawing at a delicatessen on staten island selecting the 
same numbers he picks every week 7 9 13 21 34 and 43 he 
dumped the ticket into his cookie jar at home and never checked to 
see if he won 
i just stuck it in and forgot all about it said hazell who 
works at the arthur kill correctional facility on staten island 
last week hazell was back in the deli when he noticed a sign 
encouraging lotto players to check their tickets because a 13 
million prize was still unclaimed a newspaper story pinned next to 
the sign showed the missing ticket contained his numbers thats 
when hazell began to search 
i looked everywhere because i saw my numbers i went through 
dressers drawers under the mattress i went through a bag where i 
throw all my losing tickets he said 
then hazel said he got a feeling about the cookie jar and went 
to check it out there it was all by itself 
winners have one year to produce their tickets hazell showed up 
wednesday with just 96 hours to spare 
state lottery spokesman bill knowlton said it was the longest 
anybody had ever waited to claim a prize two other people also 
picked winning numbers in the same drawing and both had already 
claimed their shares of a 4 million jackpot he said 
hazell whose winning numbers combined his birthday 
anniversary daughters age and license plate number said the 
windfall wont have any immediate effect on his lifestyle 
im not going to retire im a young 58 going on 25 he 
said im going to stay very active

a public argument on middle east policy between 
israel and the united states has stalled peace efforts at least 
until prime minister yitzhak shamir visits washington next month 
officials said thursday 
shamir declared tuesday the two allies were entering a period 
of tension and israel will not be pushed or pressured 
the next day state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
described his comments as unhelpful 
frank g wisner us ambassador to egypt said thursday the 
united states and egypt feel creative diplomacy can renew 
progress toward peace in the region 
no doors have been closed no last words have been spoken 
wisner said in cairo after spending more than three hours at the 
foreign ministry he delivered a message from secretary of state 
james a baker iii to esmat abdelmeguid the egyptian foreign 
minister 
abdelmeguid would not say what the message contained he later 
told a meeting of the usegyptian chamber of commerce that egypt 
wants the american role in middle east politics to continue 
until the remarks tuesday to members of his rightwing likud 
bloc shamir had avoided confrontations with us leaders despite 
his disagreement with the dialogue washington began in december 
with the palestine liberation organization 
yossi ahimeir director of shamirs office said the prime 
minister spoke out because of what he considered growing attempts 
by the bush administration to get israel into negotiations with the 
plo israel defines the plo as a terrorist group and refuses to 
deal with it 
what he meant was that there is liable to be a period of 
differences but he is doing everything to prevent it ahimeir 
said in an interview thursday 
on thursday israel radio revealed another apparent effort to 
diffuse tensions the radio said shamir wrote baker praising his 
efforts to advance peace in the middle east but emphasizing 
israels opposition to talks with the plo 
shamir aides could not be reached for comment on the letter 
the latest us efforts led by baker are aimed at starting 
israelipalestinian talks about israels plan for residents of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip to elect delegates for 
negotiations with the israelis 
israels cabinet leadership rejected bakers suggestions two 
weeks ago claiming they opened the door to indirect plo 
involvement but baker pursued the matter in private conversations 
with foreign minister moshe arens 
ahimeir indicated shamir felt the united states had betrayed the 
essence of the israeli plan which excludes the plo 
we are sorry that only five months have passed since shamir 
introduced the peace plan and everyone has already lost patience 
and is running to the plo with open arms he said 
there are now changes in the american position and they want 
to add things we will not accept anything where the bottom line 
will be to sit down with the plo 
news reports in israel said shamir called president bush on 
tuesday after making his comments to take issue with the latest 
us peace moves 
ahimeir confirmed the 10minute conversation occurred but would 
not give detais he said only that the tone was friendly and 
shamir expressed his views 
the daily haaretz quoting a senior bush administration official 
it did not name said the president told shamir he was 
disappointed by the remarks 
two senior israeli officials said privately the result of the 
conversation was a decision to put a temporary hold on american 
peace efforts until shamirs trip to washington in midnovember a 
statement from shamirs office thursday said he and bush decided to 
discuss peace issues further at that time 
israeli newspapers criticized the prime ministers comments 
even the conservative maariv published an editorial thursday called 
shamir is looking for confrontation 
it said the americans might respond by turning to pressing 
domestic matters and putting the middle east on the back burner 
because after all advancing toward peace in the region is more 
important for israel than for them

black bear sightings in colorado and new mexico 
cities and campgrounds have doubled this year because dry weather 
has cut into the animals normal food supply forcing them to risk 
confrontations with humans 
scavenging bears have pawed through campsites trash cans and 
dumps showed up on golf courses and even entered one home to 
empty a refrigerator of groceries and wine 
they are capable of eating so many different things said 
todd malmsbury colorado department of wildlife public information 
officer theyll be happy to go up to a picnic table and eat your 
breakfast for you 
colorados spring and summer were drier than normal which 
damaged the berry and acorn crops as well as foliage that bears 
feed on officials said 
the plight of the hungry bears has become more evident as the 
animals prepare to hibernate in early november 
if female bears hibernate without an adequate fat reserve they 
can lose their cubs other bears without enough fat can die but 
biologists wont know what kind of effect the food shortage will 
have on the mortality rate until spring when a survey of cubs can 
be made said bob davies a state wildlife biologist based in 
colorado srings 
although the colorado wildlife agency does not keep statewide 
figures on bear sightings malmsbury said a good guess would be 
they have at least doubled this year 
weve had problems almost statewide you tend to have more 
problems where the people are said bob davies a state wildlife 
biologist based in colorado springs 
in albuquerque nm there have been 26 bear sightings since 
august said mark birkhauser a conservation officer with the new 
mexico department of game and fish that compares with one or two 
sightings in an average year 
statewide weve been having trouble birkhauser said the 
extreme hotspots are albuquerque of course because its a big 
metro area and down near capitan in the capitan mountains where 
the bears are feeding on sheep 
in southeastern colorado which has the states largest 
concentration of black bears wildlife officers have trapped and 
relocated more than 60 bears malmsbury said fewer than 20 bears 
are trapped and relocated in that area in an average year 
along the front range of the rockies which includes 
metropolitan denver about 100 bears have been sighted this year 
he said at least nine have been trapped and relocated and 11 have 
been killed either accidentally or because they were a danger to 
humans 
neither wyoming nor montana has reported conflicts with black 
bears and humans 
the problems have been compounded by people who are careless 
with trash or feed the animals directly and other human activity 
said malmsbury 
barbecue smells are extremely attractive to bears and they 
carry a long distance davies said bears have an acute sense 
of smell and they follow their nose right to it 
one bear recently was killed after it broke into a home in the 
mountain community of evergreen west of denver and ripped open 
the refrigerator door ate food and drank wine malmsbury said 
in colorado springs early morning golfers reached the fifth 
hole and looked up to see a 5yearold female bear in a tree 
davies said the animal was trapped and moved to a wilderness area 
in july state wildlife officers killed a bear that attacked a 
woman at a campground in the foothills west of denver the bear 
ripped open her tent apparently to get at food she had inside 
officials said 
black bears usually grow to about 5 feet and weigh between 200 
pounds and 300 pounds on the average there are from 8000 to 
12000 of them in colorado mostly in the southern region of the 
state 
the black bear by nature is not going to be an aggressive 
animal normally malmsbury said some bears weigh over 400 
pounds and are 6 feet tall he can do pretty much whatever he wants 
to

among the casualties of the earthquake was 
an antidrug beachhead that the guardian angels had established on 
a seedy block in the tenderloin district 
the sixstory camelot hotel was condemned because of earthquake 
damage and police evacuated residents early thursday the angels a 
volunteer group known for its red berets and controversial 
crimefighting tactics left shortly after tuesdays quake 
theyre going to relocate us somewhere i suppose said 
resident austin j mahoney 65 who leaned on a metal cane as he 
looked up at the white stucco building sandwiched between a 
peepshow video parlor and a bar 
i came out of prison and it was the only place i could get 
said mahoney who moved in four years ago 
the angels made their headquarters on the third floor where a 
crackdown on crack sign hung in a window neighbors said the 
angels used citizens band radios and called the police when they 
saw trouble 
they helped clean out this block mahoney said crack was 
sold on this block 
it was better that they were here than not said another 
resident who identified himself only as lionel people did 
drugs in their rooms not in the hallways like it used to be 
the angels numbering about 10 residents and staff left for an 
unknown location after the earthquake camelot residents and 
neighbors said 
lionel 42 said the hotel which charged between 250 and 350 
a month was in bad repair but its closure leaves him nowhere to 
live

a new plan to cut capitalgains taxes and 
expand individual retirement accounts was introduced thursday with 
the support of a majority of senators and the bush administration 
sen bob packwood rore who with sen bill roth rdel 
wrote the bill told reporters he expects it to become law this 
year 
a solid majority of the house already has voted for a 
capitalgains tax cut as part of deficitreduction legislation 
that carried the endorsement of president bush but that proposal 
did not affect iras and the senate version of the legislation does 
not include the capitalgains provision 
this plan provides opportunities and incentives for all 
americans roth said its good for both savers and investors 
and its good for america 
allowing one of the saving incentives without the other would 
be like a henhouse without a rooster roth said you may still 
get the eggs but youre not going to keep the hens happy 
packwood said he can count 55 to 58 votes for the measure the 
administration supports this bill although it would support some 
alternatives as well he said 
negotiators from the house and senate met for the first time to 
try to write a compromise deficitreduction bill but as expected 
got nowhere 
the key gulf between the two chambers is over whether to remove 
a capital gains tax cut and other provisions from the legislation 
and what would happen to them if they were removed 
those decisions ultimately will be made by house and senate 
leaders but negotiators met to state their positions 
senators insisted that the moneysaving legislation be kept free 
of controversial items with sen pete domenici rnm saying 
were not going to put them on this bill 
but rep bill frenzel rminn and other house members 
expressed a reluctance to strip capital gains and other items from 
the budgetcutting bill and assume everything else will fall into 
place 
the rothpackwood bill would 
exclude from taxation up to 35 percent of individual capital 
gains which are profits from the sale of stock and other 
investments the longer an asset were held the less it would be 
taxed five percent of the gain from the sale of assets owned more 
than one year would be excluded if the asset were held more than 
seven years 35 percent of the gain would be excluded 
as an option an investor could exclude from taxation any gain 
caused solely by inflation 
present law fully taxes capital gains just as it does wages and 
salaries 
cut the tax rate on corporate capital gains now 34 percent to 
as low as 29 percent 
permit individuals to set aside up to 2000 a year in an ira 
increasing to 3000 a year after five years there would be no tax 
deduction on the contribution instead the contribution and 
interest it earned could be withdrawn taxfree for retirement 
paying for a college education medical expenses or buying a first 
home 
the plan would permit workers who in the past have made 
taxdeductible contributions to an ira to roll over those 
accounts into one of the new types in order to become eligible for 
taxfree withdrawals for education medical expenses or homebuying 
however that rollover would require the worker to pay tax over 
the following four years on the original taxfree contributions 
for example a worker who contributed to an ira in 1985 and 1986 
could transfer that money into one of the new accounts in 1991 and 
pay taxes on the transfer in 1991 1992 1993 and 1994 
the congressional joint committee on taxation estimates that 
because of the rollover provision the plan would raise federal 
revenues by 13 billion over the next five years 
workers who are allowed under present law to make taxdeductible 
ira contributions would not lose that opportunity this includes 
any worker not covered by a company pension any covered couple 
with income under 50000 and a covered single person with income 
under 35000 
if the rothpackwood proposal is to become law it would have to 
be attached to some housepassed revenue bill a prime candidate is 
a debtlimit measure that must be passed this year to raise the 
governments borrowing authority 
the housepassed capitalgains amendment is part of a huge 
deficitreduction bill on which house and senate negotiators began 
working thursday

the top republican on the senate panel that 
heard evidence against federal judge alcee l hastings this summer 
said thursday that he will vote to acquit the miami jurist of 
impeachment charges 
sen arlen specter rpa said in a 76page paper that after 
weighing the evidence and considering an unblemished lifetime 
record he decided there is insufficient evidence to convict 
hastings of plotting to obtain a bribe 
the paper was circulated by specter among his fellow lawmakers 
as the senate closed its doors to the public to deliberate in the 
impeachment trial 
the senate on wednesday heard closing arguments from hastings 
and his attorneys as well as house members who brought the 17 
impeachment charges 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said that if 
the lawmakers finished their closeddoor deliberations on thursday 
they would vote on friday on whether to remove hastings from the 
us district court bench 
hastings would immediately be removed and his 89500 salary 
would be stopped if he were convicted of any one of the 17 
impeachement charges approved in august 1988 by the house 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida history is 
accused of conspiracy to obtain a 150000 payoff lying about it 
to a jury that acquitted him of the charge in 1983 and improper 
disclosure of information obtained through a courtauthorized 
wiretap 
in his statement to the senate on wednesday the affable 
53yearold hastings reaffirmed his denial that he took part in a 
bribery conspiracy 
specter vice chairman of a senate panel that heard 18 days of 
evidence this summer noted that prosecutors at the 1983 trial told 
jurors that hastings was lying obviously the jury did not accept 
those arguments 
he said the case that hastings had improperly disclosed 
information obtained from a wiretap was neither convincing nor 
substantial 
conviction would make hastings the sixth official in history 
removed by impeachment the most recent was judge harry claiborne 
of nevada in 1986 who fought in vain to remain on the bench while 
serving a tax fraud sentence 
district judge walter nixon of mississippi convicted of lying 
to a grand jury is also fighting to remain on the federal bench 
hastings was accused of plotting with washington attorney 
william borders in 1981 to obtain the payoff from two defendants in 
his court he had sentenced them to prison terms for their role in 
a pension fraud scheme 
an fbi undercover agent posing as one of the defendants 
contacted borders and offered him 150000 in exchange for a 
reduction of the sentences to probation the attorney was arrested 
oct 9 1981 as he left a suburban virginia motel with the agent 
and a garment bag containing 125000 in cash 
hastings in washington for a testimonial dinner in honor of 
borders that night was told that the fbi wanted to contact him but 
immediately returned to miami by an indirect route without checking 
out of his hotel

an appeals court thursday canceled the bulk of a 
record 960000 libel award against the satirical magazine private 
eye and recommended tighter guidelines for juries in assessing 
libel damages 
three judges dismissed the magazines appeal but reduced to 
40000 the damages awarded by a high court jury in may to sonia 
sutcliffe the estranged wife of a mass murderer known as the 
yorkshire ripper 
this is what we hoped for said private eyes managing 
director dave cash 
we would like to think that this decision today will go some 
way toward stemming the growing tide of libel actions and the trend 
toward juries making absurdly high awards 
britains libel laws give juries freedom to set damages without 
any guidance from judges those who allege they have been libeled 
do not claim a set amount of damages and there are no upper or 
lower limits on the amount juries can award 
judge lord john donaldson of the court of appeal said he could 
not believe the high court jury had appreciated how large their 
award was 
what is i think required is some guidance to juries in terms 
which will assist them to appreciate the real value of large 
sums he said 
another judge sir martin nourse said the award must have been 
made on a wrong basis because he said without realizing they were 
exceeding their function the jurors included a very large sum to 
make an example of the defendants 
legal experts said thursdays decision could mark the end of 
usstyle libel awards in british courts 
basically what the appeal court appears to be saying is that 
they hope a judge will correct any misconceptions the jury might 
have said libel lawyer andrew stephenson 
the court dismissed private eyes request for a retrial the 
magazine had said new evidence would justify its stories which 
claimed mrs sutcliffe had tried to profit from her husbands 
notoriety by selling her story to a newspaper mrs sutcliffe 
denies that she sold her story 
the judges deferred their decision on further reducing the 
40000 in damages and said judgment on who will pay the 160000 
in court costs will come later 
mrs sutcliffe was not in court but her lawyer eileen 
pembridge said mrs sutcliffe is relieved that the matter is 
nearly over and pleased that the judges have dismissed private 
eyes new evidence 
peter sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women 
and attempting to kill five more mrs sutcliffe was not implicated 
in any of the crimes 
irene macdonald whose 16yearold daughter was among 
sutcliffes victims welcomed the ruling 
this all boils down to money she said events like this 
bring all the awful memories back 
after the high court ruling on may 24 private eyes editor ian 
hislop declared if this is justice then i am a banana 
hislop said thursday that lord donaldson and his colleagues 
have decided that i am not a banana our future looks a lot 
better than it did 
the magazine asked readers for contributions to support its 
appeal if any of the 150000 collected is left after court costs 
it will be given to a trust fund for relatives of the yorkshire 
rippers victims hislop said

a major drug manufacturer on thursday 
announced a new program to provide easily understood information to 
patients about its most widely used prescription drugs 
gd searle and co said it was initiating the program in light 
of a new survey showing that nearly half the drugs prescribed 
yearly are taken incorrectly 
the bush administration along with sen orrin hatch ranking 
republican on the senate labor and human resources committee 
endorsed the program as a voluntary private sector effort 
important to public health 
hatch called it a step forward that should be followed by 
other pharmaceutical manufacturers in this country but he said 
he would not want the government to require companies to initiate 
their own programs i dont like to make matters mandatory if we 
can do it on a voluntary basis he said 
the food and drug administration requires drug companies to 
provide to patients information on certain drugs including birth 
control pills it also has encouraged companies to distribute 
information voluntarily for some drugs that have more serious side 
effects 
an fda program to require package inserts for 10 prescription 
drugs was initiated during the late 1970s but the program ran into 
resistance from pharmacists physicians and the prescription drug 
industry and was scrapped in 1981 before it got off the ground 
consumer groups have long favored efforts to distribute more 
information to patients about prescription drugs and some 
countries are moving in that direction the european economic 
community will require drug companies to distribute such 
information beginning in january 1992 
sheldon g gilgore searle chairman said the plan which will 
be instituted worldwide by the end of 1990 is the most 
comprehensive voluntary patientinformation program by a us drug 
company 
he said the company initially will provide to physicians 
information sheets they can give to patients explaining in 
nontechnical terms the potential side effects of three drugs and 
the possible interactions the medicines can have with other drugs 
the three drugs are calan and calan sr used to treat high blood 
pressure and cytotec an ulcer preventive these account for about 
threequarters of searles nearly 1 billion in annual domestic 
sales 
company officials said the rest of searles products as well as 
future products will be covered by the program about 15 percent 
of the companys drug products are oral contraceptives for which 
the fda already requires written information for patients 
searle said a telephone survey of 1000 prescription drug users 
conducted during the last week of september by pracon inc of 
reston va said nearly half do not follow the dosage instructions 
of their medicine

the governments superfund money has not been 
spent wisely with only some 40 percent going to clean up toxic 
waste dumps a congressional study said thursday 
analysis breeds paralysis the office of technology 
assessment said in noting that only about three dozen of the 1200 
priority cleanup sites have been declared completely clean 
during the last three years 60 percent of the 44 billion 
spent by the environmental protection agency on superfund went for 
administration management or site studies rather than cleanup 
said a report from the office of technology assessment 
ota concluded that while the epa has estimated another 900 toxic 
waste sites likely will be added to its priority list over the next 
decade the number could be 10 times that with a better 
administered program 
the report entitled coming clean said while private 
superfund contractors keep busy reports pile up contamination 
spreads into soil and groundwater many sites wait to get into the 
cleanup system 
lew crampton epa associate administrator for communications and 
public affairs said the agencys figures show 60 to 70 percent of 
the money is related to site cleanup the percentage will increase 
starting later this year he said when major construction work 
begins on a number of sites 
it depends on how you define what is spending directly on 
cleanup and what is inefficient he said adding the agency has 
asked ota to explain its percentages 
crampton defending preparatory studies added you cant 
expect to stick a shovel in the ground and get rid of this stuff 
toxic waste 
studies are needed to characterize the hazard decide on the 
proper remedy and test different technologies all work that must 
be handled by contractors he said 
reps john d dingell dmich and james scheuer dny both 
noted epa administrator william k reilly has taken steps to 
improve superfund 
dingell added the constructive aspects of the ota report may 
be overshadowed by its excessive emphasis on speculative 
statistics 
rep mike synar dokla said the study paints a disturbing 
picture which questions just how permanent and complete these 
cleanups actually are and how wisely the money used to administer 
the program has been spent 
the report said the superfunds problem is not one of money but 
that funds too often were misdirected rather than aimed at reducing 
the significant health and environmental threats posed by toxic 
waste sites 
often money spent directly on cleanup efforts went toward 
reducing hypothetical risks which may not materialize instead 
of to dealing with immediate health threats it said 
at the same time the report claimed that too often the 
government has chosen or allowed the polluters themselves to 
choose cleanup methods that are unlikely to work over the long 
term 
in an attempt to reduce government costs the epa is getting 
industry to assume more cleanup activities but also is allowing 
industry to use less stringent cleanup technologies possibly 
saving as much as 1 billion the study said

bullet had lodged in her hair 
it was only after a classmate told demetra achilleos look

unusual discovery 
the incident occurred in this greek cypriot village in east 
cyprus less than a mile from the fortified buffer zone dividing 
the mediterranean island 
demetra and other girls in her class were busy on a written test 
when they heard a fusillade of shots from the zone a window in the 
classroom shattered and small pieces of plaster fell on their heads 
from the ceiling 
i felt something like a slight burning pain on top of my head 
but i did not give it much thought at the time demetra said 
later 
i thought it was a piece of glass from the broken window when 
i realized what had happened and how close i had come to being 
seriously hurt i became frightened and cried 
the bullet apparently hit her head after ricocheting off the 
ceiling with much of its force spent 
police asked un peacekeepers who patrol the zone to 
investigate 
dherynia villagers said shots are occasionally fired from the 
turkish lines toward the village though nobody has been hurt 
cyprus has been divided since a 1974 turkish invasion

the bush administration may speed up the 
planned withdrawal of us military dependents from panama the 
white house said thursday 
gen maxwell r thurman the newly appointed us military 
commander in panama also has recommended shortening soldiers tour 
of duty so that fewer bring their families to panama a pentagon 
official said 
the united states imposed sanctions against panama in march 1988 
in a campaign to oust strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega has held onto power nullifying last mays elections and 
installing a crony on sept 1 as president 
us officials last may began evacuating military dependents 
and as of july 1 some 6300 department of defense personnel had 
either been sent home or relocated onto us bases in panama white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
but there are still roughly 11000 american dependents in the 
country said fitzwater who added we are reviewing the issue 
right now of whether or not that withdrawal should be 
accelerated 
currently the united states has 10000 soldiers permanently 
assigned to panama 2500 military personnel there on temporary 
duty 7700 military dependents 2700 us civilian pentagon 
employees and 3300 civilian dependents 
the ultimate purpose is to get family members back to the 
united states fitzwater said 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said thurman had 
formally recommended to the joint chiefs of staff that tours of 
duty in panama be reduced so that fewer soldiers bring families 
with them to the troubled region 
thurman wants to cut from 15 months to 12 months the tour length 
for those going alone to panama 
the standard tour for military personnel bringing family members 
to panama would be cut from 30 months to 24 months and only a 
very few would be allowed to remain there on a full 24month 
rotation williams said 
williams said thurmans recommendations were designed to 
ensure the security of all us military members and their families 
in panama 
thurman wanted to emphasize that while the us forces have no 
quarrel with the panama defense forces the american military 
personnel serving in panama must remember the situation is a 
sustained classic lowitensity conflict said williams their 
mission is counterterrorism their mission is protection of us 
military personnel and us military assets 
noriega is under indictment in the united states for drug 
trafficking on oct 3 he quashed an attempted coup that received 
minimal support from us forces 
the withdrawal of dependents began last spring following a 
series of incidents including harassment and physical assaults 
against some americans

the state department said thursday that cuba 
as a newly elected member of the un security council should 
start showing respect for un resolutions by ending assistance to 
leftist rebels in el salvador 
cuba was one of five countries to be elected to security council 
seats wednesday it is the first time cuba has been chosen for a 
seat since the 1959 revolution 
we hope cuba will recognize that it has a special 
responsibility as a member of security council to act 
constructively to end regional conflicts not contribute to them 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
she said cuba should bear in mind that the central american 
presidents have asked the united nations to create a force to 
ensure that no state provides support to irregular forces which 
include the salvadoran rebel group known by its spanish initials 
fmln 
she noted that a un resolution approved several weeks ago 
called on all member states to halt all overt or covert aid to 
insurrectional forces in central america 
cuba is the principal violator of that security council 
resolution and the principal arms supplier to the fmln she said 
we hope its tenure on the security council will begin with cuban 
adherence to the resolution 
cuba had the endorsement of other latin american nations for the 
security council seat the action of the latin american countries 
suggested that the bush administrations policy of hostility toward 
cuba is not widely shared elsewhere in the hemisphere 
on a related subject ms tutwiler deplored the bombing in el 
salvador of the home of leftist political leader ruben zamora 
on wednesday ms tutwiler condemned the killing of the young 
daughter of a military officer in el salvador and thursday she 
said we condemn with equal vigor this reprehensible act against 
mr zamora and his family 
the spokeswoman said she not know who was responsible for the 
attack 
ms tutwiler also responded to a report contending that the 
salvadoran military has conducted a nationwide campaign of 
killings harassment and torture against doctors and health care 
workers and attacked rebel field hospitals in violation of the 
geneva convention 
based on the report written by seven americans including five 
doctors the us government has requested specific information on 
cases in which there were claims of harassment she said 
there is no evidence of a salvadoran governmment policy of 
harassment or abuse of health workers she said there is no 
doubt that the provision of health care and services by the 
government could be improved 
the team concluded that the alleged persecution of medical 
personnel was part of a campaign to obstruct religious and relief 
workers in order to undermine support for the guerrillas

new management policies including fewer 
controversial clear cuts will be adopted to preserve more 
oldgrowth trees in the national forests the forest service said 
thursday 
george m leonard associate chief of the service said he 
guessed the new policies would preserve about half the nations old 
growth stands more in some areas less in others depending on 
the tree species involved in and other things 
not all of the old growth is going to be preserved he said 
my guess its going to be substantially over half of the 
remaining old growth that will be preserved he said 
the new policies will have the greatest impact on oldgrowth 
forests in the pacific northwest but will be applied to all forests 
in the system including eastern hardwoods and soft pines of the 
south 
the oldgrowth forests often never cut before and 
distinguished by old trees and accumulations of dead material 
provide living space for many species of wildlife including the 
controversial spotted owl in the pacific northwest 
congress recently approved compromise provisions aimed at 
protecting the owl in 112 billion spending measure for the 
interior department and related agencies like the forest service 
an arm of the agriculture department 
the legislation designed to permit continued logging in the 
oldgrowth forests of the pacific northwest calls on the forest 
service and interiors bureau of land management to minimize 
fragmentation of significant oldgrowth forest stand no timber 
sales would be allowed in areas already identified as spotted owl 
habitat 
lawmakers sought a way to ensure northwest mills of a steady 
supply of timber from the regions oldgrowth forests while the 
us fish and wildlife service decides whether to declare the 
northern spotted owl an endangered species 
such declarations require federal agencies to protect the 
habitats of the species in question the spotted owl lives almost 
exclusively in oldgrowth forests and each nesting air requires a 
very large area 
leonard said the forest service will reduce the use of 
traditional clearcutting methods in which all or most trees in an 
area are cut and will increase retention of snags deadanddown 
material and logging debris that could be used by wildlife 
also some forest stands will be managed on extended 
rotations to develop oldgrowth characteristics some of those 
rotations would be for 150 to 200 years or longer 
agency chief f dale robertson said in a statement that we do 
not anticipate an immediate impact on our timber sale program since 
our forest plans provide for many oldgrowth values 
however robertson added that there will be an impact when we 
complete the final forest plans in california oregon and 
washington and as we amend or revise other forest plans due to a 
greater emphasis on oldgrowth values 
asked about wildlife species that might benefit from the new 
policys use in eastern hardwood forests leonard said the red 
cockaded woodpecker in southern pine forests was one example but he 
was not aware of any in oldgrowth hardwoods 
but certainly were looking at the impact of cutting and the 
way we lay out our timber sales on bear habitat on turkey 
habitat he said 
leonard said the recent years of controversy over oldgrowth 
forests the spotted owl and other environmental factors have been 
fierce and will take time to heal 
ive been involved in national forest management issues for 
over 30 years and ive never found a situation that was more 
polarized than the issue over the management of the pacific 
northwest he said

rockets slammed into the capitals 
airport and civilian flights were halted thursday as the soviet 
union was reported to be undertaking the largest airlift since its 
military withdrawal eight months ago 
the government said shelling in kabul killed 12 people and 
wounded 35 though two doctors at a hospital that monitors 
casualties said they did not know of any victims 
the usbacked guerrillas also shelled a strategic town near 
the pakistan border killing nine people the government said 
diplomatic sources in kabul and islamabad pakistan said it was 
the largest soviet airlift since february when soviet troops ended 
their nineyear intervention in afghanistan 
diplomats in kabul said sovietbuilt antonov12 transport planes 
were flying continuously into the airport dropping off weapons and 
food for soldiers they said the planes were also flying night 
missions 
two soldiers said all commercial traffic was shut down for most 
of the afternoon but soviet transport planes were operating despite 
the shelling witnesses said at least five rockets hit the airport 
grounds but there were no immediate casualty or damage reports 
there 
us rep don ritter rpa estimated moscow has increased its 
aid to 400 millinagers to take early 
retirement 
atampt outperformed its bell offspring which reported diverging 
results profits rose 65 percent at philadelphiabased bell 
atlantic corp but fell 89 percent at denverbased u s west inc 
fell 126 percent at san franciscobased pacific telesis group and 
fell 148 percent at strikebound nynex corp based in white 
plains ny 
while atampt said it is not aiming to eliminate a specified number 
of jobs spokesman burke stinson said it would not be 
unreasonable for 5000 to 15000 managers to take advantage of the 
plan 
analysts praised atampts costcutting step saying the company 
has too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computers 
and network equipment 
theyre doing exactly what i think they need to do said lap 
lee a salomon brothers inc analyst 
atampt will double to 34000 the number of managers eligible to 
retire with immediate pension payments it is also offering a 
special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on 
dec 30 
atampt embarked on an aggressive costcutting program beginning in 
1984 the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup 
of the bell system 
since then the company has cut its payroll from 373000 to 
298000 this is the first program aimed only at managers 
the largest single job cut in the companys history came in late 
1986 when atampt eliminated 32000 jobs the company has relied on 
incentives when slashing employment but stinson noted that this is 
the first pension sweetener in atampt history 
we are in a topsyturvy marketplace and we need to have as 
many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few 
people in nonsales behindthescenes jobs as possible stinson 
said 
the retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth 
quarter but the amount cannot be determined until the number of 
participants is determined the company said the higher expenses 
would be offset by other items including a gain from a share 
exchange that ends its direct investment in ing c olivetti amp co 
spa 
atampt reported profits rose 19 percent to 699 million or 65 
cents a share in the quarter ended sept 30 from 587 million or 
55 cents a share a year ago revenue increased 1 percent to 89 
billion from 881 billion in the third quarter a year ago 
for the ninemonth period profit totaled 199 billion or 
185 a share up 19 percent from 167 billion or 156 a share 
a year ago revenue increased 3 percent to 2681 billion from 
2600 billion in the yearago period 
atampt chairman robert e allen said that while the company is 
pleased with the results we are keenly aware that we face stiff 
competition in all our markets 
he said atampt will continue to be aggressive in the marketing 
of our products and services and aggressive as well in continuing 
to drive costs out of every part of our business 
bell atlantic and u s west two of the companies carved out of 
atampt in the 1984 breakup reported differing results bell atlantic 
attributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage 
while u s west said its profit dip was the result of special 
factors that masked modest earnings growth 
bell atlantic said its profit rose to 3632 million or 182 a 
share from 341 million or 172 a share a year earlier revenue 
rose to 291 billion from 276 billion 
for the first nine months bell atlantic said profit rose to 
107 billion or 543 a share from 101 billion or 512 a 
share a year earlier revenue rose to 856 billion from 811 
billion 
u s west said profit fell to 2581 million or 139 a share 
from 2832 million or 155 a share a year earlier revenue fell 
to 232 billion from 243 billion 
nevertheless were not satisfied with these results the 
major negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatory 
activity over the past two years on our telephone operations 
said jack mcallister u s wests chairman and chief executive 
for the year to date u s west said earnings fell to 7663 
million or 417 a share from 860 million or 468 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose to 715 billion from 687 billion a 
year earlier 
nynex blamed a continuing strike by about 60000 employees as a 
factor in its downturn in its installation of phone lines and 
delays in repairs and directory assistance it said its 
thirdquarter earnings fell to 2887 million or 147 a share 
from 3389 million or 172 a share a year earlier revenue rose

cents a share from 318 million or 75 cents a share in the third

the agriculture department said thursday it 
will prohibit use of sodium nitrate in the processing of drycured 
bacon which makes up about 2 percent of the total bacon made in 
the united states 
officials said also that the amount of sodium nitrite used in 
the dry curing of bacon will be reduced the regulation for both 
will be effective jan 18 1990 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said the move will help avoid any 
health risk from nitrosamine formation when these types of bacon 
are fried 
nitrites can combine with amines in meat to form nitrosamines 
and certain types of those have been shown to cause cancer in 
laboratory animals 
about 98 percent of the bacon in the united states is made by 
pumping curing solutions containing nitrite into pork bellies 
the agency has prohibited nitrates and limited nitrites in the 
pumping solutions since 1978 
nitrites are used in the curing of meat to guard against 
spoilage and harmful organisms and to give bacon a distinctive 
color and taste

czechoslovak police arrested former 
foreign minister jiri hajek and 14 other activists and briefly 
detained a us human rights monitor in a raid thursday on an 
international human rights meeting in prague 
an emigre source said all the activists were freed by thursday 
evening 
it was the fourth such crackdown in czechoslovakia in recent 
days indicating the communist government does not intend to follow 
poland and hungary into genuine dialogue with opposition groups 
detained briefly was jeri laber an american who directs us 
helsinki watch a group associated with the international helsinki 
federation in vienna ms laber the only foreign national 
involved was released after a document check 
dissident playwright vaclav havel and another leading activist 
vaclav maly escaped because those detained shouted warnings to 
them to flee the federation said 
rude pravo the communist party daily has said anyone taking 
part in street demonstrations to mark the anniversary oct 28 of 
czechoslovak independence in 1918 faces prosecution 
at least five activists are in prison awaiting trial on charges 
that could mean up to 10 years in jail dozens of others face 
similar charges and almost constant harassment 
czechoslovakias security forces have waged a campaign of 
carefully targeted repression following mass antigovernment 
protests in january detaining key activists and jailing 
lesserknown figures whose arrest stirs less protest at home and 
abroad than the trial earlier this year of havel 
the federation said uniformed and plainclothes police raided a 
prague cafe where representatives of the czechoslovak helsinki 
committee were to meet federation leaders and ms laber 
among those detained were banned writer eva kanturkova and 
philosopher radim palous and fellow charter 77 activists ladislav 
lis rudolf battek and martin palous 
the raid came two days after five members of the helsinki 
committee including hajek were questioned by police after leaving 
a meeting 
on wednesday czechoslovak tv and emigre sources reported five 
littleknown activists with another independent group the movement 
for civil liberties have been charged with subversion that could 
put them in jail for up to three years 
two of the five are still in custody following their detention 
oct 13 the emigre sources said 
last week independent journalists rudolf zeman and jiri ruml 
editors of the popular underground monthly lidove noviny were 
arrested and charged with incitement which carries a fiveyear 
jail sentence 
in paris thursday the international federation of newspaper 
publishers demanded authorities release ruml and zeman saying 
their only crime was to pursue the cause of freedom of 
expression 
in addition a leading rights and roman catholic activist in the 
slovak capital of bratislava jan carnogursky has been in 
detention since august on charges that could jail him for up to 10 
years

camilo jose cela a spanish writer 
whose violent grotesque images sprang from the civil war that 
killed more than 1 million of his countrymen won the nobel prize 
for literature thursday 
the swedish academy cited cela 73 for rich and intensive 
prose which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision 
of mans vulnerability 
it said his novel the family of pascual duarte published in 
1942 was the most popular work of fiction in spanish since miguel 
cervantes masterpiece don quixote was published nearly 400 
years ago 
i understand that this is the culmination of my literary 
career after many years of work cela told swedish radio from his 
home in guadalajara 30 miles northeast of madrid 
i offer it to all of literature in spanish i believe that 
other authors spanish and latin american who write in spanish 
could also have won it for the same reasons as i 
cela a bon vivant known in spain for his flamboyant lifestyle 
told reporters over lunch in madrid that life is like a game of 
tennis and this time i won 
he said he would use the 463000 prize to pay my debts and 
believe me ive got a lot of them 
in the 47 years since pascual duarte cela said what i 
have gained in wisdom ive been losing in vigor and health and 
what i have gained in experience ive lost in freshness 
as an epitaph he said he would like here lies someone who 
tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible 
his 10 novels and 60 other works short stories essays poetry 
and travel books have made cela the leading figure in spains 
literary renewal during the postwar era the swedish academy 
said he is the fifth spanish writer to receive the literature 
prize 
sture allen the academys secretary said cela also had wide 
influence on literature throughout latin america 
he is an experimental and provocative writer both regarding 
form and contents allen said furthermore he broadened the 
range of the spanish language 
asked to compare cela with another experimental spanish writer 
mario vargas llosa of peru allen described both as individualists 
who were apparently acquainted with each others works 
allen suggested that readers unfamiliar with cela begin with 
travel writings in which he tried to capture the spain he saw 
disappearing and maybe some of the spanish national spirit 
in the family of pascual duarte his bestknown work cela 
created a new style known as tremendismo that emphasized 
violence and grotesque imagery the novel a firstperson account 
of a murderer awaiting execution was banned in spain but 
established celas reputation as a writer 
requiem of darkness 5 1973 and mazurka for two dead 
1983 carried celas experimental style further 
his masterpiece is considered to be the hive published in 
1951 it describes three days in the life of madrid four years 
after the civil war ended in 1939 
the war which lasted three years and brought gen francisco 
franco to power often played an important role in celas works 
he is a native of galicia a franco stronghold in northwestern 
spain after returning from studies in madrid with tuberculosis he 
was recruited by the fascists suffered the horrors of war and was 
sent home with serious wounds 
despite his service in the franco forces cela was strongly 
antifascist from 1956 to 1979 he published papeles de son 
armadans a magazine that became a forum for the young opposition 
franco died in 1975 
the author was born may 11 1916 in the town of ira flavia to a 
middle class family that counted among its forebearers both spanish 
aristocrats and english pirates 
before the civil war began in 1936 he studied medicine and law 
he turned to writing fulltime after the success of the family of 
pascual duarte 
in 1977 king juan carlos appointed cela to a senate seat in the 
first postfranco parliament and he participated the next year in 
writing a new constitution 
he received the prince of asturias award for literature in 1987 
and has been a member of the spanish academy literary group since 
1957

the house on thursday gave overwhelming 
approval to an 837 million aid package for poland and hungary that 
nearly doubles what president bush has requested 
the vote of 34547 sent the measure to the senate 
the ice of the cold war is rapidly melting said rep david 
bonior dmich during debate we have a unique opportunity to 
seize a very special moment in history with our help the march of 
freedom in eastern europe will become irreversible 
the package was brought to the house floor with unusual speed 
just 15 days after it was introduced the urgency was an indication 
of congress eagerness to swiftly reward poland and hungary for 
their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reform as 
well as democrats desire to underscore what they call bushs 
timid response to the sweeping changes in the east bloc 
the administration has failed to grasp that this is a critical 
turning point in the history of eastwest relations said bonior 
a senior member of the chambers democratic leadership 
the package has a threeyear price tag of 8373 million 
compared to the 450 million bush has sought during a trip to 
eastern europe in july the president originally proposed about 
150 million in aid and has ratcheted the amount upward since then 
in the face of congressional criticism 
house republicans flocked to the bill one rep jim leach of 
iowa said the bill was an extraordinarily cheap way of helping 
redirect the course of history 
the situation clearly has made administration officials 
uncomfortable in a policy statement the white house said it would 
generally support the bill but has reservations about the 
excessive funding levels and would work to decrease the amount 
when the bill goes to the senate 
included in the package were 
a 200 million grant to help stabilize polands economy that 
would be the us contribution to a 1 billion multilateral fund 
sought by poland 
160 million for poland and 40 million for hungary to promote 
private enterprise 
10 million to set up a technical training program in business 
skills for poles and hungarians plus 4 million for poland and 1 
million for hungary for programs in job training labormanagement 
relations and occupational health and safety 
up to 125 million in food aid for poland 
200 million in shortterm guarantees and insurance for us 
exporters selling products to the two countries 
30 million for clean coalburning technology for poland and 
10 million for other environmental protection programs for both 
countries 
in addition the bill provided 12 million for building 
democratic institutions in poland and hungary possibly through the 
national endowment for democracy and money for the peace corps 
cultural exchanges scientific projects and medical aid 
in an ironic twist the bill uses some of the money aimed at 
helping the solidarity government an estimated 375 million to 
subsidize us maritime unions because it requires that 75 percent 
of food aid be shipped on more expensive us vessels an effort to 
trim that subsidy mostly pressed by farmstate lawmakers failed 
228 to 170 
last june in the first open elections in four decades 
candidates of the trade union solidrity won enough seats to take 
control of polands government a week ago the new government 
outlined plans for sweeping economic reforms 
hungary this year became the first warsaw pact nation to 
physically dismantle the iron curtain and opened its borders to 
allow east germans to flee to the west it is developing a new 
multiparty political system under a liberalized constitution and 
plans parliamentary elections early next year 
but serious problems in both countries pose a threat to the 
reforms 
with inflation running at an annual rate of 200 percent and 
climbing food shortages and a 39 billion foreign debt burden 
leaders of the fledgling polish government face particularly 
crucial tests 
the aid package will help relieve economic pressures and buy 
time for the new leaders to institutionalize their reforms 
proponents said and keep alive the prospects for change in the 
rest of eastern europe 
citizens in germany romania and czechoslovakia are watching 
what is happening in poland and hungary said rep stephen solarz 
dny if these experiments fail it will stifle the prospects 
for political and economic reform in the other countries he said

i came here and it was gone it happened so fast said lai 
26 who learned of the deaths when he came to check on their 
building for him like other californians the earthquake not only 
jumbled a landscape but heaved up grief and misery that clashed 
with a laidback lifestyle 
damage was heaviest in the marina district a trendy upscale 
neighborhood of pastel buildings stucco facades and terracotta 
roofs with a view of the spires of the golden gate bridge and the 
mountains across san pablo bay drenched on thursday with the

generators heavy equipment helicopters and crackling police 
radios 
evacuees carrying coolers suitcases and boxes of belongings 
competed for sidewalk space with tourists hefting video cameras and 
snapping pictures 
its bad enough were going through what we are without the

plaja 71 sitting on a curb outside a red cross shelter where she 
spent the night she carried a red cross bag filled with 
essentials including lipstick and an emery board 
one woman openly and randomly admonished those viewing the 
wreckage 
san francisco has survived another earthquake weve come 
through were not a city of kooks or something that falls apart

a coalition of amazon indians from five latin 
american countries met thursday with major us environmental 
groups to demand inclusion in consideration of the conservation of 
the worlds largest rainforest and the safeguarding of their native 
lands and rights 
the time has come for the indigenous people of the amazon the 
people who have always lived there to take a place at the table as 
well said evaristo nugkuag president of the coalition known by 
its spanish acronym coica 
representatives of the countries colombia ecuador peru 
bolivia and brazil have also met this week with officials of the 
world bank and the interamerican development bank to demand that 
development programs undertaken by these institutions be 
coordinated with the native inhabitants 
wilfrido aragon aranda of ecuador said indigenous people had 
been expelled from their lands to make way for hydroelectric 
projects because latin american governments do not respect indian 
rights we told them that we are now organized and we want them 
to deal directly with us and also to press our governments to 
comply with protection laws of our rights he said 
noted us environmentalists including thomas lovejoy of the 
smithsonian institution promised to respond to the indians 
concerns and to lobby for their rights were deeply grateful for 
this initiative lovejoy said at a news conference 
barbara bramble of the national wildlife fund said her 
organization would lobby the world bank and other institutions to 
make sure they deal directly with the indians on development 
projects 
the world bank has begun focusing attention this year on 
conservation projects after being accused of environmental 
destruction through development projects such as road and dam 
construction in the third world 
world attention has been increasingly turned to the destruction 
of the 2 million squaremile amazon forest mainly through burning 
for farming ranching highway building and mining the united 
nations and other bodies have proposed socalled debt for nature 
swaps in which they would use some of south americas 112 
billion debt to invest in amazon protection programs 
but nugkuag rejected the idea saying the indians of the amazon 
have never received money from their governments and had not 
contributed to the debt problem but still theyre talking about 
giving away our lands to pay their debts he said 
instead he suggested environmentalists should swap debt for 
projects protecting indigenous lands and peoples which would be 
the best guarantee of the forests conservation as well 
the focus of concern of the environmental community has been 
the preservation of the tropical forests and its plants and animal 
inhabitants said a statement issued by the group you have 
shown little interest in its human inhabitants 
a second meeting to discuss specific ways of advancing the goals 
adopted at thursdays meeting will be held next year in peru 
organizers said

unlike spains four other nobel laureates 
in literature camilo jose cela is a public figure better known as 
a bon vivant than for his 10 novels and other writings 
his bestknown novels the family of pascual duarte 1942 
and the hive 1951 have been made into successful movies and 
many spaniards have encountered the author during his trips through 
the country in a rolls royce 
cela 73 most recently made news with the public disclosure of 
a romantic liaison with marina castano a woman half his age who is 
his muse and literary aide 
he is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years and 
has a son camilo jose cela who said last week that having such a 
flamboyant father was difficult 
his wife rosario conde said thursday from her home in palma de 
majorca the prize was well deserved and she would accompany her 
husband to the awards ceremony in stockholm she added if i 
dont go theres no prize 
before he rushed off to a weekly television talk show appearance 
thursday the nobel laureate and ms castano spoke with reporters 
over a quick lunch at a madrid hotel she said he still writes 
everything in longhand and has no idea how to operate a typewriter 
or word processor 
cela who has produced 70 works that include essays poems and 
travel books said he was not really surprised by the award and 
the prize could just as well have gone to many other spanish 
writers 
but life is like a game of tennis and this time i won he 
said adding that the 463000 prize would come in very handy 
ill use it to pay my debts and believe me ive got a lot of 
them he said 
andreu teixedor of editorial destino which publishes celas 
work in spanish said the family of pascual duarte had sold 
more than 1 million copies in spain and latin america 
in the 47 years since pascual duarte cela said thursday 
what i have gained in wisdom ive been losing in vigor and 
health and what i have gained in experience ive lost in 
freshness 
using the crude language common to his fiction cela said he 
would like this epitaph here lies someone who tried to screw his 
fellow man as little as possible 
the author said spain which produced don quixote had been 
overshadowed in literature by latin america because of the 
countrys foolish provincialism 
the family of pascual duarte often is credited with creating 
a sort of literary vanguard in the years immediately after the 
civil war of 193639 it was published first in argentina because 
it was deemed too violent and crude for the spain of gen francisco 
franco 
it is the tale told in graphic language of a rude man from the 
country who commits a series of brutal murders without really 
knowing why and eventually is executed by garrote 
his novel the hive is set in the years just after the war 
when the rest of the world was fighting it tells of struggling 
writers who sit for hours during the winter in madrids tolerant 
wellheated literary cafes nursing a cup of imitation coffee and 
trying to keep culture alive 
cela the first spanish novelist to win the nobel said thursday 
he had a work in progress but he would not describe it 
you never really know how these things are going to turn out 
until the end he said 
spanish poet juan ramon jimenez won the nobel literature prize 
in 1956 and in 1977 two years after franco died it went to 
vicente aleixandre an obscure poet the nations first literary 
laureate was playwright jose echegaray in 1904 and another 
playwright jacinto benavente won in 1922

the interior minister on thursday called boris n 
yeltsin a liar and said the maverick communist concocted a phony 
tale of his own kidnap and attempted assassination apparently to 
help his political popularity 
he invented the entire story said interior minister vadim 
v bakatin at a hastily called news conference what the reason 
was i dont know you should ask him 
bakatin the top soviet policeman said that by exposing the 
populist lawmakers alleged falsehood and rumors it spawned we 
have simply prevented a new outburst of popularity for yeltsin 
yeltsin could not be reached for comment 
it was the lastest twist in yeltsins remarkable career which 
has seen him ousted from his post as the communist party leader in 
moscow in 1987 only to stage a stunning comeback in legislative 
elections this year 
the interior minister spoke less than 24 hours after yeltsin 
issued a statement accusing his former mentor president mikhail s 
gorbachev of staging a nationally televised political farce to 
scuttle his political career 
before the cameras of staterun tv on monday bakatin told the 
supreme soviet legislature that yeltsin an antiestablishment hero 
to millions of soviets appeared at a police post sept 28 yeltsin 
was dripping wet and falsely reported that men in a car had 
abducted him put a sack over his head and tossed him from a bridge 
into the moscow river bakatin said 
when he was given the floor yeltsin 58 denied to fellow 
lawmakers that he had ever made a formal police report of such an 
incident or that an attack occurred but he did not say whether he 
had approached a policeman informally with such a story 
in his toughly worded statement wednesday yeltsin called the 
glaring public exposure given his reputed claims a new attempt to 
ruin my health and to knock me out of the sphere of political 
struggle he claimed gorbachev was responsible 
bakatins rapid appearance before reporters showed the kremlin 
was eager to counter yeltsins accusations 
yeltsin a strapping silverhaired siberian who calls for an 
end to official privilege and a better life for the average soviet 
enjoys wide popular support which seems to boom every time people 
here perceive he has been targeted for attack by officialdom 
bakatin claimed that if any lies were being told about the 
supposed kidnapping they were coming from yeltsin i stated only 
what comrade yeltsin told the policeman bakatin said there 
was no attempt on his life these rumors are false 
he said yeltsin lied publicly when he told his story to the 
supreme soviet and a second time a day later when he issued the 
statement to the press accusing gorbachev of staging a farce 
pressed to say what lies yeltsin had told bakatin referred to 
the lawmakers statement claiming bakatin mixed truth and lies 
in his report to the supreme soviet on the investigation into the 
incident 
he also said yeltsins alleged story to police couldnt possibly 
be true 
we know the terrain bakatin said one cant be thrown 
from the bridge into the water without suffering serious injuries 
theres also the time factor one cant do all these things in one 
hour 
he suggested yeltsin lied to police for political ends this 
is my personal guess and its nothing but a guess that this false 
declaration by comrade yeltsin was made on purpose to distribute 
information of interest to him bakatin said he tried to gain 
something by making those statements time will show how he 
succeeds 
by puncturing the rumors sweeping moscow that an attempt was 
made on yeltsins life we are putting an end to unfounded rumors 
of political persecution he said 
however evident official attempts in the past to discredit 
yeltsin have misfired badly the communist partys policymaking 
central committee to which yeltsin belongs launched an 
investigation into charges that his views violate the party line 
but 89 percent of moscow voters subsequently elected him to the new 
soviet parliament in march 
last month pravda reprinted an article from an italian 
newspaper that claimed yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through a 
us speaking tour but later had to print a public apology 
admitting the allegations were hearsay that couldnt be documented 
thousands of muscovites formed a chain on gorky street to show 
their support for yeltsin who was named moscow party boss by 
gorbachev in december 1985 but fired less than two years later for 
criticizing the slow pace of the kremlin leaders reforms 
asked if yeltsin would be prosecuted under article 130 of the 
soviet criminal code for allegedly filing a false police report 
bakatin said there were no such plans besides he said yeltsins 
status as a lawmaker means his fellow legislators would have to 
sanction any criminal investigation of him

after a round of public recriminations the 
state department sought thursday to smooth over its differences 
with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and denied the bush 
administration was trying to steer him into negotiations with the 
palestine liberation organization 
shamir vowing not to yield on basic principles this week 
questioned the strategy secretary of state james a baker iii is 
following in trying to implement the prime ministers proposal for 
palestinian elections 
shamir questions the need for an israeli meeting with 
palestinians in cairo before the elections seeing such a session 
as preempting the talks that would be held with elected 
palestinian representatives from the west bank and gaza 
the state department in response on wednesday accused shamir 
of hindering the attempt to arrange negotiations with what the 
department characterized as unhelpful and disappointing remarks 
on thursday however spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
shamir had sent a letter to baker that applauds our efforts and 
encourages us to keep them up 
at the same time she said 
the united states is not trying to get the israelis to 
negotiate with the plo we are trying to get the israelis and the 
palestinians together behind the shamir election proposal 
baker had already assured the prime minister that israel would 
have to be satisfied with the composition of any palestinian 
delegation but baker also has supported egyptian president hosni 
mubaraks effort to negotiate the selection with the plo 
the plo central council meanwhile rejected bakers fivepoint 
proposal at a meeting this week in baghdad iraq 
still ms tutwiler rejected reports from egypt and israel that 
the us initiative had come to a stop every single thing that i 
know certainly leads me to believe that were all still engaged 
she said nothings changed 
the plo has denounced shamirs proposal as a ploy designed to 
avert creation of a palestinian state on israeliheld land shamir 
meanwhile has ruled out any negotiations with the plo or including 
plo members in any palestinian delegation

the farm price of milk has climbed steadily 
meaning prices at the grocery store will climb briskly for the rest 
of 1989 the agriculture department said thursday 
dairy markets are tight because of strong cheese sales 
nonfat dry milk exports and weakness in milk production the 
departments economic research service said 
however the size of the price increases largely was 
determined by the time of events the report said milk 
production unexpectedly collapsed at midyear after commitments had 
been made for large exports of nonfat dry milk and after 
cheesemakers had decided to delay rebuilding of cheese stock until 
the flush season of higher milk production last spring 
but analysts said that milk output probably will rise above 
yearearlier levels in 1990 and that seasonal easing should 
eliminate supply problems 
dairy prices will drop from this autumns highs the report 
said by next spring prices may be below a year earlier 
the farm price of milk in 1989 may average slightly more than 
1 above last years 1224 per 100 pounds the report said in 
1990 the price may average below the 1988 level 
retail prices of milk and dairy products were slower to start 
rising than farm or wholesale prices however increases in retail 
prices will be brisk during the rest of 1989 the report said 
for the first time in many years rises in retail dairy prices 
will surpass those of all food or all consumer items 
consumer food prices overall are currently forecast by usda to 
rise an average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year compared with 
a 41 percent gain in 1988

inquiry into police actions that led an appeals court to reverse 
the convictions 
one other man cleared in the pub bombing case was taken to 
belfast where his attorneys sought bail pending an appeal of an 
unrelated murder conviction 
this is a very grave matter for all who care about justice 
home secretary douglas hurd told the house of commons 
the appeals court ruling climaxed years of effort by relatives 
former government officials church leaders and journalists to 
overturn the verdict and focused new attention on two other 
bombing cases from the 1970s 
the sentence of the four had been upheld in 1977 even though 
members of an ira gang made detailed confessions in the case 
ive been in prison for 15 years for something i didnt do 
im totally innocent gerard conlon told cheering wellwishers 
outside the old bailey following his release 
if youre irish and youre arrested on a terrorist political 
type of offense you dont stand a chance you just dont stand a 
chance conlon said in an interview with independent television 
news 
the appeals court threw out the convictions of conlon 35 
patrick armstrong 39 and paul hill 35 all of belfast and 
carole richardson 32 of london in the bombing of a pub in 
guildford southwest of london on oct 5 1974 
all had been sentenced to life in prison thank god weve not 
got capital punishment conlons attorney anthony scrivener told 
the court 
the convictions of armstrong and hill for a pub bombing in the 
london suburb of woolwich on nov 6 1974 were also reversed 
hill was arrested again and taken to belfast in northern 
ireland where he had been convicted and sentenced to life in 
prison for the murder of a former british soldier 
new evidence throws such doubt upon the honesty and integrity 
of a number of the surrey officers investigating this case in 1974 
that the crown now feels unable to say that the convictions of any 
of the four are safe or satisfactory roy amlot of the office of 
public prosecutions told the hearing 
the prosecution case was based entirely on confessions and in 
particular on the integrity of the officers taking them said 
amlot who disclosed evidence that five officers had altered 
documents withheld evidence and seriously misled the court 
lord lane the lord chief justice responded in fact they 
must have lied 
three of the five officers are still serving on the surrey 
department two were suspended wednesday said david williams 
surreys deputy chief constable hurd said a third officer was 
hospitalized and the other two are retired 
an independent assessor will recommend financial compensation 
for the four hurd said 
all the money in the world would not compensate for what my 
son has gone through the last 15 years said eileen armstrong 
who then burst into tears 
hurd said the judicial inquiry to be headed by retired appeals 
judge sir john may would also examine the conviction of the 
maguire seven including conlons late father on explosives 
charges 
that case developed from statements by hill and conlon that 
conlons aunt annie maguire had manufactured bombs she was 
convicted of possession of explosives as was her husband patrick 
their sons vincent and patrick and patrick conlon patrick 
oneill and sean smyth conlon died in prison in 1980 the others 
have served their sentences 
while expressing satisfaction that the system has the capacity 
to correct its own mistakes prime minister charles haughey of 
ireland said he believed a similar error was made in the conviction 
of six irish men for two birmingham pub bombings nov 21 1974 in 
which 21 people were killed and 160 wounded 
the convictions were upheld last year 
the official admission that a miscarriage of justice can 
happen and does happen has major implications for other cases 
and in particular the birmingham six said paul may chairman of 
a group supporting the six convicts 
weve still got a long hard slog but we can now see the end 
of the road said breda power daughter of billy power one of 
the birmingham convicts 
eight days after the birmingham bombing parliament passed the 
prevention of terrorism act allowing police to hold terrorism 
suspects without charge for 48 hours and in some cases five more 
days 
hills conviction in the guildford bombing was in one of the 
northern ireland diplock courts created in 1973 in which 
judges decide terrorism cases without juries a 1986 study found 
that 89 percent of defendants in those courts pleaded guilty of 
those who pleaded innocent 57 percent were convicted 
before surrey police were accused of mishandling the guildford 
case there were scandals of false confessions in the kent and west 
midlands police forces one officer was dismissed two were 
suspended and several were disciplined

more than a third of hunting injuries occur not 
when one hunter shoots another but when careless sleepy or even 
drunk hunters or their guns fall out of trees according to a 
study released thursday 
the national centers for disease control which studies injuries 
as well as disease in the united states reported the results of a 
georgia study that found 36 percent of hunting injuries were 
mishaps involving tree stands perches where deer hunters wait in 
concealment for their quarry 
a tree stand can be anything from a hastily built platform to a 
storebought builtforcomfort tree chair 
the cdc and georgia officials studied 594 deerhuntingrelated 
injuries in the state over a decade 214 including 17 deaths 
involved tree stands fractures were common 
this is just the tip of the iceberg said dr steven gordon 
an epidemiologist with the georgia department of human resources 
the nature of the system is such that the only reports we get are 
the ones that are fairly serious 
the study looked just at georgia but were sure this is 
occurring in other states gordon said adding that no one had 
systematically looked into it 
most people hear of hunting accidents they picture one person 
shooting another said joel brown georgias state hunter safety 
coordinator but in recent years he said over 50 percent have 
involved tree stands its a serious problem 
most of the tree stand injuries involved falls 111 hunters were 
hurt when they tumbled out of their stands 49 fell while trying to 
climb down and 40 fell while trying to climb up the average stand 
was 16 feet above the ground gordon said 
some hunters simply lost their balance but others had stranger 
stories 
one woman gordon said was hurt in a mishap involving both the 
tree she was hiding in and the deer she shot the wounded deer 
charged toward her and crashed into the tree shaking it and 
dislodging her from her stand she broke a leg 
twentyseven injuries and eight of the 17 tree stand 
fatalities occurred when weapons went off accidentally either 
while being carried up and down the tree or on impact from a fall 
injuries were often serious 156 hunters or 73 percent 
suffered fractures sixteen teenage hunters suffered neck 
fractures and were paralyzed 
eleven hunters reported they had fallen asleep just before 
falling out eight hunters either admitted they were drunk or were 
suspected of it by game officials and that number gordon said 
might be low 
we could not assess the influence of alcohol or other 
substance abuse most of these hunters did not have 
bloodalcohol levels taken he said 
some of the injured hunters were asked whether they had taken a 
hunting safety course twothirds hadnt and none of the 214 
injured hunters were wearing safety harnesses or seat belts 
many mishaps could have been prevented the cdc said if hunters 
had used safety harnesses unloaded their guns while climbing up 
and down used pullup cords to hoist their weapons into their 
stands and checked the condition of their stands before climbing in 
its important that equipment be checked before you go up 
gordon said

a chartered plane a few helicopters and several hotels later 
options dealers from the pacific stock exchange had a smooth day of 
trading thursday at makeshift posts in the chicago new york and 
philadelphia markets 
what we pulled off was no mean feat said exchange 
spokesman dale carlson i just shipped 140 guys away from their 
families a day after the worst catastrophe in san francisco 
history 
if tuesdays quake wasnt quite the worst catastrophe in the 
citys history that distinction still belongs to the 1906 
earthquake the trading airlift was indeed a mean feat it was an 
unprecedented logistical nightmare that involved carpenters 
electricians computer experts and the securities and exchange 
commission 
officials at the various exchanges said trading went smoothly 
there were no hitches said warren moulds at the chicago board 
options exchange once they got oriented it was an easy do 
stock trading continued wednesday at the exchange in san 
francisco a day after the earthquake knocked out power and 
computers dealers worked by candle and flashlight rerouting 
trades via phone through los angeles 
but the los angeles exchange doesnt trade options so about 150 
pacific options traders and support staffers had to be moved east 
so investors could continue trading stock options listed solely on 
the pacific exchange 
the timing was critical because of the looming expiration of 
october stock options friday is the deadline for investors to 
renegotiate the options which let them buy or sell specific stocks 
at a specific price at a certain time 
the exchange trades options in 130 stocks with 70000 contracts 
changing hands on an average day among bigname stocks that have 
options traded only on the pacific exchange are hilton hotels corp 
and compaq computer corp 
in san francisco building inspectors okd the trading floors 
thursday but carlson said options traders would remain where they 
were through friday 
the marathon effort was sanctioned wednesday by the sec at the 
american and new york exchanges carpenters and electricians worked 
through the night on trading areas at the philadelphia stock 
exchange computer experts laid extra cables and programmed 
computers to accept new issues 
the pacific crews arrived by chartered jet shortly before dawn 
thursday in chicago the jet headed for newark nj where some 
traders caught buses into new york and others caught helicopters 
and limousines to philadelphia 
they havent slept in 24 hours plus the trauma of the 
earthquake our hats are off to them said philadelphia exchange 
president nicholas giordano in chicago pacific trading began at 
the markets 830 am cdt opening in new york and philadelphia 
extra time was needed for traders to arrive and get settled and 
trading didnt begin until 1 pm edt 
the exchanges opened up their doors like good samaritans 
said george kender executive vice president of the chicagobased 
options clearing corp which clears all trades in options the 
cooperation has been phenomenal

house and senate negotiators endorsed on 
thursday legislation guaranteeing 20000 compensation payments to 
the estimated 60000 living japaneseamericans who were sent to 
internment camps in world war ii 
the compromise legislation which could pay the former internees 
as much as 12 billion over three years must now be be approved 
by both houses of congress before being sent to the white house for 
consideration by president bush 
attorney general dick thornburgh has opposed the payments becuse 
of their cost bush has not made his position known 
the reparations payments are part of an overall 173 billion 
measure providing appropriations for the commerce state and 
justice departments for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 
house negotiators accepted the senatepassed version of the bill 
guaranteeing that all surviving internees will receive the payments 
the senate voted 7422 on sept 29 to waive budget restrictions 
and guarantee the reparations payments are made 
the senate version of the bill which the conference approved 
bars any payments until the beginning of the fiscal 1991 
but it then makes up to 500 million a year available over three 
years until all of the 20000 reparations payments are made 
the payments would be free of federal tax 
the house version of the bill would have appropriated 50 
million to be made available immediately but included no guarantees 
of any payments beyond that 
congress authorized the payments last year because of the 
budget crunch however no money was actually paid out

a 15year assault on tiny parasites has halted an 
ancient scourge in much of africa sparing millions the threat of 
blindness program director ebrahim samba said thursday 
the gambian physician head of the onchocerciasis control 
program told reporters of the 10 million people in danger when 
we started none is at risk not one 
also samba said thousands of miles of fertile riverbank land 
have been put back into use by farmers who had fled because of the 
disease 
onchocerciasis or river blindness is among the more dreaded of 
endemic diseases that afflict millions in the third world but 
remain little known in developed countries 
worldwide oncho affects an estimated 80 million people in 
africa tropical latin america and parts of southern arabia it 
causes vicious relentless itching followed by blindness or death 
samba was in paris for a world bank meeting to brief donors on 
the program 
operations began in 1974 administered by the world health 
organization and supported by 20 donors the program focused on the 
worsthit area seven countries of the volta river basin in west 
africa 
a million people there suffered from oncho at the time and 
nearly 100000 were blind since then the program added four 
neighboring countries 
by 1991 it will have cost 300 million with the biggest 
contributions from the united states the world bank and the 
netherlands a final monitoring phrase is planned until 1997 
samba estimated 90000 people would have gone blind since 1974 
and a million children would have been exposed without the program 
transmission has stopped for five years he said it is 
under control 
teams worked in villages inured to the daily routine of small 
children leading around sightless elders in parts of burkina faso 
one infant in five could expect to be blind by age 30 
on a continent where the average annual income is 300 you 
can imagine how serious it is to be blind samba said 
oncho is carried by microscopic larvae transmitted in the bite 
of riverbred black flies when operations started farmers were 
being bitten up to 1000 times a day during the rainy season 
in the human body larvae grow into threadlike worms lumped in 
nodules that itch so badly they can drive victims to suicide they 
attack the eyes and a buildup of dead worms causes blindless 
eradication teams in small planes and helicopters ranged along 
11000 miles of rivers spraying weekly during wet seasons new 
resistant strains emerged forcing changes in larvacides 
borne by westerly winds flies traveled 400 miles a day from 
unsprayed areas to stop reinfestation the program was expanded 
from 295000 square miles to 502000 square miles 
teams treat victims with a new drug ivermectin donated by 
merck amp co of rahway nj which controls young worms adult 
worms defy all medicines living up to 18 years 
ivermectin requires at least one dose yearly it cannot prevent 
infestation but samba said its use has sharply cut back 
blindness and other debilitating effects 
samba has spent almost as much time at politics as disease 
control across a wide region where conflicts sometimes erupt in 
gunfire 
after the brief war between mali and burkina faso in 1985 his 
were the first civil aircraft back in the air 
often cabinet ministers have relatives mothers and fathers 
who suffer from oncho samba said they understand the urgency 
on a personal level 
he acknowledged that program methods could not be easily applied 
elsewhere in africa or latin america because the flies were 
scattered over too wide an area 
but elsewhere this is not so acute a problem he said 
the program includes benin burkina faso ivory coast ghana 
mali niger togo guinea guineabissau senegal and sierra leone 
florent agueh world bank officer for the region called the 
program a model for aid to developing countries 
after 15 years enthusiasm among donors and recipients is as 
strong as ever he said in the world of development 
persistence is usually what is most lacking

solidarity leader lech walesa and cardinal 
josef glemp led 15000 mourners thursday at an anniversary mass for 
the rev jerzy popieluszko a popular priest slain by the secret 
police five years ago 
many of the 259 solidarity members of parliament attended the 
90minute outdoor evening service at st stanislaw kostkas church 
popieluszkos former parish in a residential neighborhood of 
northern warsaw 
dozens of buses that brought workers from around the country 
lined the street in front of the church hundreds of candles 
flickered on the sidewalks surrounding the grounds 
scores of banners proclaimed representatives of factories and 
solidarity chapters throughout poland one banner near the grave 
said jerzy today we collect the fruit of your suffering 
popieluszko supported workers in the difficult years after the 
declaration of martial law dec 13 1981 prosolidarity 
demonstrations and clashes with security police have marked 
previous anniversaries of his death 
he became a symbol of solidaritys struggle for recognition 
foreign leaders such as prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain visited his grave 
glemp the roman catholic primate of poland said in his sermon 
after five years the nation remembers the brave chaplain and 
will remember father jerzy believed and spread this belief that 
time would come for the victory of truth 
glemp put popieluszko in the pantheon of great poles such as 
composer frederic chopin who died in france 140 years ago this 
week 
the crowd warmly welcomed a delegation from hungary which like 
poland has set a course away from communism and toward democracy 
wed like to put into practice in our country in hungary 
what father popieluszko was teaching us said a hungarian priest 
accompanying the group 
he told the poles an exhibition on popieluszko opened in hungary 
this month and asked for prayers for the hungarian roman catholic 
church 
walesa went to popieluszkos grave for a silent prayer before 
the mass but did not speak at the service 
political life in poland has dramatically changed this year not 
only has solidarity been made legal again but a former solidarity 
editor is prime minister of the first noncommunist government in 
the soviet bloc 
state radio and television now directed by a solidarity member 
carried a range of programs about popieluszko including comments 
by his mother and an interview with his former driver 
three secret policemen abducted the priest oct 19 1984 ten 
days later his bound and gagged body was pulled from the freezing 
vistula river 
the three policeman and their commanding officer were convicted 
of murder in february 1985 
testimony at the trial indicated popieluszko was killed because 
of his activities in defense of workers dismissed or jailed for 
supporting solidarity 
one of the convicted policeman has been released under a reduced 
sentence but the others remain in prison

collapsed during tuesday evenings quake which measured 69 on the 
richter scale 
many commuters found themselves stuck in traffic jams others 
arrived at buildings still in the dark or with only partial power 
others turned back after facing up to fourhour delays on the 
overburdened highways

it was now you see it now you dont for the female 
form in thursdays readytowear fashion shows for next summer 
japanese designers and others swathed their models in loose 
smooth and sometimes transparent fabrics that suggested the body 
without emphasizing it 
after two seasons of normal clothes rei kawakubo at comme 
des garcons in particular reverted to some of her old layering and 
asymmetrical tricks 
kawakubos designs suggested a circus starting with a big 
group of white blousons bubble skirts and shorts with a hole 
carved out of one jacket sleeve at the shoulder a typical kawakubo 
signature touch 
some comme des garcons items looked like true paris fashion 
others were a mess including bunchedup prints clinging to the 
body and hitched up to one side to look selfconsciously offhand 
besides her usual black and white kawakubo went in for some 
blinding neon shades of pink green and yellow bright enough to 
stop traffic on sunset boulevard 
an offwhite long cool wool coat with little points at the 
shoulders was quite handsome another original idea was pairing 
fencers tunics with wide cuffed shorts and long lean pants for a 
smooth layered look 
people with a figure problem might appreciate the wideflowing 
sheer cotton dresses printed in passementerie flowered bands or 
plaids and the black tent dresses edged in gold chains were 
another good solution for the weightwatching set 
for evening she suggested women turn into disco decor in 
black and white viscose gowns with square mirror toppings 
yohji yamamotos long satin vests and baggy pants in navy or 
blackandwhite combinations looked typical of the japanese 
creator his sober layered looks command a big following though 
theyre no longer in the avantgarde 
yamamoto varied his usual menu of dreary black with lots of 
welcome color starting with a loose tangerine satin viscose apron 
worn over a clinging black body suit transparent voile cottons 
flowing over black underneath gave a lighter appeal to his severity 
yamamoto showed some wonderful stiffened dark gray midcalf 
skirts gathered like cartridge pleats with clinging black tops but 
just to emphasize female curves he brought out dresses with 
plumpedup bodices to puff up the bosom over skirts with padded 
ridges 
another designer to hail the female bust was jeancharles de 
castelbajac he brought out some molded latex fleshcolored tops 
with every anatomical detail in place topping them with a rainbow 
of multicolored sheer cotton duster jackets over wide long pants 
in hot hues like orange raspberry yellow and emerald 
the new fabrics in shorts big jackets and long pants included 
neutral tones of a corrugated and textured silklike fabric 
handpainted gzar and canvas were always in the strong color and 
simple themes castelbajac loves and rednavywhite combinations of 
felt and linen came out in all versions of sailor styles 
for beachcombers wanting to hide from the sun he showed some 
fullskirted silvery linen outfits topped by floppy straw sunhats 
as big as a beach umbrellla 
after many years as a structural designer showing clothes based 
on menswear nino cerruti loosened up considerably with a flowing 
liquid silhouette for a casual but sophisticated woman 
after some strict pastel suits for power dressing he brought 
out a big range of long and flowing outfits in soft neutral tones 
of glen plaids solids like dusty pink and grayblue 
his silhouette was always lean under very long and rounded 
lapels or wide and floppy lapels the white blouse collars showing 
on top 
thierry mugler always exaggerates the female form and this time 
was no exception besides some hot wrappedprint sarong looks he 
molded bodies in plenty of outfits with a campysexy cartoon 
appeal and even decked out one model in the trappings of a loud 
1950s hotrod with bumperbullet bosoms chrome trim and all

mexican authorities have captured the nephews 
of two major colombian drug kingpins and broken up a ring that flew 
cocaine into mexico and shipped it by boat to florida authorities 
said thursday 
the colombians were captured along with eight other men sunday 
at a clandestine airstrip in the yucatan peninsula according to 
federal police commander fausto valverde head of the narcotics 
interdiction forces 
two other men were captured in the resort city of cancun but 
one colombian escaped in an airplane valverde said 
the leaders of the yucatan ring were luis alfredo aguilar 
castro a nephew of gonzalo rodriguez gacha and ricardo isunza 
ochoa a nephew of fabio ochoa valverde said 
fabio ochoa and rodriguez gacha known as el mexicano 
because of his fondness for things mexican are top members of the 
medellin cartel and are among the worlds most wanted drug 
traffickers 
valverde said aguilar and isunza ochoa were their uncles 
representatives in the smuggling operation when asked if the two 
might be extradited to the united states valverde said anything 
is possible 
he said he didnt know what charges the two might be wanted on 
in colombia or in the united states nor if a uscolombia 
agreement under which drug traffickers can be extradited to the 
united states would apply 
commander miguel rodriguez lorrabaquio said the case was 
unrelated to recent large drug busts along the usmexico border 
including the seizure of nine tons of cocaine in harlingen texas 
and 20 tons in a los angeles suburb 
lorrabaquio said the yucatan ring brought cocaine in from 
colombia by air then shipped it by boat to the united states 
usually to florida while the cocaine seized along the border was 
probably being taken across by land 
valverde said the airplane carrying the drugs escaped when 
someone on the ground warned the pilot by radio that mexican police 
were at the airstrip 
he said authorities were looking into whether the drugrunners 
had any official or unofficial protection for their ground 
operations 
we imagine they made an arrangement for protection valverde 
said 
valverde said that in spite of the situation in colombia where 
drugrelated violence has increased since the august assassination 
of a presidential candidate there had been no threats against 
mexican law enforcement officials over the seizure of aguilar and 
isunza ochoa 
valverde said us and colombian authorities had no involvement 
in the threemonth investigation and bust

an exnurse charged with killing four 
hospital patients with lethal injections was a monster dressed 
in white who switched from mice to humans for experiments a 
prosecutor said in opening arguments thursday 
richard angelo was the living embodiment of your worst 
nightmare assistant district attorney john colins told the jury 
he conducted uncontrolled experiments on knowingly terribly 
vulnerable human beings for his stated purposes of improving his 
image and reputation colins said 
police have said angelo admitted he injected patients at a long 
island hospital to put them on the brink of death so he could be 
the first on the scene to resuscitate them and look like a hero to 
his colleagues 
angelo 27 was a nurse for about six months in 1987 at good 
samaritan hospital when four patients ranging in age from 57 to 
75 died within minutes of being injected with the muscle relaxant 
pavulon three other patients survived pavulon injections 
the lindenhurst man is charged with four counts of seconddegree 
murder and three counts of assault 
eric naiburg angelos attorney conceded that angelo injected 
the patients with the drug and that some of those patients may have 
died as a result of what he did but he said angelo is not guilty 
of murder he suggested a count of lesser homicide or assault 
colins charged that angelo turned to humans after tiring of 
performing drug experiments on mice 
to unsuspecting patients in the special care unit at good 
samaritan hospital angelo was a monster dressed in nurses 
whites colins said he was not content to stop after 
experimenting first with his mice and watching them die 
one of those angelo is charged with assaulting gerolamo kucich 
75 testified that angelo asked him how he was feeling and then 
injected him with a paralyzing drug after saying this will make 
you feel much better 
i became like dead i couldnt move said kucich who 
had been hospitalized after suffering a heart attack i was 
thinking how long is it going to last before i die 
as kucich testified angelo sat at the defense table with his 
eyes downcast 
kucich said he pressed the emergency alarm and his regular 
nurse lauren ball came in and helped revive him 
moments later angelo returned to the room but kucich said he 
still couldnt talk or see he said he heard angelos voice and 
pointed toward the voice 
according to kucich mrs ball asked angelo what did you do 
kucich said angelo answered nothing and left the room

he was to go to the electric chair for killing a state trooper in 
1977 
us district judge donald e walter granted dalton prejean 30 
the stay shortly after receiving prejeans latest appeal saying

louisiana state penitentiary officials had been preparing the 
electric chair for use just after midnight 
prejean was in another section of the prison at a state pardon 
board hearing where friends and family pleaded for clemency but 
the hearing was suspended after walters ruling

death after the officer stopped the car prejean and his brother 
were in 
the murder occurred only six months after prejeans release from 
a reform school where hed been sent for killing a taxi driver 
when he was 14 
prejean has been on death row 10 years longer than any other 
louisiana convict eight previous execution dates were canceled by 
state or federal courts

president carlos menem spent 45 
minutes thursday with two terrorists he had pardoned who told 
reporters the return of democracy had removed the need for the 
antigovernment violence they advocated in the 1970s 
fernando vaca narvaja and roberto perdia who until 12 days ago 
were fugitives in hiding outside the country told a government 
house news conference they had thanked menem for the pardon and 
pledged to work for national reconciliation 
there is no possibility of armed action when democratic 
institutions are in full force said vaca narvaja who promised 
to return ransom money his montonero guerrillas extorted from 
kidnap victims 
norvaja now 41 and in a jacket and tie looked more like a 
middleclass professional than someone once accused of murder 
kidnapping assault bombings jailbreak airplane hijacking and 
other crimes 
perdia paunchy and pinstriped at 48 looked equally unlike a 
revolutionary whose actions helped bring on the military coup of 
march 1976 and the dirty war against suspected leftists that 
raged until the end of the decade 
it is absolutely essential to think of and construct a future 
for the living without forgetting the past he said 
on oct 7 menem pardoned 39 colonels generals and vice 
admirals who faced trial for kidnapping torture and murder in the 
disappearances and presumed deaths of 9000 people during nearly 
eight years of military rule the junta left power upon the 
election of lawyer raul alfonsin as president in 1983 
menem a former provincial governor who succeeded alfonsin in 
july also pardoned 64 guerrillas and indicated he soon would free 
jorge videla and roberto viola army generals who served as 
presidents of the military juntas and are in prison for human 
rights violations 
also on the potential pardon list is mario firmenich cofounder 
of the montoneros who is serving a 30year sentence for murder 
menems goal is to end a bloody chapter in argentine history and 
concentrate on dealing with argentinas chronic inflation a 
protracted recession and uncharacteristically high unemployment 
the military has insisted since relinquishing power to alfonsin 
in december 1983 that it fought a kind of civil war against 
terrorists rights groups accuse the military of wholesale killing 
rights groups and leftist political organizations opposed the 
military pardons and say they hope to gather a million signatures 
on a petition for reversal opponents also called a demonstration 
for friday outside the faded pink government house 
meanwhile two of the three largest political parties have 
endorsed the pardon as has the roman catholic church the largest 
newspapers and the most influential business and farm groups

prodemocracy activists said on thursday that the 
choice of egon krenz as east germanys new leader could lead to 
protesters again filling the streets unless he belies his hardline 
reputation and implements reforms 
krenz succeeded erich honecker on wednesday and soon made clear 
in an address to the nation the communist party will resist the 
democratic trends evident in east germanys warsaw pact allies 
hungary and poland 
but he said west germanys refusal to recognize east german 
citizenship was an obstacle to expanding travel to the west 
krenz on thursday visited an east berlin factory and his 
encounter with workers which touched on broad public 
dissatisfaction was deemed by west germanys ard tv network 
unthinkable only a few weeks ago 
excerpts of the footage shown on aktuelle kamera east germanys 
main evening newscast were carried by west german networks 
when asked by krenz why so many coworkers had fled to west 
germany metal worker ronald berus said a lot of things kept 
adding up until some people felt there was just no alternative 
several workers complained of the rigid travel restrictions 
which recently were expanded to include czechoslovakia poland and 
hungary after more than 53000 east german refugeess streamed there 
to begin their treks west 
the unusual presentation may reflect a willingness by krenz to 
allow more frank discussion of national problems in the 
statecontrolled media 
krenz also met with werner leich head of the east german 
lutheran church federation for talks described by east german tv 
as open and constructive 
krenz said wednesday he wanted to improve relations between 
church and state 
also thursday the west german newspaper bild said polands 
state bank is selling for hard currency 100 million east german 
marks it holds in banks in frankfurt bild said the bank acted 
because of a lack of confidence in east germanys internal 
stability and as a hedge against a possible revaluation of east 
germanys currency 
east germany officially pegs one east german mark equal to one 
west german mark in reality it is worth perhaps a fourth of that 
a dollar now fetches about 185 west german marks 
reinhard schult a founder of new forum the largest 
prodemocracy group in east germany said thursday on rias radio of 
west berlin krenz stands for the continuation of neostalinst 
politics 
he said krenz did not have one word to say about the causes of 
the current crisis and made no offer for talks with the 
opposition 
author rolf schneider a critic of the government told rias 
the crisis will keep dragging on 
a lutheran church leader said privately the demonstrations 
will start again soon unless the government changes its course 
the church has been in the forefront of reform efforts 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany urged 
krenz to make fundamental reforms he said east germans demand 
their basic rights 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev a champion of reform 
sent krenz a telegram expressing confidence he would respond to 
the demands of the time following a course of renewal and 
continuity 
in poland the only soviet bloc nation with a noncommunist 
government both prosolidarity and communist party newspapers 
described honeckers departure as a welcome change 
newspapers in hungary which is moving rapidly from communism 
toward westernstyle democracy said krenz was seen as a 
transitional figure 
reform activists in east germany said 1000 people peacefully 
protested in greifswald hours after krenz 52 a protege of 
honecker was named leader 
more than 120000 prodemocracy protesters marched in leipzig on 
monday 
on thursday many residents of east berlin were skeptical about 
the leadership change 
krenz just wants to calm us down said a worker in his 
mid20s well have to see if theres going to be anything more 
than words this time

another destructive earthquake has motivated 
southern californians once again to plan ahead for the next one 
but the rush for survival goods that accompanies such frightening 
episodes may be short lived 
every time something like this happens we get a surge then it 
tapers off again said steve reed of the 11store sportmart 
chain one of the regions largest sporting goods retailers 
its been two years since the quake in the los angeles suburb of 
whittier which killed eight people inspired residents to a 
concerted effort to prepare for a natural calamity 
since the 69magnitude san francisco bay area quake tuesday 
night the sportmart stores have been overrun with customers buying 
water purifiers portable toilets stoves lanterns flashlights 
and food 
this time more than ever before they are filling in with the 
real nittygritty stuff said reed the television coverage of 
san francisco earthquake victims deprived of such basics as food 
and water has had a big impact he said 
some of the items are selling tenfold especially water 
purifying kits water is the biggest concern the idea has been 
planted said reed 
experience has taught however that apathy will return 
there was a mild response when the sparkletts drinking water 
corp tried selling earthquake preparedness kits earlier this year 
but the bay area quake jolted people into action said norm 
hefinton of the sparkletts santa ana office 
we expect to do about 40 percent more business we get a surge 
of business after every big earthquake said hefington 
consumers wont store items necessary for surviving an 
earthquake unless they are shaken up he said 
although sparkletts ended its earthquake kit advertising 
campaign in july telephones orders began pouring in the day after 
the bay area quake the kit includes two cases of bottled water a 
safety stove and a candle 
other quake preparedness items in demand were water heater 
straps and wrenches to shut down gas and water lines said mike 
ainsworth of the home depot home improvement store in huntington

three strong aftershocks rattled a jittery 
northern california on thursday and rescuers who found fewer cars 
than feared under a collapsed freeway said the world series may 
have reduced the rushhour traffic 
maybe we got lucky because of the game oakland police sgt 
bob crawford said normally at 5 oclock in the afternoon this 
area would be bumpertobumper maybe the world series saved our 
lives 
power and commuters returned to much of downtown san francisco 
as a tentative city tried to recover and regroup following 
tuesdays earthquake which claimed scores of lives and at least 
287 billion in damage 
residents of the ravaged marina district furious at initially 
being barred from their homes later lined up for 15minute passes 
to fetch clothing medicine food and belongings 
at the 1mile stretch of the collapsed doubledeck interstate 
880 the nimitz freeway in oakland workers cut holes in concrete 
and used cranes to pull out pancakeflat cars rescuers reported 
finding the cars as far apart as 60 feet rather than 
bumpertobumper as had been feared assistant fire chief al 
sigwart said 
that could lower the death toll in the highway rubble 
estimated earlier at 253 authorities said 
they are going lower much lower in fact lisa covington a 
spokeswoman for the office of emergency services said of the 
estimates whats happening is that they are finding fewer 
vehicles under the bridge than they thought 
firefighter dan getreu said he had walked the length of the 
fallen highway and estimated no more than two dozen cars were 
trapped 
no new official estimate of fatalities was made 
many people left work early to watch the third game of the world 
series scheduled to start at 530 pm and 60000 people already 
were across the bay in san francisco at candlestick park when the 
quake struck at 504 pm 
the world series will resume tuesday at candlestick park in san 
francisco 
oakland mayor lionel wilson said thursday that only 85 people 
were officially reported missing 
on thursday morning three aftershocks struck south of san 
francisco the first measuring 50 on the richter scale of ground 
motion hit at 315 am and was centered near watsonville about 
eight miles from the epicenter of tuesdays 69 quake according to 
the state office of emergency services two other aftershocks 
measured 45 
no one is really sleeping around here watsonville resident 
john murphy said 
i cant stop shaking said 73yearold marcelina toussaint 
i guess im surviving but im scared 
fiftysix people were treated at a watsonville community clinic 
mostly for bruises and frazzled nerves city spokeswoman lorraine 
washington said about 150 people were evacuated from a national 
guard armory shelter after a natural gas leak 
watsonville issued a plea for additional doctors and nurses 
some homes that were damaged in the initial quake collapsed 
under the power of the aftershocks many residents of the town of 
30000 part of californias salad bowl region where much of 
the nations lettuce asparagus and artichokes are grown spread 
across lawns and vacant lots like refugees 
were talking about people with no resources no money for 
food and no money for health care said barbara garcia executive 
director of salud pera la gente a statefinanced community clinic 
as of early thursday more than 1400 aftershocks had been 
recorded the strongest 52 on the richter scale struck within 40 
minutes of the initial jolt according the us geological survey 
across the bay area the nations fourthlargest metropolitan 
area with more than 6 million people shaken cities tried to cope 
as best they could with stilllimited services strapped police and 
fire departments and transportation havoc created by the closing of 
freeways and the bay bridge the lifeline that links oakland and 
san francisco

hummed and heavy equipment brought in to finish the destruction 
the earthquake left unfinished groaned 
marina residentsgathered at police barricades and begged for 
permission to retrieve food clothing and medicine from their 
homes but were denied because officials said the area was unsafe 
this is a nightmare i have to get my medicine for my asthma

some schools and most bank branches reopened and some shelters 
closed the subway system was operating fully but transit 
spokesman mike healy reported belownormal passenger loads because 
many workers remained home 
before dawn thursday thousands of alarms set off across the 
financial district heralded the restoration of power to downtown 
buildings 
for the most part community spirit held up even as the reality 
of the devastation and hardship set in and the grim tasks of 
uncovering bodies and cataloging damage continued 
a nonprofit organization that provides food to aids victims 
delivered more than 7000 hot meals and sandwiches to shelters on 
both sides of the bay 
pizzeria owner pete pallari mounted a charcoal grill in the bed 
of a pickup and served meals scrambled eggs bacon and fresh 
coffee 
i just couldnt save it it would have all been spoiled he 
said 
volunteers continued toiling at the nimitz freeway disaster 
scene in oakland preparing to stabilize the wreckage to eventually 
retrieve battered bodies 
rescue workers placed wood and iron pipe supports beneath 
tottering slabs of highway so they could work underneath the 
bloodspattered concrete 
you try to ignore it and just do your job said construction 
worker brad elfring 
part of the slow digging process includes crawling into the 
wreckage to map the locations of the smashed cars oakland police 
sgt alan white said bright green orange and pink paint marked 
the spots of cars and bodies 
once the map is complete and the span is supported which could 
take several more days white said a machine called a concrete 
nibbler will break through the upper level to each car removing 
sections of highway like pieces of cookie dough 
at least one rescue worker 20yearold jason solorio said he 
believed there still may be survivors in the rubble solorio said 
he sneaked into a section of the sealedoff freeway 
there are open spaces in there where a person could be trapped 
alive he said 
gov george deukmejian demanded an investigation into the 
collapse of i880 saying it should have been built to survive the 
earthquake 
despite the freeway disaster california officials took note of 
the success of earthquake preparedness and building codes although 
the quake at magnitude 69 was as strong as last years armenian 
earthquake the destruction was not even remotely comparable 
the armenian quake killed 25000 people 
president bush said he would fly to california on friday to 
take a look and to provide encouragement to people 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said 1173 california 
national guardsmen have been called to duty to help in quake 
recovery operations 
williams said the us army corps of engineers began inspecting 
federal dams and levees and at the request of the state 
government state and private dams so far no damage has been 
reported for structures inspected within 50 miles of the epicenter 
a u2 reconnaisance plane from beale air force base flew over 
the san francisco area to shoot pictures to detect problems in 
structures

up to 45 million poles will get the east 
blocs first food stamps to battle inflation that has increased 
food prices by more than 1000 percent in three months a newspaper 
reported thursday 
the food coupons represent one of several steps the east blocs 
only noncommunist government is taking to combat the worst effects 
of the current economic crisis as poland tries to switch to a 
marketoriented economy from a deficitridden centralized system 
inflation is estimated at 600 percent or more annually the 
effects have been particularly acute for food since the aug 1 
lifting of controls that had used government subsidies to keep 
prices artificially low while creating an everwidening budget 
deficit 
meat prices have increased sevenfold with 22 pounds of pork 
costing 715 butter has gone up from 14 cents for 11 pounds to 
180 for the same amount 
food coupons were a part of the new governments economic reform 
plan announced oct 6 but details have not been presented 
the food coupons will be available to pensioners and retirees 
the disabled and others who are getting help from social welfare 
institutions and children up to 6 years old from the poorest 
families according to the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
the recipients will be able to use coupons to pay for limited 
amounts of milk cheese and bread the coupons will also be 
redeemed at kindergartens institution canteens and some other 
public facilities the report said 
the first of the coupons will be distributed in december by 
social agencies and local administrations to those who show 
evidence of their low income the newspaper said 
the distribution of the coupons will become a lesson of a kind 
of social trust this second money will be given on the basis of 
ones own statement about ones income gazeta wyborcza said 
about 4 million to 45 million people will meet the income limit 
that will be set dec 1 likely pegged to the lowest current 
pension the report said 
the food stamp program will be financed by withdrawing 
government subsidies from the production of lowfat milk cheese and 
bread the newspaper said no figure was provided for the total 
cost 
across poland soup kitchens have been opened by churches and 
charitable organizations to help those hardest hit by the effects 
of what prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has called economic 
catastrophe 
the government faces a budget deficit of 23 billion that could 
reach 44 billion by the end of the year without radical 
costcutting steps 
a substantial portion of the deficit came from subsidies that 
were used to make up the widening gap between prices and the actual 
cost of production prices for many nonfood items still are 
governmentcontrolled with controls to be lifted as part of the 
switch to a market economy 
unlike food stamps subsidies supply cheap food to all 
regardless of income as did meat rationing which assured modest 
inexpensive supplies even to those who could afford to pay more on 
the free market 
a rationing system continues in the soviet union to distribute 
scarce goods but at the same fixed state prices a special package 
of items is made available to pensioners for example but it is 
not free or reduced in price 
food prices were raised gradually over the years in poland but 
the communist government tried other economic reforms in lieu of 
making major increases it feared social unrest if the state 
replaced government subsidies for production 
however the last act of the government of mieczyslaw rakowski 
now communist party first secretary was to lift government 
controls on food prices altogether aug 1 and end meat rationing 
the new government agreed the step was needed but said it lacked 
precautions to protect the poor from the worst effects

national drug policy coordinator william j 
bennett said on thursday that the drug crisis in the district of 
columbia continues to worsen despite a sixmonth joint partnership 
by federal and local authorities fighting the problem 
no one should be surprised to learn that the nations capital 
is still plagued by a serious drug problem bennett said at a 
news conference we picked a difficult task last april and i 
never had any illusions about the challenges that lay before us 
bennett made his remarks while issuing a sixmonth progress 
report on a special initiative he generated to help the district 
curb its record murder rate and drugrelated crime wave 
so far in 1989 360 persons have been killed in the district 12 
short of the alltime annual record that was set last year by this 
time in 1988 270 homicides had been reported in washington police 
blame drugs particularly crack cocaine for more than 60 percent 
of these deaths 
on wednesday city officials complained that bennetts 
contributions have done little to stop the killings and said he has 
taken credit for a variety of other antidrug programs and 
initiatives already in effect 
where we need help they have not responded said frank 
jasmine an assistant to city administrator carol b thompson 
theres a long road to go 
bennett defended the federal governments efforts but said he 
knew that local and federal authorities are in for a long battle 
i wouldnt say that we havent made any difference but i 
would still say the situation is intolerable bennett said we 
are in the process of getting control of the situationbut it 
will take time 
bennett who criticized the city government for its handling of 
the drug crisis shortly after he took office said on thursday that 
his office is working better with district officials now

china threatened to cut economic ties with 
norway if the government or king attends the ceremony awarding the 
nobel peace prize to the dalai lama norwegian tv said but norway 
showed no sign of give thursday 
egil aarvik head of the awarding committee dismissed the 
threat while assessing chinas reaction as the strongest by any 
government since adolf hitlers fury when an antinazi won the 
award 53 years ago 
hitler reacted with a similar rage when carl von ossietzky won 
the prize for 1935 aarvik told the associated press on thursday 
ossietzky a german journalist peace activist and opponent of 
hitler was in a nazi concentration camp when the award was made in 
1936 hitler responded by saying no german would be allowed to 
accept the prize 
the dalai lama exiled buddhist leader of tibet was named the 
peace laureate oct 5 for his nonviolent struggle to end chinese 
rule of his homeland the announcement was widely seen as an 
implied rebuke to beijing for its crackdown on prodemocracy 
protesters in june 
foreign ministry spokeswoman sigrid romundset said the chinese 
have not officially threatened a boycott the ceremony will be held 
on dec 10 
guisheng wang of the chinese embassy in oslo refused to 
comment on the threat reported on wednesday by norwegian 
television it is well known that we protested earlier he said 
the chinese foreign ministry complained on oct 7 that the award 
supported the dalai lamas efforts to split china and hurt the 
feelings of the chinese people 
foreign minister kjell magne bondevik observed there are 
established practices about participating in the awards ceremony 
and we have no plans of changing them

engineers delayed strengthening the 
32yearold oakland freeway that collapsed in this weeks 
earthquake because they believed it would survive a major quake 
the state transportation chief said thursday 
we didnt know 10 years ago this was subject to this type of 
earthquake damage we did not know there was any possibility it 
would collapse transportation director robert best said 
best said he was unaware of a private engineers report in 1975 
that the collapsed interstate 880 viaduct had an outdated design 
that made it vulnerable to such quakes 
ive been assured there were no experts no studies no data 
that suggested in any way that it would fall best said 
state inspection reports for the collapsed section show a 
history of minor problems over the years including hairline 
cracks flaking concrete a cracked girder and sagging deck some 
problems were corrected and others werent 
but there was no problem of structural failure at all 
best said of the reports 
a 1milelong stretch of the twotiered nimitz freeway 
collapsed during tuesdays earthquake an upper section of the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge also collapsed 
gov george deukmejian has called for an immediate investigation 
of i880s collapse the governor said the freeway should have been 
built to survive the quake which registered 69 on the richter 
scale of ground motion 
a blueribbon commission of bridge engineers is being set up to 
determine why the structure collapsed and what steps can be taken 
to prevent such tragedies in the future best said 
j david rogers a pleasant hill engineer said he determined in 
1975 that the structure wouldnt survive a major earthquake and he 
said the information was presented to state transportation 
officials at that time 
best said its irresponsible to suggest the state knew the 
structure would collapse he said its possible there were 
unusual subsurface conditions that we didnt know about which 
could have contributed to the collapse the highway was built on 
fill soils 
the failed structure had undergone only the first phase of a 
threestep program to reinforce the roadway best said engineers 
felt i880 would be at less risk than other highways because it 
was the least likely to fail 
the retrofitting project on i880 began in 1977 and was the 
first road improvement since the highway was designed in 1954 and 
constructed in 1957 
but phase two of the program for i880 and other roadways with 
doublecolumn supports was deferred as officials focused on 
strengthening roads with singlecolumn supports which they 
believed were more vulnerable best said 
the first phase involved strengthening the roadway the second 
began on singlecolumn supports two years ago and involves 
strengthening existing columns 
authorities deferred the i880 retrofitting pending outcome of a 
stillunfinished engineering study to determine the best sort of 
repairs the freeway was last inspected in april 
officials had no estimate of when that study might be completed 
they emphasized that i880 was not neglected or given too low a 
priority in the retrofitting project 
asked whether the i880 section had been considered safe from 
earthquake damage transportation department chief engineer bill 
schaefer said theres no such thing as an earthquakeproof 
structure certainly but he added he was shocked by the 
sections collapse 
we thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquake 
we could have in this area anything that would happen in this 
area he said

said thursday 
the complaints whose number wasnt tallied were made to nbc 
television network president pier mapes nbc news executive news 
director don browne and nbc news president michael gartner said

and to broadcast pictures from the scene once it began full 
coverage after 9 pm edt that day nbc stayed on the air with 
nonstop coverage that included a fivehour today edition 
before it signed off at noon wednesday 
in an interview wednesday gartner blamed nbcs delay on the 
quake itself he said krontv nbcs san francisco affiliate had 
been knocked off the air by the earthquake and was temporarily 
unable to help nbc transmit its reports 
we heard from a good number of affiliates and i would say 
they were as unhappy as we were that we werent on sooner hubble 
said thursday when asked whether nbc affiliates had complained 
about nbcs coverage 
however she added the complaining station executives proved 
understanding when told of the situation at krontv they also 
expressed pleasure at nbcs subsequent nonstop quake coverage

televison networks all sent dozens of 
staffers to cover the northern california earthquake but sheer 
numbers couldnt always overcome the enormous difficulties the 
story presented 
even with milliondollar anchors and squadrons of 
correspondents technicians and producers the three broadcast 
networks and cnn quickly learned its a grind to deliver 
compelling competitive reports in conditions where rumor and 
misinformation have flowed like water 
abc anchor peter jennings arrived at destroyed interstate 880 on 
wednesday morning and minutes later delivered a live dispatch 
that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly 
and accurately 
jennings said rescue workers had labored through the night to 
save lives on the collapsed freeway anyone who had spent the 
earlymorning hours there would have said very little happened 
after midnight 
in one of his initial news bulletins tuesday night from new 
york cbs dan rather played it safe not wanting to speculate on 
information he didnt have rather read major earthquake figures 
from an almanac 
john carman the television critic for the san francisco 
chronicle said quake coverage by cnn was sometimes as inexact as 
it was instant cnn was on the air six minutes after the quake hit 
carman noted that cnn anchors molly mccoy and bob cain were 
unfamiliar with such things as local geography and area codes 
cbs news has heard some complaints too weve been criticized 
from both ends for being too cautious and then i had a call that 
were doing too much coverage said spokeswoman donna dees 
after overcoming various initial jitters all four networks were 
praised by tv critics for steady informative broadcasts ratings 
were strong too 
the three broadcast network newscasts originated wednesday night 
from the earthquake zone as jennings was joined in town by rather 
and nbcs tom brokaw cnn sent atlanta anchor lou waters and 25 
correspondents the networks also broadcast primetime specials on 
the disaster 
in addition nbcs today show was anchored in san francisco 
and cbs 48 hours and abcs primetime live planned 
broadcasts on the quake for thursday night nbc news president 
michael gartner said his network had 60 staffers in the city 
andrew heyward the executive producer of 48 hours said 
thursday the arrival of the network stars testified to the storys 
importance there is an advantage for the anchor to be in the 
city its certainly better than in the studio heyward said 
indeed national interest in the tv accounts and mesmerizing 
footage has been profound preliminary ratings for the abc cbs and 
nbc specials wednesday night indicated nearly half of all homes 
with television tuned in 
according to ac nielsen co estimates abcs special the 
great quake of 89 was the highestrated of the broadcasts 
averaging a 132 rating 
nbcs special earthquake aftershock directly competing 
with abcs program at 10 pm edt was second with a 122 rating a 
cbs reports special the califoria earthquake which aired 
an hour earlier averaged an 119 rating 
each rating point represents 921000 homes 
cnn set an alltime viewership record tuesday night when more 
than 36 million homes watched the news network cnn spokesman 
anthony masterson said 
the great difficulties are imposed by the loss of power 
traffic jams and obstacles created by the story itself said cnn 
executive vice president ed turner once you have that 
established the unfolding of the story is not that difficult 
journalistic standards can crumble when dealing with a disaster 
such as the san francisco earthquake turner said the greatest 
trap is to pass on bad information and theres a lot of it out 
there or create an alarmist atmosphere and scare people you have 
to be judicious in your demeanor 
while many are transfixed by the television images not all are 
pleased viewers of cbs affiliate kmov in st louis flooded the 
switchboard when tuesday earthquake coverage first interrupted a tv 
movie on acquaintance rape

house speaker tom foley on thursday estimated 
at least 25 billion in federal funds would be needed for 
california earthquake damage and said the house would vote next 
week to provide it deficit or no deficit 
the money will be included in the continuing resolution to be 
voted on tuesday this is a stopgap money bill needed to keep the 
government operating until all the appropriations bills are 
approved 
if the deficit has to go up the deficit will have to rise 
said foley comparing the earthquake to a family emergency if a 
family has a tragedy it may not be in the budget but needs have 
to be met he said 
foley said that the federal government is obligated by law to 
assist in emergencies such as the earthquake and hurricane hugo he 
said the leadership of the house will not make the people of 
california the carolinas and virgin islands suffer because of a 
tight federal budget 
meanwhile former house speaker thomas tip oneill defended 
president bushs response to the earthquake even though the 
president did not visit the scene immediately 
foleys comments came after talking to members of the california 
delegation who went home to survey the damage during a telephone 
conference call rep barbara boxer a democrat from san francisco 
told foley the scene was a heartbreaker that would require 
funds in the billions 
democrat don edwards of san jose who had just returned to 
washington said its hard to imagine from pictures how bad it 
is 
another democrat vic fazio of sacramento said congress has 
asked the office of management and budget to estimate by 9 am 
monday how much money will be needed 
he said he already sees a need for at least 800 million more 
for highways and bridges than has been budgeted he said 
legislation would have to be passed to remove certain restrictions 
on the amount a single state can get in federal funds for highway 
work 
he also said the small business administration is almost out 
of money and needs at least another 1 billion for california 
sen alan cranston dcalif said earlier in the day that he 
expected the senate to act next week as well 
speaking at a news conference in dayton ohio oneill said i 
dont think its right to criticize the president of the united 
states for local disasters because he doesnt appear on the scene 
they do get the apparatus in motion 
i think hes responded very quickly to the problems out

punishments of people caught killing or selling the animals 
several offenders have been given life in prison although the 
death sentence is rare for panda poaching

president bush said thursday he wanted to 
take a look and to provide encouragement during a tour of 
earthquakeshattered northern california while house speaker 
thomas s foley pledged up to 25 billion in disaster funds from 
congress 
foley said that he did not know where all the money would be 
found but promised that the house would provide it in a vote next 
week 
if the deficit has to go up the deficit will have to rise 
foley said comparing the quake to a family emergency if a 
family has a tragedy it may not be in the budget but the needs 
still have to be met 
bush planned to leave washington before dawn friday flying 
across country for a fivehour inspection tour of damage sites by 
helicopter and car he planned to make stops in oakland and santa 
cruz two of the most devastated areas 
bush announced his trip amid democratic complaints and 
republican praise over the governments response to tuesdays 
quake which authorities estimate caused 2 billion in damage 
initial estimates of more than 250 deaths were proving much too 
high officials said thursday night without offering new estimates 
and coroners in seven counties reported only 31 bodies recovered 
the president said he was confident that federal officials were 
doing a good job and promised we will stay on top of it 
after an earlymorning flight from washington bush planned to 
spend three hours in california on friday much of the time in a 
helicopter tour 
well do as much as we can without disrupting local 
activities white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
bush is to fly to moffett naval air station near mountain view 
and take a helicopter to alameda on the east side of the san 
francisco bay and then drive to oakland to view the collapsed 
interstate 880 
he then is to double back to alameda for a helicopter hop to 
santa cruz where there is extensive damage tuesdays quake was 
the deadliest since the 1906 temblor that killed 2500 people in 
san francisco 
bush flew to south carolina on a similar inspection mission 
after hurricane hugo last month but the federal government was 
accused by some officials there of moving too slowly in providing 
disaster relief in this instance bush said california gov george 
deukmejian a republican had called to express appreciation for 
the allout federal effort 
however the democratic mayor of san francisco art agnos said 
he was ticked off that vice president dan quayle had not met 
with him during a tour of quake damage 
agnos said quayle flies around in a helicopter makes a bunch 
of television spots i have real questions about what he was 
ding here it may have been just a publicity stunt 
agnos was invited to accompany bush on friday along with the 
mayors of oakland and alameda 
in washington quayle said all mayors in the quake area had been 
invited to a meeting with him i think its very unfortunate to 
take that kind of a shot at a very difficult time 
fitzwater said agnos had turned away several administration 
approaches 
meanwhile pentagon spokesman pete williams said the army corps 
of engineers has begun inspecting federal dams and levees and at 
the request of the state government state and private dams so 
far he said no damage had been discovered in structures checked 
within 50 miles of the quakes epicenter 
a u2 reconnaissance plane from beale air force base flew over 
the san francisco area late wednesday and williams said its photos 
might help in the detection of structural problems 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said california would be eligible 
for federal jobtraining funds to assist any workers who lost their 
jobs because of the quake 
bush called quayle and transportation secretary samuel skinner 
to the oval office to report on the helicopter tour they took 
wednesday to damage sites 
our hearts certainly go out to the victims of this disaster 
bush said and i will go out there tomorrow to take a look and to 
provide encouragement to the people 
skinner in an appearance on abctvs good morning america 
program said all federal resources have been marshaled 
quayle was asked on the nbctv today show if there was 
enough money available for the relief effort he replied we will 
put the maximum that we can behind that working with state and 
local levels of government to clean the situation up 
the white house said an initial 273 million will be available 
for the area from a pool of 11 billion that congress appropriated 
after the devastation caused by hurricane hugo 
as for the flap with agnos fitzwater said the mayor was invited 
to two meetings up wherever he was and deliver him to the meetings 
and he declined that 
he said bushs chief of staff john sununu had tried to call

computers are giving some worried friends 
and relatives around the world their first word about 
earthquakedamaged sections of northern california 
this is sort of like what ham radio operators do only its on 
a computer said rich baker editorial services manager of 
compuserve it has been instrumental in giving concerned people 
the straight scoop its getting a lot of the information coming 
out of california straight in an accurate and timely manner often 
more quickly than the news media can 
the columbusbased computer information service with 550000 
individual and 1800 corporate customers worldwide created an 
earthquake forum where people could leave messages and 
information about 5 pm wednesday by 11 am thursday more than 
430 messages many seeking information had been filed 
prodigy a white plains nybased venture of ibm and sears 
roebuck amp co had a system going less than four hours after 
tuesdays quake said brian ek communications manager by thursday 
afternoon 1530 messages were posted 
it also put a psychologist on line wednesday night to help 
these people deal with the trauma we had one person who know some 
of the people involved in the nimitz highway situation who was 
pretty distraught ek said 
prodigy has subscribers in more than 100000 us households 
many messages sought information about conditions others were 
personal 
a new england man trying to find a burlingame calif couple 
learned in about an hour that they not only had survived but had 
become grandparents after the quake but that one of their fathers 
had died the day before tuesdays earthquake 
everyone was in good spirits given the circumstances a 
message said 
computer samaritans also acted as messengers for those who 
couldnt reach loved ones by phone 
an oakland woman reported for anybody worrying about their 
daughter at mills college in oakland hills students were shaken 
but fine talked to my good friends daughter there who is a 
freshman from utah and her first time away from home i told her 
welcome to california as she had never ever experienced an 
earthquake let alone a biggie like the sf quake 
a man from italy sought help finding friends vacationing in san 
francisco but their whereabouts were not known 
word also came from san carlos that damage there was primarily 
on the nerves and from santa clara that a woman sustained no 
damage to her house though her birdbath was tipped over 
the system is available only to compuserve members who pay 
1250 an hour to dial into the electronic bulletin board through 
their personal computers it is the first time compuserve has set 
up a forum solely for earthquakerelated information though it has 
been pressed into service for other disasters 
members exchanged information jan 28 1986 when challenger 
exploded and when the stock market crashed oct 19 1987 
compuserve also posted messages in the system last month when 
hurricane hugo swept into the carolinas 
the yearold prodigy charges subscribers a flat 995 a month

i got lucky but no pushups for a 
while 
michael friedman a 41yearold executive wryly offered that 
assessment thursday from a hospital bed where he was mending after 
breaking his breastbone when his car dropped with the collapsing 
interstate 880 freeway 
i thought i was going to die and that was that said 
friedman who believes his sternum was broken when his chest 
slammed against his seat belt but the splintered bone missed 
piercing his heart and aorta 
alone in his car friedman had just left the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge shortly after 5 pm tuesday headen buildings 
and plan for 
temblors on the new madrid fault which has spawned some of the 
strongest us quakes experts say 
the quake that rattled the san francisco bay area on tuesday 
has about a 1in3 probability of happening on the new madrid 
fault in the next 10 years said david stewart of the center for 
earthquake studies in cape girardeau we can watch whats 
happening out there and take a lot of notes 
san francisco is the best prepared city for an earthquake in 
the world what san francisco has been doing for a long time is 
going to pay off 
the california quake measuring 69 on the richter scale has 
been blamed for 2000 injuries as well as nearly 3 billion in 
damage to property bridges highways and rail lines early 
estimates were that 270 people died but on thursday officials said 
the death toll could be much lower 
the earthquake that devastated soviet armenia last december also 
had a 69 richter reading but killed 25000 people and did 16 
billion in damage 
armenia was an example of absolutely no preparation stewart 
said were not as bad off as armenia but were certainly not 
anywhere near as well prepared as san francisco was 
quakes are much less frequent on the new madrid fault which 
runs from marked tree ark into southern illinois but scientists 
say there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a 63 quake by 
the year 2000 
the new madrid fault is probably the most dangerous fault in 
the eastern half of the united states but there is far more danger 
of an earthquake on the san andreas fault said douglass wiens 
assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at washington 
university but thats not to say that theres not danger just 
less 
the new madrid fault has minor earthquakes registering 3 to 4 
almost daily but the last one above 60 was in 1985 said 
brian mitchell chairman of the department of earth and atmospheric 
sciences at st louis university 
in the summer of 1987 a quake of 49 hit along the southern 
illinoisindiana border causing minor damage a series of temblors 
that ripped through the new madrid zone in 1811 and 1812 could be 
felt in boston and washington but occurred in a largely unpopulated 
area and the number of deaths is unknown 
there was no equipment to measure earthquakes in the 1800s but 
scientists say the new madrid quakes would probably have been up to 
87 the san francisco earthquake of 1906 is estimated at 83 the 
1985 mexico city quake that killed 10000 measured 81 on the 
richter scale 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude

while scientists quickly estimate the 
magnitude of a quake on the richter scale it takes weeks to map 
out its intensity on the modified mercalli scale 
northern californias disastrous earthquake on tuesday had a 
magnitude of 69 according to the us geological survey a quake 
can have only a single magnitude although scientists using 
different types of seismometers often come up with different 
estimates 
but a quake can have many intensities thats because intensity 
is a measurement of a quakes actual shaking effects at various 
locations thus intensities tend to be highest closest to the 
epicenter but they also can be high at greater distances where 
ground is soft 
italian seismologist g mercalli developed his 12point 
intensity scale in 1902 and it was modified in 1931 by us 
seismologists harry o wood and frank neumann roman numerals are 
used 
the areas most hard hit in tuesdays quake locations sitting 
on soft san francisco bay mud or fill dirt may have experienced 
shaking as high as ix or perhaps x on the modified mercalli scale 
california institute of technology seismologist kate hutton said 
thursday but she emphasized she was guessing based on damage she 
saw on television 
in intensity x areas cracks several inches wide appear in soft 
ground wellbuilt wood buildings and bridges are severely damaged 
and some collapse most masonry structures are destroyed buried 
pipes tear apart or are crushed cracks and fold open in pavement 
in intensity ix areas conspicuous cracks develop in the ground 
damage is great in most masonry buildings and considerable in those 
built to withstand quakes underground pipes sometimes break and 
some quakeresistant wood homes shift off foundations 
federal scientists usually conduct field interviews and survey 
damage to construct a map showing the intensities produced by a 
major quake hutton said 
other intensity scales are used in the soviet union and japan

the warsaw pact wound up the third round 
of talks on limiting conventional arms in europe on thursday by 
presenting proposals on curbing maneuvers and exchanging and 
verifying military information across the continent 
in their initial reaction western diplomats welcomed the 
proposals and noted several concepts and language identical to nato 
proposals on the same subject sept 21 
negotiators from both blocs at the 23nation talks hailed the 
progress made during the sixweek round but expressed 
disappointment that agreement on details is still rare 
generally were making a lot of progress us ambassador 
stephen j ledogar told reporters but specifically we have not 
got much concrete to show for it yet 
more could have been done said soviet ambassador oleg 
grinevsky 
the only language agreed by both sides for an initial treaty 
both blocs want to sign next year is the definition of artillery 
ledogar grinevsky and west german ambassador ruediger hartmann 
expressed hope the fourth round beginning nov 9 and lasting until 
dec 21 will see more discussion of specifics 
the warsaw pact proposals presented thursday contained different 
specifics on limiting military maneuvers in europe than earlier 
nato suggestions they omitted for example mention of limitation 
on equipment used in such exercises 
but the east accepted significant details of the wests 
proposal it agreed that no more than 40000 men be engaged in 
military maneuvers by one bloc but sought to limit such large 
exercises to once every three years as against once every two 
years as proposed by nato 
the east also agreed that annual exchange of verification data 
take place on dec 15 once any treaty is in force and that 42 days 
be the period of prior notification for changing force structures 
both sides agreed major differences still exist over the 
definition of weapons categories such as tanks the verification of 
armaments levels in different regions of europe and the inclusion 
or exclusion of soviet air defense interceptors training aircraft 
and certain types of helicopter in the complex aircraft category 
the most urgent problem is definition of weapons categories 
said ledogar the most complex is verification and i think the 
toughest one is still the aircraft issue 
the talks opened in march they replaced negotiations on troop 
reductions in central europe that dragged on for 15 years without 
agreement

typhoon elsie moved into the south 
china sea on friday after battering the northern philippines and 
leaving at least two dead and thousands fleeing to relief centers 
officials said 
in a final typhoon bulletin at 4 am the manila weather bureau 
said elsie was 155 miles westnorthwest of the mountain resort of 
baguio in benguet province about 240 miles northwest of manila 
forecaster juliet dagupa said elsie which had 127 mph winds 
when it blew ashore thursday weakened to 103 mph and was moving 
west at 14 mph 
reports reaching the red cross headquarters in the capital said 
one person died in la unions provincial capital of san fernando 
when an acacia tree fell on him another died in a landslide in 
baguio officials added 
the militarys office of civil defense said over 17000 people 
were affected meaning they were temporarily sheltered in 
schoolhouses and other government centers or their houses were 
either damaged or destroyed 
the office said elsies winds sank two tugboats and caused a 
britishregistered commercial vessel to slam into port at la 
unions poro point no reports of casualties came from the vessels 
officials added 
officials said many northern provinces were without electricity 
because of toppled power lines fallen trees rendered dozens of 
roads impassable 
manila radio station dzxl said its affiliate in bayombong 
capital of nueva vizcaya province 130 miles north was knocked off 
the air by a power failure 
elsie roared ashore thursday in aurora province and weakened to 
116 mph as it slammed into the sierra mountain range 
us air force officials said some jets were moved to air bases 
in japan and south korea until the storm passed

a healthy galileo spacecraft sped 
unerringly toward distant jupiter on thursday while the five 
orbiting astronauts who released it measured the threatened ozone 
layer that is earths natural sunscreen 
racing along at more than 9000 mph the probe thursday night 
was more than 260000 miles out on its 24billionmile sixyear 
journey to study the largest planet in the solar system in a search 
for clues to how the universe began 
galileo was dispatched from atlantis cargo bay wednesday night 
6 hours after the shuttle was launched from cape canaveral 
national aeronautics and space administration officials reported 
thursday the craft was in perfect shape and right on course 
atlantis also was pronounced in excellent condition by 
mission control after the crew members successfully restored a 
cooling system that shut down wednesday when it overheated and cut 
in a backup unit 
on thursday a major solar flare hurled a surge of radiation 
toward earth but nasa officials said they were not concerned 
government scientists said the flare may disrupt communications 
and electrical power transmission over the next two days but nasa 
said it had been evaluated and was not considered a problem for the 
astronauts 
in the orbit were in at 160mile altitude it is no threat 
at all said flight director ronald d dittemore 
the burst also has had no impact on galileo which is built 
for much harsher environments than a solar flare said nasa 
spokeswoman paula cleggetthaleim 
earlier thursday mission control wakened the space travelers 
with a musical tribute to atlantis commander don williams and pilot 
mike mcculley both naval aviators and graduates of purdue 
university 
played were hail purdue and anchors aweigh with 
reveille sandwiched in between 
the other crew members are ellen baker franklin changdiaz and 
shannon lucid 
they began a series of medical materials processing and other 
experiments that will occupy their time until they return to earth 
on monday landing is scheduled for edwards air force base calif 
at 238 pm edt monday 
on nasa satellite television thursday night changdiaz and mrs 
baker demonstrated a retinal photography test on the shuttles 
middeck 
with swimming goggles strapped around her head mrs baker 
steadied herself while changdiaz pressed a camera to the right 
goggle to photograph her retina 
researchers said the camera slides should help them determine if 
there are any changes in the eyes vessels in zero gravity such 
changes could indicate some brain swelling and researchers want to 
determine if that is related to motion sickness in space 
a new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in the 
cargo bay to measure sections of the earths ozone layer an area 
of the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of the 
suns ultraviolet radiation 
there is global concern over depletion of the ozone layer and 
many people fear its destruction will cause a rise in such human 
health problems as skin cancer 
the information gathered by the atlantis crew will be compared 
with data being collected at the same time and over the same areas 
by nearly identical sensors aboard three older us satellites 
researchers want the new data so they can accurately calibrate 
the satellite sensors nasa considers the experiment so important 
that it has scheduled it for six more shuttle flights 
accurate reliable measurements from space are critical to the 
detection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential effects 
and development of corrective measures the agency said 
scientists report the ozone shield has thinned out worldwide by 
about 3 percent within the last two decades with the largest 
losses occurring over the polar regions 
the depletion is thought to be increased by the interaction of 
certain manmade chemicals principally chlorofluorocarbons or 
cfcs used as refrigerants and in the manufacturing of some plastic 
products 
some us manufacturers and users of cfcs have announced plans 
to stop making the chemical or to guard against releasing it into 
the atmosphere 
galileo which slowed from its initial earthescape velocity of 
more than 25000 mph has a long way to go on its odyssey that will 
take it on a scenic route through the solar system its path will 
whip it once past venus twice around the earth and within view of 
an asteroid before it reaches jupiter in december 1995 
the roundabout route is necessary for the 6000pound spacecraft 
to use the gravity forces of venus and earth to gain enough speed 
to reach its target 
once at jupiter galileo will fire a probe into the jovian 
atmosphere and then orbit the planet for a planned 22month study 
scientists believe the probe could reveal much about the birth 
of the universe 
because jupiter has apparently undergone little change from its 
beginnings its composition is thought to resemble the cloud of gas 
and dust from which the sun and planets formed galileos 
observations could give scientists a better idea of what the early 
solar system looked like when it formed 46 billion years ago 
similarly the jovian atmospheres hydrogentohelium ratio 
promises to be a vital clue to the validity of the bigbang theory 
which holds that the universe was created in a single explosive 
moment more than 15 billion years ago the ratio is thought to be 
about the same as was created at the time of the big bang

pounded by a sudden hail of ethics accusations 
mayoral candidate david dinkins struggled to regain his footing 
thursday in his heretofore stately stroll toward the election 
dinkins the democratic nominee lashed at republican rudolph w 
giuliani accusing him of gutter politics bullying and slander 
and threatening to respond with negative attacks of his own 
the uncharacteristic vitriol underlined dinkins dismay over a 
week of unrelenting criticism by giuliani who has been trailing 
badly in polls in the strongly democratic city much of it 
prompted by news reports on dinkins handling of a stock sale and a 
conflict of interest issue 
dinkins troubles were compounded thursday first by mayor 
edward i kochs call for him to release a city investigation of 
his failure to file tax returns during 196972 then by charges he 
ducked taxes more recently by understating the value of stock he 
sold to his son and finally by a racist remark by a black activist 
who had worked for his campaign 
dinkins who would be the citys first black mayor has called 
his 196972 failure to file tax returns an oversight that he 
corrected in 1973 
giuliani a former federal prosecutor accused dinkins of 
intentionally breaking the city ethics law punishable giuliani 
noted by up to a year in jail 
at issue chiefly was dinkins investment in inner city 
broadcasting a privately held highly successful media company 
formed in 1972 by his political mentor former manhattan borough 
president percy sutton 
in 1986 dinkins himself newly elected as manhattan borough 
president sold his 558 shares of inner city to his son david jr 
for 58000 payable with 8 percent annual interest in 1991 he did 
not reveal the transaction on financial disclosure forms aides say 
it was an installment sales contract and thus did not have to 
be listed as a gift or receivable note 
new york newsday reported thursday that dinkins had far 
underestimated the stocks value which has no public market price 
because it is not publicly traded 
newsday quoted inner citys general counsel as saying the stock 
in 1986 was worth conservatively 4292 per share or more than 
2 million for dinkins shares newsday quoted a tax expert as 
saying a 58000 sale price for stock worth much more represented 
a huge gift 
dinkins spokesman david fishlow maintained that the 58000 
valuation was proper he made appropriate inquiries and valued it 
fairly 
fishlow said he did not know with whom dinkins spoke or by what 
formula he valued the stock the official quoted in newsday said he 
estimated inner citys worth by a common formula 10 times the 
companys annual revenues 
giuliani also attacked dinkins involvement as a city official 
in business between inner city and the city government even though 
the board of ethics had warned against it 
dinkins had requested the ethics ruling and cited it when he 
abstained from a 1987 vote in the board of estimate which handles 
contracts and zoning on a matter involving inner city but he 
conceded wednesday that aides sitting in for him on the board voted 
in 1987 for a zoning change for inner citys new office and this 
year for a transfer of its cable franchise 
in another development robert c sonny carson a black 
activist who helped organize a voter drive for dinkins scoffed 
thursday at charges that he was an antisemite 
im antiwhite i dont limit my antis to just being one 
little group of people and i think you would insult me if you 
tried to do that carson said when asked about the accusation 
made last week by bnai briths antidefamation league 
carson insisted he had not been hired by dinkins campaign and 
personally received no money the campaign has said it paid carson 
9800 to organize the drive for the sept 12 democratic primary 
carsons comments prompted a terse statement from dinkins 
sonny carsons comments represent the kind of bigotry and 
intolerance i utterly reject and have fought against my whole life 
had such comments come to my attention he would never have played 
any role in my campaign

at first bruce stephan thought all four 
tires on his car had gone flat but when the san franciscooakland 
bay bridge started bouncing and weaving he realized it was an 
earthquake then the bridge gave way and he was plunging toward the 
san francisco bay 
the ground just opened up and the car started going down 
stephan said thursday all i could think is im going through 
the bridge and into the bay i knew it was death i didnt 
think there was anything that could stop us 
when it was over stephans gray mazda stopped only inches shy 
of plunging into the bay he was looking at water his car wedged 
in the gap between the collapsed upper deck and splitopen lower 
deck 
in a fluke stephan and his passenger janice freiburger cannot 
explain they were in the only vehicle on the falling section of 
bridge 
stephan 33 of san francisco was treated for minor bruises and 
released freiburger 41 of larkspur was hospitalized with a 
cracked sternum a cracked collar bone and a crack in her spine 
doctors predict that she will be released early next week 
when i look at it i cant imagine that neither of us were 
more seriously hurt freiburger said from her room at pacific 
presbyterian hospital i have injuries but im just fine 
stephan and freiburger coworkers at a san francisco real 
estate company were returning from a project in the east bay when 
they were caught on the bridge 
it all happened in just split seconds freiburger recalled 
first there was a moment of utter silence and then boom an 
explosiontype of noise it all opened up we went traveling down 
like a roller coaster ride just that fast 
i closed my eyes real tight and made my mind blank said 
stephan you know how youre supposed to have all those 
flashbacks and your whole life flashes before your eyes that 
didnt happen i told janice were going to die and she 
said no were not hold on 
after the car stopped stephan clambered out the window and onto 
the hood of the car before hoisting himself up onto the surface of 
the bridges lower deck he said he didnt look down as he and a 
stranger helped pull freiburger from the hood to the roadway 
the pair walked more than a mile to treasure island where they 
were examined at a clinic before being taken by ambulance to san 
francisco general hospital 
stephan said he is trying to come to grips with his good fortune 
it seems like it should be more profound it was kind of a 
brush with death but i dont feel that much different he said

a morehouse college sophomore died in what school 
officials said appears to have been a hazing incident in the 
nations oldest black fraternity and school officials said they 
may expel the members involved 
school officials said the college had suspended the alpha phi 
alpha chapters charter 
medical examiners have not determined the cause of death of joel 
a harris 18 of new york but they said he appeared to suffer 
from a heart condition 
however his mother adrienne c harris said thursday her son 
had been healthy despite undergoing openheart surgery when he was 
2 years old to correct a birth defect she said he was born with 
holes between the chambers of his heart which were closed 
surgically 
joel was very active all his life mrs harris said 
alpha phi alpha state director robert willis said the death 
occurred wednesday at a gathering in an apartment for 19 young men 
interested in joining the 110000member fraternity 
he said the students told him they met with approximately seven 
fraternity brothers and were pushed and shoved around when they 
failed to correctly answer questions about the fraternity 
next thing they knew they looked around and the fellow was 
lying on the floor willis said at first they thought he was 
faking it but then when they realized he wasnt faking they 
called 911 
willis said that according to the potential pledges the 
fraternity brothers knew of harris history of heart trouble 
joel wasnt really picked on willis said they pledges 
said they didnt see joel get hit 
the fraternitys president gregory burrell could not 
immediately be reached for comment thursday the fraternity chapter 
does not have a house there was no telephone listing for burrell 
and a message left for him at the morehouse dean of students office 
was not immediately returned 
the fraternity the countrys oldest black greekletter 
organization prohibits hazing which also is outlawed in georgia 
morehouse spokesman robert bolton said in a statement that the 
chapter also had not received clearance from school officials to 
commence their pledge period or engage in any form of 
offcampus pledge activities 
school officials said the college also was conducting an 
internal investigation and would take appropriate disciplinary 
action up to and including dismissal of all participants 
clearly the fraternity is out of line bolton said 
dr joseph burton cobb county medical examiner said an autopsy 
of harris failed to reveal any bruises or visible injuries 
right now it looks like he had a cardiac disrhythmia 
burton said exactly what precipitated this we dont know 
hundreds of students friends and morehouse faculty attended a 
memorial service for harris on thursday many students sobbed 
openly during the ceremonies and hugged each other afterward 
everybody who knew him loved him said john t saunders iii 
who said he was harris best friend in high school i loved him 
mrs harris said she would campaign to see that no more 
children in this country will die because of hazing joel 
harris mother will work to get it outlawed in all the states this 
is utterly ridiculous this is not right 
morehouse president leroy keith called harris a young man with 
a well of integrity 
wreaths lined the front of the stage during the service at a 
college chapel and the allmale morehouse college glee club sang 
hymns

cable cars returned to the streets of san 
francisco on thursday after being stuck in their barn since an 
earthquake knocked out electrical power two days earlier 
by midday enough traffic signals were working again so that 
partial service on the popular tourist attraction could resume 
most of the citys landmarks including the golden gate bridge 
coit tower mission dolores and the colorful victorianstyle homes 
were virtually unaffected by the powerful quake and remained 
unruffled and picturesque as ever 
automobiles were snaking down the crookedest street in the 
world of postcard fame the block of lombard on russian hill 
the traffic hasnt stopped at all except tuesday night when 
they closed the street off because a cable car was stuck at the top 
of the hill said jason doty who lives on the steep winding 
street our electricity is still out but there are no other 
problems here 
not all the frequently photographed landmarks got through the 
earthquake untouched of course 
the san franciscooakland bay bridge big sister of the more 
colorful golden gate was crippled some 4000 worth of glass was 
broken at the conservatory of flowers a huge greenhouse in golden 
gate park at the bayside end of market street the flag atop the 
ferry building was tilted and the tower clock was still stuck on 
tuesdays lateafternoon earthquake time 504 pm 
the mansion hotel a victorian building in the pacific heights 
district rode smoothly through its second major quake 
it stood proud and its obviously a survivor it looks 
fragile but it isnt owner bob pritikin said of the building 
completed in 1887 the only damage we found was a crack in a 
bathroom ceiling 
alcatraz called the rock by those who did chilly hard time 
there when it was a federal prison certainly lived up to its 
nickname tourists though very few of them in the fishermans 
wharf area thursday were pointing their cameras at the bleak island 
in the bay 
we like san francisco alex camenisch of marthalen 
switzerland said as he and his family strolled through fishermans 
wharf where there was no power and almost all businesses were 
closed 
they were not planning on staying overnight however we were 
going to stay at a downtown hotel but now were going to stay 
somewhere else said camenischs wife esther 
on nob hill about half the fairmont hotels 500 rooms were 
empty as well as dark wednesday night a national business group 
that had reserved 450 rooms canceled a scheduled meeting 
i was on the phone starting wednesday morning to groups with 
reservations here the next 30 days news reports have made things 
sound pretty dismal and i wanted to let them know the city was not 
burning down said stan boyd director of sales for the fairmont 
at the moscone center the citys largest convention center one 
event ended its run tuesday the next a car dealers gathering set 
for oct 26 is still scheduled as well as a convention of 5000

a series of at least six earthquakes rumbled 
across rural north china late wednesday and early thursday 
destroying more than 10000 homes killing at least 29 people and 
injuring more than 150 
the quakes measuring from 50 up to 61 on the richter scale 
hit shanxi and hebei provinces the official china daily said 
friday 
most of the destruction occurred in shanxi province and the 
daily quoted a local communist party official there as saying 
the problem is serious and the casualties may increase 
film footage taken by shanxi provincial television showed rescue 
workers using primitive tools to dig through the rubble looking for 
victims makeshift clinics set up outside to treat people with 
broken bones and badly bloodied heads people in heavy overcoats 
huddled around bonfires and children wrapped in blankets sleeping 
in straw outside their destroyed homes 
bread and medical supplies were being distributed to the 
homeless and injured china daily said the army sent 1000 soldiers 
to join rescue efforts 
the worst quake was centered about 135 miles west of beijing on 
the border of shanxi and hebei provinces and struck less than 24 
hours after a massive earthquake hit the san francisco area but 
state seismological bureau officials said there was no evidence the 
temblors were linked 
residents of beijing felt the tremors but no reports of damage 
surfaced and the bureau said there was no need to take safety 
measures in the capital 
the epicenter was near datong famous for its yungang caves that 
hold thousands of buddhist paintings and statues dating to the 5th 
century whether any caves were damaged was not reported efforts 
to reach datong by telephone failed 
the seismological bureau said an initial quake hit at 1057 pm 
wednesday 1057 am edt and measured 57 on the richter scale 
at least four others registering 5 or above hit in the next six 
hours including a quake of 6 on the scale at about 1 am thursday 
1 pm edt wednesday 
an aftershock measuring 51 hit at 629 pm 629 edt 
thursday the official xinhua news agency said more than 300 
lesser aftershocks were recorded 
for many hours almost no details were available from the 
government or official media about extent of damage 
chinas prime time national news program gave extensive time on 
thursday to premier li peng inspecting a stadium and a continuing 
campaign against pornography but failed to mention the killer 
earthquake that was felt in beijing 
it takes days for details of many major disasters to be 
reported and many particularly industrial accidents are still 
ignored by the official press 
the region affected by the wednesdaythursday quakes is a dry 
windswept farming area where wheat and other grains are grown and 
where most homes are built onestory high of unfired clay bricks 
vulnerable to collapse in an strong quake 
shanxi also is chinas main coalproducing province 
earthquakes are frequent in china last month one hit southwest 
sichuan province injuring 54 people and destroying 4000 homes 
five earthquakes with magnitudes registering up to 67 on the 
richter scale hit western sichuan in june and july killing 11 
people 
chinas worst earthquake in recent history leveled tangshan in 
the northeast in 1976 with a magnitude estimated at up to 82 the 
official count listed 240000 dead but unofficial estimates put 
the toll at three times that that time it was years before the 
outside world learned the extent of the catastrophe 
the richter scale is a measure of ground movement as recorded by 
seismographs the openended scale is logarithmic meaning each 
degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last thus the 
69 quake that hit san francisco would be 10 times stronger than 
one registering 59 
bureau director fang zhangsun told xinhua transportation and 
communications in the quake area remained intact and relief work 
was in progress but he gave no details 
xinhua on thursday devoted five paragraphs to the tremors in its 
englishlanguage service two of which were concerned with saying 
the quake had nothing to do with the one in san francisco 
the san francisco quake by contrast made the evening news 
wednesday night 
unlike the soviet union which won wide international sympathy 
by allowing foreign journalists and relief organizations to go to 
armenia when an earthquake devastated that region last december 
foreigners were barred from going to yunnan where an earthquake 
killed 730 a month earlier 
when reporters asked the foreign ministry for permission to 
cover thursdays quakes they were told to write a formal letter of 
request

and a july fire resulted in about 400000 damage carey said 
last month a bomb caused about 35000 damage to a mine 
ventilation system also last month authorities disarmed a 
57pound time bomb set to explode carey said 
neither the arrested miners nor local union leaders could be

police said they arrested the personal 
pilot of colombias alleged cocaine godfather thursday and will 
hold him for extradition to the united states 
the pilot jorge de la cuesta marquez is wanted in florida on 
charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine national police col 
oscar pelaez carmona said in a news release he identified de la 
cuesta as the pilot of pablo escobar leader of the medellin 
cocaine cartel 
pelaez would say only that de la cuesta was arrested in an 
apartment in northern bogota 
with de la cuestas arrest five colombians await extradition to 
the united states colombia earlier extradited four others 
none is on the us justice departments list of the 12 most 
wanted drug suspects in colombia 
an army official said thursday the army detained dairo chica a 
wellknown colombian bullfighter as a lowlevel drug trafficker in 
a raid on a farm outside of medellin 
the official speaking to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity said chica was among four people captured 
press reports said chica was wanted for extradition to the 
united states on drugtrafficking charges but the official could 
not confirm this 
in mexico city authorities said they captured the nephews of 
two colombian drug kingpins and broke up a ring that flew cocaine 
into mexico via the yucatan peninsula and shipped it by boat to 
florida 
federal police commander fausto valverde head of mexicos 
narcotics interdiction forces said the two identified as luis 
alfredo aguilar castro a nephew of gonzalo rodriguez gacha and 
ricardo isunza ochoa a nephew of fabio ochoa were seized with 
eight other men sunday at a clandestine airstrip in the yucatan 
president virgilio barco resumed extraditions on aug 18 
following the slayings of a leading presidential candidate a 
federal judge and a police colonel by drug barons 
another federal judge was killed by a gunman in medellin on 
tuesday three days after three colombians were extradited 
a group calling itself the extraditables said in a telephone 
call to a medellin radio station the murder was in revenge for the 
extraditions carried out so far 
barco says he will not back down in his war on drug traffickers 
the traffickers replied they prefer a grave in colombia to a jail 
cell in the united states they killed a governor bombed two 
newspapers killed eight news media employees and set off 164 
explosions in an effort to force the government to call off 
extraditions 
the explosions at banks shopping areas hotels schools and 
government offices have killed 16 people 
the latest occurred wednesday in bogotas main plaza when a hand 
grenade exploded apparently accidentally and killed the man 
carrying it 
the man was only steps from the building of the national 
congress 
about 17000 colombian judges and judicial employees meanwhile 
said they were ending a 72hour strike thursday night and will 
return to work friday despite the governments inability to address 
their security concerns 
consuelo herrera a board member of the court workers union 
said justice minister roberto salazar manrique told the board 
tuesday the government did not have the resources to increase 
protection for judges threatened by drug traffickers 
he told us that the us aid for us had not arrived and that 
the government could do nothing for us without it ms herrera 
told the ap by telephone 
in september the bush administration pledged 19 million in 
us aid to protect colombias judges 
the walkout has paralyzed most courts here since tuesday 
ms herrera said judges and court workers were returning to work 
with the certainty more of them will be murdered 
we cant shut down the court system for very long because it 
is just too important she said but the next time one of us is 
assassinated and it is sure to happen we will go on strike

a state grand jury has begun a new investigation 
into the 1976 carbomb slaying of investigative reporter don 
bolles sources said thursday 
the grand jury has already issued subpoenas for several 
witnesses including people in california or colorado said sources 
familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity 
although the man who planted the remotecontrol bomb that killed 
the arizona republic reporter was found guilty and imprisoned no 
mastermind has ever been convicted 
attorney general bob corbin who has come under fire for his 
handling of the bolles case declined to comment on any grand jury 
matter but confirmed that his office had been working on the 
bolles case for more than a year 
witnesses subpoenaed in california or colorado may be entitled 
to a court hearing before any arizona subpoenas are honored 
sources said 
the sources demanded anonymity because they feared prosecution 
under an arizona law making it a crime to dislose grand jury 
matters 
bolles clung to life for 11 days after the bomb went off 
repeatedly saying the word emprise an apparent reference to a 
company later called delaware north that runs dog and horse racing 
tracks 
racing dog owner john adamson was convicted of murder for 
planting the bomb that killed bolles 
adamson testifying at the trial of max dunlap of phoenix and 
james robison of chandler said dunlap had asked him to kill bolles 
because of the reporters articles about a wealthy benefactor of 
dunlap unrelated to the company 
dunlap and robison were convicted and sentenced to death but 
the verdicts were overturned on appeal attempts to try them again 
were put on hold when adamson refused to testify again unless he 
got a better deal from prosecutors 
corbins office then withdrew the deal under which adamson had 
been sentenced to 48 years in prison in exchange for his earlier 
testimony and prosecuted him again 
he was convicted and sentenced to death but a federal appeals 
court in san francisco threw out the sentence and arizonas death 
penalty in general as unconstitutional that ruling has been 
appealed to the us supreme court 
corbin a republican who is up for reelection next year has 
come under increasing pressure over the bolles case his only 
announced opponent for the gop nomination tucson attorney david 
eisenstein has made the case a centerpiece of his campaign 
eisenstein on thursday questioned the timing of the grand jury 
leak 
i find it very interesting that there is a grand jury working 
on it just a month after i pointed out that he hadnt done anything 
about it for 11 years eisenstein said im curious but at the 
same time im encouraged

the reek of gasoline dripping from 
flattened cars and trucks mingled thursday with the aroma from 
eucalyptus trees splintered by tons of concrete crashing to the 
streets below 
on the railing of the flattened upper deck of interstate 880 
markers of flourescent green pink and orange spray paint point the 
way to crushed cars and shattered bodies 
the code is crisp and clear the letters 1doa signified a body 
2mt a pair of empty cars a circle and arrow with the number 43 
showed a car 43 feet away 
here and there blood spatters the highways underside 
two days ago 3footthick concrete supports turned to dust 
2inch steel reinforcing bars bent like pipecleaners and chunks of 
freeway cascaded like runaway boulders when an earthquake collapsed 
a milelong section of i880 the nimitz freeway 
early estimates put the number of dead at 250 people but by 
thursday officials said they expected the total would be lower 
possibly much lower 
gov george deukmejian said he would likely appoint a board to 
look into the failure of the freeway which was partially 
reinforced in 1977 to make it less prone to damage from earthquakes 
during a live broadcast of the cbs television show 48 hours 
on thursday an angry parent who believes his son may be buried in 
the cypress rubble confronted oakland mayor lionel wilson 
mayor did you know that you are directly responsible for this 
here mess this disaster asked daniel rubi of san francisco 
rubi said he had been turned away on wednesday when he asked to 
climb the freeway structure and search for his son juan 
the mayor replied im sorry i cant answer that question 
police took rubi from the scene in a squad car oakland jail 
officials reported he was not arrested 
across from the rubble just outside the pacific pipe co a 
salesman who would identify himself only as dennis stood on the 
sidewalk thursday still shaken by what he had seen 
it just was one single pow dennis said the concrete made 
so much dust you couldnt see anything 
after you got out here it was so quiet all you could hear was 
people screaming anybody who could move was getting out we got 
some ropes the thought everyone had was that this was the way it 
was everywhere we didnt know how long it would be before help 
came 
one who came to help was david horn a firefighter from 
neighboring berkeley 
it was a mess said horn who returned thursday to see how 
the scene appeared in daylight it looks worse to me today you 
always look at the dangers but they dont affect you so much in an 
emergency 
there was cars this tall he said holding his hand level 
below his knee and arms sticking out of them 
at first i though we should be a lot more frantic but then i 
realized there was no way life could be supported in there 
but we never gave up hope he added its been proven some 
people could survive some places might not support an adult but 
would support a child 
chainsaws roared and hammers pounded thursday as carpenters and 
ironworkers used 2030foot lengths of 12inch timbers and 16inch 
pipe to shore up the bottom deck of the highway 
others on the top deck used heavy machines called concrete 
nibblers to break holes to reach each crushed vehicle the concrete 
railing of the lower deck was being punched out by a huge backhoe 
fitted with a steel ram to allow rescuers inside 
black soot marked where gasoline had caught fire and burned 
within the wreckage out of reach of help 
on the sidewalk below hundreds of expensive bottles of wine and 
champagne lay unbroken where they had been thrown when a rental 
truck was pitched from the overpass 
blankets were heaped on the sidewalk in front of a warehouse 
where injured people had been comforted 
construction worker brad elfring wearing an orange safety vest 
and a hardhat got up from a cot in a loading bay where he had 
napped after working straight through from tuesday when he came in 
from sacramento 
you sleep a few hours and go back to work he said you 
try to ignore it the carnage around him and just do your job 
a burly carpenter who refused to give his name said he had seen 
incredible bravery by his fellow carpenters and ironworkers 
that whole damn structure was shaking when a cat caterpillar 
tractor went by and guys were in there shoring up under there 
he said i saw people crawling in there in places where they 
werent sure a branch was holding them up running torches in 
places they werent sure there was gas because they had to 
four carpenters worked til 2 this morning and went to their 
regular jobs at 7 and theyll be back tonight he said were 
here just because we believe in it 
oakland police sgt bob crawford said he thought the death toll 
would ultimately be far less than the 250 first estimated the 
earthquake hit while many people were already home in front of 
televisions or across the bay at candlestick park for the third 
game of the world series between the oakland as and the san 
francisco giants 
normally at 5 oclock on a tuesday afternoon the traffic in 
this area would be bumper to bumper crawford said we thought 
at first it might be 200 or 300 dead 
but it was world series day and the traffic was light we 
might get lucky on this one because of the world series

in 18 years in a meatpacking plant dave kellens wages have 
helped build his house put food on the table and raise two 
daughters but he says he has paid a terrible price the use of 
his hands 
kellens hands are too weak to chop wood much less twist open a 
bottle he blames it on years of such jobs as tearing gobs of fat 
from hogs repeating the same few steps struggling to keep pace 
with hundreds of carcasses an hour 
his employer john morrell amp co says plant safety is improving 
and is contesting a 43 million government fine for allegedly 
allowing dangerous work conditions meanwhile kellen 41 who has 
endured surgery twice on each hand now sweeps floors at the sioux 
falls sd plant and hes worried 
im sitting here with my hands 37 percent crippled theyre 
whats got to make my living for the next 20 years he said is 
morrell going to be there are my hands going to get worse i dont 
know whod be willing to hire me thats whats got me scared 
its like going blind slowly 
such problems go beyond one man one company or one occupation 
many union safety and academic experts say kellen is an example 
of an insidious trend in american industry companies are producing 
more cutting payrolls modernizing computerizing and creating a 
more hazardous workplace 
people are getting hurt more than they ever were argues 
joseph kinney director of the national safe workplace institute 
theyre under more pressure to produce than they ever were a lot 
of companies that once were using seven workers to do a job are now 
asking five to do it 
the new fatfree american business syndrome is asking those 
who are left to do too damn much 
similar concerns have surfaced from congressional hearings to 
union organizing drives in auto meatpacking construction steel 
and other industries experts say automation competition and the 
changing business landscape play a role 
we live in a time of corporate downsizing mergers and 
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that end or greatly diminish 
many of the modest safety and health programs that exist said a 
september report by the workplace institute the raiders and 
downsizers are unwitting participants in our industrial carnage 
while most workers no longer confront sweatshop horrors and 
archaic equipment some experts say a new trend in which technology 
allows experienced employees to be replaced by those with less 
training has contributed to increasing dangers 
others disagree noting large investments that companies 
including the big three automakers are making to improve plant 
designs they also cite giant government penalties against lead 
paper meatpacking construction and other firms that are serving 
as a deterrent 
i think workplaces are generally safer said berrien 
zettler deputy director of compliance programs at the occupational 
safety and health administration 
kinneys group says osha has improved but he cites government 
numbers the average number of workdays lost due to onthejob 
accidents for each 100 workers rose from 585 days in 1983 to 699 
days in 1987 
and the national safety council says permanent workrelated 
disabilities rose from 60000 in 1986 to 70000 in 1987 
safety experts speculate conditions may be even grimmer because 
companies underreport injuries to avoid osha inspections in fact 
the government has cited union carbide corp usx corp and others 
for alleged recordkeeping violations 
ironically some trace rising injuries to economic prosperity 
especially in steel one steelworkers local says its injury rate 
nearly doubled when overtime peaked 
when youre tired and you work in a dangerous operation 
fatigue is going to lead to accidents said mike wright the 
united steelworkers of americas health and safety director 
a 1988 university of texas study found nearly 93 percent of 
injury increases in durable goods industries could be explained by 
overtime and employee turnover 
those arent the only culprits 
automation is increasing and the workers who performed a 
variety of the jobs are being replaced by machinery said bob 
hall research director at the institute for southern studies in 
north carolina 
the jobs that are left are not as complicated and 
increasingly treat people as robots and treat arms and hands 
like theyre part of a machine but you cant oil a persons arm or 
hand 
workers who cut chop or pull thousands of times daily have 
developed painful and sometimes disabling hand arm and wrist 
ailments known as repetitive trauma disorders the most severe 
form is called carpal tunnel syndrome a thickening or swelling of 
tendons in the wrist 
repetitive trauma disorder cases including hearing loss 
soared from 26700 to 72940 from 1983 to 1987 the government 
says though some attribute part of that to heightened awareness 
much publicity has focused on meatpacking where the united food 
and commercial workers union says production jumped nearly 20 
percent in the last five years while production employees dropped 
by almost 10000 
when line speeds are increased and the workforce is decreased 
in the name of efficiency injuries go up said debbie berkowitz 
the unions health and safety director 
meat and poultry workers some of whom have testified before 
congress have complained about treacherously fast production 
lines where meat flies off damaged conveyor belts and blood 
splatters in their faces they have described cysts infections and 
crippling hand and back pains that make it hard to lift their 
children comb their hair or hold a glass 
former poultry employee lillie watson worked as a packer and leg 
cutter for nearly a decade making thousands of cuts a day she had 
surgery three times on her hands has arthritic legs and says she 
cant scrub floors or lift heavy pots 
i feel bitter and angry she said aint no job i can get 
where i can use my hands occasionally 
workers such as miss watson often dont have many options 
either because of the scarcity of job opportunities or limited 
education 
another injured worker bev whaley said she had surgery on her 
right hand because of her job at the morrell plant in sioux falls 
she said a doctor told her shed have to learn to live with it i 
wanted to take a baseball bat and smash his hands and tell him hed 
have to learn to live with it 
her union local claims assembly line speeds have increased in 
many areas for example in the beef kill department where the 
animal is knocked out its throat slit the hide pulled off and the 
body split in half the hourly rate jumped from 105 an hour in 
1979 to 193 in 1986 
said coworker kellen youre just pushed to the limit

but companies dispute the charges poultry producer perdue farms 
inc recently estimated repetitive trauma disorders at its plants 
at less than 1 percent 
and though osha contends morrell knew conditions were causing 
injuries but did nothing company spokesman raoul baxter said 
safetyimprovement efforts were being made and the agency reviewed 
records during an atypical time a period that included a strike 
in 11 months records showed 880 of 2000 workers sustained 
repetitive strain injuries baxter said there are no quickfix 
programs for such injuries its going to take a lot of hard 
work he said our progress has been dramatic 
morrell says injuries at sioux falls fell per 100 workers from 
705 in january 1988 to 1348 in july 1989 baxter attributed the 
high injury rate to the hiring of replacements and other strike 
effects for the decline he credited outside consultants workers 
and supervisors 
but jim lyon union local president said he hasnt seen any 
safety progress and said company numbers are totally 
inaccurate he also contends a program providing prizes for 
injuryfree records encourages people not to report them

57 million penalty was reduced to 975000 after the company 
agreed to conduct a threeyear safety program to reduce motion 
injuries 
a recent workplace institute study of several large penalties 
found osha had bargained fines down from 293 million to 95 
million 
and in cases where osha fines are smaller in the thousands of 
dollars the agency is not effective in providing the stimulus 
employers need to properly deal with safety and health said john 
moran a former official of the national institute for occupational 
safety and health the bottom line in business is the dollar 
bill 
oshas zettler said his agency usually doesnt reduce penalties 
by more than half in ibps case he said we believe the 
significant reduction was justified by what we were getting back 
zettler also conceded osha doesnt have staff to inspect all 
hazardous places annually and it may cost more to comply than pay a 
penalty if it takes us 15 years to get there the guy has saved 
that investment for 15 years he said 
but he says his agency has increased safety awareness and most 
major companies have health experts many also have hired safety 
design experts 
one is the university of michigans center for ergonomics 
director don chaffin believes its simplistic to blame 
productivity alone for increased injuries and says corporations are 
paying more attention to these concerns 
but one union local disagrees at the allegheny ludlum corp 
plant in brackenridge pa maintenance division injuries jumped 
from 27 percent to 4547 percent during four heavy overtime months 
in 1988 said carol mochak usw local 1196s safety chairman 
people tend to overlook a lot of safety procedures he said 
theyre lax in wearing safety equipment all they want to do 
is get the job done as quickly as possible 
a spokesman for the specialty steelmaker said the company tries 
hard to limit overtime and has no serious safety problems 
productivity also has been an issue in construction said moran 
the former niosh official who now works at a firm that trains 
hazardous waste cleanup workers 
its been getting worse for the last several years the 
economic pressures the greater and greater emphasis on cutting 
costs he said 
its get it done faster if youre laying a pipeline you 
save money as a contractor by not putting in proper shielding or 
shoring in the trench 
he said in 96 percent of trench cavein deaths he studied at 
niosh there was no shoring or sloping 
shortcuts in the name of efficiency are ultimately uneconomical 
said berkowitz of the united food and commercial workers any 
gains made by pushing people will be eaten up by high turnover and 
worker compensation 
as for kellen he has agreed to a workers compensation 
settlement of more than 16600 
but he asks whats the price on your hands youve got to 
provide for your family there was a time when everybody thought of 
retiring there after 30 years i dont look for any future there at 
all its a sad deal

with enrollments in us seminaries flat and the supply of 
foreignborn irish dried up the roman catholic church is seeking 
nontraditional sources to ease a worsening shortage of priests 
clergy from the philippines haiti korea india and other 
nations have been coming to the united states to provide 
sacramental help to a new generation of immigrants 
american bishops they want priests they dont care whether 
they speak with a gaelic brogue a spanish accent or a polish 
accent they want priests said the rev frank koper rector of a 
seminary for polish priests in orchard lake mich 
while many welcome the new priests for their ability to serve 
immigrants from their native lands other catholic leaders worry 
that the newcomers will struggle with the more liberal us church 
and that theyre being used to stall discussion on other solutions 
to the clergy shortage such as opening the priesthood to women and 
married men 
i think its an approach to the priest shortage and i think 
there are other creative ways said sister christine matthews of 
cincinnati executive director of the national association of 
church personnel directors i think we can find resources withi 
our catholic community 
while diocesan ordinations increased this decade in south 
america africa asia and europe they continued to decline in the 
united states falling from 593 priests ordained in 1980 to 470 in 
1987 nearly twothirds of all american priests were ordained 
within local dioceses while the other third were ordained by 
religious orders 
a study by the hartford seminarys center for social and 
religious research in connecticut said last year the number of 
catholic seminarians declined from 8885 in 1965 to 4063 in 1985 
the study further estimated the brotherhood of priests would 
decline 40 percent by the year 2000 the total number of american 
priests has dropped to 53000 this year from 59200 in 1970 
the shortage of priests has forced some catholic churches to 
merge congregations or to close for good a parish that might have 
been served by five priests may now be down to one or two the 
ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700 per priest 
in 1955 to almost 1000 today 
from the waves of irish priests who arrived in the 19th century 
the socalled fbi connection to the immigration of italian 
priests early in this one plenty of historical precedent exists 
for the new wave of foreignborn priests to follow their flocks 
overseas 
the only change is its 1989 rather than 1889 said richard 
dowd editor of crux an international newsletter for clergy and 
religious people weve become ethnically conscious again so we 
may want to have a polish priest running a polish parish or an 
italian priest running an italian parish 
no hard figures exist on the number of foreign priests who have 
entered the united states in recent years but 1000 is probably 
a good guess according to the rev peter zendzian associate 
director of migration and refugee services for the united states 
catholic conference the conference has just begun negotiations 
with bishops from india for an exchange of priests 
zendzian said this latest wave of noneuropean immigration is 
different 
in previous migrations priests came with their people and it 
just worked out said zendzian weve seen this day and age so 
many different people who have come from so many different 
countries in such a short time 
for example he said there are 1 million filipinos in the 
united states an estimated 85 percent of whom are catholic 
if priests are not sensitive to their needs zendzian said 
they strip away their old culture their old value system then 
they strip away their faith and theyre left with nothing 
some bishops also say they value the mix of faith and alien 
culture offered by foreign priests 
the richness that we have from other countries from other 
cultures is very good for us said auxiliary bishop augustin a 
roman of the archdiocese of miami i think culture is the door to 
communication 
at the ss cyril and methodius seminary for polish priests in 
orchard lake mich enrollment has grown from 10 students in 
198384 to 75 this year most were born in poland where the number 
of seminarians increased from 5325 in 1978 to 8069 in 1987 
according to koper 
in the united states where more than 2 million polishspeaking 
catholics live diocesan bishops want to add 75 polishspeaking 
priests to the 2250 already here koper said 
but others say the influx of foreign priests may create problems 
in a church that has grown more liberal since the second vatican 
council ended in the mid1960s the hierarchical catholic church 
has evolved into one in which laypeople play major roles in 
everything from running church schools to distributing communion 
the rev joseph brink of covington ky president of the 
national federation of priests councils said the real problem 
is cultural 
while the us church has moved toward shared responsibility 
among bishops priests religious and laity in a lot of other 
countries the priest does everything 
the rev james hennesey a catholic historian at canisius 
college in buffalo ny said the risk in importing foreign clergy 
was that you tend to keep priests cut off in the form of a 
caste 
hennesey said there was another message this thing seems to 
say any priest will do 
the rev david brinkmoeller executive director of the national 
conference of catholic bishops secretariat for priestly life and 
ministry said the last thing any ministry needs is just plain 
old warm bodies 
brinkmoeller and others say the church should be exploring other 
options beyond foreign priests such as consolidating additional 
parishes or aggressively selling the priesthood to young men as a 
positive active calling hennesey and sister matthews suggest 
dropping the barriers to married and women priests 
i wonder if this is a sign from providence we have to look 
that way hennesey said as an overall solution i dont see 
why we cant consider were being moved in the direction of 
ordaining married men

those whose youthful ambitions were nourished by 
horatio alger might not find much new in this story but a few 
adult cynics might very well be surprised 
it really is true that long hours hard work and good service 
are keys to entrepreneurial success you are assured of this by a 
detailed threeyear study of nearly 3000 business owners and 
companies 
the study takes its place in a long list of similar works all 
aimed at understanding american entrepreneurs considered a 
curious even mysterious breed by scholars and just commonsense 
folks by themselves 
in earlier analyses the entrepreneur was found among other 
things to have who moved to rather than being born in the area 
of success to have delivered newspapers been a soso student and 
to have experienced need 
whether such findings are sound or have significance is another 
matter but the latest by the national federation of independent 
business and american express has the ring of truth 
it did turn up at least one finding not revealed by the many 
earlier studies that long hours on the job do indeed make a 
positive difference but that extreme hours apparently erode 
entrepreneurial effectiveness 
long but not excessive hours make a difference according 
to the federation which claims membership of more than 570000 
small and independent business in all 50 states 
small business is a poorly defined category sometimes used 
to include all companies not among the top 1000 in gross income 
but the federations membership ranges all the way down to sole 
proprietorships 
its research arm found that 80 percent of those who worked 
between 60 hours and 69 hours a week remained in business after the 
first three years a period in which many startup companies fail 
however the survival rate of those who worked more than 69 
hours a week actually dropped to 75 percent while those who worked 
fewer hours fell to 76 percent 
while the federation didnt say so fatigue could be a critical 
factor in the effectiveness decline because more than 69 hours is 
double that of many wageearners and translates into 10 hours a day 
seven days a week 
of the companies studied more than threequarters succeeded 
the owners average age was 35 years with a working spouse and no 
more than five previous jobs of these successes 90 percent said 
they would do it again 
based on their experiences it was determined that quality 
service is more important than low price that success is enhanced 
by positive attitudes and that it is important to have had prior 
experience with the product involved 
the importance of service over price was pronounced those whose 
companies emphasized better service showed an 82 percent success 
rate compared with those who adopted a lowprice strategy 
as expected the quality of financing played a big role in the 
success or failure of the companies involved too little capital 
shows up in almost every survey of smallbusiness failure and this 
one was no exception 
what motivated the entrepreneurs more than threequarters 
agreed that it was to have greater control over their lives 
closely followed by using my skills and abilities and 
building something for my family 
less than half agreed with the statement earning lots of 
money that kind of reward mr alger might have suggested is 
simply the just recognition of ambitious hardworking people who 
seek to serve

last april billy crystal tries a few jokes on a 
small audience bomb city 
uhoh he thinks i need to see what works but where am i 
going to break in at catch a rising czar at the impravda he 
thinks this way because he is in the soviet union at the time a 
rough place for an american comic to break in a new act 
but anyone who survives saturday night live soap and 
publicity tours for when harry met sally is clearly of 
sturdy stuff crystal returns to mother russia in august it 
results in a 90minute show 
called billy crystal midnight train to moscow its 
getting five home box office cable showings that start saturday 
its a mix of comic fantasy a bit of jazz and a tracing of roots 
in addition to teaching one moscow audience how to do the wave 
he does a short but memorable skit as soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev and maverick soviet politician boris yeltsin in a fierce 
argument 
instead of mimicking their voices himself he does it with 
bigband jazz riffs on old maynard ferguson recording got the 
spirit 
they went nuts with that because it was so timely said 
crystal who also in the show plays a jazzman lester hawkins a 
combination of several famous musicians he actually knew as a kid 
his knowledge of jazz and decision to attempt a comedy show in 
the soviet union despite initial worries may stem from several 
factors 
one of his grandmothers came from the soviet union he also is 
the nephew of a man who founded commodore records a label devoted 
to dixieland his father used to produce jazz concerts 
as a kid in new york he learned the rudiments of clarinet from 
a jazz great pee wee russell he met billie holliday when he was 
5 grew up around jazz folk all friends of his father and uncle 
those musicians made me want to be a performer said 
crystal now 41 the house was always full of them always 
smelled of bourbon and brisket 
he achieved his boyhood goal but when it came time to visit the 
land of his relatives to perform there he wanted first to case 
the place try a few things there his first trip left him 
discouraged the reason 
well theres no sense of humor there that makes any sense to 
me to my kind of comedy what i like to do im talking about live 
on the stage how would that work 
he kicked ideas back and forth with paul flaherty who 
eventually directed his show finally crystal said he hit on a 
comedyfantasy concept and started really tracing my roots back 
found how deep they went 
and then the show became more than a comedy show 
early in the program he does a standup routine on a moscow 
stage in front of an audience many of whom obviously appear to 
understand english but he opens by speaking fluentsounding 
russian 
although he has the ear of a good mimic he doesnt know the 
language he said 
i had a good coach he explained but he admitted he found 
russian a tough language theres a lot of coughing and spitting 
 
still he said i wanted to come out speaking russian and not 
slow and loud the way people do with foreigners i wanted the 
people to know my roots are there 
although his two soviet trips were for the purpose of a show 
that hopes to make people laugh crystal found what he saw of the 
soviet union a little sad a little unsettling despite many 
reports of change for the better there 
theres a joke in the show that the place is so gray that ted 
turner should buy it and colorize it he said you feel that 
there there are some beautiful things to see 
but theres an eeriness that theres a sadness among the 
people you just feel it this fog that is around everybody

blues singer big joe williams was 
fresh out of jail when he cut his first album for arhoolie records 
one october day in 1960 
it was one of the most emotional blues sessions chris strachwitz 
has ever recorded 
he was just fierce the arhoolie owner recalled he had 
jail on his mind and everything was going bad i mean thats the 
blues thats pure blues 
for more than three decades the germanborn strachwitz has 
wandered the united states holding scores of impromptu recording 
sessions capturing some of the greatest blues cajun and 
mexicanamerican musicians as well as many obscure artists for 
his arhoolie records label 
i dont think these people today with 10 million tracks could 
have done a thing more than what i did with a capps condenser 
microphone strachwitz said but of course these were all 
acoustic instruments 
record collectors know his down home music store which shares a 
building in el cerrito about 20 miles east of san francisco with 
arhoolie 
the place is a record mecca for fans of folk blues country and 
world music but unlike the big retailers tapes and compact discs 
still represent the minority of sales down home ships albums 
nationwide through detailed mailorder catalogs that feature 
reviews some good some bad for the records it carries 
strachwitz also has produced and codirected films about music 
with director les blanc whose studio is adjacent to arhoolie and 
he is working on a book about lydia mendoza the famous 
mexicanamerican singer 
but strachwitz doesnt spend much time in the record store he 
bought the building more than 20 years ago with proceeds from rock 
band country joe and the fishs hit im fixin to die rag to 
which he held the publishing rights 
the onetime high school german teacher and avid record 
collector he has at least 22000 records stashed in something 
called the vault now faces the task of putting more than a 
hundred recordings made over 30 years plus scores of others hes 
released onto compact disc 
all for a business he says has never been very profitable 
i never went at it as a business thats where im somewhat 
different than most strachwitz said in an interview i never 
thought about merchandising or that this stuff was a product i 
began to realize this country was constituted of all kinds of 
people from all kinds of backgrounds 
in the late 1950s he saved money he made teaching and headed 
east one summer to louisiana mississippi and texas he recorded a 
handful of performers then returned to california and formed a 
record label 
i learned to splice 12 songs together two sides of a record 
roughly 20 minutes a side he said then i sent that to a guy 
who cut an acetate master from that the plates were made and then 
they started pressing the plates then you made the jacket 
he found musicians on street corners bars and fields 
artists such as mississippi fred mcdowell big mama thornton 
earl hooker clifton chenier and michael ducet owe at least part of 
their status to strachwitz 
he found arhoolies first artist mance lipscomb while driving 
near houston another black ace he found by asking locals whether 
they knew of any good guitar pickers 
id stop on street corners thered be guys playing dice and 
id walk up and ask them you guys ever heard of a guy named 
little brother theyd usually just stare at you and say what 
you want with him they figure youre a bill collector or 
something 
so this one guy said yeah hes hangin around with black 
ace that name was on my list that paul oliver a blues fanatic 
friend had sent me they said he comes to this tavern right around 
the corner every afternoon about 5 oclock 
thats how i met black ace that was another record 
strachwitz traces his love of blues to his boyhood in los 
angeles where he first idolized bluesman lightning hopkins after 
hearing his single hello central on radio station kfvd 
in 1959 he visited hopkins for the first time in houston and a 
year later he returned hoping to record hopkins music 
at that time i decided i wanted to make a record label because 
i wanted to document lightning hopkins in the beer joints the way 
he sounded i was never able to do that i didnt have the 
technical equipment i didnt have the money 
he got his chance later in his career when he took hopkins into 
a recording studio 
by the time strachwitz made his first recording he had teamed 
with fellow blues fanatic mack mccormick a playwritecab 
driver from houston after asking around the two found bluesman 
lipscomb at his home in navasota texas 
we just turned the machine on and he played one song after the 
other they usually give you their best strachwitz said it 
was just a little shotgun house with his wife and a number of 
grandchildren 
in 1963 hopkins introduced strachwitz to clifton chenier who 
was playing little bars in houstons french section 
i always tried to get him to play his french music but he 
always wanted to play rock n roll 
chenier one of arhoolies bestselling artists died in 1987 
over the years strachwitz has improved his equipment but he 
still prefers taping acoustic instruments with simple recording 
devices more and more he is forced to take bands into the studio 
to cut albums 
his current best seller is the cajun band beausoleil featuring 
fiddler michael ducet strachwitz said ducet has much of the 
spontaneity and character of the singers he found in remote areas 
during the 1960s

weapons in the feuds that have riven ireland 
seamus deane nearing the end of his work on one of the biggest 
books of all an anthology of 14 centuries of irish writing hopes 
it will be simply too large and too inclusive to hurl at an enemy 
deane a professor of english and american literature at 
university college dublin is general editor of the field day 
anthology of irish writing 5501990 to be published in april by 
faber amp faber 
in two volumes and 3000 pages the anthology will include 
examples of writing in early medieval and modern irish norman 
french latin and english 
deane stresses writing in the title because he has included 
magazine and newspaper articles oral histories attempts at 
literature that could hardly be called great and commentaries about 
ireland by english notables including oliver cromwell who led a 
bloody military expedition through ireland 
this immense and distressing work as deane calls it is 
inevitably a political document an argument against anyone 
republican loyalist protestant catholic celt gael 
scotsirish angloirish who would stake an exclusive claim to 
being irish 
we are not trying to say in fact we are refusing to say that 
there is some metaphysical essence called irishness that is as 
visible in a 9th century poem as it is in a play by sean ocasey 
were not interested in that because we dont believe in the 
existence of it said deane a native of londonderry in the 
british province of northern ireland during a recent visit to 
london 
the anthology is a serious attempt to try to introduce to 
people the idea of a culture that was so rich and diverse that it 
cannot be appropriated by any one group 
the anthology was sponsored by field day founded in londonderry 
in 1980 by playwright brian friel and actor stephen rea as a 
traveling theater company it expanded into publishing in 1983 with 
a series of political pamphlets and is widely regarded as the 
finest cultural response northern ireland has produced against the 
violence that has torn the province 
deane described the anthology as a definition of irish writing 
of repossession of irishborn authors such george bernard shaw 
oscar wilde jonathan swift edmund burke and laurence sterne who 
are prominent in english letters and of decolonization 
it is important that this should be an exemplary act of 
showing how you can retain cultural intimacy and links with the 
colonizing power while at the same time not learning to think of 
yourself as having an ancillary marginal or junior role to that 
power deane said 
however he also detects in ireland a tendency to fall into a 
trap of colonial selfimage they dont know where they are or 
where they came from and they invent fake origins that exclude 
many people whom they have to live with 
ultimately he argued this process of inventing origins and 
excluding latecomers makes the others less human and thus 
suitable targets for murder 
the anthology is intended deane said to provide material 
that will show the stupidity and the brokenhearted terminus to 
which sectarianism leads and how sectarianism can only be 
justified by a certain kind of deliberate fostered nurtured 
ignorance of what in fact has happened what contributions have 
been made by various groups over the centuries to the culture 
one section will be devoted to protestant political oratory in 
the north in the 19th and 20th centuries it will also take note of 
an ulster protestant literary tradition a literature alas 
that is not known to many protestants 
one important figure in that tradition is sir samuel ferguson of 
belfast one of the first to try to combine in his writings a 
plea for irish cultural unity which at the same time would allow 
maintenance of the political union with britain 
deane believes the anthology will demonstrate that the republic 
of ireland does not have a culture distinct from that of northern 
ireland and he sees that as a rebuke to southern provincialism 
there is a section called provincialism and censorship 
centering in the 1930s and 1940s and is about those writers such 
as samuel beckett sean ofaolain frank oconnor flann obrien 
denis devlin who in a sense find that the atmosphere in the south 
was suffocating he said 
they shut the doors on the minds in the south they exported 
the young people and by the 1950s it had become a kind of 
semigeriatric society with most of its young energy drained away 
and the catholic church ruling the roost and the intellectual life 
in a dreadful state of disrepair

a great blue heron its craned neck 
and long bill poking through the morning mist feeds along the 
wooded shore of a stripmine lake 
not far away are watchers armed with binoculars cameras and 
video cameras but its not the heron theyre watching its 
dozens of outofstate trash trucks rumbling up to the center point 
landfill feeding the earthmovers whose drone shatters the idyll a 
halfmile from the lake 
the dump patrol including teachers miners teenagers and 
retirees was organized by terri moore whose dream of a quiet 
rural life also has been shattered by fears of a mountain of 
garbage imported from the east coast 
until the outofstate waste stops were going to be out 
here said moore 33 whose troops have logged nearly 1200 rigs 
from 140 companies in the 11 weeks since they started keeping track 
the landfill operators have called it harassment i have a 
substantial investment in the landfill im not going to be doing 
anything to jeopardize that said john r hoffman a new 
jerseybased businessman who is a partner in the center point 
landfill and others near peru and wabash 
but moore said that if a cleanup is ever needed officials will 
have names they need by tracing license plates and companies logged 
by the dump patrol 
john and terri moore and their family moved into their home on 
25 acres outside this western indiana town 2 years ago the 
lifelong area residents wanted their children to grow up here too 
near the fiveacre lake on their land that attracts the herons 
geese and other wildlife 
it was our dream house we knew in life we couldnt ask for 
anything more it was like having a vacation every night terri 
said 
then last year john came home from work one day and said 
developers proposed a landfill on the property adjacent to theirs 
a few hundred feet from their lake across the road from center 
point landfill 
moore feared toxins would leak through abandoned mine shafts to 
their lake and property last october she formed hope hoosiers 
opposing pollution of the environment and tried to reach all of 
approximately 750 people who live within two miles of the dump she 
figures 60 percent of the families now are members 
i got people upset i got people concerned and worried she 
also got them to have local landzoning changes approved that 
stopped that landfill 
it proved to be an empty victory 
last november center point landfill got a state permit to 
accept asbestos which causes cancer and is being removed from 
buildings across the country it also began accepting limited 
shipments of trash from out of state east coast landfill space is 
dwindling and communities must ship refuse elsewhere 
the landfills neighbors objected 
robert bedwell jr whose family owned the site said some 
people called state officials to report suspected but unfounded 
infractions he began talks with a group headed by hoffman and a 
sale was completed in july 
since then trucks carrying outofstate trash have rolled into 
center point some days as many as 30 trucks queue up at the dump 
motoring to the top of a hill and unloading refuse that bulldozers 
cover with dirt 
we knew the landfill was sold and then one morning we saw 30 
or 40 trucks were going by that kind of made all of our nightmares 
come true said terri moore 
i dont see how our state officials can have this go on 
said patrol member forest reece a 78yearold retired custodian 
and factory worker my god i think its horrible myself 
indiana apparently can do little federal laws forbid one state 
from refusing to accept trash from another state the solid waste 
management board has given preliminary approval to a plan to track 
the amount and origin of the trash but it faces public hearings 
and other steps before it goes into effect 
bedwell 37 began taking outofstate garbage a year ago out of 
fear that if a new landfill opened across the road it would steal 
his business he began taking asbestos because it was an 
opportunity for the family business to grow 
i didnt take anything hazardous he said adding that his 
asbestos operation met the highest state and federal requirements 
bedwell said he tried to talk to members of hope and show them how 
the landfill operated but they didnt want to see they wanted 
to stand by the road and imagine it 
i went to school with these people now they wont even talk 
to me these people used to be my friends it hurts it hurts real 
bad 
neither bedwell nor hoffman would say how much was paid for the 
landfill but legal papers show hoffmans group came up with an 
initial 27 million 
hoffman a 13year veteran of landfill operations said that 
without the outofstate business his landfills would be barely 
getting by he said half the refuse accepted at center point comes 
from out of state 
this is a privately owned business we have space to sell 
he said to run a good operation you need income 
the landfill employs 12 people with an annual payroll of 
350000 it will pump about 1 million into the local economy over 
the next 12 months he said i think thats a very good 
neighbor 
hoffman also said the landfill was safe and like his operations 
near wabash and peru refuses waste it is not permitted to accept 
that particular landfill is probably the best geologically sited 
in the state of indiana 
hopes fears about the asbestos are unfounded he said while it 
is dangerous in the air he said it has zero chance of getting 
into the groundwater it is not mobile in soil 
hoffman acknowledged that hopes presence will probably help him 
run the landfill better he has tried to work with the group and 
called moore shortly after he took over but she wasnt interested 
in seeing the operation 
now hoffman said he has no more time for moore or hope you 
cannot deal with these people rationally i cant be distracted by 
them theyre interested in closing the landfill true and simple 
meanwhile us rep christopher h smith rnj says he will 
use the photographs taken by moore and her patrol to convince 
congress that it needs to ban the practice of transporting trash 
and food in the same trucks 
smith plans to introduce legislation to bar refrigerated trucks 
from hauling landfill waste ban waste transporters from hauling 
food and require landfill operators to have truckcleaning 
procedures moore sent him pictures of refrigerated trucks 
unloading garbage at the landfill during the summer 
four different truckers told us they hauled beef on hanging 
meat racks from chicago to the east coast after making trash 
runs she said one thing that really upset us was when 
truckers showed us live maggots in the back of nonrefrigerated 
trucks that had gone through the landfills washing procedure

beware of the 1990 subaru legacy ls awd wagon it could make you 
forget all about buying a minivan 
i know minivans are the hot ticket station wagons are supposed 
to be passe 
but compact sedans also are popular a la the toyota camry and 
honda accord and subarus legacy wagon feels just like a sedan 
with the utility of a little van 
the legacy ls allwheeldrive test wagon drove like a sedan 
handling well and accelerating with steady power 
it seated five with relative ease just like a decentsized 
sedan would and there was no stepping up to get inside 
and the legacy had 71 cubic feet of cargo space in back with 
the split rear seats folded down thats more than the 627 cubic 
feet you get by removing the rearmost seats of general motors new 
minivans though not as much as the 1112 cubic feet you get in 
those vans if you take out both sets of rear seats 
still the legacy also had fulltime fourwheeldrive an 
alternative not yet offered on the gm minivans or even chryslers 
popular minivans 
and the legacy test car came standard with a 22liter engine 
that was powerful and yet had only four cylinders with four valves 
per cylinder and multiport fuel injection rather than the 
sixcylinder engines sometimes needed to adequately power minivans 
no wonder that subaru nicknamed its engine the boxer it pulls 
no punches just delivers the power eagerly when teamed with 
fivespeed manual transmission 
and it delivered decent fuel economy while powering all four 
wheels 20 miles to the gallon in the city and 26 mpg on the 
highway even the automatic transmission gets 20 mpg in the city 
and 25 mpg on the highway in the fourwheeldrive model according 
to the epa that compares with 18 mpg and 22 mpg respectively for 
the allwheeldrive nissan axxess with fourcylinder engine and 
automatic transmission 
subaru also was attentive to inside details the legacy wagon 
has a nifty twocup holder that pulls out of the dash below the 
ventilation controls 
it places cups high enough to be easily reached while driving 
make sure the radio is tuned beforehand however its tough to 
make adjustments with the cups in the way 
a shelf below the ashtray had rubber material that gripped 
whatever was placed there so keys tickets and change didnt slide 
off 
dashboard gauges had large easytoread numbers and included a 
tachometer frontseat headrests could be adjusted for height as 
well as how close they were positioned to an occupants head the 
ls model came with a sunroof and cruise control for added comfort 
in the cargo area subaru installed a big plastic tray under the 
thick cargo rug for tools or small items a stalk was provided to 
prop the cargo rug up out of the way as you reached for the spare 
tire replacing the rug was a snap literally easy snaps hold the 
cargo covering snugly in place 
but be wary of the top tailgate on the test car it tended to 
bounce up quickly and could have hit an unwary bystander 
but the real news was passenger space this is subarus largest 
car ever the first with a wheelbase of more than 100 inches 
the space was used well with plenty of room front and back 
legroom was terrific with the front seats moved up and even when 
the front seats were all the way back and slightly reclined my 
knees cleared the seatbacks 
seating for two was more than adequate in the rear and three 
would be snug only if everyone was overweight but even the person 
sitting in the middle would appreciate the legacy design there was 
no bump or hard middle in the back seat just cushioned comfort 
throughout 
subaru says legacy buyers are expected to be married 2549 
years old with household income of 40000 or more 
about 60 percent will be male and they will have some college 
education 
the company did not have sales projections but has sold more 
than 6000 wagons since the legacy appeared in showrooms in may 
because the legacy is new consumer reports does not have owner 
complaints 
one final note the legacy is the first usbuilt vehicle for 
subaru with some vehicles coming from a new plant in lafayette 
ind

right now the days and nights of televisions 
molly dodd also known as actress blair brown are spent on a 
shabby block of west 47th street at broadways ethel barrymore 
theatre 
shes starring in the secret rapture a new play by british 
playwright david hare her boyfriend the drama was written 
specifically for brown for blair as ever says hares 
dedication and she plays one of its three choice female roles 
it tells of two sisters brown and frances conroy who return 
home after the death of their father and who must deal with their 
lives as well as the life of their alcoholic stepmother mary beth 
hurt marion played by conroy is an ambitious junior minister in 
the thatcher government and isobel the role played by brown is 
an ineffectual but wellintentioned graphic designer 
the secret rapture was a big hit at englands national 
theatre where it was performed by a different cast and with a 
different director hare does the honors here 
whats hard for some people about davids plays is that they 
are not manuals about how to live brown says everyone in 
them not unlike life is a mixture of good and bad strengths and 
weaknesses and thats sometimes difficult for mass american 
audiences to accept 
shes confident that new york theatergoers wont have trouble 
relating to very english characters and will have an easier time 
picking up on the family drama than the british politics 
so many of the characters sound very american like marion 
who is a real achiever or her husband tom a christian 
businessman brown says i thought the united states had the 
corner on that profession and that they were all southern 
whether the secret rapture will succeed on broadway brown 
doesnt know but she has an affection for the character she plays 
isobel is a woman sensitive to a certain kind of emotional 
blackmail probably a person whos living her life according to the 
path of least resistance the actress says she is not a 
victim she hangs on to her own integrity but to a fault isobel 
is a good daughter 
not unlike the slightly bewildered woman brown plays on the 
television series the days and nights of molly dodd now seen 
on lifetime a cable channel 
molly dodds history is worthy of soap opera if not sitcom 
it began more than two years ago with producer jay tarses for 
whom brown had done a television pilot that abc decided not to pick 
up they had gotten along immediately 
we had the same sense of humor he was so twisted brown 
laughs 
then brandon tartikoff of nbc called jay and without ever 
mentioning the mary word said he wanted to do a series about a 
single woman in the big city she recalls 
what tarses came up with was molly dodd which premiered on 
nbc during the summer of 1987 despite cheers from the critics it 
never lived up to the networks expectations what nbc got was an 
unusual comedy in which molly struggled to cope with her mother 
exhusband sister various boyfriends and life some of the time 
she didnt succeed 
the show moved from time slot to time slot eventually was cast 
off by nbc and picked up by lifetime and instead of being filmed 
in los angeles molly dodd is now done in new york where its 
production team can take advantage of the citys theater people 
the pool of actors here is much grittier much more 
interesting brown says now we have a little theatrical rep 
company 
most of the shows scripts are written by playwright eric 
overmyer author of on the verge and directed by don scardino 
a veteran theater performer who will direct the play a few good 
men on broadway later this season 
everyone took a salary cut when the show moved to cable because 
the licensing fees are less 
but it was worth it brown says whats your choice not 
to do it because you are going to make more money doing something 
you dont like 
the size of the audience on cable is smaller too we were 
worried viewers wouldnt be able to find us but people still 
recognize brown on the street 
its nice but then molly is kind of a benevolent personality 
its not like judy carnes sockittome girl on laugh in they 
dont want to see how tough i am they basically think im their 
neighbor 
and most dont think of her as a theater actress audiences 
dont realize that before there was the days and nights of molly 
dodd or movies like continental divide with john belushi or 
tv miniseries like kennedy and captains and the kings 
there was the stage 
brown a native of washington dc has extensive and 
impressive credits starting with her training at the national 
theatre of canada she ended up working at the shakespeare festival 
in stratford ontario and in regional theaters across canada and 
the united states including two seasons at the guthrie in 
minneapolis 
i was an ingenue so i could always get work because i looked 
the right way she says 
a couple years ago i was going in for an audition and i could 
see this director thinking oh this is a television actress im 
going to cross over she says i wanted to take him by the 
throat and yell look at my credits 
brown was given six months off from molly dodd to do the 
secret rapture if it runs long enough shell leave the play 
next february to resume production of the television series 
its very rare to have this much good material to do 
especially material that is written for you brown says so 
its just bad sportsmanship to complain just keep your mouth shut 
and count your lucky stars because it will soon be over

donald petersen says the worst day in his 
40 years with ford motor co came shortly after he was named 
president in march 1980 when he realized the no 2 automaker was 
in worse shape than hed thought 
it was certainly a sobering day he said it was probably 
the most sobering day 
the company had just reported a profit of 117 billion for 
1979 the second straight year that profits were down fords 
financial slide was accelerating hurt by rising gasoline prices 
and rising interest rates which were making cars less affordable 
by the time petersens first year as fords president ended the 
company had reported a 154 billion loss to the outside world 
things looked pretty bad 
but sequestered from public view in ford design studios were the 
cars that would help resurrect the company and make it one of the 
worlds most profitable corporations in less than a decade 
first the sleek thunderbird and later the jellybeanlike taurus 
and sable models became the weapons ford used to slamdunk its way 
back into the brutally competitive auto business threatening no 1 
general motors corps dominance 
what was so striking to me about the taurus was that it put 
the stamp of certified acceptance and rightness on the efforts of 
ford motor company in a fashion that i did not anticipate fully 
petersen said to me we had started the process long before 
i thought of the 83 thunderbird as really if you will the 
benchmark car that really declared that there was going to be a 
very different direction specifically in design of automobiles 
petersen was no stranger to watching cars develop from a sketch 
sheet to the assembly line 
through the 1950s and 1960s he rose through the product 
planning division to become vice president for car planning and 
research in 1969 in the early 1970s he was vice president and 
general manager of the companys truck operations giving him broad 
product experience 
between then and the time he was elected to fords board of 
directors on sept 8 1977 petersen was executive vice president 
for diversified products which linked the company with suppliers 
and subsidiaries and was vice president for international 
operations 
some analysts have said his role overseeing foreign operations 
gave him a view of the international automobile industry that has 
spurred ford to break out of the big three carmaking mold 
the introductions of the taurus and sable on the day after 
christmas 1985 proved to be the gift that has kept on giving for 
ford 
by then the company was well into a painful costreduction 
program that scrapped the paring knife and instead used a cleaver 
to eliminate what petersen and his colleagues considered excessive 
and redundant at the same time gasoline prices and interest rates 
were falling 
i think it was all of this coming together in that type of car 
that created almost a sensation that i didnt expect petersen 
said 
earlier that year petersen became board chairman and chief 
executive officer in 1985 ford made 252 billion 
ford has been on a roll since the taurussable introduction 
stealing sales and market share from gm fighting off foreign 
competition easier than other domestic manufacturers and keeping a 
lid on manufacturing expansion through the use of overtime instead 
of expensive new factories 
one of the big problems for automakers in the 1990s promises to 
be overcapacity too many assembly lines producing too many cars 
for a saturated market it likely will affect ford less than others 
if the scenario is roughly what we think it will be slow 
growth an industry down some perhaps from this year ford 
should be in a pretty good position to deal with most of the 
problems by fluctuating overtime petersen said 
it is that outlook of soft growth that has pushed ford into 
other directions under petersens guidance 
for example the automaker has expressed interest in buying all 
or part of such wellknown european automakers as britains jaguar 
and swedens saab to strengthen its worldwide operations 
ford also has made major moves into financial services to 
cushion the blow of any autoindustry downturn last july for 
instance it announced the 335 billion purchase of the 
associates a major provider of consumer financing from paramount 
communications corp 
petersen is making no predictions about the level of car and 
truck sales in 1990 we want to see a little bit more of the 
fourth quarter of 1989 before we start quantifying next year 
he said 
we do think that its likely to be off some from the 1989 
calendar year but not a dramatic drop in fact he added fords 
sales should continue to grow which would give it a larger share 
of a smaller market 
petersen said much of the reason for fords comeback stems from 
a management meeting in 1984 when the companys leadership adopted 
company mission values and guiding principles a statement of 
fords goals 
ill always remember henry ford ii devoting his entire talk to 
the then new statement of mvgp at ford petersen said as he 
left the podium he said to me pete i hope i gave your new 
statement of what we want to be a good send off 
that really was a certification that we really are going to 
change at that point we were very much in the process of change 
under petersens direction the company became the most 
profitable automaker in history in 1986 ford made 329 billion 
raised that to 463 billion in 1987 and set an industry record 
53 billion in profit in 1988 
honors have been heaped on petersen for work in and out of the 
automobile industry yet his office has none of the numerous 
plaques he has received over the years in fact there is little 
indication save a lifesize bust of the greek god mercury by 
marshall fredericks that its the seat of management for ford 
motor co 
in the place of plaques certificates and official proclamations 
are things near and dear to petersen and his wife jody 
rocks 
not just any rocks but minerals collected from all over the 
world 
a case contains raw and finished forms of dozens of minerals 
an emerald from muzo colombia cinnabar from chinas hunan 
province and imperial topaz from minas gerais brazil 
in a private meeting room as a centerpiece on a small table 
there is an unusually large specimen of twinned quartz 
my interest is whats beautiful and whats pretty petersen 
said and then you go on to see if its perfect

bunting poses another scenario 
all right he says its 102 degrees out youre in the 
south bronx and youve got 300 people around you now what are you 
charging this guy with 
a hispanic cop getting into the spirit jumps up and confronts 
her classmate 
what are you doing thats my brother he didnt do nothing 
the laughter drowns out bunting 
bunting once gave a lecture to a group of mystery book writers 
and was deluged with offers to coauthor a book 
dr alan goldstein a psychology professor says he was once 
teaching a class about schizophrenics and their usual nonviolent 
nature 
a copstudent asked would you like me to show the class the 
two bullet holes i have in my buttocks from one of those 
nonviolent schizophrenics 
goldstein says that is one of the great strengths of john jay 
we all learn to be tolerant and we learn from each other 
meanwhile back in the ivory tower part of the school freshmen 
are wrestling with an english literature survey course basic 
mathematics speech government 101 much like students at any 
college half of their credits must be in traditional liberal arts 
courses but even those have a criminal justice flavor 
sometimes we wish their interests were broader says dr 
dorothy bracey head of the anthropology department and an expert 
on international policing particularly the criminal justice system 
in china but in another way it makes it easier to teach here 
in theory all students have some interest in criminal justice 
forty percent of jays students come from families that earn 
under 12000 a year they are older than most college students and 
most of them work about 80 percent receive some sort of financial 
aid 
the undergraduates are 36 percent black 32 percent white 28 
percent hispanic almost half are women 
due to finances about a fourth graduate in four years with 
work and aid almost threefourths stick out 10 to 14 semesters to 
graduate 
still about 500 students get their baccalaureates each year 
the staff includes olga ford a retired new york city detective 
she has worked as technical adviser for tv shows there was a 
reported contract out on her when she helped bring down drug 
kingpin nicky barnes 
as head of the internship program and knowing the reality of 
policing she advises students dont take internships with private 
industry security men who are armed never ride in a radio car 
never visit a parolee never walk with a cop to and from the 
precinct 
theres dr ansley hamid an anthropology professor who 
specializes in crackrelated violence and street gangs and 
maintains that crack is not as instantly addictive as it is being 
portrayed 
the dealers are controlled users or sometimes abstinent and 
i recently met an 80yearold grandmother who has no previous 
history of alcohol or drug abuse who is a controlled user hamid 
says 
crack just came on us so fast there was no time for a body of 
experiential users to teach others now people are coming up with 
strategies for recreational use of crack they might mix a little 
with some marijuana for instance 
is this a rather benign view of crack 
not benign says hamid just a businessasusual view of 
underground economies 
the real danger is the destruction of families and crack does 
the footwork the marijuana dealer lasted a long time eventually 
he bought a small bakery or maybe a boutique in the neighborhood 
with crack the money doesnt stay here 
the crack dealer doesnt last long he is either arrested 
killed by the competition or he becomes a crack head himself but 
when he has the money he conspicuously consumes buying fancy 
imported cars and jewelry the money doesnt go back into the 
community that generated it 
over at the criminal justice center there is william mccarthy 
retired new york city detective with the code name mother he 
was once the undercover owner of two houses of prostitution as 
head of the bomb squad when he retired he was known as billy 
bombs 
now working on his doctorate mccarthy says if it werent for 
john jay i would never have gotten my bachelors and masters 
degrees back then it was the only place a cop could go 
in the next office sits william louden also working on his

the handsome charismatic grand dragon of the 
ku klux klan was destined for political control of indiana until a 
young schoolteacher looked beneath his sheet 
it had in a sense fatal consequences for both it led to her 
kidnaping and rape in her humiliation she took her own life it 
sent him to prison amidst revelations of corruption and criminal 
activities behind the facade of a benevolent kkk that brought his 
empire crashing down 
nbc retells the story in the miniseries cross of fire 
mel harris stars as madge oberholtzer a teacher working for the 
department of education and john heard is david stephenson the 
klansman in this drama based upon a true story of events in 
indiana in the 1920s at that time the kkk was a major political 
force in a number of states 
cross of fire which nbc will telecast in two parts on 
sunday and monday also stars lloyd bridges as the defense attorney 
and david morse as the prosecutor paul wendkos directed on 
location in kansas from a screenplay by robert crais 
they meet at a party for state bigwigs said harris who 
played the role during time off from abcs thirtysomething 
she sees it as an opportunity to promote her book program she 
meets david and he tells her the klan does good work and charity 
he says the bad reports are merely being spread by outside 
factions hes very charismatic and she goes for him 
her feelings cause some emotional conflict yet its the first 
love of her life she tries to set aside her reservations about the 
klan 
he has his own private party with her harris said she 
goes to his house to talk about her book project when she resists 
his aggression he kidnaps her beats her and rapes her 
she wasnt naive she was very intelligent she had been taken 
in by his charm theres always the element that love is blind she 
wanted to believe that he was good she tries to kill herself when 
she realizes the situation shes in 
although she died as a result of taking poison the jury was so 
enraged at his conduct that they sent him to prison for life for 
murder some of his political cronies also went to jail no 
governor dared release him from prison until 1956 after he served 
31 years 
harris plays hope steadman in the emmywinning 
thirtysomething she recently costarred with jim belushi in 
the feature film k9 and costars with john ritter in the 
upcoming abc movie my brothers wife the latter is based on 
the play the middle ages 
during an interview she was in costume for a 1940s fantasy 
sequence for thirtysomething pants shirt and tie a bowler on 
her head the studio streets and commissary were filled with extras 
in period clothing 
i dont know whats ahead for hope she said we talked 
about her having a second baby hope will continue to work and have 
a career outside of the house shes very loving and caring and 
friendly but sometimes she can be a little too much of those 
things 
she would make a wonderful best friend i dont want to be 
her but i would certainly take her as a friend 
in the show shes married to michael played by ken olin 
michael is jewish and the interfaith marriage occasionally causes a 
few problems such as which faith to raise their son in and the 
celebration of christmas 
my brothers wife is a romantic comedy and a nice change of 
pace she said i did it after i completed cross of fire 
its about a girl who meets two brothers ones a straight 
republican growing up in his fathers mold the other pushes the 
limits played by john ritter of course david byron plays the 
other brother 
i marry the stuffy brother then its about how i and the 
other brother keep crossing paths i guess they have this love for 
each other she stays faithful to her husband its about how 
peoples lives change over the years 
her first movie was the 1985 tv movie harrys hong kong it 
was a series pilot in which david soul was a businessman and she 
was a reporter she moved to los angeles with her husband and 
newborn son just before the 1984 summer olympics she had been 
doing modeling and commercials and studying acting in new york 
harris is married to cotter smith who stars in the upcoming abc

district attorneys office

former president ronald reagan is beginning a 
week in japan that gives rich new meaning to the word 
honorarium make that very rich 
reagan is said to be picking up a fee of 2 million prompting 
complaints in congress and an inquiry into the government costs for 
secret service protection during the trip 
the trip and the flap came as congress completed action on a 
bill providing 18 million to pay the pensions office and staff 
expenses of the four living former presidents that does not 
include the cost of the secret service protection provided to 
former presidents and their wives 
the total cost of that protection is expected to come to 125 
million this year for three of the former presidents richard m 
nixon decided in 1985 to give up his secret service bodyguards and 
pay for his own protection a spokesman said he now spends about 
150000 a year on it 
sen david pryor dark wants a review of the benefits 
bestowed on the men who have served in the white house he called 
it federal largesse intended to avoid commercialization of the 
office 
perhaps there is an equitable middle ground between the reagan 
and nixon situations regarding public funding of protective 
services for former presidents when they are traveling on 
profitmaking ventures pryor said 
he has arranged to meet with secret service officials next week 
to talk about the cost of guarding former presidents on trips like 
reagans 
pryor suggested reagan voluntarily reimburse the treasury for 
secret service costs on his trip to japan i doubt he will do 
so pryor told the senate if some administrative accommodation 
cannot be reached on this matter i will introduce legislation to 
make sure the taxpayer does not get stuck with the bill when our 
former presidents are off actually increasing their personal 
fortunes 
in the house rep paul kanjorski dpa said it is 
embarrassing to have a former president picking up big fees from a 
foreign corporation then warming to his topic called it an 
unmitigated atrocity for the government to pay security costs 
on such a trip 
i do think it is reasonable to ask what it is costing american 
taxpayers to send a former president of the united states to japan 
so that he may engage in conversations with japanese corporations 
and gain 2 million in personal income for doing that kanjorski 
said tuesday when the house passed the bill including the 
appropriation for former presidents who receive annual pensions of 
99500 the senate completed action on wednesday without debate 
reagan and his wife were spending the weekend in an elegantly 
refurbished japanese guest house after flying to tokyo on friday on 
a twa 747 chartered by fujisankei communications group the company 
is financing the trip at an estimated cost of 7 million including 
the reported 2 million fee to reagan neither the companys 
spokesmen nor reagans have confirmed the size of his payment 
im not familiar with those details said reagan aide mark 
weinberg reagan is to meet with japanese officials and to appear 
at a series of companysponsored events including two speeches 
followed by questionanswer sessions 
the japanese government is cohost for a visit first discussed 
in 1983 and again in 1988 before reagan left office charles z 
wick former director of the us information agency and a close 
friend of the reagans helped arrange the visit and was traveling 
with them 
about 200 dependents of american military personnel stationed in 
japan flew there for visits on the chartered jet they are to 
return to los angeles with the reagans on oct 28 
the staff office and expense appropriations provided to former 
presidents date back 21 years costs have been increasing and 
there have been proposals to limit that spending during the past 
five years the reagan controversy may give that movement a push 
we owe our former presidents protection and respect but do we 
owe them a guarantee to underwrite whatever future business 
ventures they may undertake for personal gain pryor asked 
sen charles e grassley riowa has proposed a bill to limit 
staff and expense payments to former presidents and also to 
provide for annual reviews of their security needs beginning five 
years after they leave office while they should be rewarded for 
their service to this country it is not appropriate to treat them 
as royalty at taxpayer expense grassley said when he introduced 
it last summer 
the appropriation congress has just passed provides 559500 for 
reagan 387800 for jimmy carter 426800 for gerald r ford and 
426700 for nixon 
nixons assistant said none of the money he gets has been used 
on his books or any other profitmaking work john h taylor 
said nixon does not accept speech fees despite offers that total 
720000 a year

lost angels orion home video vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
southern california youth hollywood would have us believe are 
interested only in sex drugs alcohol fast cars good times and 
having their own outtasight pads they love to spend their parents 
money except theyre too stupid to really know how to count change 
and bills so they steal or hustle or use credit cards 
these same spoiled empty and ignorant teens pop up like 
laminated paperdolls in hugh hudsons lost angels a 
superficial tale about some seriously disturbed young people and 
their seriously disturbed parents 
unlike fast times at ridgemont high and other teenoriented 
movies in which irresponsibility and often crime are played for 
laughs lost angels takes a hard line and tells us that 
trashing someone elses property driving a car into a swimming 
pool or physically abusing another youngster for being a good 
student or a virgin just isnt very nice 
tim doolan adam horovitz lives with his bloated mother and her 
bloated second husband in an affluent housing development mother 
snivels about how good stepdad is to take them in stepdad talks 
about discipline but crudely urinates in a punch bowl during a 
party 
tim hangs out with a gang called dab dead at birth theyre 
middleclass white kids who have nothing better to do with their 
time such as read develop a skill or hobby get an afterschool 
job or do volunteer work pursue cultural activities or sports so 
they adapt hispanic names and rumble with the 10th street gang a 
group of latin kids 
when theyre not fighting hurling racial slurs or otherwise 
trying to prove the superiority of the white race they break into 
the homes of vacationing families and destroy everything in sight 
why no reason opines one dab member its just something to 
do these are kids whose parents have money but do not have class 
values or culture 
tim is arrested and sent to juvenile hall after his girlfriend 
gets high and parks her mothers new car in the family pool hes 
sent to valley acres a center for troubled youth 
this is where the filmmakers slip into david and lisa land 
but the celebrated 1963 frank perry movie was an intelligent case 
history drama with a degree of authenticity lost angels has 
none of those qualities even donald sutherland as a tortured 
alcoholic and committed doctor can not save this video which is 
not worth the rental

pet sematary paramount home video priced for rental rated 
r 
 
victims in horror movies have one thing in common they lack 
common sense and use bad judgment in short theyre stupid 
pet sematary the film adaptation of stephen kings novel 
offers a good look at the stupidity factor 
louis creed moves his wife rachel daughter ellie and toddler 
son gage into a house on one of the fastest trucker speed strips 
in maine the minute they arrive the wife takes gage out of his 
car seat sets him on the lawn and turns her back on him gage 
wanders towards the highway to wave to a passing truck a neighbor 
jud crandall fred gwynne snatches the lad out of the jaws of 
steel just in time 
do the creeds put up a fence dont be silly 
the stupidity factor escalates during a family picnic creed 
allows gage to fly a kite and hands him the ball of twine the baby 
drops the twine and all watch as the kite runs away creed turns 
his back on the baby who dashes after the kite and into a truck 
but thats not the end of gage and only the beginning of the 
horror awaiting the creeds 
because the movies characters do so many misguided things 
their behavior and the films action becomes more predictable and 
less scary everything is neatly laid out in pet sematary and 
thats one of the problems you dont feel the hairs twitching on 
your neck and whats the point of a horror movie if it doesnt 
scare you 
pet sematary beautifully photographed by peter stein 
explores the human fear of death and dying and the tempting notion 
of bringing back the dead but as jud says sometimes dead is 
better 
behind the crudely constructed cemetery for pets which had been 
made over several generations by children is an ancient indian 
burial ground only problem the soil has gone sour and the 
place is evil 
creed finds out when jud takes him there to bury ellies cat 
church who had also tapdanced with a truck but jud neglects to 
tell creed that what returns isnt always the same as what was 
buried sweet and gentle church returns as pit cat 
so it is with a certain prescient horror that creed takes his 
dead son to the same burial ground what comes back would make 
freddie and jason proud 
theres plenty of slicing and dicing in pet sematary and 
some clever special effects by lance and david anderson to show 
spilled brains severed heads etc theres also a campy turn near 
the end as creed finally kills the returned gage the baby who has 
just come off a killing spree looks at him pouts and says no 
fair 
dale midkiff and denise crosby are just fine as louis and 
rachel but gwynne upstages even church the pit cat with his down 
east flavor 
king wrote the screenplay and tries to remain true to his book 
which was not necessarily a wise move because the story doesnt 
move fast enough and even at the slow pace there are a lot of 
holes 
still its an ok video for a rainy halloween weekend

three of victoria guillens children have 
had hepatitis one daughter has sores up and down her arms and legs 
and her husband suffers gastritis she blames the lack of running 
water in her home 
many health workers agree that lack of water is the direct cause 
of the guillens illnesses they also blame a lack of public policy 
in the last decade for failure to find a remedy for her problems 
and those of thousands of other colonia residents living along 
the usmexico border 
and they warn that the longer the colonias go without running 
water the greater the threat to the health of the rest of the 
nation as people possibly carrying disease cross the border many 
of them migrant workers who travel around the united states 
what weve got is a third world part of which happens to be 
in the us said dr herbert ortega chief of the pan american 
health organizations el paso office 
consider 
el paso countys tuberculosis rate is a little less than twice 
the national average and 80 percent are traceable to a foreign 
country 
each day 12 million gallons of raw sewage flow into the 
tijuana river another 20 million and 22 million are dumped into 
the new river and rio grande respectively according to an 
american medical association report 
between 1980 and 1988 the population of ciudad juarez across 
the border from el paso rose from 714000 to 125 million 
officials estimate anywhere from 83 million to 400 million border 
crossings each year 
twentyfive to 50 percent of border residents are living in 
poverty 
despite these grim statistics health officials physicians and 
some politicians have been unable to turn the attention of congress 
to the border and change the living conditions of mrs guillen and 
other residents 
the guillens have lived for 15 years in a trailer home in a 
subdivision east of el paso they had owned a home in el paso but 
sold it when they moved to california when they returned they 
discovered they could buy a lot of land for less than it would cost 
them to rent a home they were promised sewer and water hookups 
would arrive soon 
it has been a long time 15 years we have been waiting for 
water she said on the stove a rusting metal bucket holds water 
for cooking washing dishes and bathing 
sometimes the family can get water from neighbors a block away 
with running water but when they run out at odd hours they must 
use a backyard pump 
mrs guillen fondly recalls when the family lived in el paso 
when my kids were very small they would get full of dirt and 
i was used to letting my kids play letting them get dirty and then 
bathing them but not here at times i dont even have water 
from the pump and the pipes get clogged up we get very tense 
because there is not even water to fill the tub you can imagine 
with a big family and no water for the bathtub what do we do we 
have to put up with it 
sometimes her husband cleans the pipes to the backyard pump and 
ends up covered with sand mrs guillen said we take a bath with 
sand there are a lot of people who take a bath with sand 
last year three of her children got hepatitis problems with 
water can cause people to have big infectious sores that erupt 
inside your skin two of my daughters had that same infection 
years back 
one daughters foot was so infected it swelled the girl spent a 
summer with an aunt in el paso and believe it or not her sores 
got better because she was taking a bath with city water 
mrs guillen speaks reverently of the city water it is clean 
your body feels clean but with the water she must use im not 
sure if i smell good because that water smells bad 
health officials hope a recent conference sponsored by the texas 
medical association and the recent meeting between president bush 
and mexican president carlos salinas de gotari will bring some 
remedy to border living conditions 
i dont know ultimately what will come of it but there is 
greater awareness more interest more action the texas medical 
association the american medical association are pushing the 
administration to respond said dr robert bernstein texas 
health commissioner 
health officials would most like to see a joint usmexico 
commission formed and given consistent funding to coordinate the 
work of many independent groups trying to alleviate the border 
conditions 
texas voters will be asked nov 7 to approve a 500 million 
water bond package which includes 100 million that could be used 
for subsidized loans and grants to provide water and sewage systems 
to colonias the bonds would be guranteed by local governments 
water districts or water supply corporations 
but even if the money is approved comptroller bob bullock has 
said 100 million would not be enough to upgrade conditions in all 
the states colonias 
others see a solution through more involvement by the 
maquiladora twinplant industries these foreignowned 
manufacturing centers along the border flourish with cheap mexican 
labor and have drawn millions to the border overwhelming municipal 
infrastructures 
about 90 percent of the 1400 maquiladoras in operation are 
situated on the usmexico border with 500 plants along the 
texasmexico border juarez alone has 249 according to the pan 
american health organization 
some of these maquila plants throw their wastes directly into 
the sewage disposal system paho reported in a recent newsletter 
other maquilas sell tanks with toxic residues to questionable 
recycling companies 
it has been found that these companies dispel these toxic 
tanks into the first dumping site found the tank ends up sold to a 
third party who may use it to store water for their personal 
hygiene andor to cook or drink 
meanwhile mrs guillen hopes to have running water by december 
thats what shes been told

scientists believe a new generation of crops 
with strange names like guayule kenaf and jojoba may provide 
homegrown rubber for tires newsprint for daily papers and 
lubricants for machines 
they also could provide thinners for paint thickeners for 
ketchup moisturizers for cosmetics and income for us farmers 
this is the beginning of a whole new revolution in 
agriculture said himayat naqvi president of the association for 
the advancement of industrial crops it will give farmers 
something different to grow it will help our trade balance reduce 
our dependence on foreign oil and improve our environment 
scientists farmers and government officials met in peoria 
earlier this month to discuss crops like vernonia cuphea and 
lesquerella chemicals from such plants can be refined to replace 
compounds derived from imported oil or from plants raised only in 
other nations 
however there are few acres of these industrial crops in the 
united states and the government spends relatively little to 
develop them said naqvi a plant breeder at the university of 
california at riverside 
the association the peoria meeting was its first hopes 
congress will appropriate funds for research so farmers will feel 
safe growing the crops 
for example rubber can be extracted from the wildgrowing 
southwestern shrub guayule and its quality is as good as the best 
foreign rubber a pilot processing plant will be built in arizona 
said naqvi but improvements must be made in guayule yields for 
commercial production to be economical 
another promising crop is jojoba a desertgrown perennial that 
produces large brown beans containing a unique oil it already is 
used by the cosmetics industry but could be an excellent lubricant 
because it withstands temperature and friction but researchers 
need to develop better ways to grow and harvest it and control 
pests said carole whittaker president of hyder jojoba inc of 
phoenix which has 1300 acres of jojoba in a remote desert area of 
arizona 
jojoba is a high value crop that can be grown on marginal land 
with far less water than crops like citrus and cotton she said 
it would be ideal for a state like arizona where water is a 
prized commodity 
commercialization for some industrial crops could be 10 to 20 
years away but naqvi said the first big success story likely will 
be kenaf these tall fibrous annuals could be a raw material 
source for paper and cardboard 
the nations first kenaf milling plant is expected to open in 
1991 in mcallen texas to supply newsprint to the newspaper 
industry 
the new crops will provide alternatives for farmers who have 
gotten into serious economic trouble by producing surpluses of 
lowvalue feed grains naqvi said if one crop is not working we

agriculture who thought kenaf could fit into the states diverse 
agriculture we dont want to wait 20 or 30 years we need a 
product that will convince farmers and investors that these things 
are going to happen

forty years after nuclear wastes were 
first dumped into the soil of the hanford nuclear reservation the 
government is starting to look at just whats brewing under the 
surface 
the ambitious new molecular science research centeris a symbol 
of the us department of energys committment to cleaning up after 
production of nuclear weapons at 17 plants around the country said 
michael knotek who left the brookhaven national laboratory to 
become the centers manager 
the total cost of the cleanup has been estimated at 90 billion 
to 150 billion the country cant afford that said knotek 
noting that one major mission will be to find technology to reduce 
those costs weve got to find a permanent solution one we can 
afford and everybody will be happy with 
when it is completed it will be the only us facility 
dedicated to molecular science research the study of molecules and 
how they combine to form structures such work is currently 
distributed across the country and the only comparable facility is 
in okazaki japan knotek said 
the msrc takes molecular research out of a closed setting like a 
university and into the front line said steven colson who was 
hired from yale university to be an associate director were 
here on top of a major environmental problem you dont find that 
at a university 
the center is expected to focus on problems of cleaning up the 
hanford site since 1943 hanford has produced much of the 
plutonium for the nations nuclear arsenal its the energy 
departments most polluted site with more than half of the nations 
defense wastes much of that waste in the past was dumped directly 
into the soil 
what it has been doing underground is not known said don 
friedrich who is using lasers to study the reactions of chemicals 
that exist underground wastes that could be relatively benign 
alone can combine with others or with elements in the soil to 
become very dangerous on the other hand the danger from some 
wastes could be reduced by molecular conversion occurring 
underground 
the laser research is designed to give a sort of underground 
weather map of the hanford site he said it will help scientists 
predict how the wastes are changing in which direction they are 
traveling and how fast 
friedrich is one of about 10 researchers and staff already 
working at the center which is operating on a 6 million 1990 
budget and has headquarters at the pacific northwest laboratory run 
by battelle when a 135 million building is completed by the 
mid1990s it will have 200 fulltime staffers plus 30 to 50 
visiting scientists and an annual budget of 40 million 
that is a drop in the bucket compared to the 385 million annual 
budget and 6300 jobs tied to the production of plutonium for 
weapons at hanford in recent years plutonium production has 
already been sharply curtailed and is expected to be phased out 
completely by the mid1990s 
washington state politicians especially those opposed to 
nuclear production at hanford have repeatedly argued that waste 
cleanup represents the best economic future for the site and the 
adjacent tricities 
the msrc and a companion environmental center of excellence 
which will fieldtest different cleanup proposals are the 
cornerstone of a plan to turn hanford into the nations leading 
nuclear cleanup research center 
but it is extremely unlikely the waste research can ever provide 
the level of jobs that defense production did knotek said 
hanford is a good choice for the msrc because it is next to the 
bulk of the nations defense wastes where we will never be able 
to forget it and because of the northwests strong environmental 
interest he said 
knotek considers environmental cleanup a more pressing goal than 
the space race set off in the 1950s by the soviet sputnik launch 
sputnik was an implied threat to national security while nuclear 
waste is a real physical problem 
that should lead to an increase in federal funding for 
environmental science research with a corresponding increase in 
jobs for researchers he said research follows needs its as 
simple as that

wildlife officials plan to split the worlds 
only captive colony of whooping cranes in november to reduce the 
chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural disaster 
the us fish and wildlife service said 22 of the 54 birds at 
the patuxent wildlife research center would be shipped to the 
international crane foundation in baraboo wis whooping cranes are 
an endangered species 
the service has been concerned about having all of their eggs 
in one basket literally said david trauger the centers deputy 
director the service felt it was the prudent thing to do to 
separate the breeding flocks and theres enough breeders now to do 
that 
the center started in 1987 to breed the birds known for their 
elaborate courtship dance under a joint program with canadian 
wildlife officials 
the foundation was selected as the home of the new flock after 
considering several groups around the nation although it has not 
bred whooping cranes it has successfully bred 13 of the 14 other 
crane species 
scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in 
captivity they will be able to establish another flock in the 
wild an attempt to do that failed in 1975 when a flock at the 
grays lake national wildlife refuge in idaho failed to produce 
enough eggs to sustain the colony

an african tick brought to the 
caribbean by accident poses a threat to floridas cattle sheep 
goat and whitetailed deer say state veterinary scientists who are 
trying to develop a vaccine 
the ticks can cause a skin condition or heartwater disease that 
can kill up to 90 percent of infected animals university of 
florida scientists say 
if the disease spreads to florida we probably would have to 
quarantine the whole state that would be devastating said dan 
childs vice chairman of the national cattlemens association 
animal health committee 
bont ticks which infest exotic animals such as rhinoceroses and 
ostriches a shipment of rhinoceroses arriving in texas five years 
ago carried them and the us department of agriculture issued a 
warning in june after african ticks were found on shipments of 
imported ostriches sent to several us cities 
if nothing is done to control the tick in the caribbean its 
only a matter of time before birds or imported animals carry it to 
cuba jamaica trinidad and the united states said michael 
burridge head of the universitys center for tropical animal 
health and its department of infectious diseases 
the ticks can carry a rickettsial bacteria that causes 
heartwater disease which is no threat to humans but causes high 
fever and nervous system disorders in animals animals often suffer 
swelling of the lungs called pulmonary edema and 
hydropericardium or water around the heart 
florida is one of the top 10 cattleproducing states said 
childs 
a team in zimbabwean has produced a laboratory technique to grow 
large quantities of the rickettsial bacteria in culture but 
diagnostic field tests are thought to be some three years away 
burridge said 
and a heartwater vaccine would not protect animals from the 
associated fatal skin ailment acute bovine dermatophilosis which 
causes sections of the animals hide to slough off although rare 
the skin disease can affect humans 
its a horrible disease and we found that for some 
reason it occurs only in the areas where there are tropical bont 
ticks burridge said 
if these ticks should spread to the united states were in 
big trouble because the organism that causes the skin disease is in 
the soil here already just waiting for this tick to arrive he 
said

in times of famine a watery broth with a few 
vegetables held off death in mansion dining rooms a perfectly 
clear consomme shows the epitome of elegance for centuries people 
have counted on soup 
people like soup because it not only tastes good but they feel 
that they are doing something good for themselves said lee 
bailey author of the cookbook soup meals it gives you all 
the feelings of security that we seem to need more as time goes 
by 
although soups are made yearround harvests seem to bring them 
more to mind the vegetables available enable the home cook to try 
all sorts of combinations 
cabbage and broccoli are very strong you have to be careful 
when you use them with other things they combine well with 
potatoes but they can overwhelm other things bailey said you 
can otherwise combine anything that suits your fancy 
soups have several advantages in most kitchens an inventive 
cook can find ingredients for a serviceable soup soup can be made 
ahead and most soups can be frozen 
if using canned stock taste the soup before adding salt the 
flavor of canned stock can be substantially improved by letting it 
simmer for a half hour or so with chopped carrots onions and 
celery before it is used 
for cream soups pureed vegetables or rice can substitute for 
cream

the recent stock market turmoil has provided a 
grim backdrop for the second anniversary today of black monday 
oct 19 1987 when the dow jones average plunged a record 508 
points 
after the fridaythe13th selloff last week that drove the dow 
down 190 points it looked as if stocks were heading for something 
similar to the crash of two years ago 
but the market has settled down this week gradually allaying 
those fears in wednesdays trading the dow jones average of 30 
big industrial stocks rose 492 to 264365 bringing its net gain 
over the past three days to 7439 points 
however if that steady showing came as a relief it did not 
necessarily provide much reassurance for anyone who follows the ups 
and downs of stock prices 
indeed the image of wall street as a sort of upscale gambling 
den once again has been reinforced in many minds by the latest 
gyrations to individual investors who have been withdrawing more 
money than they put into direct stock holdings for two decades now 
stocks are widely seen as too risky and too volatile 
while nobody disputes that risk and volatility are facts of life 
in stock investing longtime students of the markets say those two 
perils are often viewed in a distorted light 
volatility the tendency of stock prices to rise and fall 
dramatically in short periods of time has drawn more and more 
attention in recent years with advances in technology and the 
concentration of large amounts of capital in the hands of 
professional traders and money managers 
with instant communications and computers programmed to execute 
buy and sell orders the market now can react within moments to 
changing news developments that might once have taken weeks to 
absorb 
but the importance of shortterm changes in stock prices 
diminishes drastically if one examines what has happened in the 
market in the postworld war ii era 
since the late 1970s stocks have suffered four separate 
october massacres yet this month also brings another happier 
anniversary notes norman fosback editor of the investment 
advisory letter market logic 
fifteen years ago amidst the turmoil of watergate disclosures 
and the gloom of a deep recession the current bull market was 
born he states 
from its low of 57760 in late 1974 through its recent highs 
near 2800 the dow jones industrial average nearly quintupled and 
other broader measures of stock price trends recorded even greater 
gains 
results like these were achieved during a time of economic 
growth erratic though it may have been from year to year they by 
no means preclude the possibility of a longterm decline in stock 
prices should the economy languish for an extended period 
but they do buttress the case that the impact of shortterm 
volatility can be substantially cushioned by the passage of time 
when people set about choosing individual stocks to buy they 
face a second hazard sometimes referred to as company risk 
that is familiar to people for example who might have bought 
shares of a respected blue chip like us steel for an effective 
price of 68 in the 1960s and seen the stock wither to about half 
that value today under its present name usx corp 
even before yu factor in inflation thats a lot of damage for a 
small investor to suffer 
the standard strategy for dealing with company risk is to 
diversify spreading investment money over stocks of several 
companies in dissimilar businesses or buying shares of two or 
three mutual funds that way a single big loser poses a much 
smaller risk of wiping you out

the bush administration will quit buying 
mexican oil for the us emergency stockpile early next year 
ending an eightyear supply link aimed in part at aiding the 
debtridden mexican economy sources said 
the administration and the mexican state oil company pemex 
agreed that an existing supply contract expiring nov 30 will not 
be renewed said an energy department source who spoke on condition 
he not be identified 
additional mexican oil will be purchased for three months beyond 
the contracts expiration in order to satisfy a minimum volume 
requirement the source said wednesday 
the arrangement is to be announced next month according to an 
internal energy department memorandum made available to the 
associated press 
starting in december the energy department will meet its 
stockpile needs by soliciting bids for shortterm supply deals with 
domestic and foreign suppliers the usual practice before the 
mexican contracts started in 1981 
in august 1982 at the height of mexicos foreign debt crisis 
the reagan administration agreed to pay mexico 1 billion in 
advance for oil to be put in the strategic petroleum reserve 
the decision to end contract purchases from mexico is due in 
part to a growing constraint on mexicos capability to produce 
enough highquality isthmus crude to meet both export and domestic 
demand the source said 
the reserve was started in 1975 after the arab oil embargo and 
is designed to give the united states enough emergency supplies to 
weather any future disruption of oil imports the oil about 575 
million barrels is stored in underground salt domes in texas and 
louisiana nearly half has come from mexico and only 6 percent from 
us wells 
on tuesday the department gave congress an interim report that 
suggested ways to cut costs of filling the reserve including 
leasing oil from foreign producers and selling us government 
bonds to finance the reserve 
an energy department delegation is to fly to the middle east 
early next month to discuss the leasing idea and other topics with 
saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates a department 
source said

early indications were that californias 
strong economy would shake off the effects of the devastating 
earthquake in the san francisco bay area

standard amp poors corp which evaluates the safety of bond 
issues and other financial instruments said it expected the credit 
impact to be localized and it said it did not expect to adjust its 
ratings of the financial obligations of major west coast financial 
institutions 
john sullivan the undersecretary of the state department of 
business transportation and housing said wednesday he stayed up 
all night assessing the situation but that it was still too early 
to set a damage figure 
however he said overall the impact will be one the state 
will recover from very quickly 
we have a large strong economy and while the personal 
tragedy for many families is great the overall economic picture 
for the bay area and the rest of the state is unclouded by this

those who follow the insurance industry 
see opportunities for investors in the wake of the san francisco 
earthquake 
analysts predicted insurers will be able to reverse three years 
of declining rates in california by increasing pressure on state 
regulators to boost premiums as a result of the earthquake and the 
estimated 4 billion in damage from hurricane hugo in south 
carolina 
an increase in insurance rates could translate into greater 
profitability in the long term which in turn would boost the value 
of stocks the analysts said wednesday 
theres a perception that this could turn the cycle that 
this could be enough to firm pricing said gloria l vogel an 
analyst with bear stearns amp co inc in new york 
insurance companies struggled wednesday to assess the amount of 
claims theyre likely to pay as a result of the quake in addition 
to home damage the insurance companies are likely to face claims 
for automobile damage broken glass theft and burglary business 
interruption due to electrical outages water damage and possibly 
workers compensation 
some estimated that damages will reach 1 billion or more but 
industry observers said they dont expect any company to be 
seriously hurt by claims arising from the quake 
we dont think any company is going to have problems paying 
claims said elisa siegal public affairs manager for the 
american insurance association a washingtonbased trade group 
easing the burden on insurers is the fact that most homeowners 
in the san francisco area dont have earthquake insurance on their 
houses 
the association of california insurance cos in sacramento said 
that in the san francisco area 25 to 30 percent of the homes have 
earthquake insurance the organization estimated residential damage 
at 500 million in the bay area with 100 million to 150 million 
of that insured 
statewide in california only 15 to 20 percent of all homeowners 
have earthquake insurance which typically requires a 10 percent 
deductible and costs 200 to 400 a year for a 100000 home 
according to industry spokesmen 
insured homeowners without earthquake protection will have to 
pay for repairs to their houses themselves unless their homes are 
ravaged by fire fire damage is covered under basic homeowner 
insurance polices said hugh strawn director of catastrophe 
services at the property loss research bureau in schaumburg ill 
if there was fire damage the fire is covered thats quite 
specific strawn said 
earthquake insurance is an emotional and politicallycharged 
issue in california where many of the nations most damaging 
earthquakes have occurred 
under a 1985 california law insurers are required to offer 
earthquake insurance to homebuyers but homebuyers are not required 
to buy the coverage 
insurers arent required to offer earthquake insurance to 
commercial property owners but the percentage of business property 
with the coverage is higher than that of homeowners industry 
spokesmen said they estimated that at least 25 percent and 
probably many more business properties are insured 
because of its high costs earthquake insurance has become a 
target of the controversial proposition 103 approved by california 
voters last year the proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback 
in insurance rates insurers and state regulators are battling over 
the rates and how theyre set

thereve been popup ads scented ads even a 
magazine spread that played christmas music but this week texas 
instruments inc has taken it a step further with a magazine ad 
that talks to readers 
i am the talking chip one of many texas instruments megachip 
technologies that are changing the way the world lives works and 
plays says the voice generated by a miniscule computer chip that 
costs less than 2 to produce 
this ad demonstrates a new tool for creative people to deliver 
powerful messages in an arresting way said bill edwards who 
supervised the project for the dallas office of the mccannerickson 
advertising agency 
who can ignore a printed page in business week that talks to 
you he said the effect is truly startling 
the ad will run in 140000 copies of business weeks oct 20 
industrialtechnology edition and 76000 copies of its nov 20 
international editions 
the ad also features a tearaway section allowing a look at the 
creditcardsized eighthinch thick gadget that contains three 
batteries with enough juice for 650 repetitions a microprocessor 
that performs 61 chores and generates the voice and a oneinch 
speaker 
the chip represents the latest advance in speech synthesis 
semiconductors said tis ken melvin product manager for 
semiconductor speech 
for years highquality speech has been a luxury that 
manufactures added only to consumer products with price points of 
50 75 100 or more melvin said our goal has been to 
reduce the cost of speech technology to make it practical in more 
applications 
ti hopes the advertisement will demonstrate not only marketing 
possibilities but spark ideas for other uses of the silicon wafer 
reducing the chip cost to under 2 allows products using the 
technology to sell at retail for about 10 melvin said 
one possible use for the chip is the creation of talking 
products for the visually handicapped which would contain verbal 
warnings or statements about their use 
magazine advertisers in recent years gone to extraordinary 
lengths to make their messages stand out 
transamerica for instance devised an ad that ran in time 
magazine in 1986 that featured a popup of a facsimile of its 
distinctive san francisco tower dodge trucks had a similar popup 
ad for its midsize pickup truck in a 1987 issue of sports 
illustrated 
also in 1987 the importers of absolut vodka introduced sound to 
massmarket magazine advertising by including a batterypowered 
microchip that played christmas music when its ad in the new yorker 
magazine was opened absoluts most recent ad features a punchout 
paper bottle of its vodka that produces a 3d image when the reader 
looks through two eye holes in it 
ti began using speech technology in 1974 and in 1978 introduced 
its popular speak and spell line of educational toys in the 
meantime all sorts of products have begun to talk books cars 
alarm clocks toys learning aids and appliances 
ti also uses its speech knowhow in many of its military 
projects 
texas instruments ad was developed with intervisual 
communications and mccannerickson

amr corp has broken its silence imposed since 
donald trump made his sinceaborted 75 billion takeover offer 
calling the bid for the parent of american airlines 
illconsidered and reckless 
the new york billionaire retorted wednesday that the boards 
statement was strident and pompously selfserving and accusing 
amr management of smugness in it attitude toward stockholders 
after a meeting wednesday the amr board issued a statement 
saying we are pleased that mr donald trump has withdrawn his 
uninvited proposal to negotiate a cash merger agreement with amr 
amr has not been and is not for sale 
the statement was the first of substance from the fort 
worthbased company since it received trumps offer oct 4 
amr has been operating pursuant to a highly successful 
longterm plan designed to create growth and value the statement 
said we see absolutely no basis for departing from that strategy 
and believe that the imposition of a highly leveraged capital 
structure would have very unfavorable effects 
the board took no other action stemming from trumps offer said 
spokesman john hotard 
some industry analysts had speculated the board might erect 
stronger takeover defenses such as taking advantage of lower stock 
prices to create an employee stock ownership plan that would place 
a big block of shares in presumably friendly hands making a 
hostile takeover nearly impossible 
amrs reference to its successful longterm plan is 
particularly ironic on a day that amr reported a significant 
decline in net income and has warned its shareholders of a 
disappointing fourth quarter to come trump said in new york 
amrs smugness about its marketplace perception ought perhaps 
to give way to a concern for its shareholders he said to 
date amr has yet to pay any dividend 
amr stock rose 75 cents to close at 74 a share wednesday in 
heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
trump withdrew his bid monday because of the tumble in amrs 
stock price during and after the markets friday the 13th selloff 
the selloff was sparked by troubles in financing a 675 billion 
managementemployee buyout of ual corp parent of united airlines 
amr stock had hit 107 immediately after trumps offer but fell to 
the mid70s in the market plunge 
trump said he would consider other options including selling 
his amr shares or making a lower offer however analysts doubt he 
can return with a bid below the 120 a share he already offered 
financing questions dogged trumps proposal and analysts 
questioned how he would raise enough money in the unsettled credit 
markets beyond the 1 billion in equity he promised to put up 
himself 
amr had focused on the debt in its initial vague response to 
the flashy tycoons proposal for the nations largest airline and 
chairman robert l crandall repeated that concern wednesday 
imposing extraordinary levels of debt on an airline 
particularly without the active cooperation of both management and 
employees will not serve the longterm interests of anyone 
crandall said 
the public will be disadvantaged if excessive financing 
reduces an airlines ability to seize new opportunities to 
promptly replace old airplanes to be responsive to environmental 
desires for quieter airplanes to produce adequate passenger and 
freight facilities to finance stateoftheart maintenance and 
pilot training facilities crandall said 
amr said its profit in the three months ended sept 30 fell to 
137 million or 216 per share from 1503 million or 250 a 
share in the same period last year revenue rose to 273 billion 
from 233 billion last year 
crandall blamed the results on a slight decrease in yield and a 
more than 11 percent increase in fuel prices from a year earlier 
and said amr expected those trends to continue in the fourth 
quarter 
this unhappy outlook underscores the continuing volatility 
of airline earnings and the importance of an adequate capital 
base he said 
crandall told analysts last month that profits through next year 
would be squeezed by the gradual recovery of eastern airlines from 
a crippling strike higher labor costs expansion of service and 
purchase of new aircraft 
crandall said the airline had 216 percent of the domestic 
market during the quarter 
for the first nine months amrs earnings rose 155 percent to 
4159 million or 659 per share from 3601 million or 599 
per share a year earlier revenue in the ninemonth period rose to 
789 billion from 646 billion

a former top federal prosecutor says the 
crippling fines and forfeiture provisions of the federal 
racketeering law should be turned on those accused of fraud in the 
savings and loan scandals 
and the man who helped craft the controversial racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act agrees 
at a conference discussing the future of rico joseph digenova 
former us attorney for the district of columbia said the law was 
perfect for what went on in the savings and loan industry 
congress has enacted a 50 billion bailout plan for the nations 
faltering savings and loans many of which failed because of fraud 
mismanagement and the economic downturn in the southwest 
in april the government seized a large california thrift 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine and filed a 11 
billion civil lawsuit against its operators charging fraud and 
racketeering 
james barth chief economist at the office of thrift 
supervision attributed approximately one in 10 failures to fraud 
it seems to me that knowing what we know about rico and 
knowing what we know about the sampl crisis that congress could not 
have enacted a better statute to deal with what went on in the 
savings and loan industry over the last few years said digenova 
now in private practice 
that notion was seconded by g robert blakey a university of 
notre dame professor who was one of the architects of the rico 
statute nearly 20 years ago 
its not a single instance of fraud but it would be a pattern 
of frauds multiple bad loans of one kind and another insiders 
dealing with outsiders that falls within the core meaning of rico 
mail fraud and wire fraud 
their remarks came at a conference rico rights and the 
constitution sponsored by the cato institute a washingtonbased 
think tank 
passed by congress in 1970 as part of the organized crime 
control act rico was designed to make it easier for prosecutors to 
go after mobsters by giving them a tool to attack seemingly 
legitimate businesses associated with organized crime 
prosecutors can take seemingly unrelated crimes or alleged 
crimes committed by several people over a 10yearperiod and if 
they can convince a jury that those charged were linked through a 
criminal enterprise they can win a racketeering conviction 
those convicted are subject to maximum penalties of 20 years in 
prison hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and forfeiture of 
illegal profits into the millions if the government can collect 
in civil rico cases brought either by the government or private 
parties defendants are liable to pay triple damages if found to 
have engaged in a racketeering enterprise 
though tremendously successful in the justice departments 
attack on the mafia rico has become increasingly controversial as 
prosecutors used it on crooked politicians and businessmen in cases 
that critics say might not have been brought under other laws 
but in reply to that argument digenova countered no one 
seems to have a problem with applying rico to the colombo 
organized crime family or the genovese organized crime family 
or anyone of a number of families whose names end in vowels the do 
have a problem apparently applying rico to people whose names 
dont end in vowels and run what are called legitimate businesses 
but who happen to engage in massive fraud

a devastating earthquake in california failed to move the us 
oil futures market despite reports of major pipeline shutdowns 
late wednesday inspectors examined gasoline pipelines in 
northern california for possible leaks or ruptures while major oil 
companies made contingency plans to avoid supply disruptions 
officials said the pipelines were closed as a precaution 
following tuesdays earthquake 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude fell 19 cents to 
finish at 2056 cents a barrel after a brief earthquakerelated 
rally at the opening 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for november delivery closed at 
5458 cents a gallon down 126 cents from tuesday and november 
heating oil dipped 045 cent to settle at 6060 cents a gallon 
energy brokers said weekly inventory statistics that showed a 
57millionbarrel rise in crude oil last week helped weaken the 
market once earthquake news was absorbed 
pipeline owners in northern california including chevron corp 
santa fe pacific pipeline partners and shell co said hundreds of 
miles of underground gasoline pipes were closed tuesday when the 
quake hit 
no damage was detected as of late wednesday and the pipelines 
were expected to resume normal operations they said 
we know of no line ruptures or seam leaks said john abboud 
senior vice president for santa fe pacific which has 800 miles of 
pipeline stretching from san francisco to reno nev we will do 
some lowpressure testing and once were satisfied that the lines 
are in good shape we will start the system back up 
the pipelines deliver gasoline diesel and jet fuel from 
richmond calif refineries to big terminals products are then 
trucked to service stations 
chevron corp and exxon corp both reported minor damage to 
refineries 
chevron spokesman hal holt said the quake jolted chevrons 
315000 barreladay richmond facility but the plant resumed normal 
operations early in the day exxon said it slowed operations 
slightly at its 135000barreladay benicia calif refinery 
spokesman henry beathard said the company did not know when normal 
refinery operations would resume 
several companies said they were making contingency plans to 
ensure delivery of products by truck in case pipelines remained 
closed 
theoretically we could bring product up from los angeles or 
bakersfield if necessary said albert greenstein spokesman for 
atlantic richfield co 
companies also said they were inspecting underground storage 
tanks at service stations and establishing alternate delivery 
routes to avoid damaged roadways 
texaco inc said its richmond terminal sustained minor damage 
but would not disrupt deliveries 
unocal corp said between 12000 and 15000 barrels of gasoline 
leaked from three storage tanks at its richmond terminal but the 
spill was contained

ual corps stock price appears to have 
stabilized but dealmakers trying to salvage a proposed buyout of 
the parent of united airlines may have trouble courting one 
prospective investor british airways plc 
derek stevens british airways chief financial officer said 
his company was in no way committed to a deal going through at 
all 
stevens in an interview with dow jones news service also said 
his company might reduce its planned equity investment of 750 
million if a new ual buyout deal is put together 
a buyout offer of 230 a share would be certainly not too 
low stevens said 
meanwhile uals stock closed at 19175 wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange down a comparatively small 625 following a 
twoday drop of 8162 at the beginning of the week 
the worst of the selloff appears to be over at this point 
said stephen dexter an airline industry analyst with kemper 
financial services inc who predicted speculators would watch the 
market until concrete terms of a new bid are announced 
citibank and chase manhattan bank said wednesday they were 
continuing to court japanese lenders who balked at the original 
deal with a sweeter offer a citicorp spokesman in tokyo has said 
the new offer was worth 250 a share or 562 billion 
the group trying acquire the nations secondlargest air carrier 
said friday it could not get banks to finance its 675 billion 
300ashare offer 
that announcement from the group made up of united pilots ual 
management and british airways plc helped spark a stock market 
plunge and the biggest oneday decline in the dow jones industrial 
average since the crash of 1987 the widelyfollowed index tumbled 
190 points friday 
a british airways spokesman in new york john lampl said he 
could not comment on how long it would take to reconstruct a 
revised formal proposal spokesmen for the pilots union could not 
be reached wednesday 
billionaire investor marvin davis said he remained interested in 
acquiring ual but not at the 300ashare level he previously 
offered davis started the buyout fight for ual when he submitted a 
bid in august 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers which represents nearly 25000 of uniteds 70000 workers 
vehemently opposed the pilotmanagement groups original bid 
it contended the plan would put the airline into too much debt 
and that the 10 percent steady revenuegrowth projections on which 
the deal was based were unrealistic 
on tuesday the machinists called for the resignation of ual 
chairman stephen m wolf and asked for a federal investigation into 
possible violations of securities laws by ual and davis 
its very very important especially from the japanese 
viewpoint that there is some semblance of labor harmony dexter 
said of the machinist actions 
but even with the machinists continued opposition japanese 
backers could agree to finance a less risky bid of under 250 a 
share he said 
machinists spokesman jim conley said the union was not looking 
for credit for quashing the original proposal but was happy to 
accept it 
had we gone along with it i think it probably would have 
flown but that would have been irresponsible on our part conley 
said 
it was really an issue of job security he said when the 
deal starts going sour they dont go back to the banks to 
renegotiate the financing the first thing they do is lop heads

bat industries plcs shareholders as expected 
today approved a major defensive restructuring planned by the 
british conglomerate including the sale of all its us retailing 
operations 
bats plan is aimed at increasing shareholder value in an 
attempt to thwart a hostile allpaper 21 billion bid from an 
investor group led by sir james goldsmith 
the purchase would be the worlds second largest takeover behind 
the 25 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc completed earlier 
this year 
bat is the worlds biggest tobacco company and has substantial 
operations in retailing such as the saks fifth avenue and 
marshall field chains in the united states paper and financial 
services 
bats shareholders cast their vote at a special shareholders 
meeting held in london bat chairman patrick sheehy said more than 
99 percent of the votes favored the plan 
goldsmith previously said his bidding group hoylake investments 
ltd would vote in favor of the bat plan calling it a first 
step in the unbundling of the conglomerate which he has 
proposed 
goldsmith who wants to sell off all of bats nontobacco 
interests has said he intends to pursue a takeover of bat 
hoylakes offer of 1396 worth of securities for each bat share 
has been suspended while the bidders seek approval from us state 
insurance commissioners to change the ownership of bats farmers 
insurance group inc of los angeles that could take months 
hoylake held between 2 percent and 3 percent of bats shares at 
the last announced count 
bats shares were up the equivalent of 52 cents at 1255 on 
londons stock exchange after the voting results were announced 
the stock has been seesawing during the recent stock market turmoil 
and on concerns about what effect wednesdays disastrous northern 
california earthquake might have on farmers 
company spokesman michael prideaux said wednesday that the stock 
markets recent gyrations would not change bats restructuring 
plans which he characterized as longterm 
bat intends to sell off its us retailing interests and divest 
its paper companies and british retailing interests to existing bat 
shareholders it plans to retain its tobacco and financial services 
businesses 
bat also intends to buy back 10 percent of its stock and boost 
its dividend by 50 percent 
these moves are intended to enhance bats share value the 
companys critics have complained that bats share price has been 
depressed by the relative slow growth of its tobacco interests

announced a 19 percent gain in thirdquarter earnings and said it 
was sweetening its pension program to lure thousands of managers 
into early retirement 
while atampt is not aiming to eliminate a specified number of 
jobs spokesman burke stinson said it would not be unreasonable 
for 5000 to 15000 managers to take advantage of the plan 
atampt will double to 34000 the number of managers eligible to 
retire with immediate pension payments it also offered a special 
sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on dec 30 
atampt embarked on an aggressive costcutting program beginning in 
1984 the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup 
of the bell system 
since then the company has cut its payroll from 373000 to 
298000 this is the first program aimed only at managers 
the largest single job cut in the companys history came in late 
1986 when atampt eliminated 32000 jobs the company has relied on 
incentives when slashing employment but stinson noted that this is 
the first pension sweetener in atampt history 
we are in a topsyturvy marketplace and we need to have as 
many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few 
people in nonsales behindthescenes jobs as possible stinson 
said 
the retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth 
quarter but the amount cannot be determined until the number of 
participants is determined the company said the higher expenses 
would be offset by other items including a gain from a share 
exchange that ends its direct investment in ing c olivetti amp co 
spa 
atampt reported profits rose 19 percent to 699 million or 65 
cents a share in the quarter ended sept 30 from 587 million or 
55 cents a share a year ago revenue increased 1 percent to 89 
billion from 881 billion in the third quarter a year ago 
atampt chairman robert e allen said that while the company is 
pleased with the results we are keenly aware that we face stiff 
competition in all our markets 
he said atampt will continue to be aggressive in the marketing 
of our products and services and aggressive as well in continuing 
to drive costs out of every part of our business 
for the ninemonth period profit totaled 199 billion or 
185 a share up 19 percent from 167 billion or 156 a share 
a year ago revenue increased 3 percent to 2681 billion from 
2600 billion in the yearago period

the nations stock markets have shrugged off the 
deadly california earthquake and traders even found it created 
buying opportunities in certain stocks 
construction contractors and computer disasterrecovery services 
were among the companies that saw their stock prices jacked up 
wednesday by investors in search of quakerelated profits 
even some insurance stocks rose after analysts said the quake 
could stimulate insurers to raise rates and improve the industrys 
profitability 
by today the california quake was mostly forgotten on wall 
street as stocks rallied in response to a fresh piece of news an 
unexpected slowdown of inflation the labor department said today 
that consumer prices rose a modest 02 percent in september 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 2356 
points at 266721 at 11 am edt as advancing issues outnumbered 
declining ones by a 3to1 margin on the new york stock exchange 
on wednesday the first session after the california quake the 
dow jones average ended the day up 492 to 264365 in the calmest 
trading since last fridays 190point plunge the only 
quakerelated jitters came in the opening moments 
most companies with headquarters in san francisco and the nearby 
silicon valley were unscathed by the market even the phone and 
utility companies suffered only small declines on wall street as 
analysts concluded damage to them was less than feared the diablo 
canyon nuclear power plants of pacific gas amp electric co were 
reported to be unharmed 
one big gainer from the quake was kasler corp a road and 
bridge builder based in san bernardino calif whose stock rose 
almost 30 percent 
obviously one has to assume that the amount of construction 
work thats going to be necessary out there is enormous kasler is 
one of those that should see a good increase in business said 
richard rossi an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc 
he added i hate to use the word good in such a tragedy 
the earthquake cut power to the san francisco floor of the 
pacific stock exchange where some traders continued to work by 
candlelight but trading in stock options had to be suspended the 
securities and exchange commission late wednesday approved a plan 
to shift trading in those options temporarily to exchanges in new 
york philadelphia and chicago 
the biggest declines from the quake actually came overseas on 
the australian and new zealand markets which close before new york 
opens for business traders there sold partly out of fear that the 
quake might sink the us stock markets 
the bigger foreign markets reacted more calmly key indexes 
gained about 03 percent in tokyo and 16 percent in london where 
trading overlaps with the us trading day

new brunswick nj 
million or 17 cents a share the company said 
greer would not specify the percentage increase in overseas 
sales but he said foreign sales accounted for about 45 percent of 
total sales in the period 
for the first nine months net income increased 79 percent to 
952 million or 429 a share that compared with 882 million or 
388 a share in the same period last year sales for the first 
nine months increased 54 percent to 936 billion 3m said 
allen f jacobson chairman and chief executive officer said 
results for the quarter benefited from higher profits in the 
information and imaging technologies sector which makes 
videotapes diskettes and xray film 
he also said the company has just completed its seventh 
consecutive quarter of doubledigit volume gains abroad 
reflecting the slowing of us economic growth 3ms domestic 
unit volume increased only 3 percent over the same quarter last 
year jacobson said 
the sluggishness was most evident in 3ms industrial and 
electronic sector which makes tapes sandpaper and cleaning 
materials he said 
the company still expects higher fullyear sales and profits 
but earnings in the fourth quarter will continue to be affected by 
us economic slowing and negative currency effects jacobson said

consumer prices in september rose an 
unexpectedly modest 02 percent with most prices virtually 
unchanged except for a sharp rise in clothing costs the government 
said today 
energy prices which had climbed sharply at the wholesale level 
raising the expectation of an increase on the retail level fell 
for the fourth consecutive month in september the labor department 
said 
jittery stock and bond markets rallied on the news taking the 
favorable inflation number as a sign the federal reserve board has 
leeway to nudge interest rates lower at noon edt the dow jones 
industrial average was up 3135 points to 267500 
michael boskin chief economic adviser to president bush called 
the data good economic news he added were delighted to be 
able to say that while were always on guard to make sure that 
inflation remains under control the concern earlier in the year 
that inflation was getting out of control appears to have been 
unfounded 
also the report triggered an announcement that the nations 
389 million social security recipients will get a 47 percent 
benefit increase in january to offset the effects of inflation over 
the past year 
the costofliving increase is determined by comparing the 
consumer price index in the julyseptember quarter with the same 
period of last year 
the average recipient will see his or her benefits increased by 
25 a month to 566 
at the same time the cap on social security payroll taxes will 
rise workers will have to pay the tax on their first 50400 in 
wages up from 48000 
meanwhile in a separate report the department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation rose 03 
percent in september following a 07 percent decline in august 
average weekly earnings in september were 33867 up 35 
percent from a year earlier but when inflation is taken into 
account real weekly earnings were down 
consumer prices rose at a high annual rate of 67 percent for 
the first five months of the year driven up by rising gasoline 
prices 
however the index has risen only 02 percent or remained flat 
in each of the last four months bringing the annual rate down to 
44 percent for the first three quarters the same as the rate for 
all of 1988 and 1987 
this shows clearly that inflation is under control under 
these circumstances there is no question that interest rates will 
fall said economist william k macreynolds of the us chamber 
of commerce 
but economist robert dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
said the september report overstates the decline in inflation and 
warned of higher energy prices ahead 
there has been an abatment but it hasnt been to the degree 
this number would suggest were likely to have some less 
attractive numbers in the fourth quarter he said 
gasoline prices down 22 percent in september have declined 
93 percent in the past four months after increasing 212 percent 
in the first five months of the year 
fuel oil prices fell 02 percent last month after declining 09 
percent in august 
however analysts dont expect the trend to persist because 
crude oil prices have been rising 
food prices which were surging earlier in the year rose a 
moderate 02 percent last month in part because of a 11 percent 
decline for fruits and vegetables 
food and beverage prices which shot up at a 93 percent annual 
rate through may from june to september climbed at only a 17 
percent rate 
also down last month were coffee 27 percent and fats and oils 
and nonalcoholic beverages 
however the index for dairy products jumped 14 percent the 
largest monthly increase since may 1980 
clothing prices after falling in the three previous months 
rose 17 percent in september apparel for women and girls 
reflecting the introduction of new fall and winter fashions were 
up 36 percent 
the various changes left the overall consumer price index at 
1250 in september meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods 
and services costing 100 in the 198284 base period would have 
cost 125 last month 
the social security benefit increase is based on a narrower 
index that reflects costs for urban wage earners and clerical 
workers that index was 1236 
in advance of the report most economists were expecting an 
inflation figure approximately double the 02 percent reported in 
september 
the more modest rise may provide room for the federal reserve 
board to reduce interest rates the central bank has been fighting 
inflation by trying to slow the economy with higher interest rates 
in response to the stock market gyrations the central bank this 
week has allowed the interest rate for overnight loans between 
banks to decline about onequarter percentage point to 875 percent 
with todays inflation number most analysts now believe the fed 
will allow the rate to fall further or at least refrain from 
pushing it back up once market turmoil has subsided 
in another report emphasizing the economys softness the labor 
department said new state unemployment claims for the week ending 
oct 7 increased 62000 from the previous week to 396000

american telephone amp telegraph co on thursday 
announced a 19 percent gain in thirdquarter earnings and announced 
incentives that could lead 5000 to 15000 managers to take early 
retirement 
meanwhile philadelphiabased bell atlantic corp reported a 65 
percent quarterly profit increase and denverbased u s west inc 
said its profit fell 89 percent 
while atampt said it is not aiming to eliminate a specified number 
of jobs spokesman burke stinson said it would not be 
unreasonable for 5000 to 15000 managers to take advantage of the 
plan 
analysts praised atampts costcutting step saying the company 
has too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computers 
and network equipment 
theyre doing exactly what i think they need to do said lap 
lee a salomon brothers inc analyst 
atampt will double to 34000 the number of managers eligible to 
retire with immediate pension payments it is also offering a 
special sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire on 
dec 30 
atampt embarked on an aggressive costcutting program beginning in 
1984 the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakup 
of the bell system 
since then the company has cut its payroll from 373000 to 
298000 this is the first program aimed only at managers 
the largest single job cut in the companys history came in late 
1986 when atampt eliminated 32000 jobs the company has relied on 
incentives when slashing employment but stinson noted that this is 
the first pension sweetener in atampt history 
we are in a topsyturvy marketplace and we need to have as 
many people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as few 
people in nonsales behindthescenes jobs as possible stinson 
said 
the retirement option will increase expenses in the fourth 
quarter but the amount cannot be determined until the number of 
participants is determined the company said the higher expenses 
would be offset by other items including a gain from a share 
exchange that ends its direct investment in ing c olivetti amp co 
spa 
atampt reported profits rose 19 percent to 699 million or 65 
cents a share in the quarter ended sept 30 from 587 million or 
55 cents a share a year ago revenue increased 1 percent to 89 
billion from 881 billion in the third quarter a year ago

185 a share up 19 percent from 167 billion or 156 a share 
a year ago revenue increased 3 percent to 2681 billion from 
2600 billion in the yearago period 
atampt chairman robert e allen said that while the company is 
pleased with the results we are keenly aware that we face stiff 
competition in all our markets 
he said atampt will continue to be aggressive in the marketing 
of our products and services and aggressive as well in continuing 
to drive costs out of every part of our business 
bell atlantic and u s west two of the companies carved out of 
atampt in the 1984 breakup reported differing results bell atlantic 
attributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage 
while u s west said its profit dip was the result of special 
factors that masked modest earnings growth 
bell atlantic said its profit rose to 3632 million or 182 a 
share from 341 million or 102 a share a year earlier revenue 
rose to 291 billion from 276 billion 
for the first nine months bell atlantic said profit rose to 
107 billion or 543 a share from 101 billion or 512 a 
share a year earlier revenue rose to 856 billion from 769 
billion 
u s west said profit fell to 2581 million or 139 a share 
from 2832 million or 155 a share a year earlier revenue fell 
to 232 billion from 243 billion 
nevertheless were not satisfied with these results the 
major negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatory 
activity over the past two years on our telephone operations 
said jack mcallister u s wests chairman and chief executive 
for the year to date u s west said earnings fell to 7663 
million or 417 a share from 860 million or 468 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose to 715 billion from 687 billion a

bat industries plc shareholders overwhelmingly 
approved a major restructuring thursday that includes the sale of 
the conglomerates us retailing businesses and is aimed at 
thwarting a 21 billion hostile takeover 
among shares voting for the restructuring in which bat hopes to 
bolster its stock value by concentrating on its tobacco and 
financial interests were those controlled by the takeover group 
led by anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith 
bat also plans to buy back up to 10 percent of its outstanding 
stock or 153 million shares shortly after the midday vote at a 
special shareholders meeting announced it had bought 25 million 
shares at the equivalent of 1248 a share from the brokerage 
barclays de zoete wedd securities ltd 
bats shares rose the equivalent of 43 cents to 1252 a share 
thursday on londons stock exchange 
the goldsmith group hoylake investments ltd and its 
associates controlled between 2 percent and 3 percent of bats 
shares at the last announced count 
a spokesman for goldsmith who was not identified said by 
telephone we voted for it as we said we would 
the restructuring was favored by 99 percent of the shareholder 
votes cast said bat chairman patrick sheehy 
bat plans to retain its tobacco and financial services 
businesses and sell its us retailing interests which include 
saks fifth avenue and marshall field stores it also plans to spin 
off its paper companies and british retailing interests to existing 
bat shareholders and to boost its dividend by 50 percent 
bat said it would keep acquiring shares under its buyback plan 
subject to price availability and market conditions up to the 
close of business on friday after then bat may not buy more 
shares until it has released its thirdquarter results on nov 22 
we will proceed as speedily as possible and in light of market 
conditions sheehy told shareholders 
there was concern that the recent stock market turmoil following 
the friday the 13th plunge on wall street and the large number of 
us retailing properties on the block might make it difficult for 
bat to sell pieces at a good price and might delay the 
restructuring 
we are determined to get a good price for them sheehy said 
we are not in any hurry to sell them 
sheehy said bat already had intended to change its strategy of 
diversifying slowly away from tobacco and goldsmiths bid prompted 
a significant acceleration 
hoylake wants to sell off all bats nontobacco interests and 
says it will continue pursuing its bid despite the restructuring 
bats critics have complained the relative slow growth of the 
tobacco businesses has depressed the market value of bats shares 
but sheehy said tobacco offers steady earnings and good cash 
flow while financial services offer faster growth these 
businesses represent 80 percent of bats forecast pretax profit 
for 1989 
there was no sign of goldsmith at the shareholders meeting the 
anglofrench financier previously said hoylake would vote for the 
restructuring calling it a first step in his hopedfor 
unbundling of the conglomerate 
hoylakes bid of 1396 worth of securities for each bat share 
has been suspended while it seeks approval from us state 
insurance commissioners to change the ownership of bats farmers 
insurance group inc 
sheehy said he didnt expect farmers profit to be hurt by 
tuesdays disastrous northern california earthquake

textron inc reported thursday that 
higher costs in its aerospace and auto products businesses 
contributed to a 55 percent drop in the conglomerates 
thirdquarter earnings 
textron said it earned 595 million or 66 cents per share in 
the quarter ended sept 30 compared with 1988 thirdquarter 
results of 628 million or 72 cents per share 
revenue increased to 173 billion from 172 billion a year 
earlier 
textrons aerospace business was especially hard hit by cost 
increases in its fixedprice contracts to develop the v22 osprey 
tiltrotor aircraft with boeing helicopter co said spokesman 
raymond w caine jr 
the defense department has canceled that program but textron is 
attempting to persuade congress to restore funding he said 
overall aerospace segment revenue fell nearly 10 percent to 756 
million and earnings in that division were down almost 17 percent 
to 656 million 
textrons commercial products segment which includes its 
automotive businesses posted a 41 million increase in revenue to 
434 million but earnings decreased from 33 million to 27 million 
caine said he was unable to pinpoint one reason for the softer 
margins in that segment its just a question of the costs were 
higher than we thought they would be he said 
textrons financial services sector saw earnings increase 25 
percent to 69 million because of strength in consumer finance and 
insurance businesses caine said 
for the first nine months of the year textron said it earned 
1821 million or 217 a share compared with 1704 million or 
227 a share a year earlier textron had more shares outstanding 
a year ago

signs of a large soviet purchase of us corn 
pulled corn futures prices up sharply thursday on the chicago board 
of trade and the other grain markets rallied in kind 
it looks like russia bought another 2 million metric tons of 
corn overnight and i believe its true said gerald zusel 
manager of balfour maclaine corps floor operations at the 
exchange 
he cited heavy buying of futures by grain exporters which 
frequently signals a large foreign purchase 
rumors of soviet buying of us soybeans and soybean meal gave 
those markets an additional boost and wheat futures gained on a 
spillover of the bullish enthusiasm 
snow accumulations of up to six inches were expected overnight 
in the eastern corn belt which would bring harvesting activity to 
a halt but zusel said forecasts for mild weekend temperatures and 
drierthannormal conditions in the midwest next week minimized 
chances of significant harvest delays 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 1 cents higher with 
december at 407 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents higher 
with december at 244 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents 
higher with december at 146 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents to 9 
cents higher with november at 566 a bushel

share in the quarter ended sept 30 up from 1468 million or

computer systems are providing an 
electronic lifeline between isolated earthquake victims in san 
francisco and anxious relatives back home 
compuserve a columbusbased computer information company with 
550000 individual and 1800 corporate customers worldwide put an 
earthquake forum on line about 5 pm edt wednesday said rich 
baker manager of editorial services 
by 11 am thursday more than 430 messages many seeking 
information about relatives and friends living in northern 
california had been filed 
this is sort of like what ham radio operators do only its on 
a computer said baker its setting a lot of the information 
coming out of california straight in an accurate and timely manner 
often more quickly than the news media can 
another computer information services company prodigy had such 
a system operating less than four hours after the earthquake hit 
said communications manager brian ek the company based in white 
plains ny launched its service in october 1988 and has 
subscribers in more than 100000 households across the country 
as of thursday afternoon 1530 messages had been entered he 
said 
among the other computer bulletin board services that went into 
action after the quake was the well which is based in sausalito 
calif and has about twothirds of its 3000 subscribers in the 
san francisco bay area 
many of the messages sent through compuserve have sought 
information about things such as road closings but others were 
more personal 
a new england man trying to find a couple in burlingame turned 
to the computer network for help about an hour later he received 
word that they not only survived the earthquake but had become 
grandparents he also learned that the mother of one of his friends 
had been widowed the day before the earthquake hit 
computer samaritans across the country offered to act as 
messengers for those who couldnt reach loved ones by phone 
an oaklandarea woman reported for anybody worrying about 
their daughter at mills college in oakland hills the students 
were shaken but otherwise fine 
one man from italy sought help in finding friends vacationing in 
san francisco but their whereabouts were not known 
word also came from santa clara that a woman sustained no damage 
to her house but her bird bath was tipped over 
the compuserve system is available only to members who pay 
1250 an hour to access the electronic billboard through their 
personal computers 
ek said the messages filed on the prodigy service have been 
similar but the company took the service for which subscribers 
pay 995 a month a step further 
the company put a local psychologist on line wednesday night 
to help these people deal with the trauma we had one person who 
know some of the people involved in the nimitz highway situation 
who was pretty distraught he said 
baker said he is not surprised at the offers of help from 
stranger to stranger 
this is not uncharacteristic of the online computer 
community he said were a tightly knit caring group of 
people we like to show the human side of personal computing

with damage in the northern california 
earthquake being estimated as high at 1 billion or more insurance 
officials say only five other natural disasters have had higher 
dollar price tags 
because of inflation the dollar cost of natural disasters from 
earlier times cant be directly compared to the dollar cost of the 
bay quake 
the independent insurance agents of america said thursday that 
while the final cost of the san francisco region quake will not be 
known for some time it will likely top 1 billion 
only five other disasters in the united states have had price 
tags in excess of that amount the association reported 
those are hurricane hugo with the cleanup still under way but 
costs expected to reach 398 billion hurricane agnes 1972 3 
billion hurricane camille 1969 142 billion hurricane betsy 
1965 14 billion and the eruption of mount st helens 1980 
11 billion 
the next most costly earthquake the insurance agents reported 
was the 1971 san fernando quake where losses were estimated at 
553 million 
the great san francisco quake of 1906 caused an estimated 524 
million in damage according to the agents group in todays 
dollars that would be 5 billion to 58 billion the group said 
that is a huge sum considering that san francisco was a far smaller 
city in 1906

assets of the nations 473 money market mutual 
funds surged by 607 billion in the latest week to a record 
35610 billion reflecting an investor exodus from stocks into 
safer investments following the oct 13 wall street plunge the 
investment company institute said thursday 
it was the biggest rise in fund assets since the week of another 
large decline in stock prices jan 13 1988 when assets rose by 
762 billion 
the latest rise broke the record total set the previous week 
when fund assets totaled 35003 billion the institute originally 
reported that figure as 34937 billion but revised it upward 
jacob dreyer chief economist and senior vice president of the 
washingtonbased mutual fund trade group attributed the latest 
rise to investors who sought safe havens for their money after the 
stock market dropped sharply oct 13 with the dow jones industrial 
average falling 190 points 
the biggest weekly rise in funds assets 964 billion in the 
week ended oct 21 1987 came during the stock market collapse

usx corp and kobe steel ltd of japan said 
thursday they plan a joint venture in sheet steel galvanizing for 
auto and appliance makers 
the two companies as usskobe steel co already share another 
joint venture operating the former usx plant at lorain ohio 
the new venture is an effort to answer growing demand for 
highquality coated sheet steel primarily for domestic and 
japanese automakers in the united states and other sheet steel 
consumers such as makers of appliances and office furniture 
the companies hope to reach a definitive agreement by years end 
on a 5050 equity partnership 
usx and kobe plan to jointly design and build a stateoftheart 
plant somewhere in the midwest to produce 600000 tons per year 
construction could begin next spring and production could begin two 
years later 
the steel will be coated by dipping it in molten zinc a process 
once limited to culverts water pails garbage cans and other 
lowgrade uses hotdip galvanizing has become increasingly 
sophisticated and now can compete with sheets coated by 
electrolysis or electrogalvanizing said usx spokesman tom farrell 
master coils would come from usx plants at pittsburgh gary 
ind and birmingham ala the new plant is not expected to hurt 
other usx hotdipped galvanizing lines 
the companies said they could not project the number of jobs 
that would be created or the cost of the plant 
usx is the nations largest steelmaker kobe is japans 
fifthlargest steelmaker

federal engineers have stepped up an 
investigation of four ford motor co models following complaints of 
malfunctioning cruise controls the government said thursday 
the national highway traffic safety administration said its 
investigation of speed controls in the 1986 and 1987 ford tempo and 
mustang and the mercury topaz and capri was being upgraded from a 
preliminary evaluation to an engineering analysis 
the change means engineers will study the potentially defective 
parts as opposed to just paperwork analysis 
the investigations help the agency decide whether to seek 
recalls 
fiftyfive customers have complained that the cruise controls do 
not disengage properly forcing drivers to hit the brakes to slow 
the cars agency spokesman tim hurd said the problem has been 
blamed for two accidents and three injuries 
in detroit ford spokeswoman joyce stinson said the company was 
investigating the purported defect but had reached no conclusions 
its always our policy to cooperate fully with nhtsa in their 
investigations and we will do so in this case she said 
an estimated 562000 of the 198687 tempos mustangs topazes 
and capris are on the road hurd said 
the agency also said it was launching several new investigations 
and calling off some probes for lack of evidence the public was 
endangered 
nhtsa also upgraded to an engineering analysis its probe of 1985 
toyota vans and cargo vans of which 104100 are on the road there 
have been five complaints alleging eight accidents caused by 
steering gear failure and resulting loss of control over the 
vehicles 
an engineering analysis of hydraulic fuel leaks in the 1985 
volkswagen audi 500 was halted despite 663 complaints of hydraulic 
fuel leaks causing loss of power steering and brakes 
engineers determined the problem is not a safety hazard because 
the cars can be controlled with manual brakes and steering hurd 
said an estimated 90000 are on the road 
the agency opened preliminary evaluations of 
reports that on hard turns the front wheels of 1987 1988 and 
1989 chrysler lebarons rub on something under the car causing tire 
wear an estimated 600000 are on the road 
four complaints of locking wheels and steering systems in 
180000 chevrolet berettas from 1988 causing two accidents and one 
injury 
fractured rear axle shafts in 12 million chevrolet camaros and 
pontiac firebirds from the 1982 through 1988 model years six 
accidents and three injuries have been reported 
alleged transmission oil leaks in the 198889 ford probe and 
mazda mx6 which are built in the same facilities and have similar 
designs two probe fires have been reported 
fires under dashboards of chrysler voyager caravans from 
19841989 ten fires have been reported 15 million vehicles are 
on the road 
brake failure in the 198688 pontiac bonneville buick lesabre 
and oldsmobile 88 there have been 35 complaints alleging six 
accidents and three injuries an estimated 12 million of the cars 
are in use 
preliminary evaluations also were begun on two childrestraint 
seat models there have been complaints of children pulling off and 
putting in their mouths metallic labels of the fisher price model 
9100 made in 1988 and foam rubber from century products models 
4365dt and 4366bh made in 1989 
the agency closed the books on three preliminary evaluations 
finding no defect trends 
those included investigations of axle seal failures in 643800 
general motors safari and astro minivans from 198588 breaking 
stabilizer bars in 567000 toyota tercels from 198288 and wearing 
parking brake cable sheaths on the chevrolet monte carlo 
oldsmobile 88 and pontiac grand prix from 198588

oil futures prices ended mostly higher thursday 
boosted in part by strength in the heating oil market 
energy prices were unaffected for the second day by the 
devastating san francisco bay earthquake most gasoline pipelines 
closed after the quake hit on tuesday were reopened by late 
wednesday and refineries were reported operating at or near normal 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
domestic heating oil rose 029 cent to finish at 6089 cents a 
gallon after dipping 045 cent in the previous session 
i like the way heating oil came back today said james 
steel analyst with refco inc it could be partly because there 
is a bigger shortage in europe than we realize 
colder weather in many parts of the country also helped prices 
traders said 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for november delivery closed 007 
cent higher at 5465 cents a gallon after a 126 cent decline on 
wednesday 
prices of west texas intermediate crude were mostly higher with 
the exception of the november contract which closed down 14 cents 
at 2042 a barrel the contract for december delivery settled 17 
cents higher at 2042 and january finished at 2018 up 22 cents 
projections of higher fourthquarter demand by the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries technical committee had no 
immediate impact on the market traders said 
the opec committee projected that worldwide demand for opec oil 
would increase by 600000 barrels a day to 231 million barrels in 
the final quarter of 1989 from the estimated 225 million barrels 
that the cartel is now producing

amoco corp posted a 39 percent drop in thirdquarter profit due 
partly to lower refining earnings and an 80 million charge for 
environmental programs the company said thursday 
schlumberger ltd meanwhile reported its thirdquarter profit 
rose nearly 2 percent as oilfield earnings offset a decrease in 
interest income 
and ashland oil inc said an aftertax charge of 78 million in 
the fourth quarter will result in a net loss for the period and 
significantly lower results for the year 
chicagobased amoco said its thirdquarter earnings tumbled to 
336 million or 65 cents a share from 552 million or 107 a 
share in the yearearlier period revenue climbed 12 percent to 
66 billion from 59 billion a year ago 
amocos ninemonth earnings declined 24 percent to 13 billion 
or 250 a share from 17 billion or 328 a share in the same 
1988 period the oil companys revenue meanwhile climbed 12 
percent to 199 billion from 177 billion in 1988 
for the threemonth period ended sept 30 new yorkbased 
schlumberger said its net income totaled 1142 million or 48 
cents a share compared with 1122 million or 42 cents a share 
in the same 1988 quarter 
revenue totaled 112 billion down 6 percent from 118 billion 
a year ago 
amoco chairman richard m morrow said an 80 million charge to 
increase provisions for future costs of refining and marketing 
environmental programs helped reduce thirdquarter results 
also contributing to the thirdquarter decline were lower 
production earnings overseas 12 million compared with 95 
million in the 1988 third period and lower us refining 
marketing and transportation income 134 million vs 319 million 
a year ago 
in addition higher interest income and operating costs offset 
the favorable effects of higher crude oil prices and increased 
natural gas and crude oil production amoco said 
schlumbergers income in the first nine months fell 95 percent 
to 3234 million or 136 a share from 3572 million or 132 
a share in the comparable 1988 period revenue declined 5 percent 
to 348 billion from 368 billion 
schlumberger chairman euan baird said the company experienced 
growth in its oilfield services unit in the third period despite a 
9 percent decline in the average number of active rigs worldwide 
that helped offset a decrease in interest income stemming from a 
12 billion stock buyback in 1988 
the ninemonth figures include a gain of 13 million or 5 cents 
a share from the sale of a defense systems unit and a 22 million 
extraordinary gain from an award by the iranus claims tribunal 
the award stemmed from a claim filed by schlumberger over oilfield 
equipment left in iran a decade earlier when many us companies 
evacuated the country due to political turmoil and the rescinding 
of oil exploration agreements 
ashland based in ashland ky said its fourthquarter charges 
include 38 million from a previously announced 325 million 
settlement with the national iranian oil co a 15 million charge 
from the planned sale of ashlands technology corp subsidiary and 
a 25 million charge stemming from costs to correct performance 
problems at its riley consolidated subsidiary 
the outofcourt settlement with iran involved claims for oil 
that had not been paid for a decade ago when iran rescinded 
exploration agreements with ashland as well as other us oil 
companies 
ashland said it plans to announce its results next week in last 
years fourth quarter the company had net income of 66 million 
or 119 a share on revenue of 22 billion for the 1988 fiscal 
year it had net income of 224 million or 401 a share on 
revenue of 82 billion

chancellor nigel lawson reaffirmed on thursday 
that britains interest rates would stay high for some time to 
come 
lawson ruled out any alternative to his strategy of raising 
interest rates to curb inflation and said there would be no major 
policy changes 
he also criticized european proposals for a single european 
currency warning any attempt to create a single central bank for 
europe could end in tears 
lawson made his comments at the annual banquet of the lord mayor 
of london called the mansion house speech it is a traditional 
platform from which the government announces changes in economic 
policies 
the government has pushed up interest rates to 15 percent their 
highest level in eight years to support the recently weak pound 
and slow down inflation which is running at an annual rate of 76 
percent 
britains merchandise trade deficit of 268 billion in the 
first eight months of this year eventually will narrow and 
inflation will abate lawson predicted

signs of a large soviet purchase of us corn pulled corn 
futures prices up sharply thursday on the chicago board of trade 
and it wasnt just idle speculation 
the agriculture department confirmed after the close that the 
soviet union had bought 12 million metric tons of corn 
on other commodity markets copper futures rallied while 
precious metals retreated stockindex futures soared energy 
futures advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
corn settled 2 cents to 5 cents higher with the contract for 
december delivery at 244 a bushel 
wheat futures finished cent to 1 cents higher with december 
at 407 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with 
december at 146 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents to 9 cents higher 
with november at 566 a bushel 
heavy buying of corn futures by grain exporters freqently a 
signal of a large foreign purchase fueled speculation that the 
soviets had been in the market overnight the purchase had been 
rumored to be as large as 2 million metric tons 
persistent rumors of soviet interest in us soybean meal and 
soybean oil continued on thursday giving the soybean complex a 
boost and wheat futures gained as the enthusiasm spread from the 
corn and soybean pits to the wheat arena 
export sales of corn and soybeans typically increase in 
midautumn when newly harvested crops increase the supply and 
bring prices down 
a general rule of thumb in these markets is that after the 
harvest is past the halfway point youll see a rally and were 
past the halfway point now said walter spilka a grainmarket 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
the harvest has suffered a setback this week due to cold stormy 
weather in the midwest and a storm was expected to drop up to six 
inches of snow in the eastern corn belt overnight 
but forecasts for mild weekend temperatures and 
drierthannormal conditions next week minimized chances of 
significant harvest delays 
if anyone bought today on weather they bought for the wrong 
reason said gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps 
floor operations at the board of trade 
copper futures rallied modestly on new yorks commodity exchange 
after slipping on thursday below 127 a pound in a move that some 
analysts had interpreted as a signal the market was weakening 
significantly 
precious metals prices declined following the governments 
report of a lowerthanexpected 02 percent rise in consumer prices 
last month 
copper settled 13 cents to 23 cents higher with december at 
12795 a pound gold finished 180 lower across the board with 
december at 37060 a troy ounce silver was 25 cents to 28 cents 
lower with december at 5133 a troy ounce 
stockindex futures advanced strongly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange as jitters linked to last fridays collapse continued to 
fade the contract for december delivery of stocks tracked by the 
standard amp poors 500 index settled 495 points higher at 34960 
the contract is valued at 500 a point

consumer prices rose an unexpectedly modest 
02 percent in september the government said thursday soothing 
frazzled financial markets 
investors took the report as an indication the federal reserve 
board has room to lower interest rates and the stock market 
rallied the dow jones average of 30 industrials gained 3955 
points to 268320 
inflation which had been rising at a 67 percent annual rate 
from january through may has abated to a 44 percent rate for the 
first nine months of the year 
the inflation rate so far this year is the same as in both 1988 
and 1987 and well under the bush administrations 1989 inflation 
projection of 5 percent 
michael boskin chief economic adviser at the white house 
called the report good economic news 
were delighted to be able to say that while were always on 
guard to make sure that inflation remains under control the 
concern earlier in the year that inflation was getting out of 
control appears to have been unfounded he said 
the seasonally adjusted increase in the labor departments 
consumer price index follows no gain at all in august and similarly 
modest 02 percent rises in july and june 
although private economists said inflation was likely to pick up 
in the fourth quarter jittery stock and bond markets rallied on 
thursdays news interpreting it as a sign the federal reserve 
likely will nudge interest rates lower 
because of the stock market turmoil set off by the friday the 
13th nosedive the fed has eased a key interest rate from about 9 
percent to 875 percent analysts predicted another quarterpoint 
decline soon in the federal funds rate which banks charge each 
other for overnight loans 
under these circumstances there is no question that interest 
rates will fall said economist william k macreynolds of the 
us chamber of commerce 
in an effort to contain inflation the fed has been using high 
interest rates to slow the economy although wholesaleprice 
inflation shot up 09 percent in september other statistics for 
the month portray a sluggish economy with weakening manufacturing 
employment industrial production and housing construction 
in other reports 
the labor department said new state unemployment claims for the 
week ending oct 7 grew 62000 in a weeks time to 396000 that 
report amounted to a further indication of the economys softness 
the department said americans average real weekly earnings of 
33867 in september were up 35 percent from a year earlier not 
enough to keep up with inflation adjusted for inflation earnings 
rose 03 percent last month following a 07 percent decline in 
august 
the nations 389 million social security recipients watched 
thursdays consumerprice report with particular interest because 
it affected the benefit increase theyre due to receive in january 
benefits will climb 47 percent the biggest boost in 7 years 
to offset the effects of inflation over the last year the average 
monthly payment will climb 25 to 566 
at the same time the cap on social security payroll taxes will 
rise workers will have to pay the tax on their first 50400 in 
wages up from 48000 
analysts were suprised by the september inflation data they had 
been expecting higher crude oil costs to ripple through to gasoline 
pumps pushing up prices overall by about 04 percent 
but energy prices declined for the fourth consecutive month 
gasoline down 22 percent in september has fallen 93 percent in 
the last four months after increasing 212 percent in the first 
five months of the year 
fuel oil prices dropped 02 percent last month after declining 
09 percent in august 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
said higher energy prices likely will show up when octobers report 
is released 
there has been an abatement of inflation but it hasnt been 
to the degree that this 02 percent number would suggest he 
said were likely to have some less attractive numbers in the 
fourth quarter 
food prices which had shot up at a 93 percent annual rate 
through may climbed at a rate of just 17 percent from june 
through september they rose a moderate 02 percent last month in 
part because of a 11 percent decline for fruits and vegetables 
coffee prices fell 27 percent last month however the index 
for dairy products jumped 14 percent the largest monthly increase 
since may 1980 
clothing prices after falling in the three preceding months 
rose 17 percent in september with another increase expected for 
october prices for apparel for women and girls reflecting the 
introduction of new fall and winter fashions were up 36 percent 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch amp co said the 
september report was favorably influenced by several price drops 
unlikely to be repeated 
the cost of new cars fell 04 percent the fifth drop in a row 
and the longest such string since the labor department began 
tracking those prices in 1953 he said 
auto dealers are giving the things away he said 
theres a point where you just cant do more and i think theyve 
reached that point 
tuition and school fees fell 04 percent seasonally adjusted 
while hotel and motel costs dropped 45 percent 
the various changes left the overall consumer price index at 
1250 in september meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods 
and services costing 100 in the 198284 base period would have 
cost 125 last month

the san francisco bay area earthquake revived 
a debate over whether 16yearold federal seismic standards for 
nuclear power plants are tough enough 
tuesdays quake caused no damage to the five active nuclear 
reactors in california according to the nuclear regulatory 
commission the three that were operating at the time are still 
running normally said frank ingram an nrc spokesman 
the five reactors are in southern california two at diablo 
canyon 12 miles southwest of san luis obispo and three at san 
onofre five miles south of san clemente one reactor at each site 
was shut down for normal refueling when the quake hit 
under the 1973 standards set by the nrc each nuclear power 
plant must be built to quakeresistance specifications that differ 
according to local seismic conditions the standards for diablo 
canyon are the stiffest in the country ingram said 
the risk of nuclear plant accidents from earthquakes was a major 
point of contention between the industry and environmentalists 
during the 1960s and early 1970s when site planning was done for 
most of the 110 plants now operating in this country 
the chief danger is that a quake would cause a crack in the 
piping that carries cooling water to the reactor core a rapid loss 
of coolant could cause the fuel rods in the core to melt possibly 
allowing radioactive material to escape into the atmosphere 
although the seismic issue has faded in recent years the 
environmental group public citizen founded by consumer advocate 
ralph nader said wednesday the northern california quake 
underscored a need to reexamine the nuclear construction standards 
federal regulators should at least view the earthquake as a 
final warning that seismic standards and testing for all nuclear 
reactors as well as evacuation planning needs to be substantially 
upgraded before the next quake hits said ken bossong director 
of public citizens critical mass energy project 
bossong said at least two nuclear plants are perilously close 
to known fault lines he cited diablo canyon which is near the 
hosgri fault and millstone near the point at which the honey hill 
and lake char fault lines intersect in connecticut 
bossong also noted that the energy department has acknowledged 
that its three active nuclear reactors at the savannah river 
weapons complex in south caroline which make materials for nuclear 
warheads need to undergo seismic upgrades 
some specialists however say the seismic standards for 
commercial nuclear reactors are adequate 
larry white an environmental engineer with the consulting firm 
roy f weston inc in washington said the standards are pretty 
conservative although he acknowledges there is a lot of 
uncertainty in attempting to predict how structures such as 
nuclear plants would respond to the worst possible quake

the chief of the international monetary fund 
credits japan with significant economic achievements and says the 
japanese should now take the lead in eliminating trade barriers 
it is particularly important for japan to take further steps 
to improve market access for imported goods said imf managing 
director michel camdessus 
specifically the imf chief called for japan to loosen quota and 
tariff restrictions on agricultural products echoing us demands 
aimed at reducing japans high trade surplus with the united states 
camdessus former governor of the bank of france and now head of 
the 152nation imf addressed the japan society in new york 
wednesday night and the text of his speech was released here 
thursday 
i believe that japan is in a position to take unilateral steps 
to reduce trade barriers and thus to assume a leadership role in 
promoting multilateral trade liberalization in the current global 
trade talks at geneva he said 
in addition to easing japanese restrictions on foreign farm 
products camdessus called for reforms in land management and the 
distribution system he said he supported japans recent efforts to 
tighten credit in order to avert inflation but added there is also 
an urgent need for a more determined effort to remove structural 
impediments to growth 
he said that while japan has made significant progress in 
boosting domestic demand in other areas the reforms have been 
limited 
the united states and japan are already holding bimonthly 
structural talks at which us officials are pressing for changes 
in japanese distribution and landuse systems that they maintain 
are anticompetitive discriminate against imports and penalize 
consumers 
camdessus said he agreed with the advice japan is giving the 
united states in their structural talks to reduce deficit 
spending and increase savings and investment 
conditions are favorable today for the major deficit 
countries to make needed changes he said naming only the united 
states 
action to strengthen the public finances in many of these 
countries including the united states would raise national 
savings make room for an improvement in net export and reduce 
pressure on prices and interest rates he said 
camdessus said japanss national savings rate never fell below 
30 percent of gross national product during the 1980s in 1988 
when its surpluses were declining it hit a peak of 33 percent a 
remarkable performance by any standards given the overall 
shortage of world savings in recent years 
the us personal savings rate after taxable income fell to 
32 percent in 1987 and rose to 42 percent in 1988 while the 
comparable japanese rate was 165 percent in 1987 according to 
us treasury figures

of warner in which it initially purchased a controlling interest in 
warner for 70 a share in cash time then became time warner inc

shareholder before time completed the first phase of the buyout 
contended that it had the right to veto the structure of the second 
part of the deal 
it argued that as the only holder of warners series b preferred 
stock it had the right to vote as a class on the merger agreement 
but a delaware chancery court judge ruled against chriscraft 
last month and a threejudge panel of the delaware supreme court 
meeting in dover del affirmed that ruling late wednesday 
time warner currently owns about 69 percent of warners shares 
and has offered a package of preferred stock plus warners stake in 
a chriscraft subsidiary for the remainder

million portfolio of property acquired through the bailout of 
insolvent thrifts in five states 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp announced the plan during a speech to dallas real estate and 
financial executives 
of the 150 properties 82 are in texas and the rest are in 
california colorado arizona and florida he said regulators hoped 
to sell the real estate in one package but would sell it in pieces

industrial retail and vacant land are part of the 27 billion in 
assets being managed by the federal asset disposition association

insolvent sampls this year giving it control of more than 600 
institutions and more than 350 billion in deposits

billion to 70 billion of repossessed real estate into private

young amp rubicam inc said thursday it would end 
its contract with the jamaica tourist board an account that led to 
charges that the advertising agency paid nearly 1 million in 
bribes to jamaican officials 
yampr and the jamaica tourist board have reviewed our contract 
and under the present circumstances have agreed that it is prudent 
to discontinue that contract alex kroll the ad agencys 
chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement 
he said yampr would represent the tourist board until it finds a 
new ad agency 
the tourist board issued its own statement later thursday in 
which it expressed shock at the timing and content of yamprs 
announcement 
the tourist board said the ad agency had not notified the board 
that it would make such a statement the board also said it had 
notified yampr on oct 10 of its intent to cancel the agencys 
account 
the board wishes to emphasize that the decision to terminate 
yampr is a result of the development of an unsatisfactory commerical 
relationship between yampr and the board and is not to be interpreted 
as a comment on the accuracy of the allegations reflected in the 
indictment the tourist board said 
the indictment handed up earlier this month by a federal grand 
jury in connecticut charges the new yorkbased agency two of its 
executives and a former executive with racketeering and conspiracy 
to violate the foreign corrupt practices act 
jamaicas former minister of tourism and another jamaican were 
charged with accepting the bribes 
the ad agency and its executives and former executive pleaded 
innocent the jamaican officials have not appeared in court on the 
charges
