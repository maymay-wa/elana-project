in a costsaving experiment that may be tried 
elsewhere overseas cable news network and cbs news will share a 
bureau and satellite equipment in berlin a cnn official said 
friday 
the test will start in midjune and is a a limited 
experiment in which the two organizations will maintain separate 
news correspondents and producers said ed turner executive vice 
president of cnn 
turners comments came during a telephone interview about the 
upcoming 10th anniversary of cnn 
cbs news officials would not comment on the unique sharing of 
office space with a stillgrowing cable rival we have no 
announcement to make said cbs spokesman tom goodman 
the berlin bureau arrangement marks the second deal between cbs 
and a company owned by atlanta cable tycoon ted turner who 
unsuccessfully tried to buy cbs in 1986 
last september turner network television announced a 50 
million contract with cbs that lets tnt show 50 hours of coverage 
from the 1992 and 1994 winter olympics cbs owns the us 
television rights to those games 
the cnncbs news arrangement in berlin is really more symbolic 
than anything else said ed turner who is not related to cnns 
owner 
what is unusual about it is two rival tv news organizations 
cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a satellite feed 
point and saving each other a little money he said and well 
see where it goes from there 
asked if there might be similar cbscnn arrangements elsewhere 
overseas turner replied that were looking at some but right 
now theres nothing to talk about 
the costsaving effort comes at a time that all the major 
networks are trying to find ways to reduce or share costs of news 
coverage overseas 
several years ago nbc bought nearly 38 percent of visnews a 
londonbased overseas tv news service visnews majority owner is 
the reuters news company but the british broadcasting corp also 
owns an 1125 percent interest 
nbc and visnews recently began sharing the same office in 
moscow and the bbc uses nbcs satellite equipment there to 
transmit stories to london nbc said 
abc owns 45 percent of another londonbased overseas tv news 
service worldwide television news subscribers to the service 
include abc news cbs news and cnn

a former mental patient was found innocent by 
reason of insanity friday of fatally shooting two universal studios 
guards who refused to let him see actor michael landon 
nathan nicholas trupp acknowledged that he killed guards jeren 
beeks 27 and armando torres 18 at a studio gate dec 1 1988 
but he has never offered a coherent explanation 
superior court judge clarence a stromwell declared trupp 
innocent by reason of insanity and committed him to a state mental 
hospital in a plea bargain with prosecutors who said trupp could 
be institutionalized for the rest of his life 
trupp 43 said he understood the terms of his plea but was not 
asked if he knew why he had committed the murders 
trupp was sought by new mexico authorities for questioning in 
the slayings of three people in albuquerque a few days before he 
went to universal in search of landon 
prosecutors have said trupp went on the universal studio tour 
then returned to the gate asking to see landon who was then 
starring in the highway to heaven television series 
when guards refused him entry and would not let him use their 
telephone to call landon trupp left then returned with a handgun 
and shot them 
as the slender bearded trupp entered his pleas families of the 
two victims sat sobbing in the courtroom two of them said outside 
they were pleased that trupp was now unable to harm anyone else 
deputy district attorney sterling norris asked trupp if he 
understood that you may be held in the hospital for the rest of 
your life 
yes trupp answered quietly 
norris noted that trupp can periodically apply for release but 
suggested that the sentence is the equivalent of life in prison 
he said his office and new mexico authorities would oppose any 
effort to free trupp 
new mexico authorities were consulted about the plea bargain 
norris told reporters he said they would not proceed with 
prosecution of trupp for the slayings of three people in an 
albuquerque bagel shop nov 29 1988 
trupp had said in the past he believed that those he killed were 
nazis 
trupps public defender steven hobson said outside court that 
trupp who is jewish and spent time in israel in his youth remains 
obsessed with nazis and says he hears voices as well as god telling 
him to do things

president bush began a presummit 
vacation friday by signing into law an aid package for panama and 
nicaragua swollen by tens of millions of dollars worth of pet 
projects for members of congress 
the measure provides 420 million for panama which is 
rebuilding after us economic sanctions and an invasion of 
american forces last december to topple manuel antonio noriega from 
power 
nicaraguas new government led by usbacked president violeta 
chamorro will receive 300 million 
overall the spending measure provides 44 billion in domestic 
spending and foreign assistance the administrations high priority 
on winning aid for panama and nicaragua led bush to swallow 
porkbarrel spending added by congress 
the measure was flown to bushs seaside maine compound for his 
signature and a white house statement said bush signed it friday 
night 
the president said in a written statement he regretted that 
congress has used this important legislation to enact many 
special interest provisions that are not in response to dire 
emergencies 
bush was greeted by sunny skies as he arrived for four days of 
golf and boating before next weeks summit with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
bush in an interview released friday called gorbachev a 
strong soviet leader clearly in charge with whom we have a lot of 
business items 
and they range from contentious ones like the lithuania 
problem to more reconcilable problems like arms control and to some 
other difficult ones like a postgerman unification europe said 
bush 
the interview was conducted thursday with a french television 
station 
asked if gorbachev was having difficulty with military leaders 
in his country bush said i dont think we know that but thats 
certainly a concern but i gather hes in pretty strong control 
now but facing enormous problems but its not my role to figure 
out whether gorbachev is having a problem with his left or his 
right its mine to deal with whats on the table 
there was no indication bush would spend much of the weekend 
honing up for the superpower meeting beginning thursday although 
he did bring along a briefing book 
no special briefings were planned and most of his top aides 
remained in washington including chief of staff john sununu 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and even press secretary 
marlin fitzwater who accompanies bush on virtually every trip 
weekend guests for bush and his wife barbara included 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and his wife honey and 
houston friends charles and sally neblett also joining bush on the 
air force one flight were his son marvin his wife margaret and 
their children marshall and walker 
bush and skinner began the weekend on a golf course and the 
president said he hoped to finish 18 holes in a speedy two hours 
and then go fishing got to get out the mackerels are running 
out to sea said bush 
before leaving washington bush called mrs chamorro and 
panamanian president guillermo endara to tell them congress had 
approved their aid package 
stephen hart white house deputy press secretary said the 
leaders called the aid a major step forward in solidifying and 
supporting the growth of democracy in panama and nicaragua 
bush expressed the continued us desire for close relations 
and for the continued partnership with panama and nicaragua and the 
rest of latin america hart said 
in central america panamanian and nicarguan leaders said the 
aid would help their economies but wouldnt solve all their 
problems 
president guillermo endara at a news conference promised 
judicious use of the money for the greatest benefit to all 
panamanians while nicaraguan presidential spokesman danilo 
lacayo said the money would stabilize a little the situation we 
live in at the start of the planting season 
bush had asked congress for 800 million for panama and 
nicaragua but congress pared his request while adding money 
elsewhere when passed the bill contained 4 in domestic spending 
for every dollar of latin aid 
for example the measure included nearly 40 individual grants 
through the department of housing and urban development totaling 
28 million most of them for communities whose members of congress 
are on the house and senate appropriations committees 
on the list was 400000 to fill in a collapsed utility tunnel 
in salisbury nc sought by rep bill hefner dnc and 
990000 to fix up a waterfront park in bay city mich in the 
district of democratic rep bob traxler 
the measure also provides several billion dollars for domestic 
programs such as the 12 billion needed to make up a shortfall in 
food stamp funds for the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
545 million for veterans benefits 166 million for head start 
and 432 million for fighting forest fires 
it also included other foreign assistance 75 million to meet 
refugee needs around the world 45 million in antinarcotics aid 
to bolivia and peru 30 million for aid to caribbean countries and 
30 million for africa

mules pull the loads and theres hardly a 
car to be seen in motor city china 
this city of 378000 in the mountains of central china is home 
to the second automobile works the nations largest truck 
manufacturer which employs 80000 people and indirectly provides 
livelihoods for many more 
it made 135000 trucks last year about onefourth of all the 
motor vehicles china produced 
the second automobile works has brought the 20th century and 
prosperity to a backwater where peasants still use mules and water 
buffalo to scratch a living from the rocky terrain 
when china was in the throes of the cultural revolution in the 
late 1960s and relations with the soviet union were extremely 
tense mao tsetung decided to move key industries out of the way 
of upheaval and invasion 
in 1969 it was decided trucks would be made in shiyan a small 
town in the poverty belt of northwest hubei province 
there was nothing here but rice paddies then said ma yue 
executive vice president of the plant who arrived in 1971 there 
was no place to live so we had to stay with farmers 
young men brought in as workers had difficulty finding wives so 
a textile mill was built to attract young women 
today per capita annual income is about 2800 yuan 595 for 
workers at the truck plant and 2300 yuan 489 for shiyan 
residents in general both are roughly double the national average 
trucks from the second automobile works are in great demand 
all 140000 vehicles to be made this year are sold so shiyan has 
escaped an economic slump that began affecting most of china six 
months ago the citys industrial output in the first four months 
of 1990 grew by 51 percent 
unemployment is a problem in china as a whole but not in 
shiyan because the area is so remote the truck plant relies on 
local sources for 70 percent of its parts 
company officials also say the staterun enterprise will not lay 
off workers as it automates although the factory appears 
overstaffed 
during a visit to the final assembly plant 146 people were 
working along a 785foot production line children of workers are 
usually guaranteed jobs at the plant 
shiyan has shown off its affluence by building a musically 
synchronized fountain costing the equivalent of 170000 that 
provides residents with a colorful water symphony every weekend 
mayor wu fayu said that by supporting the truck factory and 
marching along the socialist road the people of his city were 
leading a comfortable life 
poverty still reigns outside the city beyond the drab 
functional apartments for factory workers farmers hack at tiny 
vegetable patches next to oneroom huts of brick and mud 
water buffalo pull plows through rocky soil women wash clothes 
in streams while their children bathe 
after leaving shiyan the road quickly deteriorates into 
potholes and stretches of construction where young boys chip at 
the mountainsides with pickaxes 
buses jeeps and trucks cruise on the citys wide empty 
streets but there are virtually no passenger cars carts pulled by 
men or mules carry produce and supplies 
the few traffic lights in the selfdesignated motor city of 
china were turned off during a visit to shiyan street lights on a 
main avenue did not come on after dark and couples strolled down 
the middle of the moonlit street 
guo shuyan the provincial governor said northwest hubei was so 
remote the the government did not know of a serious food shortage 
in one area until a newspaper reporter wrote an expose he said 
authorities quickly sent 44000 tons of grain 
company officials acknowledge being more than 600 miles inland 
from shanghai is a drawback to competing in the expanding chinese 
auto industry 
we are in the mountains so we have to provide our own schools 
and welfare facilities ma said and about 10 percent of the 1989 
profit of 600 million yuan 127 million went to welfare programs 
asked about the original decision to build the plant in shiyan 
ma replied it was the 1960s and we had no choice 
shiyan will remain the companys base but it has ambitious 
plans and is looking elsewhere 
a joint venture with citreon of france to produce 150000 small 
passenger cars annually by 1993 and up to 300000 later will be 
built in wuhan the hubei provincial capital wuhan is on the 
yangtze river an ideal route for shipping finished cars 
xiangfan on the plains 120 miles east of shiyan will be the 
site of a plant to produce up to 400000 engines a year for the 
joint venture

thirty times in the past two years freelance 
writer bonnie kaufman got letters from strangers who said her work 
wasnt good enough 
shes used to such rough treatment freelance writers belong to 
a mongrel breed renowned for its ability to take a kicking and keep 
on licking 
but now shes tired of turning the other cheek she wants to get 
even 
the aim of her new american society of rejected writers is to 
have fun with the rejection thing by trashing editors 
membership is open to any writer who can produce a rejection 
letter she envisions a group that will meet annually and present 
prizes for the greatest number of rejections the slowest and 
funniest rejections the rejection that contained the most 
grammatical and spelling errors and the cruelest rejection 
how cruel can a rejection letter be ms kaufman recalls that a 
friend once received a letter that consisted of five words 
i cant i just cant the editor wrote 
ms kaufman 29 doesnt have to write to be rejected she moved 
to new york five years ago in the hopes of getting married my 
hopes were dashed 
she has accumulated a passel of rejections from her freelance 
work including two from the new york times hers column 
trouble is she had not submitted the article to that department 
it was a profile not the kind of feminine introspection that is 
published in hers 
i figure that their computer just spit out the wrong form 
rejection letter twice she said 
while struggling as a freelance writer ms kaufman works 
parttime as an editor for a manhattan weekly newspaper a job that 
has forced her to reject the work of other writers 
one writer responded not with anger or anguish but with 
gratitude 
i was nice to him ms kaufman said i told him that the 
idea was good but i thought the execution could be improved and 
he was so grateful 
that got her thinking about rejection letters that were not so 
kind and that got her thinking about forming a group to unite 
downtrodden writers 
she placed an ad in this weeks new york magazine asking anyone 
who was interested in such a group to call that wasnt an easy 
decision new york had just rejected an article of mine she 
said and she didnt know whether she wanted to pay money to a 
magazine that had rebuffed her 
in the first two days the magazine was out she received 15 
calls there were some pretty pathetic cases among them 
one woman called and said to call her anytime day or night 
please call ms kaufman said another had not been rejected in 
the united states but had been rejected in the philippines was 
that acceptable 
another man said he had thrown away all his rejection letters 
could he join informed that he could not he asked if the 
rejection letter from the american society of rejected writers 
would count as a rejection 
this is getting more complicated than i had anticipated ms 
kaufman said

a russian woman has won custody of her 
2yearold daughter until a hearing next month on whether the child 
should live with her mother in leningrad or with her father in new 
orleans 
alexsandra mcfaull had been living with her father attorney 
roderick mcfaull since he won a court order april 23 to take her 
off a plane that was about to leave new york city for leningrad 
galina mcfaull must surrender her passport and tickets for a 
flight to leningrad to ensure that she wont leave with alexsandra 
before the permanent custody hearing june 13 civil judge yada t 
magee ruled wednesday 
she said mcfaull may visit his daughter each day until the 
hearing 
the couple met in 1984 while mcfaull was on a trip to the soviet 
union and were married there the following year 
civil judge max tobias had granted mcfaull temporary custody in 
april to prevent mrs mcfaull from taking alexsandra out of the 
country 
after three days of hearings magee ruled wednesday that it was 
in the childs interest to be with her mother 
i hoped the judge would be fair and she was fair for the 
child said mrs mcfaull 
mcfaull said magee didnt give enough weight to testimony that 
mrs mcfaull on several occasions had left their daughter 
unattended for up to two hours in their new orleans home while she 
went out to shop 
there are state laws here which say you cant leave children 
by themselves for long periods mcfaull said 
magee ruled several weeks ago that she didnt have jurisdiction 
in an international custody case but the state 4th circuit court 
of appeal overturned that decision and ordered a custody hearing

members of congress are trying to stop 
president bush from giving another year of trade benefits to china 
whose leaders they called butchers and pirates 
bush announced on thursday he would extend most favored nation 
trade status to china for an additional year despite the 
administrations unhappiness with beijings human rights policies 
following the june 1989 massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators at 
tiananmen square 
this is the second time in a year the president has fought with 
congress over china the last time when the issue was how to 
protect chinese students studying in this country bush won a 
narrow victory 
the announcement touched off a firestorm on capitol hill in 
part because many lawmakers thought bush might impose some 
conditions on beijing at the same time he approved trade benefits 
most of the criticism came from democrats but a few republicans 
were angry too 
the presidents repeated concessions for the chinese 
government have been met with intransigence said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine the answer is not more 
concessions that doesnt make sense 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash criticized bush for 
failing to put any conditions on the oneyear extension to prod 
china toward reforms 
i think he faces some very severe problems here foley said 
at the present time i would say there are not the votes to 
approve it 
mitchell vowed to aggressively and vigorously pursue 
legislative action to revoke chinas trade benefits 
most members criticized chinas human rights record by 
extending favored trade status we are only legitimizing the 
bankrupt and repressive butchers of beijing said rep tom 
lantos dcalif 
one of the presidents few defenders was rep jim leach riowa 
closing down the economy may slam the door on political reform 
in china he said 
house minority leader bob michel rill said earlier he would 
back the president 
members didnt waste any time introducing bills that could end 
most favored nation status for china 
resolutions disapproving the extension were introduced in the 
house and senate if passed bush could veto them both houses 
would need a twothirds vote to override the veto 
alternatively the senate finance committee and the house ways 
and means committee could initiate legislation to revoke the trade 
benefits 
when congress returns june 5 from its memorial day recess china 
is sure to be a dominant issue members can expect to hear from 
business interests about the issue on their vacations 
sen alfonse damato rny said toy manufacturers have beat 
the door in their lobbying effort to gain an extension of favored 
trade but damato said he still opposes bush because its wrong to 
trade with any killer do business with any pirate 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the finance committee will 
hold hearings on the issue in early june the senate foreign 
relations committee plans another round of hearings 
bush had until june 3 to make a decision but he likely wanted 
to avoid announcing his decision around the time of the june 4 
oneyear anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre 
most favored nation status gives china the same preferential 
trade treatment including lowestpossible tariffs that is 
extended to most major trading partners china has had the status 
for 10 years 
denial would send tariffs rising sharply on about 12 billion in 
annual imports from china of textiles toys and other products it 
also would have hurt business in hong kong a british territory 
the american association of exporters and importers has 
estimated that removal of favored trade status would have boosted 
tariffs on chinese goods by an average 40 percent the president 
said these costs would be passed on to us consumers 
shortly after bush announced the decision richard h solomon 
assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs 
defended the china decision on capitol hill 
in the end the president concluded that denial of mfn most 
favored nation status would inflict grievous harm on the 
multitudes of intellectuals workers managers and officials inside 
china who struggle daily to keep alive the flame of reform and 
openness to the outside world he told members of the house 
foreign affairs committee

the us senate nomination are going easy on each other and aiming 
their fire instead at potential republican opponent sen jesse 
helms 
democrats mike easley and harvey gantt have carefully avoided 
attacking each other during the first two weeks of the runoff 
campaign but they frequently jabbed at helms 
they have a lot of common supporters and its hard to insult 
people who are fairly close to you said thad beyle a political 
science professor at the university of north carolina at chapel 
hill 
beyle characterized it as a gentlemanly runoff designed in 
part to avoid alienating voters who could choose to sit out the 
november general election 
easley is the brunswick county district attorney and gantt is a 
former charlotte mayor who is hoping to become the states first 
black senate nominee this century 
meanwhile helms a threeterm incumbent with a nationwide 
network of conservative financial contributors and supporters says 
he isnt taking reelection for granted 
i hear far too often jesses got it made helms said at 
one weekend campaign appearance well jesse aint got it made 
the states political history favors easley in the june 5 
democratic runoff even though gantt outpolled him by 50000 votes 
in the sixway may 8 primary 
black candidates such as gantt traditionally have lost runoffs 
against a single white candidate after leading a field of several 
whites in the first primary beyle said 
that history led minorities last year to successfully push for a 
change in state election law that allows a candidate to win a 
primary with 40 percent of the vote rather than the old standard 
of 50 percent black voters account for 26 percent of registered 
democrats in north carolina 
while the change in election law was expected to help gantt he 
fell short of the new threshold and finished the primary with 375 
percent easley was second with 302 percent three other white 
candidates and one black candidate were eliminated 
easley during a weekend campaign appearance said democrats 
should focus on the issues and make helms record an issue 
weve never done that weve always got caught up in national 
politics and thats a mistake 
gantt meanwhile criticized helms vote last week against a 
spending bill designed to help cities and states cope with growing 
numbers of aids cases helms charged that money was being diverted 
from other diseases and that the bill would encourage homosexual 
practices which he termed immoral 
i thought he embarrassed the people of north carolina by 
showing no compassion for the aids victims in our society for 
showing a lack of understanding as to what in fact has caused that 
problem to exist gantt said 
i just thought it was an embarrassing performance and another 
example of how irrelevant he is to the times we live in gantt 
added 
both democrats have been scrambling to raise money while helms 
has raised and spent more than 5 million so far easley had raised 
481000 and gantt had raised 402000 as of may 16 
helms told a goldsboro rally over the weekend he is worried 
about complacency 
no matter who the other side nominates if its mortimer 
snerd theyre going to get 40 or 45 percent of the vote in 
november right off the top he said its going to depend on 
people in this state who believe in conservative principles to get 
to the polls 
beyle said that while gantt and easley are gunning for helms 
they also may be thinking about future bids for office 
theyre keeping their sights on the main target which is in 
november and there is no question they are trying to shape the 
issues rather than give helms the chance to shape them beyle 
said 
but i think also there is some feeling that if they dont do 
well in june or november they want to do well in 1992

a waning soviet threat has prompted nato to 
slash war games nearly in half replacing them with computer 
simulations and to slacken the response time of some forces the 
alliances chief military commander says 
people dont want big exercises because the looming threat of 
an immediate war has lessened us gen john r galvin the 
supreme allied commander in europe said thursday 
we have cut down significantly on the amount of noise 
maneuver damage and general bother and yet we have accomplished 
our exercises to train to the standards that are required he 
said in an interview at his official residence in mons about 40 
miles southwest of brussels 
that should come as good news to west germans who have 
increasingly called for a cutback in nato maneuvers on the ground 
and in the air that have been prone to sometimes deadly mishaps 
most of the exercises are held in west germany 
the changes in the north atlantic treaty organization follow the 
fall of hardline communist regimes in eastern europe and come as 
east and west germany prepare to merge 
a new nato report shows authorities have canceled or trimmed 47 
percent of the approximately 100 exercises that will begin late 
this year and run over three years in europe 
ten major maneuvers have been scrapped 22 exercises have been 
linked together and an additional 22 have been reduced it said 
some exercises held annually now will take place every three 
years fewer tanks and other heavy equipment will be used 
the report estimated the slimmer training schedule would mean an 
annual savings of about 21 million in property damage in west 
germany heavy tanks tear up farmers fields and cut into roads 
used in the maneuvers 
galvin said that with the tightened military exercises senior 
officers use computer simulations of crisis situations to get their 
training smaller units often swallowed up in the big maneuvers 
get more chances to run through drills and perfect their skills 
this is better training than we had before he said 
im not trying to whitewash a reduction in training by saying 
we still get better training he insisted i could prove it to 
any professional 
galvin also said that under a new plan to ease response times in 
war quickreaction combat planes will remain at full alert but 
some frontline soldiers will have twice as long to react to an 
enemy attack 
the response times of air and ground forces in western europe 
could be relaxed further if the soviet union pulls more troops out 
of eastern europe he said 
there is no use keeping as many people snugged right up close 
on response times unless its absolutely necessary he said 
with the changes in eastern europe its not quite as 
necessary 
the new response times which refer to the amount of time it 
takes a unit of soldiers to react to an enemy attack will go into 
effect on july 1 
all ground and most air forces including helicopters and 
surfacetoair missile units in europe will be affected by the 
changes galvin said 
there will be no easing of the reaction time for fullalert 
interceptors which have only a few minutes notice to be in the air 
to fend off an attack 
as long as we have forces we want some quickreaction 
capability that is right down to a matter of minutes to get 
airborne he said well under 100 planes he said are ready to 
do that 
the changes he said could mean substantial cost savings over 
time 
he said it was expensive for instance to keep an antiaircraft 
missile crew with backup assistance at a high level of readiness 
galvin said nato guidelines give him the authority to relax the 
reaction times to a certain extent but additional reductions would 
require agreement of the member nations 
defense secretary dick cheney and other nato defense ministers 
announced wednesday the decision to lower the readiness and 
availability of a number of our standing forces 
the move is part of a series of measures likely to be taken in 
the coming months to revise the military strategy that guided the 
alliance in the cold war years

shuttle columbia is set to blast off 
wednesday with seven astronauts and a 150 million observatory that 
will examine highenergy ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from 
stars and galaxies 
columbias launch initially scheduled for may 9 and then for 
around may 17 was delayed because a faulty cooling valve had to be 
replaced in the shuttles payload bay 
liftoff now is scheduled for wednesday at 1238 am edt the 
fifth nighttime launch of a shuttle 
were ready to go nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said after a 
flight readiness review meeting thursday the mission managers who 
met at kennedy space center praised technicians for their work 
malone said 
there were no problems during that whole repair process she 
said 
technicians last week removed a valve with a torn filter and 
replaced it with a new one it was the first time such work had 
ever been performed on an orbiter at the launch pad 
a final check of the cooling system this week found everything 
in order malone said technicians removed a makeshift platform 
erected in the payload bay and other work items wednesday and spent 
thursday closing out the shuttles rear engine compartment 
the astro ultraviolet and xray observatory will photograph the 
ultraviolet sky and simultaneously measure the high energy of 
ultraviolet and xray radiation wavelengths which are absorbed by 
the atmosphere and therefore invisible from the ground 
four astronomers on the crew will operate astros three 
ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope 
the astro mission originally was scheduled for march 1986 but 
the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 resulted in a lengthy 
delay 
the nine to 10day mission will be the 36th shuttle flight

with the demise of communism in eastern 
europe the white house is wondering why the united states should 
continue broadcasting radio programs to those countries 
a review by the national security council is recommending that 
the broadcasts by radio free europe be reduced according to a 
source familiar with the preliminary report scheduled for 
completion may 30 
radio free europe based in munich west germany has been 
broadcasting to eastern europe throughout the cold war and was much 
reviled and jammed by the communist governments in those countries 
although the changes in eastern europe have given radio free 
europe unprecedented reporting and broadcasting opportunities they 
also have called into question the need for its existence 
the network announced thursday it was opening offices in prague 
and warsaw at the invitation of the leaders of czechoslovakia and 
poland czech president vaclav havel attended the bureau opening in 
prague and praised radio free europe for its programs that 
contributed to the fall of communism 
the bureaus as well as the one opened in hungary last 
september also will help train local journalists in westernstyle 
news gathering the radio free europe statement said 
we expect to be there for quite some time to come said 
radio free europes washington representative pat gates lynch 
but the nsc review is expected to call on radio free europe to 
eventually cut its programs to czechoslovakia hungary and poland 
said the source it recommends that radio free europe initially cut 
its repeat programs and eventually its original broadcasts too 
the money saved would be channeled into other foreign 
broadcasting services possibly the voice of america or the us 
information agencys television network said the source radio 
free europe has a congressionally funded budget of 190 million 
the panel also is expected to recommend the creation of a 
bipartisan presidential commission to examine the future of us 
government broadcasts abroad 
the recommendations are expected to set off a tussle between 
various agencies seeking to retain their share of programming or to 
enhance it 
the panel also is recommending cuts in the planned construction 
of a 300 million transmitter in israel which radio free europe 
and voa intend to use for broadcasts to eastern europe asia and 
africa said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the nsc believes that radio free europe broadcasts to eastern 
europe will be sharply reduced by the time the transmitter becomes 
operational in 1996 said the source 
an independent advisory commission last week issued a report 
recommending that radio free europe be gradually phased out and its 
assets passed to voa the report by the us advisory commission on 
public diplomacy drew a heated protest from the board for 
international broadcasting which controls radio free europe 
the board argues that eastern europe needs radio free europe 
during its transition to democracy that its audiences are far 
greater than those of voa and its functions are completely 
different

a bright turquoise pipeline spans the 
st john river between maines northern tip and canada linking two 
halves of a pulp and paper mill a mile apart 
the pipes carry wood pulp and steam but they also stand as a 
symbol of a union between two towns that see themselves as one 
despite the international border that separates them 
if you could put blinds on for a minute youd forget theres 
an international border said bert martin manager of the fraser 
inc pulp mill in edmundston new brunswick its really two 
towns in two countries but one community 
for the most part people in madawaska and edmundston work for 
the same company shop in the same stores speak the same language 
french and share a common acadian background 
children ride their bicycles across the bridge joining the two 
countries to play with their friends on the other side workers who 
cross the line daily address immigration officers by their first 
names 
with no hospital nearby on their side of the border many 
madawaska women choose to go to the edmundston hospital to have 
their babies one reason why so many children grow up with dual 
citizenship 
also mixing the pot are americans who marry canadians and 
canadians who become american citizens after working on the us 
side job transfers and promotions add to the mishmash of 
citizenship and sense of homogeneity 
im a canadian working in the us married to an american 
working in canada said barry k voss manager of the fraser ltd 
paper mill in madawaska im not unusual 
another case in point is al soucy a canadianborn madawaska 
mill worker who is now an american soucys oldest daughter is also 
american but his son and twin daughters are canadian he describes 
madawaskaedmundston which have a combined population of 17500 
as safe day and night and a nice place to bring kids up 
things were peaceful even when the area wedged between northern 
maines rich potato fields and new brunswicks forested hills was 
at the center of a bitter international border rivalry 
from the late 1700s until the present lines were agreed upon in 
1842 the british and american governments each claimed a large 
chunk of land along the st john 
it was the site of a colony that had been settled by acadians 
ousted from their eastern canadian homeland along with french 
canadians and yankees the groups formed their own little melting 
pot and peacefully inhabited a selfgoverned area about four times 
the size of rhode island 
ever since madawaskans from both sides of the border have 
viewed themselves as one people the mayor of edmundston retains 
the honorary title of president of the republic of madawaska 
still differences between the two communities are apparent 
street and store signs on the edmundston side are in french in 
english on the madawaska side 
each side also offers its particular amenities clothing is of 
superior quality and theres a better choice of restaurants and 
night spots on the canadian side soucy said but many canadians 
head south to buy milk and gas cheaper on the us side voss said 
while the border itself may go unnoticed the time difference it 
represents is a constant source of confusion even to longtime 
residents maine is in the eastern time zone an hour earlier than 
the atlantic time zone in new brunswick 
separate national holidays are marked on each side of the border 
voss said his family celebrates both the canadian thanksgiving 
in october and the american holiday a month later others celebrate 
canada day which falls on july 1 as well as the fourth of july 
dealing with two nations tax laws is not so simple dual 
regulations can bedevil people living in one country and working in 
another voss has to hire an accountant to sort out his tax 
paperwork before he files 
because frasers operations straddle the border it must comply 
with separate national labor environmental and other regulatory 
laws 
while the american and canadian governments are working to 
remove trade barriers and eliminate most tariffs through their 
freetrade agreement fraser the economic backbone of the region 
already effectively endruns us import hurdles through its unique 
setup 
the edmundston mill whose 670 employees are virtually all 
canadian produces pulp the essential ingredient of paper it also 
produces box board the material used in cereal boxes and frozen 
food cartons 
the mill is connected to its other half in madawaska by the 
7000foot pipeline that carries pulp and steam used to manufacture 
products such as paper for books catalogs and telephone 
directories 
there is no duty on the pulp nor on the steam that provides most 
of the power consumed in the madawaska mill where upwards of 90 
percent of the 1200 employees are us citizens and because the 
paper is manufactured in the united states a huge market for 
finished paper there is no import duty

senators say their crime bill limiting nine 
kinds of semiautomatic guns and prohibiting the death penalty for 
mentally retarded convicts in federal cases could be running into 
severe trouble 
it seems to me there is great pressure from certain groups 
to kill the bill senate minority leader bob dole rkan said 
thursday after 271 possible amendments surfaced the measure was 
shelved until after a 10day congressional recess set to begin 
today 
the senate earlier thursday upheld 5938 a ban contained in the 
bill on putting to death mentally retarded individuals convicted of 
capital crimes in federal cases it voted 5838 to drop a provision 
allowing death row inmates to use statistics to prove on appeal 
that their sentences involved racial bias 
the senate also reversed a decision it made wednesday and 
approved 5246 a stringent version of legislation on how courts 
review capital punishment cases to determine whether they were 
conducted in a constitutional manner 
the habeas corpus provision adopted would give defendants at 
most 60 days after their conviction to seek a federal review to 
determine if their case met constitutional standards 
courts would have 110 days to reach a decision the senate on 
wednesday approved a version that would give the prisoners a year 
to file and impose no time limit on the courts 
the bill also calls for the death penalty for 30 federal 
offenses including assassination of the president 
no corresponding legislation is on the calendar in the house 
senate democratic leaders saying it was necessary to keep the 
bill from going into a stall set june 5 on a vote to limit debate 
they said that without invoking cloture or limiting debate the 
senate could become hopelessly bogged down in discussion of each 
individual item 
but senators said it was not certain that such a constraint 
could be imposed the national rifle association remained upset by 
an action wednesday in which lawmakers voted to keep the bills 
restrictions on semiautomatic weapons 
more than 30 of the 184 republican and 87 democratic amendments 
that materialized thursday concerned firearms senators said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he hoped 
there would be no delay he reminded lawmakers that president bush 
has repeatedly indicated his desire for action on this 
legislation as recently as this week 
hours earlier however bush told reporters at the white house 
that he wanted a good strong anticrime bill without the curbs 
on semiautomatics 
judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden ddel told 
reporters thursday night he feared that unless limits were placed 
on debate the bill might be doomed 
if you dont get cloture i think you bring it down biden 
said he said it was a crapshoot as to whether senate leaders 
could mobilize the 60 votes needed to limit debate 
biden led opposition thursday to efforts to drop the bills 
language prohibiting execution of mentally retarded people 
convicted of capital crimes under federal law 
the prohibition comes in reaction to a supreme court decision 
last year that cleared the way for execution of the mentally 
retarded but it would not fully reverse that ruling since it 
would not apply to state cases 
for gods sake if you acknowledge you should not put children 
to death acknowledge that you should not put to death the mentally 
retarded biden urged the senate 
conservatives said that under the legislation virtually every 
defendant in a capital case would claim to be mentally retarded 
seventy percent of them are claiming that now said sen orrin

a pipe bomb explosion in a car thursday 
injured two members of a militant environmental group and a member 
of the group said police planned to file explosives charges against 
the two 
karen pickett a member of the earth first group questioned by 
police about the bombing told radio statio kcbs in san francisco 
they had told her evidence indicated the two activists were 
carrying the bomb in the car when it exploded 
police refused to say whether they planned charges against judi 
bari 40 and darryl cherney 33 both of ukiah 
bari said recently she had received death threats for helping 
organize a campaign to slow logging in northern californias 
oldgrowth forests and other environmental activities 
the explosion occurred shortly before noon near oakland high 
school said a garage worker who identified himself only as charles 
it sounded like a cherry bomb in a tin can said the worker 
it was pretty loud i kind of felt it in my body and i was 
inside 
after the explosion the car rolled about 50 yards before 
hitting another vehicle and coming to a stop witnesses said 
pieces of seats and windshield covered the street 
earth first spokesman daniel barron identified the victims as 
bari a passenger in the white subaru station wagon registered in 
her name and cherney the driver 
bari suffered facial injuries and a pelvic fracture and was in 
serious but stable condition at highland hospital hospital 
spokesman david berry said cherney was treated for a minor injury 
above his left eye berry said 
no other injuries were reported 
supporters were infuriated by the suggestion that bari and 
cherney might have been transporting a bomb 
local earth firsters are totally outraged we know both of 
them to be completely nonviolent said organization spokeswoman 
kelpie wilson 
about 30 members of seeds of peace a group that works with 
earth first waited inside the lobby of the oakland police 
department on thursday night where they said police and fbi were 
questioning cherney 
the activists said they would stay there until police let 
cherney go one woman who would not give her name accused the 
police of trying to frame the injured environmentalists 
preliminary investigation indicates it was a device that 
exploded inside the vehicle and its been characterized by 
police as a pipe bomb fbi spokesman duke diedrich he said he 
did not know where the bomb was in the car 
bari and cherney were organizers of the upcoming redwood 
summer campaign to slow what some environmentalists say is 
excessive logging in california earth first spokeswoman kelpie 
wilson said 
redwood summer is based on the nonviolent civil rights movement 
of the 1960s wilson said 
in an interview published sunday in the san jose mercury news 
bari said she has received several death threats in recent months 
other earth first members involved in antilogging activities 
were attacked by loggers during demonstrations in ukiah last year 
in august a logging truck rammed into the back of a car driven by 
bari and carrying her two young daughters and the child of another 
activist 
wilson said bari is a wellknown eco warrior who advocated 
tree spiking the driving of long metal spikes into trees to 
damage lumbering equipment 
for the redwood summer campaign earth first members on the 
northern california coast had vowed to give up such radical 
activities for more peaceful practices

two congressional panels are looking into 
whether sweetheart contracts are allowing concessionaires to 
rake in excessive profits at national parks 
our national parks were established for people not for 
profiteers rep bruce vento dminn said thursday as his house 
subcommittee on national parks and public lands considered two 
interior department reports critical of concessionaire practices 
the departments inspector general said many longterm 
contracts at times running more than 30 years are allowing 
concessionaires to earn a much greater return on investment than 
they could expect elsewhere 
as a result he said the federal government has earned about 
100 million less in fees since 1984 than it should have received 
and 90 million more will be lost over the next four years he said 
the contracts often include a clause making it virtually impossible 
to renegotiate unless the concessionaire agrees to do so 
investigators also found little attempt to promote competition 
once a contract is up for renewal the interior department report 
suggested 
interior secretary manuel lujan in december ordered the 
investigation as well as a report on concessionaires by a national 
park service task force 
he promised to change the way contracts are negotiated seek 
higher franchise fees and shorten the duration of contracts but he 
told the subcommittee he does not think legislative changes are 
needed 
in addition to ventos panel a subcommittee of the house 
government operations committee dealing with the environment and 
natural resources is expected to hold hearings soon on the parks 
concession issue 
while concessions at smaller parks frequently are run by mom 
and pop operations concessionaires at large parks often are 
subsidiaries of such major corporations as the mca inc 
entertainment giant whose park amp curry co operates at yosemite 
national park 
concession contracts usually are written by inexperienced local 
park officials officials said 
park service employees who are trained as park rangers are 
outmatched when dealing with sophisticated business executives and 
their accountants james richards interior inspector general 
told ventos subcommittee 
richards said concessionaires reported 500 million in gross 
receipts from national park operations in 1988 while the 
government collected only 125 million in franchise fees 
fourteen companies accounted for more than half of the receipts 
and about 62 million in fees he said 
these findings seem to paint a picture of sweetheart deals 
whether intended as such or not resulting in excess profits at 
taxpayer expense said vento 
the conference of national park concessioners obtained a 
temporary restraining order in federal court late wednesday to keep 
major portions of inspector generals report from being released 
on the grounds that financial information was proprietary 
portions of the report circulated at thursdays hearing were 
blanked out in compliance with the court order so that financial 
information about specific concessionaires at specific parks could 
not be read the interior department contends the data should be 
made public 
richards said the government frequently has agreed to low 
franchise fees in exchange for promises by concessionaires to make 
park improvements but he said those improvements usually allow a 
concessionaire to make more money without directly enhancing the 
park 
in one instance the government sought to promote sales of 
indian crafts by not including revenue from such sales in the 
formula used to determine a franchise fee 
the concessionaire sold 45 million worth of crafts over four 
years at profit margin of 122 percent said richards estimating 
the government lost 2 million under the fee arrangement

five companies that usually compete for 
aerospace business will work as a team with government permission 
to develop an airplane 25 times faster than sound 
they will work as if they were one said lee beach nasas 
director of the national aerospace plane project each company 
will share in all of the data which is a very different kind of 
thing than they are used to 
the goal is to have the nasp known as the x30 flying by 
19961997 if the project gets a final goahead three years from 
now the x30 will be a research vehicle to develop technologies 
for planes of the future 
this is not a fullscale development program for an 
operational vehicle beach said we are talking about a 
technical demonstration program 
the x30 would fly directly into orbit from a conventional 
runway unlike the space shuttle which requires a booster rocket 
and an expendable fuel tank for launching it also would be capable 
of longrange hypersonic travel within the atmosphere 
the five companies forming the new national contractor team are 
general dynamics mcdonnell douglas rockwell international 
rockwells rocketdyne division and pratt amp whitney 
they agreed in january to end competition for developing the 
plane and modify fixedprice contracts with the government to 
reflect the team concept a joint nasadepartment of defense 
announcement thursday confirmed the governments acceptance of the 
plan 
the normal mode of operation would be to select an engine and 
an airframe said beach you would basically select a winner 
from competing designs and therefore good ideas from nonselected 
designs would not be used in this mode the good ideas will be put 
on the table and have the potential for inclusion in the final 
design 
barry j waldman formerly vice president and program manager of 
rocketdynes nasp efforts was selected by the team as program 
director rockwell international will be the lead contractor 
congress appropriated 254 million for the nasp project this 
year 
the immediate task said rockwells erik simonsen is to come up 
with a single configuration for the aircraft by the end of the 
year right now rockwells model mcdonnell douglas and general 
dynamics are slightly different shapes their task is to come up 
with a single shape simonsen said 
antitrust issues raised by the teaming are not expected to be a 
problem since the x30 is not a commercial product and not for 
profit 
earlier this week in an unrelated action the french aircraft 
builder aerospatiale announced an agreement to set up an 
international study group to look into the feasibility of 
building a successor to the aging supersonic concorde 
boeing and mcdonnell douglas along with the german airbus will 
cooperate with aerospatiale and british aerospace in a study for a 
concorde replacement 
aerospatiale has said if the study finds a new supersonic model 
is feasible a faster larger and longerrange plane than the 
concorde could be in the air by the year 2005

budget negotiators are beginning a twoweek 
break divided by party lines over the amount of deficit reduction 
they need and pointing fingers over who created the problem in the 
first place 
bush administration officials and congressional leaders held 
their fourth negotiating session on thursday a threehour meeting 
that participants described as argumentative 
once again they made no final decisions they continued 
debating how much they should cut from next years deficit which 
the administration now concedes could approach 206 billion 
in january bush said the shortfall appeared to be 1005 
billion and under control the white house has blamed an uncertain 
economy and the everexpanding problems of the savings and loan 
industry for the bleaker budget picture 
the days talks were overshadowed by the latest round of 
battling between president bush and congressional democrats this 
time over who is responsible for the deficit mess 
bush complained that it is congress fault telling reporters at 
the white house that congress holds the power to pass spending and 
tax bills 
people understand the congress bears a greater responsibility 
for this he said 
democrats wasted little time in firing back 
he is one of the first presidents in recent history to say 
congress has greater power than the presidency to determine the 
course of the economy said house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif i dont think anyone believes that 
others renewed their call for a presidential speech detailing 
the deficit problem and explaining why new taxes or spending cuts 
may be necessary 
bush rejected that demand again thursday democrats contrasted 
his decision with the soviet unions announcement of a referendum 
on the direction of their economy 
the leadership of the soviet union is coming forward now and 
talking about their economic problems said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn i would hope the leaders 
of this country would do likewise 
in their closeddoor meeting thursday negotiators spoke of 
seeking some combination of new taxes and spending cuts that would 
yield 45 billion to 60 billion in savings next year participants 
said 
they want to save between 425 billion to 600 billion over the 
next five years 
democrats want the higher range of savings while republicans 
prefer the lower amounts both parties realize that the higher the 
savings the more likely it is that new taxes will be needed 
threatening bushs campaign pledge to shun higher levies 
the administration also released new figures thursday that 
further boosted the possible federal cost estimate of shoring up 
the savings and loan industry 
they showed that over the next six years the bailout could cost 
from 1025 billion to 1547 billion 
a day earlier treasury secretary nicholas brady told congress 
the government will have to borrow between 90 billion and 130 
billion to clean up the sampl mess unlike bradys figures the 
numbers released thursday included the governments interest costs 
for borrowing the funds 
the administration insisted for more than a year that the bulk 
of the problem could be resolved with the 50 billion in borrowing 
authority included in the sampl bailout bill 
the talks will resume in early june when lawmakers return from 
their memorial day recess

leaders of a house subcommittee accuse federal 
aviation officials of discriminating against air traffic 
controllers who take drugs to control diabetes or aids 
the faa told a hearing of the subcommittee on the civil service 
on thursday that controllers who take the drugs insulin or azt pose 
a hazard to air safety in the sensitive job of monitoring and 
directing air traffic 
a diabetic football player with a 44 million contract a young 
air traffic controller who has been removed from the screens and a 
prominent doctor who runs a diabetics center all disagreed 
a controller who is being treated with azt after testing 
positive for the aidscausing hiv virus also said outside the 
hearing that he feels fit to continue behind the radar screens azt 
is the only drug authorized for antiviral treatment of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
reps gerry sikorski dminn subcommittee chairman and 
constance morella rmd ranking minority member said they would 
draft a letter urging the faa to change what they consider a 
discriminatory policy 
sikorski said the faa decided to exclude insulin users last 
december after a false rumor that a controller on the drug had 
collapsed on the job 
he said of the faa policy to exclude azt users lord knows 
what vague rumors that decision was based on 
thats discrimination sikorski added 
its discrimination for the sake of safety testified 
william hark an faa medical specialist 
darlene freeman faa deputy associate administrator for aviation 
standards said the agency has given administrative jobs to 22 
controllers who take insulin or azt 
she said controllers who take insulin could suffer episodes 
called hypoglycemia which can include faintness palsy confusion 
visual disturbances or weakness 
sikorski criticized the faa for its refusal to allow washington 
dulles international airport controller ron wilkinson to continue 
on the job after he began taking azt last year 
wilkinson said the faa suggested this week that he get a desk 
job at dulles he said he is under a doctors care in florida and 
believes he should be given a position there as a controller 
hark said no final action had been taken to disqualify 
wilkinson who he said went on leave in july to seek treatment for 
an undisclosed illness 
the faa official said the agency was reexamining its policy on 
azt in light of a recent reduction in the dosage given patients 
but probably would not change it without at least several months of 
study 
dr william reiter a fort lauderdale fla aids expert who is 
treating wilkinson has said that tests of patients on azt showed 
no significant sleepiness dizziness or other problems 
minnesota vikings quarterback wade wilson who spoke for the 
american diabetes association said his diabetes had not affected 
his performance as a player or his 44 million fouryear contract 
stephen j pazarena 26 said he has lost pay and any chance for 
advancement because he takes insulin he works in an administrative 
job at the indianapolis air route traffic control center 
the faa is a flying circus he said now theyve got me 
wasting away upstairs in an office 
dr robert ratner director of the diabetes center at george 
washington university said the risk of a heart attack in 
controllers with mildly high blood pressure is greater than the 
chance of an insulin user having hypoglycemia although blood 
pressure is not used to exclude controllers

manuel noriegas defense lawyers saying they were 
betrayed by the us attorneys office in a botched deal to pay 
their fees have threatened to reveal the details of the cias 
secret payments to their client 
a prosecutionsponsored proposal to have the government pay the 
lawyers as much as 350 an hour fell apart thursday when a federal 
judge said he could find no legal basis for the arrangment 
opponents had called it a legal slush fund for noriega 
as their part of the deal noriegas defense had agreed to 
postpone a showdown over 11 million they say their client received 
from the cia and other intelligence agencies that agreement is now 
void lead defense attorney frank rubino said after a hearing on 
the issue 
they couldnt take the heat that came out over this 
agreement rubino said of the us attorneys office now we 
shall litigate every dime gen noriegas been paid by this 
government and we shall litigate it as publicly as possible 
us district judge william hoeveler said both sides must now go 
back and litigate the issue of 20 million seized by federal 
authorities in 27 bank accounts around the world and said he 
wanted a quick resolution the defense is demanding some of the 
money to pay expenses they estimate could reach 5 million they 
say the government has hired two dozen attorneys to prosecute their 
client and is prepared to spend almost 40 million 
hoeveler has questioned the prosecutions contention that the 
frozen money is all drugrelated and their reluctance to turn any 
of it over to noriega 
the judge said the final word was his 
i will take the government the us attorney off the hot 
seat ill make the decision the judge said 
noriega who agreed to the arrangement in court monday is 
jailed in the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami he 
was brought to florida after surrendering to us troops in panama 
on jan 4 two weeks after they invaded the country 
the former panamanian leader is charged in a february 1988 
indictment with turning panama into a way station for colombias 
medellin drug cartel accepting 46 million in bribes to allow 
them to process and ship cocaine to the united states through his 
central american country 
the deal for the government to pay noriegas legal fees began to 
unravel when outside attorneys questioned the plan they said 
federal law only sanctions the payment of 75 an hour to one 
attorney for a defendant 
michael okane a defense attorney for noriega codefendent 
daniel miranda fired off a letter to the us comptroller of the 
currency okane argued that the government has no right to pay the 
excess fees nor to accept an assignment from noriega to pay back 
the treasury 
the conservative washington legal foundation also wrote the 
judge to complain 
congress simply did not appropriate a legal slush fund to be 
paid to noriegas attorneys im sorry said paul kamenar 
executive director of the foundation 
the deal also was denounced on the floor of congress 
us attorney dexter lehtinen denied at thursdays hearing that 
his office ever specifically approved government payment of fees 
over the 75 per hour 
there is not actually any agreement here or deal lehtinen 
told hoeveler but he suggested the judge could salvage the 
arrangement by declaring the fee limit law unconstitutional because 
it violated noriegas right to a fair trial 
hoeveler expressed doubt about taking such action he said the 
collapse of the deal has brought us back to square one

the democratic party says it collected 36 
million in socalled soft money in the past 16 months with the 
biggest donations coming from major labor unions and scores more 
from major corporations and rich americans 
the democratic national committee released a list of 550 soft 
money donors on thursday a month after the republican party 
allowed access to a list of 4200 donors who gave 7 million to its 
soft money accounts last year 
neither party has to disclose its soft money receipts because 
the money is kept in accounts that do not have to be reported to 
the federal election commission but both have faced public 
pressure to list the donors because of criticism of the loophole by 
public interest groups 
also thursday the fec released a report detailing fund raising 
and spending by the two parties in the first 15 months of the 1990 
cycle january 1989 through march 1990 that analysis based on 
reports to the fec from the three major fundraising arms of each 
party showed the gop with a clear edge 
soft money is used by the political parties to pay for 
administrative costs voter registration and other election 
activities in targeted areas in the 1988 presidential election 
the parties raised a combined 40 million in such funds tapping 
labor unions and corporations for huge donations that cannot 
legally be made directly to campaigns most of the money is 
funneled through state parties making it difficult to track in a 
comprehensive fashion 
critics of the soft money loophole contend it allows otherwise 
illegal campaign contributions by unions corporations and banks 
and gives the wealthy too much political influence curbs on soft 
money is among the issues being debated as the senate considers 
changes to election financing laws party leaders contend the money 
helps pay for legitimate partybuilding activities 
the dnc said it raised 24 million for its softmoney accounts 
last year and 12 million through the end of april this year a 
party statement said 52 percent of the soft money spent last year 
went to candidates and related election programs twentynine 
percent went to administrative costs and 19 percent for new 
fundraising costs 
virtually every major labor union made hefty donations to the 
dnc softmoney accounts with the united autoworkers united 
steelworkers national education association and american 
federation of state county and municipal employees giving 100000 
or more 
allied signal archer daniels midland atampt general electric 
general dynamics shell oil phillip morris upjohn and warner 
communications were among the major corporate donors to the 
democrats prominent democratic fundraiser monte friedkin of 
florida was listed as a 100000 donor more common were individual 
donations in the 1000 to 15000 range some were as low as 200 
the separate fec report covered the first 15 months of the 1990 
election cycle january 1989 through march 1990 
the fec said the republican national committee the national 
republican senatorial committee and the national republican 
congressional committee raised a combined 1126 million in the 
15month period 
that was more than four times the 244 million raised during 
the period by the three democratic groups the dnc the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee and the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
the three gop groups spent 996 million in the 15 months 
compared with 242 million in spending by the three democratic 
groups much of the spending was for 10 special congressional 
elections held in the past year contests this november involve 34 
senate seats and all 435 house seats 
democrats are incumbents in most of this falls races the 
republicans fundraising advantages is offset in many cases by the 
incumbents individual fundraising powers 
of the 1126 million raised in 15 months the gop groups gave a 
combined 117 million to house and senate candidates while the 
democrats donated 940103 to congressional candidates much of it 
for special elections 
the republican groups gave 11 million to other party 
organizations primarily to state parties for special elections 
compared with slightly more than 500000 in democratic donations 
to state party organizations in the same period 
the gop groups reported combined debts of 1 million virtually 
all of it owed by the house campaign group the democratic groups 
owed 17 million of which 13 million was reported by the 
partys cashstrapped house campaign body

south korean president roh taewoo told lawmakers 
today that japan must openly deal with the dark side of its history 
if it wants to present a new image to asians 
there must be true understanding between our two peoples on 
the basis of truth so that a bright future can be ensured for our 
bilateral relationship roh said in the first speech by a south 
korean president to a joint session of japans diet or parliament 
roh also urged the japanese to improve the status of roughly 
680000 koreans living in japan most of whom are the descendants 
of people brought from korea as forced laborers before and during 
world war ii 
only when they become able to live in this land as good 
neighbors of the japanese and without artificial inconvenience 
will both our peoples feel genuine friendship to each other roh 
said 
although many of the koreans living here were born and raised in 
japan few have taken the trouble to be naturalized as japanese 
citizens as aliens they must be fingerprinted and are not 
eligible for many jobs such as teaching in schools or the civil 
service 
roh was on the second day of a state visit to japan that is 
aimed at healing the stillfestering wounds from japans 191045 
colonization of the korean peninsula 
on thursday prime minister toshiki kaifu and emperor akihito 
offered the most explicit apologies ever for japans harsh colonial 
rule akihito expressed deepest regret for japanese actions 
and kaifu acknowledged that japan had inflicted unbearable 
suffering and sorrow on the korean people 
although japan and south korea normalized their diplomatic ties 
25 years ago relations between the two countries are still cool 
roh is only the second korean head of government to visit japan 
since 1965 
roh contrasted japanesekorean relations with the close ties 
developing among european countries that were bitter enemies in 
world war ii 
roh said a psychological barrier prevents the development of 
friendship and bilateral ties he poignantly recalled how japanese 
colonialists refused to allow korean schoolchildren to use their 
korean names and native language 
the south korean president praised japans stunning economic 
recovery after the war and development of parliamentary democracy 
japan has now become a new country much different from what 
it used to be roh said 
but he added when japan fully opens up to history and the 
world it will be able to present a new image especially to 
asians 
roh held forth a vision of a future with a tunnel under the 
125mile korea strait that would link japan and korea and permit 
people from both countries to journey together on a tour of 
friendship to link continents and make all humanity one family 
in south korea many koreans were not willing to accept the 
words of regret expressed by the emperor and other japanese leaders 
thousands of radical students staged violent antijapanese 
protests thursday burning japanese flags and demanding that roh 
cancel his humiliating visit to tokyo elderly citizens have 
staged noisy protests for 10 days in front of the japanese embassy 
its not enough to satisfy the peoples sentiments toward 
japan we can hardly accept akihitos remarks as an apology said 
park yungnok a vice president of the opposition party for peace 
and democracy

relatives of a gunners mate blamed by navy investigators for an 
explosion that killed him and 46 other sailors aboard the uss iowa 
hailed the decision to reopen the probe 
my son is not guilty the navy was barking up the wrong 
tree earl hartwig said of the announcement thursday 
the navy concluded last september that the april 19 1989 blast 
probably was sabotage by hartwigs son clayton hartwig who navy 
investigators claimed was disgruntled over his treatment 
the pentagon said it was reopening the investigation and 
ordering an end to the firing of 16inch guns aboard all 
battleships after the unexplained ignition of bags of gunpowder 
during testing at sandia national laboratory in new mexico 
i consider this a total victory said hartwigs sister 
kathy kubicina 
the navys announcement came the day before the general 
accounting office congress watchdog agency was to release a 
report on the investigation and conclusions the gao report based 
on testing at sandia was expected to show there was no conclusive 
evidence that a detonator device was placed between gunpowder bags 
igniting gunpowder and creating a huge fireball at one of the 
ships gun turrets 
hartwigs father said the gao report forced the navy to reassess 
its earlier conclusion 
it seems awful strange that the navy pulled this now that the 
lab findings are coming out said hartwig who was a navy 
gunners mate in world war ii 
families of other iowa victims also were overjoyed with the 
navys decision to reopen the probe but said there is much work to 
be done to determine what happened aboard the iowa 
i hope they go back to square one on the investigation said 
darleen schelin whose son geoffrey was killed i hope the 
investigation will be unbiased 
the navy report drew protests from some of the families of the 
dead sailors the relatives demanded that the investigation be 
reopened 
nancy lewis whose son richard died in the blast kept the 
families in touch about the investigation through a newsletter she 
said many families had doubts about the stability of the powder 
used to fire the iowas massive guns 
this is a tremendous sense of relief that we may finally get 
to the bottom of this ms lewis said i have always felt that 
there was something unsafe 
ms kubicina has said green fragments found in some of the iowa 
corpses would prove the gunpowder was old and more likely to 
explode the gunpowder on the battleship had been stored on barges 
in extreme heat and had started to turn green a sign of 
deterioration she said 
critics of the navy investigation have contended the navy 
ignored numerous possible causes of the explosion in order to find 
a scapegoat 
sharon ziegler whose husband reginald died in the explosion 
said he had complained several times about conditions in the turret 
where the blast occurred 
i think it was an accident waiting to happen she said

the government says that as part 
of its marketoriented reform it will cut all food subsidies and 
raise the prices of about 30000 items in july by an average of 
nearly 25 percent 
annual food subsidies totaling 168 billion in a yearly budget 
of 263 billion will be diverted to other sectors of the economy 
price office chairman vladimir dvorak told reporters thursday 
communist authorities kept food prices steady and relatively low 
during their 41year rule that ended last year after massive 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
dvorak described the removal of food subsidies as a 
preparatory step to the rectification of price relations in our 
economy another step in gradual transition to market economy 
convertible currencies and world prices 
the measure will increase the prices of about 30000 items by an 
average of 246 percent effective july 9 dvorak said the increase 
will hit milk and dairy products by as much as 51 percent while 
prices of meat will go up only moderately 
the official said meat prices will remain partially subsidized 
labor minister petr miller said the country intends to fully 
decontrol its prices by the first of next year miller also 
confirmed energy costs and other consumer goods prices will rise as 
much as 30 percent in autumn 
a 25 percent rise in the price of cigarettes and a doubling of 
bus and rail fares were announced wednesday 
asked about inflation in czechoslovakia which is currently 
estimated at 7 percent to 8 percent annually dvorak said the price 
increases this year are likely to take that figure above 10 percent

a push to open adoption records is illadvised 
and may violate the privacy rights of people trying to put a 
painful past behind them according to a group representing more 
than 100 adoption agencies 
we believe in protecting the privacy of those that want to 
maintain their privacy while allowing those that want to have 
contact to have it said mary beth seader of the national 
committee for adoption 
women who made adoption plans 20 years ago may not want to see 
that child seader said thursday some adopted people also do 
not want to have that contact 
seader was reacting to a renewed effort by another group 
involved in the adoption issue the american adoption congress to 
change laws to allow adoptees birth parents and adoptive parents 
access to adoption records 
historically adoption records have been sealed but alabama 
alaska and kansas have enacted laws opening them 
several other states including california and pennsylvania are 
considering such measures said kate burke president of the 
washington dcbased adoption congress it represents some 50000 
people who have been personally involved in adoption 
adoption groups estimate that about 5 million people in the 
united states are adopted 
burke said open records make sense from a medical standpoint 
enabling adoptees to be aware for example of illnesses they may 
have inherited 
perhaps more importantly she said is the gutlevel need to 
know 
what most adoptees feel is that gnawing need to know where 
they came from burke said adoptees grow up frequently 
with a lack of selfesteem and other problems the reunion is a 
very healing process for adoptees as well as birth parents 
the national committee for adoption also based in washington 
and representing 146 nonprofit adoption agencies favors a mutual 
consent registry like those currently in place in 22 states 
seader said 
seaders group favors an exchange of medical information between 
adoptees and their birth parents that exchange is possible 
without sharing identifying information she said 
the american adoption congress said a registry doesnt go far 
enough 
the bond to that birth mother is always there said ken 
watson chairman of the child welfare league of americas national 
adoption task force we can separate the child legally but we 
cannot cut that psychological bond 
the best we can do when we put a child in an adoption is to 
allow the child and the adoptive parents to respect that bond and 
to support that child in reexploring it he said 
some group members believe the adoption process itself should be 
changed and relations among birth parents adoptive parents and 
the adoptee should be encouraged 
seader disagrees 
that kind of relation denies what adoption is all about she 
said adoption is creating a family for a child we need to 
protect the integrity of that family 
the conference which opened thursday was being attended by 
about 500 people

scientists are looking at a type of immune 
cell that attacks nerve tissue in the brain and may be a cause of 
multiple sclerosis 
separate research in boston and stanford university isolated two 
types of immune cells found in the brain tissue of ms victims 
understanding the role these cells play in the crippling disease 
could help in developing a way to control it 
in a study published today in the journal science dr david a 
hafler of harvard and the brigham and womens hospital in boston 
said his team isolated from the blood samples of multiple sclerosis 
patients a unique immune cell that attacks myelin the nerve tissue 
that is destroyed in the ms disease process 
hafler in a telephone interview said the specific immune cell 
was isolated in high numbers from the blood of five multiple 
sclerosis patients but was found in only very small numbers in the 
blood of five people who do not have ms 
the researcher said it is very likely that other types of immune 
cells also are involved in the ms disease process but that the 
cell found by his team may have a major role 
another research group led by dr lawrence steinman of stanford 
university reported on thursday in the journal nature that they 
had isolated another type of immune cell from the brain tissue of 
patients with ms the cells found in the brain studies by 
steinmans group are different from the cells isolated by the 
hafler group from the blood of ms patients 
but both of the cells found by the two groups are parts of the 
immune system called tcells normally tcells are a vital to the 
bodys defense against infection the body makes them by the 
millions and each type is equipped with a type of receptor a 
protein that is attracted to specific viruses or bacteria 
in ms it is believed that for some reason not now understood 
the receptors on some tcells are attracted to myelin this causes 
the tcells to attack the nerve tissue as if it were an enemy of 
the body such an action called an autoimmune response leads to 
the crippling of ms 
hafler said that by identifying the specific tcells that play a 
role in ms researchers could design drugs that would cause these 
enemy tcells to be killed or inactivated 
eventually said hafler his group will propose tests in ms 
patients of a medication that would specifically attack the 
vbeta17 tcells found by his group 
whether or not this will cure the disease will have to await 
the clinical trials he said most likely said hafler we 
would have to identify all tcells involved in ms and learn how to 
turn all of them off or eliminate them before the disease could be 
absolutely controlled 
such clinical trials are still years away said hafler 
dr stephen reingold the vice president for research at the 
national multiple sclerosis society said studies by the hafler and 
steinman groups are complementary and are important advances in 
the battle against ms 
the impact of these studies is that as we get closer to an 
understanding of this disease there is a possibility of developing 
a specific immunotherapy that would block the nerve tissue damage 
caused by the enemy tcells said reingold 
hafler said the brigham and womens hospital research team took 
blood samples from ms patients and isolated tcells that react to 
the protein that is in myelin the group then tested this group of 
tcells to identify the specific amino acid chains in each cell 
the researchers found that in 36 of 64 tcell samples from ms 
patients there was a tcell type called vbeta17 
a similar study on blood from people without ms found that only 
9 percent of the tcell samples contained the vbeta17 amino acid 
chain 
hafler said that the finding suggests that many people may have 
the vbeta17 cells in their bodies but that something causes the 
immune cells to turn on and start attacking brain or nerve 
cells 
if you dont have any tcells in you that recognize react to 
the brain then you will never get ms he said if you do have 
tcells that can recognize brain then something else has to happen 
for the disease to develop we havent identified yet what that 
is 
coauthors of the science paper with hafler were howard l 
weiner kw wucherpfennig kohei ota noriaki endo jg seidman 
and anthony rosenzweig of the harvard medical school

britains opposition labor party riding 
high in the polls against prime minister margaret thatcher easily 
retained its seat in this labor stronghold in a parliamentary 
special election results showed today 
the vote thursday came as the party unveiled a moderate platform 
that marked the climax of a major policy shift 
in the balloting labors mike carr polled 75 percent of the vote 
in bootle a town 155 miles northwest of london that encompasses 
liverpools docks 
james clappison the candidate for the governing conservative 
party polled 9 percent or 3220 votes compared to carrs 26737 
the liberal democrats took third place with 3179 votes going to 
their candidate john cunningham 
the special election was held to fill the seat held by allan 
roberts who died in march 
the labor party led by neil kinnock has led opinion polls for 
more than a year sometimes by as much as 20 points and the party 
hammered the conservatives at local government elections earlier 
this month achieving a huge 11 percent swing against the government 
the popularity of mrs thatcher and her conservative party has 
been weakened by high interest rates rising inflation which hit 
an eightyear high of 94 percent in april and an unpopular new 
local government tax paid by all adults which replaces property 
taxes paid only by homeowners 
the next election does not have to be held until mid1992 there 
is speculation however mrs thatcher may call one in march 1991

auditors say roman catholic relief services in 
india misused food for underfed women and children but church 
officials say they are guilty of weak management but not theft the 
washington post reported today 
the audit accused indian catholic church officials of using 
shortweighing measuring devices for distributing food creating 
false lists of food recipients improperly using donations to 
support commercial businesses and deliberately concocting 
inaccurate records to hide abuses 
indias catholics receive about 25 million in food from the 
united states each year the us agency for international 
development asked the auditing firm of price waterhouse to 
investigate the program 
the audit report concludes that the food program was operated 
in an atmosphere whereby the commodities could be misused with 
little risk of detection the newspaper said in a dispatch from 
new delhi 
the audit report did not however charge the bishops priests 
and nuns involved with outright theft and no individuals were 
identified 
unidentified sources were quoted as saying the audit was not 
broad enough to determine whether the church officials had 
deliberately stolen large amounts of food 
however catholic relief services based in baltimore was 
criticized for not closely monitoring the distribution of us 
government food and inadequately overseeing the activities of the 
indian church officials 
the newspaper said us officials were reviewing whether the 
church group should be allowed to continue as a subcontractor in 
the us aid food program in india the largest effort of its kind 
in the world 
catholic relief services sharply disputed the audit findings 
claiming in a letter to aid that the conclusions were based on 
factual errors speculation and at times misrepresentation 
and that the auditors had unfairly extrapolated the violations of a 
few churches and convents 
we admit the management is weak but i dont think there is 
widespread abuse in the program james deharpporte chairman of 
the catholic relief services program in india was quoted as 
saying do you think mother theresa is corrupt 
unidentified us officials were quoted as saying they believed 
problems uncovered by price waterhouse were serious and widespread

government and business leaders said today 
president bushs decision to continue favorable trade status for 
beijing is welcome news for this british colony that relies heavily 
on commerce with china 
trade and industry secretary john chan called bushs move 
thursday very good news from hong kongs point of view 
in a statement he noted that the business community and 
government had engaged in intensive lobbying during the past few 
weeks to explain how termination of special trade status would harm 
hong kong which will return to chinese sovereignty in 1997 
seto fai honorary president of the chinese manufacturers 
association said the us decision will help prevent hong kong 
from sliding into economic recession 
hong kong is already experiencing a slowing of economic growth 
and could not afford to stand a blow from the united states he 
said now we have at least another year to breathe 
the news drew little response from the stock market which had 
rallied sharply earlier in the week on expectation that bush would 
renew chinas mostfavorednation trade status 
the bluechip hang seng index today rose 20 points in early 
trading before finishing the morning session virtually unchanged at 
3049 the market had gained 130 points in the preceding five 
sessions largely on anticipation of the us decision 
mostfavorednation status gives chinese exports to the united 
states the lowest possible tariffs denial would send tariffs 
rising sharply on about 12 billion in annual imports from china of 
textiles toys and other products 
much of the chinese exports to the united states are produced in 
jointventure factories set up by hong kong investors in southern 
china about 70 percent of chinese products sent to the us market 
are shipped through hong kong seto said 
hong kong nowadays shares an inseparable economic link with 
china any threat to sanction china economically would inevitably 
drag us into it said carson chan assistant director for the 
federation of hong kong industries 
he said termination of the special trade status for china would 
have resulted in at least 20000 hong kong people losing their jobs 
in industries such as trade transportation and banking 
hong kongs economy already is experiencing high inflation and 
sluggish growth with the gross domestic product forecast to rise 
only 3 percent this year 
industrialists expressed confidence that the us congress will 
not reject bushs decision despite opposition by some lawmakers

a hitandrun victim who crawled into 
the brushy median of a freeway and spent four days and nights lying 
there is making a remarkable recovery doctors said 
juan francisco camacho 20 was returning home to a northern san 
diego county migrant camp may 5 after looking for work when he was 
hit while walking along the inside shoulder of interstate 5 it was 
shortly after dark 
camacho an undocumented worker who has lived in the united 
states since 1986 said he never heard the car coming 
the only thing i heard was music american music camacho 
said from his bed at scripps memorial hospital where he was in 
fair condition thursday 
as the driver sped away camacho crawled into the median 
shrouded by thick oleander bushes to avoid being hit again i 
crawled so i could get beneath a tree he said i was rolling 
and dragging myself 
doctors said the car apparently hit camacho from behind 
shattering his midsection 
when we got him he was in shock from loss of blood and his 
blood pressure was down to about 60 which is about half the normal 
pressure said dr edgar gamboa a trauma surgeon at scripps 
he was dehydrated he had a dislocated knee and his pelvis was 
cracked open like a book there was bacteria and infection from all 
the dirt in his wounds 
as cars whizzed past camacho the first night and day he shouted 
for help in spanish and rattled a small tree branch overhead to try 
to attract attention he had nothing to eat but soon noticed a 
water sprinkler nearby and crawled to it so he could sip water to 
stay alive 
as the days passed camacho said he entered a daydream state 
he recalled talking to himself and imagining that the telephone 
wires overhead were answering back 
eventually he lost the feeling in his legs and on the fourth 
day decided to crawl back out by the road to become more visible 
a northbound motorist spotted him during rush hour that 
afternoon and called 911 from camp pendleton 
i was shocked gamboa said its really incredible that 
hes still here even if trauma victims get treatment within the 
first hour many people still die from these types of injuries 
even after we got him in the hospital we half expected him to 
die for the first two days 
doctors say camacho survived probably because he was in good 
physical condition and none of his vital organs were crushed that 
and his determination to live 
how long could he have survived theres no way of telling 
gamboa said i guess it was up to him 
camachos recovery is expected to take several months he 
wonders who hit him and why they didnt stop but says hes not 
angry about it 
for me its not a problem i just thank god im better 
camacho said

thousands of accidents and injuries could be 
prevented by a proposed federal rule that would require new light 
trucks and vans to be equipped with center highmounted rear brake 
lamps says the governments top highway safety official 
the national highway traffic safety administration proposed the 
regulation thursday four years after requiring the rear lamps on 
new cars 
the extra light is effective because it signals just one 
thing braking action said jerry r curry administrator of the 
agency it cant be confused with rear lights or turn signals it 
is in the direct line of sight of the following driver forming a 
triangle with the other two brake lamps 
the regulation would require the lamps on all light trucks and 
vans by the 1993 model year giving manufacturers time for design 
changes curry said 
a similar requirement imposed on cars in 1986 has been 
successful he said pointing out that cars with the center brake 
lights experience 17 percent fewer rearend collisions than those 
without 
the proposed regulation will be printed in the federal register 
opening a 60day public comment period after which the agency will 
decide what action to take 
the law would apply to multipurpose passenger vehicles 
including minivans and sportutility vehicles pickups and other 
trucks under 10000 pounds and small buses

if sen phil gramm has his way congress will 
soon take the unprecedented step of dictating how the district of 
columbia spends part of its annual payment from the federal 
government 
gramm told mayor marion barry during a hearing on the citys 
budget thursday that he wants to earmark part of the annual payment 
for the police department 
city police overtime patrols particularly in the citys upscale 
georgetown section were recently threatened by funding shortages 
im not into trying to play mayor but something is wrong 
when people are being notified to stay out of georgetown at night 
because we dont have police officers the texas republican said 
congress which has review power over all city law has never 
told the city how to spend any of the annual payment it receives 
from the federal government 
under gramms plan an unspecified portion of the proposed 
4305 million payment would be spent on the police department 
sen brock adams who chairs the senate appropriations committee 
that oversees the district also told barry he was concerned about 
the citys spending priorities 
congress has been increasingly critical of the citys crime 
situation over the past two years during which the district has 
set two annual murder records and witnessed dramatic increases in 
drugrelated crime 
congress last year gave the city 317 million extra to help 
fight the drug war 
barry assured the panel the district will use money from the 
special payment to cover the unexpectedly high overtime costs 
no one in this city is more concerned about public safety than 
i am said barry who is awaiting trial on drug possession and 
perjury charges

a woman who won a bitter custody battle 
for seven frozen embryos says she no longer wants them and will 
donate them to her fertility clinic with hopes someone else can 
use them 
mary sue stowe described her decision in papers filed with the 
tennessee court of appeals her exhusband junior lewis davis has 
appealed a ruling in the couples divorce case last september that 
granted her temporary custody over the embryos 
blount county circuit judge dale young had ruled that life 
begins at conception and the embryos deserved the same legal 
status as children would have in custody disputes between their 
parents 
youngs ruling prevented mrs stowe from using the embryos until 
the appeals were settled 
she does not wish us to discuss her decision mrs stowes 
lawyer kurt erlenbach said thursday its a very private matter 
and a very hard decision she made it within the last few weeks 
mrs stowe who remarried in december had testified that the 
embryos represented her best chance to have a child davis said he 
did not want the embryos used without his consent 
mrs stowe who moved from maryville to titusville fla after 
the ruling needs the courts consent and the consent of her 
exhusband to donate the embryos erlenbach said adding he 
believed davis opposed donation 
oral arguments on davis appeal were scheduled for june 6 
telephone calls to the home of janet mayfield one of davis 
attorneys went unanswered late thursday and his other lawyer 
charles clifford has an unpublished home telephone number 
the embryos were produced through in vitro fertilization in 
december 1988 after the couples continued efforts to have children 
resulted in mrs stowe having five tubal pregnancies 
after two of nine fertilized eggs were unsuccessfully implanted 
the others were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at the 
knoxville clinic they will have been frozen two years in december 
erlenbach said 
doctors have told mrs stowe she has a 52 percent of giving 
birth from one of the seven embryos erlenbach said

a new sex survey conducted in china says 
attitudes have liberalized in the past decade of openness to the 
outside world but that there is a great need for sex education 
i believe that chinese concepts of sex are in a process of 
change said liu daling whose shanghai sex sociological research 
center conducted the survey weve broken through some of the old 
concepts but not completely 
the june 4 military crackdown on dissent last year almost killed 
the survey before it got under way as foreign investors withdrew 
funding and some leaders said the projects timing was 
inappropriate 
but liu solved the funding crisis by dipping into his own 
savings by august hundreds of volunteers were interviewing 
married couples students and sex criminals in 15 provinces of the 
worlds most populous nation of 12 billion 
interviewers often faced resistance from a population not used 
to discussing details of their private lives 
they didnt understand why someone would want to ask that kind 
of question how many times do you have sex with your husband each 
month liu explained theyd say why do you want to ask this 
are you kidding 
while most of the respondents were given a written form to fill 
out and deposit in a sealed box to maintain secrecy illiterate 
peasants were questioned verbally 
by october about 23000 usable questionnaires were completed 
and what the respondents had to say indicated a change of attitudes 
for what long has been a prudish society 
as an example more than half of the married respondents said 
they do not limit sexual intercourse to only the missionary 
position which liu described as a departure from past practice 
the survey also found 54 percent of city dwellers and 44 percent 
of peasants do not object to extramarital affairs attitudes that 
liu said would have been espoused by only a small minority just 10 
years ago nearly 15 percent of married city women who were 
questioned acknowledged having one or more affair 
liu who was in hong kong this week to attend a seminar on 
sexology said in an interview that 90 percent of the married 
respondents expressed some degree of satisfaction with their sex 
lives 
about onefourth of village women and onethird of city women 
said they often experienced pleasant feelings during 
intercourse and many others said they had such feelings 
occassionally 
up to onethird of the surveyed women said they did not miss 
their spouses when they left home for an extended period of time 
about onethird of respondents also said they thought their lives 
would be better had they married someone else 
the survey also found that while chinese couples typically have 
sex four to seven times a month it can be a painful and 
perfunctory experience 
about 45 percent of city women and 37 percent of peasant women 
said they experienced pain during intercourse often or sometimes 
says liu onethird of respondents in villages and 17 percent in 
cities said they usually spend less than one minute on foreplay 
its a little like animals said liu they start as soon 
as they hit the bed 
communist chinas statecontrolled media has yet to report 
details of the survey although a brief xinhua news agency report 
noted that the findings show sex education should be strengthened 
and the spread of pornography has seriously affected the healthy 
growth of young people 
among the many campaigns launched in the past year by chinas 
conservative leadership has been a crackdown on pornography and 
prostitution which have become particularly widespread in the 
countrys relatively open coastal regions 
liu applauds the antipornography sweep but says sex education 
is even more important for society to develop properly 
besides learning the basics such as contraception he believes

defense lawyers asked a judge to dismiss an 
indictment against an art gallery showing photographs by the late 
robert mapplethorpe saying the gallery is immune from ohio 
obscenity laws 
the lawyers on thursday also asked hamilton county judge david 
j albanese to dismiss the charges on grounds that prosecutors 
unfairly singled out the contemporary arts center gallery and its 
director dennis barrie 
marc mezibov who represents barrie said that even if seven 
photographs cited in the indictment are found obscene ohio law 
exempts material exhibited for a proper purpose by artistic and 
educational institutions 
do you think the us supreme court would buy that albanese 
asked during a threehour hearing 
oh absolutely mezibov said what these laws are all 
about is an attempt to eliminate commercial hardcore pornography 
the cac is not in the profitmaking business they are an 
educational institution 
senior assistant city prosecutor frank prouty disagreed 
the issue here is not their status the issue is whether what 
they displayed is obscene he said 
albanese did not say when he would rule on the defense request 
or the contention that prosecutors singled out the gallery 
at least some of the pictures in the indictment are available in 
books at the university of cincinnati and on display at the 
cincinnati art museum said h louis sirkin who represents the 
arts center 
im not here to get these institutions in trouble im here to 
point out that law enforcement officers were well aware that the 
material was available he said 
the arguments by mezibov and sirkin came after albanese let the 
city amend the indictment to add references to us supreme court 
obscenity and child pornography standards 
the judge granted proutys request that the indictment allege 
that the two pictures featuring children in the 175photograph 
exhibit include a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on genitals 
albanese also agreed to have the indictment allege that five 
other pictures depicting sex acts meet supreme court requirements 
that obscene material violate community standards depict clearly 
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value 
its clear that the state can amend that charge so long as 
the defendants have a chance to prepare for a trial the judge 
said 
barrie and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity and 
using children in material involving nudity if convicted they 
face 6000 in fines and barrie faces six months in jail 
their lawyers had argued that the indictment accused them of no 
crime referring only to depictions of sex acts and nude children 
which are not automatically obscene 
albanese also rejected a defense request to see a transcript 
from the county grand jury that returned the charges april 7 
defense lawyers said the indictment doesnt indicate whether 
grand jurors were told of supreme court standards that pictures 
found to have artistic value cant be ruled obscene 
albanese refused to violate the traditional confidentiality of 
the grand jury noting that a county common pleas court judge had 
reviewed the transcript before refusing a similar request last 
month

one of cabeys lawyers ronald kuby said he had seen goetz 
videotape the tape proves nothing but that darrell knew what he 
had for lunch and knew who the mayor of new york was on dec 27

bernhard goetz to sink he continued he harbors a murderous 
and sadistic hatred for darrell cabey he shot him at pointblank 
range in the back after saying you dont look so bad heres 
another one hes crippled the young man for life caused him 
permanent brain damage

unlicensed gun on dec 22 1984 goetz said the teens surrounded 
him on a subway train and were trying to rob him the youths 
claimed they were panhandling money for video games

from west germany that it says are racist and could cause violence 
following two weeks of antisemitic incidents 
in thursdays order interior secretary pierre joxe prohibited 
distribution and sale of the smallcirculation magazines which are 
translated into french for distribution to extremeright groups 
however joxe said the works threaten the public order because 
of their apologies for nazism racism and antisemitism 
his authority to ban them comes under a 1939 law controlling 
foreign publications 
france has been ungoing a wave of protests and recriminations 
since a jewish cemetery in carpentras was desecrated two weeks ago 
a corpse was mutilated and 34 tombs desecrated and the case 
remains unsolved 
since then similar incidents have been carried out in france 
israel canada and elsewhere 
in the latest french legal action a court in poissy west of 
paris charged a 26yearold man with painting antisemitic 
graffiti on the doors of a vocational school 
the messages discovered tuesday were aimed at the schools 
jewish director 
on wednesday a judge in saint herblain freed under court 
supervision three skinheads charged with profaning 90 graves at a 
catholic cemetery in the eastern french village 
mayor charles gautier denounced the decision by judge gilles 
dubigeon in a letter thursday to prime minister michel rocard the 
mayor said the three suspects should have been held in jail while 
awaiting trial 
in another development extremeright leader jeanmarie le pen 
on thursday criticized a court decision to fine him for referring 
to the nazi gas chambers as a detail of world war ii history 
in a statement by his national front party le pen criticized 
wednesdays ruling as political persecution and an infringement on 
his free speech rights 
the court in nanterre outside paris ordered le pen to pay 18 
cents to each of 11 organizations that filed suit against him after 
the remark in 1987 
judge lefoyer de costil said freedom of expression has a 
limit he also ordered le pen to pay 720 to each of the groups 
to cover legal fees 
this decision only takes into account the interpretations of 
my political enemies and not at all the explanations i provided 
le pen said this irreversible judgment is proof of political 
persecution against me 
the 61yearold politician has been increasingly ostracized 
since the desecration of the cemetery at carpentras 
le pen a deputy in the european parliament wants to expel 
immigrants from france and enact laws to keep them out he denies

thousands of demonstrators chanting 
down with communism demanded the ouster of presidentelect ion 
iliescu in the largest antigovernment protest since the first free 
election in 53 years 
the demonstration thursday came four days after the election in 
which iliescu scored a landslide victory despite opposition claims 
that he and other members of the national salvation front are 
neocommunist 
the estimated 8000 protesters demonstrated peacefully for about 
seven hours in university square in downtown bucharest about 600 
people led by three blackrobed orthodox priests staged a 
candlelight march to the television station late in the evening 
the marchers were demanding that the governmentrun television 
show a tape which they claimed showed members of the national 
salvation front dividing up top posts on dec 22 the same day 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu fell from power 
the front dominated by former communists has insisted it did 
not form until after the revolution began the demonstrators said 
the tape showed that the front actually existed some time before 
ceausescus ouster and that its members took advantage of the 
revolutionary chaos to grab power 
the demonstrators said they planned to march to the television 
again this evening because they arrived too late thursday to 
present their demands 
two dozen soldiers supported by half a dozen armored personnel 
carriers were deployed around the tv center in northern bucharest 
the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in decembers 
revolution about 200 soldiers in riot gear replaced the usual 
police guard around the governments headquarters 
with almost all the ballots counted from sundays election 
iliescu had 852 percent of the vote in the threeway presidential 
race radu campeanu of the national liberal party received 106 
percent while ion ratiu of the national peasant party trailed with 
42 percent 
in another development the general prosecutors office 
announced thursday that the final death toll among civilians and 
soldiers in decembers revolution was 1038 it added that 2000 
people were injured in the clashes between revolutionaries and 
ceausescu loyalists 
it was not clear whether the casualty figures included the 
securitate secret police and proceausescu loyalists 
the death toll is way below estimates in the tens of thousands 
offered by romanian and foreign observers during the revolt 
opposition activists suggest the front deliberately exaggerated the 
death toll at first in order to strengthen its position in the 
revolutions early days

a man prosecutors describe as a major 
international heroin trafficker has been sentenced to more than 24 
years in prison on federal drug charges 
mushtaq malik 41 whose defense included a claim that he was 
doublecrossed in a plot to kill pakistans former leader told a 
judge at his sentencing thursday that he did not believe justice 
had been done 
it seems to me that being a poor man from a third world nation 
nobodys looking at my side malik told us district judge frank 
h freedman 
malik was convicted by a jury last november on charges of 
importing heroin and conspiracy to import prosecutors alleged that 
malik arranged for a jordanian man to bring 10 million worth of 
heroin to the united states 
an appeal was expected on maliks behalf 
at his trial malik testified that his involvement with an 
accused drug dealer was merely an effort to track down a man he 
said had doublecrossed him in a plot to kill former pakistani 
president gen mohammed zia ulhaq 
a pakistani official denied the assassination plot at the time 
of the testimony 
malik did not say he was involved in a mysterious plane crash 
that killed zia on aug 17 1988 several months after malik had 
been arrested 
the judge sentenced malik to two concurrent prison terms of 24 
years and five months with five years supervised release 
at the sentencing assistant us attorney kevin oregan asked 
that malik be sentenced to 30 years 
mr malik is an international narcotics trafficker of the 
highest level only the most serious punishment is appropriate in 
this case oregan said 
but maliks attorney michael o jennings asked the judge to 
consider a lower sentence saying that people who commit more 
serious crimes do not get as long as 20 years to serve

emergency inspections have turned up five more 
boeing 737 jets missing pins that help keep steering wheels in 
place a boeing co spokesman says 
that brings to seven the number of missing cotter pins spotted 
on boeingmade 737s within the last two weeks said the spokesman 
jack gamble 
the five jets reported tuesday belonged to foreign carriers that 
neither boeing nor the federal aviation administration would name 
the faa last week ordered usowned airlines to inspect 
steering assemblies on 737 models 300 400 and 500 that were built 
over the past two years 
the order came after a steering wheel came off in a copilots 
hands during a test flight of a 737400 delivered to a west german 
air carrier the pilot immediately took control the plane landed 
safely boeing said 
the planes steering mechanism was later found to be missing 
cotter pins the second missing cotter pin involved a 737 parked on 
boeings flight test line at boeing field in seattle 
the faa said last week it has launched an investigation to 
determine whether the problem is due to a breakdown in boeings 
quality control 
the cotter pin is fastened behind the nut in the nutandbolt 
assembly that holds the steering wheel to the steering assembly in 
the airplane cockpit it is designed to prevent the bolt from 
working loose which could allow the bolt to drop out and the wheel 
to come free 
the nuts and bolts were tight on six of the seven planes found 
to have missing cotter pins gamble said 
a total of 378 airplanes qualified for inspection under the faa 
order while the order applied only to usbased airlines gamble 
said foreignowned airlines routinely act on such orders 
the us airlines were required to report by last monday any 
problems with steering assemblies and there were no reports gamble 
said 
airlines were trying to determine why cotter pins were missing 
the boeing spokesman said it was possible that maintenance work 
had been done and the pins had not been replaced gamble said 
the 737 is the smallest jetliner made by boeing a twinengine 
shorttomedium range plane produced at its plant in the seattle 
suburb of renton 
the model 300 can carry as many as 141 passengers the 400 as 
many as 159 passengers and the 500 the newest model up to 122 
passengers

vessels large and small many of them the 
same ones that rescued hundreds of thousands of allied troops from 
the nazi onslaught made their way across the english channel to 
mark the 50th anniversary of the evacuation 
thursdays 10hour crossing by the socalled little ships 
began a weekend of celebrations reuniting about 5000 french and 
british veterans some in their 90s who fled to england just 
ahead of the advancing german army in 1940 
the dozens of vessels in the flotilla hoisted the british naval 
ensign and entered dunkirk waters in formation thursday afternoon 
behind the frigate hms alacrity to be greeted by a throng of local 
officials and wellwishers 
its a onceinalifetime thing i suppose hon british 
consul to dunkirk sandy baker said they wont be able to do this 
again 50 years from now 
britains prince philip husband of queen elizabeth ii stood on 
the dover docks to give a royal sendoff to 76 vessels reenacting 
the world war ii mission that rescued 338000 troops off beaches in 
northern france and belgium before onrushing german troops 
at the end of may 1940 tankled german forces drove allied 
troops onto the beaches of dunkirk and de panne belgium 20 miles 
away where they were trapped with their backs to the channel 
on may 29 of that year the british government appealed to 
owners of all types of vessels to volunteer to help make up for the 
shortage of troop transports and amateur and professional sailors 
raced across the channel in their boats to aid the allies 
over the next seven days an armada of about 860 naval ships 
fishing boats and pleasure craft rescued almost 400000 british 
french and belgian troops under enemy fire 
british coast guard boats on thursday stood by to shepherd the 
elderly fleet which could only travel as fast as the slowest boat 
about 7 mph in addition to winds and high seas the boats had to 
sail through the wakes of the ferries that frequently crisscross 
the channel 
about eight miles out a boat that once carried katharine 
hepburn and humphrey bogart in the hollywood film the african 
queen began taking on water off ramsgate 
a rescue helicopter from a neary royal air force base and a 
lifeboat were sent to escort and tow the 30foot steamdriven 
vessel back to harbor 
a dover coastguard spokesman said four people were on board 
including the american owner of the boat jim hendricks hendricks 
55 a hotel owner from key largo fla said the system that pumps 
water into the boiler quit working 
it was much rougher than i expected the waves were getting 
pretty high hendricks said adding it was just too much for 
her 
the threeman crew of the boat which hendricks purchased in 
1982 said they were afraid the boat was going to overturn in the 
rough channel 
the flotilla which will spend three days in the marine basin at 
dunkirk included motor launches cabin cruisers thames barges 
yachts old lifeboats and a former torpedo boat many are the 
original preserved craft that returned from the beaches in 1940 
with thousands of expeditionary forces aboard 
events commemorating the rescue will include a parade wreath 
layings lunches parties and a prayer service in dunkirk and in 
nearby de pannes

catherine mccants believed her son was 
gunned down in a grocery store parking lot because he was black and 
dating a white woman 
she was half right investigators say on thursday they charged 
a prison parolee who just hated blacks with fatally shooting 
21yearold darren jessie on march 31 
mobile county sheriff tom purvis said the man arrested daniel 
amos pilot did not know jessie jessies injured 17yearold 
friend joseph ocain or jessies white girlfriend amanda hicks 
pilot 34 was charged with murder and attempted murder and 
ordered held without bond 
ocain was shot in the back and is partially paralyzed 
pilot was paroled march 12 from a state prison after serving 
four years of a 12year sentence for receiving stolen property 
said prison spokeswoman debbie herbert 
in my opinion it was a spontaneous unprovoked senseless act 
of violence purvis said if there was any provocation it was 
merely the hatred in pilot toward blacks 
it wasnt the interracial dating the sheriff said because 
pilot didnt know the victims or anyone in the store they were 
customers in the store he said 
purvis said investigators determined that pilot and a friend had 
gone into a winn dixie grocery store in the mostly white surburb of 
theodore to buy beer pilot passed a car where jessie and ocain 
were waiting to pick up ms hicks from work they were listening to 
the radio when the shots were fired 
when they said he was killed in theodore by a white man i 
knew it was race mrs mccants said he should get the chair 
they dont need to send him back to prison to live

a wildcat rail strike spread today to 
gdansk and cut off all train traffic to the countrys baltic ports 
posing the most serious challenge yet to the solidarityled 
government and its economic reform program 
the ministry of transport said talks to resolve the walkout are 
at a total impasse 
the strike began sunday as a wildcat protest by workers 
demanding higher pay it has now received the support of the 
onetime communistbacked labor federation which is challenging 
solidarity for support among workers 
solidarity chairman lech walesa canceled a trip to scandinavia 
today due to the labor crisis in a reference to the rival 
federation walesa said in a nationwide radio broadcast that 
demagogical forces were trying to exploit workers legitimate 
grievances in a game that could lead to civil war 
i hope that reason will win he said in a midday radio 
interview the strikers should be given a way out of it with 
honor because they are right 
but he said the route of strikes leads nowhere even though 
i am unhappy and almost the entire society is unhappy 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a former solidarity adviser 
who became head of the east blocs first noncommunist government 
last summer has said the strike could seriously damage polands 
reform program 
railway workers at stations in the port city of gdansk joined 
the strike today crippling the harbor where the solidarity labor 
movement was born during a 1980 shipyard strike 
there is no access to the entire coast by train now said 
transport ministry spokesman stefan pozniak so its getting 
really serious 
the ports handle most of polands coal exports the countrys 
leading hard currency earner in addition to gdansk the labor 
dispute has paralyzed szczecin the countrys busiest port where 
12 ships awaited unloading 
a rail route linking berlin with gdansk through szczecin was 
blocked as was freight from czechoslovakia and hungary en route to 
the polish ports pozniak said 
officials say thousands of the 400000 workers employed by 
the staterun railway are on strike but have not given any 
specific numbers for the strikers about 50 railway workers are on 
a hunger strike 
rail traffic to two dozen key junctions across northwest poland 
has been cut off and the army was called in to move perishable and 
essential goods 
mazowiecki appealed for an end to the strike at a local election 
rally thursday warning it could destabilize the government and 
discourage western investors the prime minister said there are 
other means of claiming ones rights in a state that is 
democratic and no longer totalitarian 
negotiations broke off thursday when three of the four unions 
which represent the railway workers demanded that the talks be 
moved to slupsk the northwest city were the wildcat strike 
committee is based 
the government had refused to negotiate with the strikers 
directly because they were not protesting within legal union 
structures 
but two branches of the opzz labor federation the union created 
by the communists after they banned solidarity in 1982 and a small 
independent union stepped in to represent the strikers 
the solidarity union was the only one to agree to remain in 
warsaw for the talks it has called the strike a strong warning 
for the government it helped create but is urging the workers to 
end the protest 
in his radio interview walesa accused the opzz of manipulating 
the strikers in a game that will solve nothing but may lead even 
to a civil war 
the government has made no announcement about whether it would 
send its negotiators to slupsk 
however the government has firmly resisted granting the railway 
workers the pay raise they are requesting saying that making an 
exception for one group of workers would unleash a torrent of 
similar demands 
the government says this could scuttle the shock therapy 
economic reform program it instituted on jan 1 
the drive to create a market economy from the shattered 
socialist system is built on cutting government subsidies to ailing 
staterun enterprises including the railroad pay raises have to 
come from an industrys own resources 
the strict wage controls coupled with the raising of prices to 
market levels have reduced poles real incomes by an estimated 40 
percent 
the railway workers are demanding that their basic monthly 
salary be raised to 8 above the average monthly salary of 79 the 
strikers are also seeking the dismissal of railroad directors 
installed by the former communist regime who they say are 
incompetent and hampering reforms 
the government fired the communistappointed director of the 
strikebound pomerania rail district in northwest poland on 
thursday officials say interviews are under way for a new general 
railway director and a restructuring plan for the railroad is being 
drafted including a new pay scale

serbian authorities have ordered the 
expulsion of 17 albanian refugees accused of provoking ethnic 
unrest in the troubled province of kosovo official news reports 
said 
the albanians mostly the offspring of defectors who escaped 
albanias harsh stalinist regime after 1945 were given 30 days to 
leave yugoslavia and find a new country in which to resettle the 
official reports said thursday 
the un high commission for refugees in belgrade meanwhile 
denied reports that it had been formally notified of the expulsion 
orders and would help the refugees find a country willing to take 
them 
the crux of the matter is whether these people formally have 
the right to refugee status judith kumin an official of the 
un commission said 
she said that according to the 1951 un convention on refugee 
status which yugoslavia has ratified children of refugees are 
automatically granted the same rights and cannot be expelled 
unless convicted of serious crimes 
there are many more safeguards involved in expelling a refugee 
than expelling an ordinary alien we dont know whether these 
people have been afforded the same level of legal protection 
kumin said in an interview 
serbias communistcontrolled newspapers reported that the 17 
albanians who live in kosovo were denied hospitality because 
they broke yugoslav laws the reports did not specify what laws 
the albanians had violated 
serbia the largest yugoslav republic has launched a campaign 
to expel some 730 albanian refugees in kosovo who allegedly do not 
possess valid residence permits 
serbias communist authorities claim the albanians worked for 
their native countrys sigurimi secret police and were instructed 
to provoke tensions between the ethnic albanian majority and 
serbian minority in kosovo an autonomous province in serbia which 
borders albania 
several of the refugees interviewed by the liberal press in the 
republics of slovenia and croatia denied they were sigurimi 
agents they said their families escaped from albania because of 
political or religious persecution 
in another development kosovos premier jusuf zeinulahu and 
three other ethnic albanian ministers withdrew the resignations 
they had submitted during a twoday session of the provinces 
legislature 
the four wanted to resign to protest moves by serbian 
authorities to tighten their police and administrative control over 
kosovo where 60 ethnic albanians have died since february 1989 in 
antiserbian riots they withdrew their resignations at the request 
of ethnic albanian lawmakers 
ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of kosovos 16 million 
population and are fighting for more autonomy from serbia which 
says it must control the province to protect the serbian minority 
from alleged albanian harassment

the diet of israeli leaders became a political 
issue today after a powerful rabbi privately accused several 
politicians of eating nonkosher foods such as pork and shellfish 
the accusations against prime minister yitzhak shamir and others 
were secretly recorded as rabbi ovadia yosef spoke to other 
religious leaders at a jewish seminary on thursday night 
yosefs comments were the lead item on both israel and armed 
forces radio stations this morning and were quoted on the front 
page of the daily yediot ahronot newspaper israel radio said it 
obtained the tape recording from an unidentified person who made 
the recording without the rabbis knowledge 
yosef the spiritual mentor of the ultraorthodox shas party 
said of shamir he eats only impure fish thats what he likes 
hes dying for it 
he also said of ariel sharon a leading rightwing figure he 
doesnt eat shellfish but he really loves pork 
israel radio reported that shamir refused to comment when asked 
in an interview about yosefs charges neither sharon nor his 
spokesman could be reached for comment 
yossef azran head of the shas faction in parliament told army 
radio that yosefs remarks on the politicians dining habits were 
taken out of context 
many religious jews adhere to strict dietary laws that prohibit 
them from eating foods they consider unclean such as pork and 
shellfish shamir and other top politicians lead a secular 
lifestyle but publicly they observe jewish holidays and some of 
the customs 
the accusations were broadcast as shamir the interim prime 
minister tries to persuade ultraorthodox religious parties to 
join a coalition cabinet that would be led by his rightwing likud 
bloc 
yosef played a key role two months ago in toppling shamirs 
coalition government with the leftleaning labor party the 
coalition lost a vote of confidence in parliament after yosef 
ordered the six shas lawmakers to abstain 
shas traditionally has supported likud

strong earthquakes shook southern sudan 
for the second time in a week causing damage in the town of juba 
a relief official said today 
it went on and off all night a building at the airport 
collapsed and there appears to be damage in the town said bob 
koepp of the lutheran world federation 
koepp runs a relief air shuttle from nairobi he was relaying a 
report from one of his pilots who made a round trip to juba this 
morning 
the pilot did not go into the town and had no information about 
possible casualties koepp said he said the airport runway 
sustained no damage 
koepp reported the pilot said the quake began thursday morning 
and that tremors continuing throughout the day 
the us geological survey in boulder colo reported a quake 
measuring 71 on the richter scale about 50 miles east of juba 
shortly after a 68 tremor rocked the same area the hong kong 
observatory also reported a 68 tremor in the same region but made 
no mention of the 71 quake 
the quakes were strong enough to be felt in neighboring uganda 
and western kenya and shook buildings near lake victoria 375 miles 
south of the epicenter the daily nation newspaper of nairobi 
reported today 
they were in the same area where an earthquake measuring 74 
struck saturday the area is sparsely populated with the few 
residences consisting of grassthatched mud huts 
in cairo egypt rashad kebeasy a geologist said the latest 
quakes were aftershocks of last weekends earthquake 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 
times greater a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage on 
land while a tremor of magnitude 7 is capable of causing heavy and 
widespread damage

the governor of jammukashmir state 
whose harsh tactics fanned the flames of a moslem separatist 
revolt resigned today a senior official and news reports said 
the resignation reportedly at the request of the new delhi 
government came four days after paramilitary police in srinagar 
opened fire on a procession bearing the body of a slain moslem 
religious leader 
at least 58 people were killed and 300 wounded in what survivors 
claimed was an unprovoked attack the government said the troops 
fired after they were shot at by militants in the procession 
a senior government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity reported the resignation of the governor jagmohan who 
uses only one name 
perhaps he now feels that he has become an object of 
oontroversy and his presence is not likely to help the people of 
kashmir to join the mainstream said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
in mostly hindu jammu the winter capital of predominantly 
moslem jammukashmir state shops closed in protest as word of 
jagmohans resignation spread 
jagmohan 61 was appointed governor of jammukashmir on jan 19 
to try to halt the increasingly violent moslem campaign for 
independence from predominantly hindu india 
the next day his government launched the harshest crackdown ever 
against the fourdecadeold secessionist movement at least 460 
people mostly moslem militants and supporters shot by security 
troops have been killed in kashmir since then according to daily 
tallies verified by reporters and sources 
the government said the toll was less than 300 while some 
sources claimed it was as high as 1200 
in srinagar jammukashmirs summer capital moslem 
demonstrators used jagmohans name as a synonym for repression he 
said he used fairness and firmness but kashmiris claimed he 
allowed troops to rob and torture them 
srinagar a oncethriving tourist town of 1 million people has 
been under curfew every night for the past four months and often 
during the daytime 
jagmohan a career civil servant will be succeeded by girish 
saxena security adviser to prime minister vp singh press trust 
of india said like jagmohan the new governor is a hindu 
united news of india quoted lk advani head of a conservative 
hindu party as saying jagmohan submitted his resignation at the 
request of singhs government 
advani whose party supports but does not formally participate 
in singhs minority coalition criticized the dismissal but said it 
would not cause his party to withdraw its support of singh such a 
move could have brought down the government 
calls for jagmohans dismissal had been raised in parliament 
this week by moslem and leftist legislators and exprime minister 
rajiv gandhi leader of the opposition congress party 
the demands followed mondays killings of mourners carrying the 
body of the assassinated islamic clergyman maulvi mohammad farooq 
whose killers have not been caught 
the clergyman had long advocated political discussions to 
resolve kashmirs future but recently he started calling for 
independence 
kashmir a former princely state was divided along a 
stilldisputed frontier between india and pakistan after the two 
nations became independent from britain in 1947 and were 
partitioned along religious lines 
about 64 percent of the 6 million people in indiangoverned 
jammukashmir state are moslems making it the only state in india 
with a moslem majority nationwide moslems account for 12 percent 
of indias 880 million people while hindus comprise 82 percent

china has made clear that president bushs 
decision on trade relations would have bearing on political and 
cultural ties 
china today welcomed bushs announcement on thursday that he 
favored extending chinas mostfavorednation trade status for one 
year allowing beijing to continue enjoying low tariffs 
this is not only in the interests of china but in the 
interests of the united states too the official xinhua news 
agency today quoted premier li peng as telling visiting japanese 
businessmen 
xinhua had said earlier that only a small number of americans 
under the pretext of socalled human rights opposed the renewal of 
chinas mfn status 
their arguments have been strongly rejected by the majority of 
american people who cherish the longterm interests of relations 
between the two countries the news agency wrote 
some us congressmen say they will fight bushs decision 
citing chinas brutal crushing of a prodemocracy movement a year 
ago 
trade between china and the united states has flourished since 
1979 when diplomatic ties were renewed 
in recent days china indicated that raising tariffs on its 
goods would lead not just to higher duties on us products and a 
sharp drop in trade but diminished political and cultural contacts 
as well 
china fought hard on the issue mixing veiled warnings with 
calls for washington to be sensible and consider the matter from 
a longterm perspective as communist party general secretary 
jiang zemin said recently 
china also made concessions to critics of its human rights 
record by lifting martial law in the tibetan capital and releasing 
211 people jailed for taking part in last years democracy movement 
in beijing 
bushs decision can thus be seen as a chinese diplomatic 
victory but a limited one 
chinas leaders still have failed to convince the white house or 
the us congress that how they treat political dissidents is an 
internal matter on which the united states has no right to comment 
in making his announcement bush said he was not condoning 
chinas suppression of dissent and urged chinese leaders to improve 
their human rights record 
many americans still believe chinas leaders should be punished 
in some way for having ordered the army to fire on unarmed 
prodemocracy protesters last june when hundreds and perhaps 
thousands were killed 
given such deep differences in outlook continued friction 
between beijing and washington is inevitable there will be no lack 
of new occasion for conflict 
for example the world bank is scheduled to consider several new 
loans to china next week although china insists such loans should 
not be linked to politics the united states has blocked past 
loans making exceptions only for those considered for humanitarian 
purposes 
fang lizhi chinas most famous dissident and his wife li 
shuxian remain in the us embassy in beijing a constant irritant 
in relations there appears no progress toward winning them safe 
passage from china jiang reiterated recently the couple must admit 
their guilt and promise not to fight the government again 
the more than 30000 chinese students in the united states will 
become a growing point of friction if as their studies finish 
significant numbers fail to return home bush has said those who 
were in the united states last june can stay at least until jan 1 
1994 if they fear persecution at home

president bushs summit next week with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev may mark the end of one era in 
ussoviet relations and the beginning of another 
the main business the two will conduct symbolizes the old era 
they will sign a declaration to reduce us and soviet strategic 
nuclear weapons by much less than the 50 percent initially 
advertised and probably commit themselves to pursue further 
cutbacks 
the declaration will make the may 31june 3 summit like the 
majority of its predecessors an arms control summit 
at the same time bush and gorbachev will begin the transition 
to a new superpower relationship forced on them by a rapidly 
changing world 
the germans taking charge of their future are moving speedily 
toward unification this is creating a new europe and bush and 
gorbachev will have to put their heads together and decide how to 
adjust 
michael mandelbaum director of the eastwest project of the 
private council on foreign relations has suggested the two leaders 
use the summit to begin plotting a new european security order 
he calls the task far more important than arms control 
bush is not about to jettison the north atlantic treaty 
organization but he has to look into a future europe anchored by 
an immensely powerful germany and lacking the stabilizing standoff 
of two military alliances 
what is going on in germany is upsetting the old balance of 
power between nato and the warsaw pact it is forcing bush and 
gorbachev to come up with a new formula 
natos days may be numbered the warsaw pacts surely are 
officials of the two superpowers have had some preliminary 
discussions about fitting germany into a new structure the talks 
were held ithout the fireworks that marked deliberations in the 
fastfading cold war era 
gorbachev is not trying to hold on to east germany once the 
soviets most reliable ally 
the future of the 360000 soviet troops there is uncertain 
while the soviet leader is likely to comply with requests by 
hungary and czechoslovakia to remove all traces of the red army by 
next year poland is making noises along the same line 
so there is no reason for bush to play the heavy to poke a 
finger in gorbachevs eye 
the president insists that the new germany be in nato and yet 
he also is aware of the anxieties that causes the soviets who are 
losing their east european buffer and have stark memories of world 
war ii to oppose such an affiliation 
within the soviet union meanwhile the diverse nationalities 
are threatening to go their separate ways that weakens moscow but 
also raises a danger of ethnic strife and instability 
like german unification these events are outpacing the ability 
of the two superpowers to take charge of history bush and 
gorbachev working together would have a better chance of keeping 
up 
the pressure on gorbachev of course is far more severe than 
the strains on bush although the president must keep a wary eye on 
the drive toward unification in western europe and the economic 
colossus challenging the united states that could result 
the west germans seeking soviet blessing for unification may 
be ready to buy that approval with economic assistance bush so far 
has promised moscow almost nothing feeling the heat of 
congressional conservatives who are worked up over gorbachevs 
treatment of the baltics bush is reluctant to assist perestroika 
he has ruled out lowering tariff barriers until final passage of 
a new soviet law establishing the right to emigrate the soviet 
parliament was supposed to finish work on the law next thursday as 
the summit opened 
now the calendar is slipping and bush will not recommend lower 
tariffs to congress unless the law is on the books 
bush also may delay signing a new trade deal with the soviets 
even though negotiators reached broad agreement late last month in 
paris again conservatives are pressuring the white house to 
retaliate against gorbachevs moves to blunt independence drives in 
lithuania latvia and estonia 
hardliners like former pentagon official richard perle are 
urging bush to take advantage of gorbachevs troubles to force 
completion of a treaty to withdraw tens of thousands of soviet 
troops and tanks from eastern and central europe 
bush apparently will not heed the advice the president and 
secretary of state james a baker iii want to improve the 
ussoviet relationship even with the slowdown in the arms talks 
and the squeeze on lithuania 
bush will observe the tradition of past arms control summits by 
joining gorbachev in the declaration to cut us and soviet nuclear 
bombers missiles and submarines 
but the president also will take a look down the uncertain road 
of europe with the soviet leader and may begin the transition to a 
new and more peaceful relationship

pope john paul ii left today for a threeday visit 
to malta the first papal visit to the mediterranean island 
although malta has a long christian tradition a papal visit 
would have been unthinkable under the previous socialist government 
john pauls 48th foreign tour as pope takes him to a republic of 
350000 people nearly 99 percent catholic where abortion is 
banned and divorce is not allowed 
malta the site of the ussoviet summit in december planned 
joyous celebrations hundreds of maltese working outside the 
country have returned this week to join the festivities 
john paul will tour both malta and gozo the second largest 
island in the archipelago and deliver about a dozen speeches 
the first christian community on malta is said to date to the 
year 60 when st paul was shipwrecked on the island 
the island was home to the knights of malta mobilized in the 
16th century to defend christian europe from the ottoman turks 
churchstate relations soured during the long period of 
socialist rule from 1971 to 1987 some of the bitterness stemmed 
from the churchs treatment of socialist officials and supporters 
in the 1960s 
the churchstate crisis reached a head in 1984 when thenprime 
minister dom mintoffs government decreed private schools 
including catholic ones could no longer charge tuition 
but relations between the nationalist government of prime 
minster eddie fenech adami a regular churchgoer and the cathoic 
hierarchy are described as excellent maltese president vincent 
tabone paid a state visit to the vatican in december 
john pauls visit will be a fitting start to the annual series 
of village parties in honor of patron saints malta boasts 313 
churches and its main monument the 16th century st johns 
cathedral was restored for the occasion

an audit of us aid to roman catholic 
charities in india says bishops priests and nuns misused millions 
of dollars and the us embassy said today that an investigation 
is under way 
the audit by the us accounting firm price waterhouse said 
officials in indias roman catholic church which receives 25 
million in us food annually drew up bogus lists of food 
recipients and used donations to run businesses clergy also 
purposely exaggerated the amount of aid they distributed and filed 
false reports to hide the abuses the audit said 
the audit was ordered by the inspector generals office of the 
us agency for international development and focused on catholic 
relief services a baltimorebased charity which gives food to 
4600 groups that distribute the food to the needy mostly children 
and pregnant women 
most of the organizations are roman catholic although hindu 
moslem and nonreligious groups participate they include the 
missionaries of charity run by nobel peace prize winner mother 
teresa 
james deharpporte head of catholic relief services operations 
in india said the audit was unfair and highly exaggerated the 
extent of our problems but he acknowledged the organization was 
undergoing a management shakeup 
the us embassy said today that the central bureau of 
investigation indias version of the fbi and the investigative 
wing of the us agency for international development are looking 
into the reported abuses 
news of the audit came first in todays washington post details 
subsequently were provided by auditors and a us official in new 
delhi 
tridibes basu a partner at price waterhouse in the indian 
capital said the audit does not accuse roman catholic clergy with 
theft but the report says the relief program was operated in an 
atmosphere whereby the commodities could be misused with little 
risk of detection 
but some officials said they believed the report showed 
substantial evidence of widespread corruption and theft of the free 
american food 
quantities of food stored in warehouses did not tally with 
written records of food delivered to and distributed from these 
warehouses a us official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity proper quantities of food were not distributed to 
beneficiaries and distribution of food was done irregularly or not 
at all at some sites 
the audit estimated that records for food distribution and 
actual food distribution differed by about 4 million 
the us official said recordkeeping was shoddy food storage 
was poor and catholic relief services role in monitoring the aid 
had generally been deficient 
he said that due to the audit catholic relief services had cut 
its operations in india and that the us agency for international 
development was reconsidering its aid to the organization 
future operations will depend on improvements in catholic 
relief services management ability the official said 
deharpporte said his organization had slowed operations but he 
denied there were widespread abuses 
he acknowledged that the charity had terminated its relationship 
with some organizations and was seeking repayment for lost or 
stolen food in one case 2000 bags of food worth 20000 
disappeared from one warehouse 
not everybodys an angel not everybodys a saint but when we 
do find abuses we terminate our agreement he said 
the united states gives india about 100 million worth of food 
annually wheat corn soy beans vegetable oil and milk comprise 
the bulk of the aid the care charity gets most of the aid 
the audit was completed in december 1989 and filed with the 
inspector generals office of the us agency for international 
development in march said vali nijhawan senior manager of price 
waterhouse in new delhi

an end to the worst flooding in decades 
was in sight today after the trinity river crested at a record 
mark but gnats spawned in floodwaters gathered in swarms lethal to 
animals and some arkansas farmers blamed water managers for 
crippling crop damage 
the trinity river reached 2998 feet thursday at liberty up 
slightly from 2996 feet the day before flood stage on the river 
is 24 feet and the old record highwater mark was 29 feet in 1942 
the water will be with us for a while but we hope weve 
turned the tide said jim mitchum liberty county emergency 
management coordinator 
barring another onslaught of heavy rains officials said the 
river was unlikely to rise further upstream waters were receding 
and were expected to begin dropping at liberty as early as today 
about 100 miles to the north clouds of bloodsucking turkey 
gnats rose from floodwaters to menace people poultry and other 
animals 
this is probably the worst infestation of the turkey gnat in 
east texas since the 1930s or 1940s said dr james robinson an 
entomologist for the texas agricultural extension service at 
overton we have confirmed reports of infestations in at least 14 
counties all joining or near major rivers or streams 
turkey gnats are members of the black fly family and are 
slightly larger than fruit flies robinson said the infestations 
could persist for six weeks 
we have reports of more than 1000 head of fowl dying as a 
result of turkey gnat infestations said gayle finch extension 
agent in henderson county numerous people have called within the 
past two weeks reporting losses of chickens ducks geese guineas 
and birds 
the gnats also can inflict painful bites that raise itchy red 
welts on humans 
some people have gone to the doctor for treatment of bites we 
are finding the bites to be worse than mosquito bites said 
denise easterling a veterinarian in leon county 
flooding an early killing freeze and high winds caused an 
estimated 23567 million in losses to the states farmers and 
ranchers the arkansas farm bureau said thursday the losses amount 
to 28 percent of their usual net income 
flood damage far outweighed other weathercaused problems 
officials said 
we had one farmer with about 2000 acres and he hadnt seen 
it since the first of may said frank plafcan staff director for 
the jefferson county extension service 
farmers from oklahoma and arkansas who gathered for a meeting in 
fort smith ark on thursday with army corps of engineers 
officials complained about perceived flood control shortcomings 
the hearing was the third of five the army engineers are holding 
to explain how they operate reservoirs 
some farmers said they received too little warning about 
impending floods and accused army engineers of failing to lower 
reservoir levels in anticipation of possible floods 
were getting floods from controlled waters hartman farmer 
richard plugge said applause erupted when he said army engineers 
focused on maintaining recreation water levels rather than flood 
control 
james proctor little rock district reservoir control chief 
said flooding would have occurred regardless of any action taken by 
water managers 
we dont have infinite wisdom said col lee smith of the 
corps tulsa district 
train service across the trinity river and a nearly 100yearold 
bridge was remained detoured as crews worked to stabilize a 
300foot trestle knocked askew by floodwaters 
the bridge was built in 1904 with later construction in 1919 
the river has come within 7 inches of railroad ties 
texas officials estimate that about 10000 people statewide have 
been forced from their homes by storms and flooding that began late 
last month in northern texas 
nearly 1 million for temporary housing has been given to 
families forced from their homes by the high water federal 
agencies have received requests for help from some 4123 texas 
families 
no deaths or injuries have been blamed on the floods along the 
lower trinity river thirteen deaths were blamed on storms and 
flooding in northern texas 
elsewhere louisiana and oklahoma officials said flooding there 
caused more than 20 million damage to farms parts of indiana also 
suffered severe damage

premier li peng today welcomed president bushs 
decision to renew chinas mostfavorednation trade status saying 
it would help uschinese ties 
at least two other asian governments hong kong and japan 
also praised the move saying friendly ties were important despite 
beijings crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators a year ago 
bush announced thursday that he favors renewing the trade status 
for one year entitling china to the lowest available tariffs on 
its exports 
this is not only in the interests of china but in the 
interests of the united states too the official xinhua news 
agency quoted li as telling visiting japanese businessmen 
xinhua said li noted that his government will as always make 
due efforts to restore and promote sinous relations 
us congressional critics said they would try to overturn the 
decision in order to protest chinas killing of prodemocracy 
demonstrators last year china maintains that its treatment of 
dissidents is an internal matter 
china had made it clear that downgrading its trade status would 
have hurt political and cultural ties with the united states as 
well as cause a sharp drop in trade uschinese relations were 
already badly strained by conflict over last years killings 
xinhua in its report on bushs decision claimed that only a 
small number of americans supported ending the favored trade status 
under the pretext of socalled human rights 
other official chinese media argued before bushs announcement 
that american consumers rather than chinese manufacturers would 
be hurt most by canceling the favored status 
china daily said without cheap chinese canvas shoes some 
americans would be unable to afford similar shoes manufactured in 
the united states 
last year china exported about 12 billion worth of goods to 
the united states mostly garments and toys the united states sold 
china about 57 billion worth of goods led by wheat fertilizer 
and aviation equipment 
hong kongs trade and industry secretary john chan today said 
bushs move was very good news from hong kongs point of view 
in a statement chan noted the british colonys business 
community and government had engaged in intensive lobbying during 
the past few weeks to explain how termination of special trade 
status would harm hong kong which will return to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 
much of the chinese exports to the united states are produced in 
jointventure factories set up by hong kong investors in southern 
china 
the japanese government today welcomed the bush decision and 
said stable ties between washington and beijing are an 
indispensable factor for maintaining the peace and stability of 
asia and the pacific 
japan had urged bush to resist pressure to punish china for last 
years crackdown in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
students were killed

the candidate backed by mikhail s gorbachev for 
president of the russian republic withdrew from the race today 
strengthening the campaign of boris n yeltsin the populist who 
has repeatedly clashed with gorbachev 
the state news agency tass reported the withrawal of russian 
premier aleksandr v vlasov but did not give a reason it said 
vlasovs pullout had been announced at the congress of the russian 
federation which will elect the president a newly created post in 
the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
on wednesday gorbachev attacked yeltsins platform accusing 
him of calling for the breakup of the soviet union 
the russian republic contains moscow and encompasses 11 time 
zones from the baltic to the pacific the russian language 
predominates in the soviet union and much of the nations wealth 
including vast natural resources is concentrated in the republic 
in addition to yeltsin two other men remained in the race 
ivan polozkov and vladimir morokin but from the start the 
campaign had appeared to be a contest between yeltsin and vlasov a 
vote was possible later in the day 
prior to vlasovs announcement yeltsin delivered a 
wellreceived speech pledging that if elected he would defend the 
republic from meddling by the national soviet government but 
refrain from clashing with gorbachev 
gorbachev holds the posts of president of the soviet union and 
general secretary of the soviet communist party the two most 
powerful jobs in the soviet union 
i am for businesslike relations dialogue and negotiations 
with the president and the government but on the principle that 
russias sovereignty is not damaged yeltsin told the russian 
congress 
his bass voice booming through the hall of the great kremlin 
palace yeltsin pressed a radical platform for bringing the russian 
republic out of crisis 
he presented a pointbypoint program on how he would fight for 
russians sovereignty unleash market forces increase housing and 
flood stores with consumer goods 
he blasted the government program for a transition to a market 
economy presented by premier nikolai ryzhkov on thursday saying it 
had already created panic in the stores today 
instead he backed an alternative program involving sale of 
government property more liberal laws on ownership and foreign 
loans to make the transition without everything falling on the 
shoulders of the people 
yeltsin already is a member of the congress of peoples 
deputies which is the national parliament the russian congress of 
peoples deputies the russian republics parliament and the 
communist party central committee 
during a questionandanswer session he was asked several times 
about his relations with gorbachev who entered the hall halfway 
through the speech yeltsin formerly gorbachevs protege has 
become an opponent in the last two years blaming the soviet 
president for halfway reforms 
but yeltsin said their personal relationship would not influence 
their interaction as presidents if there was or is something 
personal ill set it aside he said 
yeltsin left the podium to prolonged applause and was followed 
by ivan polozkov a communist party chief from krasnodar who is now 
considered yeltsins main rival 
russia is the largest of the 15 soviet republics with just more 
than half the countrys population and twothirds of its territory

united nations scientists today warned that global 
warming has begun temperatures will rise in the next century 
faster than in the last 10000 years and that urgent measures are 
needed to curb greenhouse gases 
in addition a separate report warns that warming poses serious 
threats to the planet including rising sea levels the spread of 
disease and mass starvation in poor countries 
the world temperature is likely to increase about 18 degrees in 
the next 35 years and 54 degrees before the end of the next 
century said a report released by a working group of the uns 
intergovernment panel on climate change 
sea levels were predicted to rise by 23 inches each decade or 
8 inches by 2030 and 255 inches by the end of the next century 
these conclusions represent something of an international 
consensus on the scientific certainty of global warming 
its the biggest international research drive into global 
warming ever conducted its authoritative and objective it was 
set up by the united nations general assembly and staffed by 
firstrank scientists from around the world said greenpeace 
spokesman steve elsworth 
dan lashoff an observer at the meeting from the natural 
resources defense council in washington said the report will bring 
increased pressure on the united states to take action 
the white house must take this report seriously the white 
house will no longer be able to pick its favorite scientific 
skeptics as an excuse for not reducing us emissions lashoff 
said 
president bush has called for more study on global warming 
the united nations established three working groups which 
together called on the expertise of about 1000 scientists around 
the world 
global warming is the process by which greenhouse gases such as 
carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons collect on the outer edges 
of the earths atmosphere and trap heat within 
the release of the report by the respected un panel of 
scientists could move the international agenda from discussions of 
whether global warming exists to plans for how to deal with it 
shortly after the reports release prime minister margaret 
thatcher urged a giant international effort to deal with the 
threat and committed britain to a 30 percent reduction in carbon 
dioxide emissions by the year 2005 
if the panels predictions are broadly right then the world 
could become hotter than at any time in the last 100000 years 
she said in a speech at the opening of the hadley center for 
climate prediction and research at the meteorological office in 
bracknell 
she said the problem cannot be dealt with by individual 
countries we shall only be able to deal with the problem by a 
giant international effort in which we all cooperate she said 
in fixing the countrys carbon dioxide target the british 
government took a position between what environmentalists and 
scientists are asking and what the government feels is politically 
and practically possible 
many scientists want to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 20 
percent worldwide by 2005 instead of simply stabilizing them 
if the world followed the target mrs thatcher has announced 
we will fail to control global warming it is totally 
inadequate said andrew dilworth spokesman for friends of the 
earth 
a preliminary report by a sovietled panel on the impact of 
climate change warned that global warming poses a serious threat to 
the planet parts of the report were published in britain this week 
melting at the poles will cause seas to rise coastlines to 
flood and vast migrations from coastal and droughthit agricultural 
regions the report predicted tropical diseases such as malaria 
would spread to higher latitudes the report said 
agricultural regions such as the corn belt in north america 
could shift toward the poles by 125 to 185 miles for every degree 
of warming forests might move hundreds of miles toward the poles 
food production overall could be sustained but agricultural 
costs worldwide would increase by 10 percent and poor countries 
with burgeoning populations would face mass starvation the report 
said

the us trade deficit fell to 264 billion 
from january through march the lowest quarterly imbalance in more 
than six years the government reported today 
the commerce department said the 82 percent improvement from a 
287 billion fourthquarter deficit resulted from a record level 
of us sales abroad offsetting the highest volume of oil imports 
in more than 12 years 
for the first quarter us exports rose 47 percent to an 
alltime high of 9604 billion imports were also at a record 
level based on a surge in oil demand climbing 16 percent to 
1224 billion the trade deficit is the difference between imports 
and exports 
todays report on merchandise trade as calculated on a 
balanceofpayments basis confirmed trends already noted in the 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports they showed a first 
quarter deficit of 239 billion 
the disparity in the two figures comes from the fact that 
todays report excludes military sales by the us government and 
makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures 
analysts were generally heartened by the new figures despite the 
surge in oil imports they noted that us export sales remain at 
strong levels since growth in exports has fueled a large portion 
of us economic growth over the past three years the continuation 
of this trend is seen as a promising sign for the future 
the firstquarter deficit was the smallest since a 217 billion 
shortfall in the fourth quarter of 1983 
exports of machine tools industrial supplies and consumer goods 
climbed 4 percent to a record 851 billion in the first quarter 
more than onehalf of this increase came from a boom in exports of 
civilian aircraft following the end of the boeing strike 
farm exports were up 7 percent to 11 billion with increases 
recorded in overseas sales of wheat vegetables fruits and nuts 
corn exports were down reflecting sharply lower shipments to the 
soviet union 
average prices of corn and cotton increased 2 percent while 
prices of other commodities changed little the government said 
imports of petroleum were up 17 percent in the first quarter to 
156 billion with the average number of barrels imported daily 
climbing to 89 million the highest level since the third quarter 
of 1977 
the average price per barrel increased to 1947 the highest 
since the first quarter of 1986 when the price per barrel was 
1765 
americas deficits declined with several countries including 
japan down 19 billion to 104 billion for the first quarter 
the united states even posted a 400 million trading surplus with 
the countries of western europe

two brothers charged with the 
shotgun slayings of their affluent parents wailed hysterically in 
an emergency telephone call reporting the murders 
the recording was made after the aug 20 slayings of 
multimillionaire entertainment executive jose menendez and wife 
kitty it was released thursday after news media attorneys obtained 
a court order requiring that it be made public 
the emotional twominute call appears to have been made by the 
slain couples elder son lyle 22 who has been charged with his 
brother erik 19 in the murders prosecutors say greed was the 
motive 
superior court judge james albracht ordered the audio tape 
release along with a videotape documenting a police search of the 
home of the menendez brothers psychologist 
but psychologist jerome oziel on thursday won an emergency 
appellate court stay blocking release of the videotape 
i believe that release of the search warrant videotape 
would be a complete violation of my familys constitutional right 
to privacy oziel said it would serve no purpose whatsoever in 
clarifying any relevant issues in this case 
the court of appeal asked for written argument on the matter by 
may 29 
the brothers defense counsel opposed the release of the audio 
tape but did not appeal it it recorded dispatchers trying to calm 
down a sobbing screaming man and determine what happened 
somebody killed my parents were the first words choked out 
by the caller after a dispatcher asked repeatedly whats the 
problem 
when asked to repeat who the victims were the caller said my 
mom and dad 
at least twice the caller yelled to erik by name and a 
dispatcher hearing the name asked to speak with erik the second 
brother never took the phone but his cries could be heard in the 
background throughout the tape 
at one point the caller sobbed i came home and found them 
the first call ended with a dispatcher saying that an ambulance 
was on the way the tape also contained a brief call from the 911 
dispatchers back to the house a man answered hello quickly 
and then began sobbing 
ok i want you to come outside the male dispatcher said 
ive got to get my brother came the reply 
you tell your brother come out the front door everybody come 
outside the dispatcher said 
the brothers claim they discovered their parents bodies when 
they returned home after a night out at a restaurant and the movies 
prosecutors contend the boys committed the murders to collect a 
14 million inheritance jose menendez was an executive with live 
entertainment inc a video distribution company 
an autopsy report said the couple was killed in an upstairs den 
of their mansion by shotgun blasts at close range both large 
pellet and birdshot ammunition were used menendez was hit by five 
blasts his wife was hit 10 times

federal prosecutors say mayor marion barry is 
making unfounded claims of government misconduct and is not 
entitled to have the 14count drug case against him dismissed 
barry was indicted on eight drugrelated charges on feb 15 six 
new charges including one count of conspiracy and five counts of 
cocaine possession were brought may 10 
he is scheduled to go to trial june 4 and his lawyers have 
moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds the prosecution 
retaliated against him by bringing six new drug charges against him 
less than a month before his trial 
a hearing on the dismissal motion and other requests by barry 
was scheduled today before us district court judge thomas 
penfield jackson 
meanwhile the washington post said today today a poll showed 
barry has suffered no significant erosion in his political base 
since his arrest he and councilman john ray were tied with 23 
percent each of the 760 selfdescribed democrats polled by the 
newspaper about their preference for the democratic mayoral 
nomination the rest were split among four additional challengers 
barry has not officially announced whether he will seek a fourth 
term 
the government is making a diligent effort to investigate 
criminal wrongdoing and is not retaliating against barrys refusal 
to plead guilty to the original indictment prosecutors said in 
court papers filed thursday 
no plea offers were extended by the government they added 
the charges set out in the original indictment did not reflect 
the full extent of the defendants criminal conduct said us 
attorney jay stephens 
nothing that has happened in this case even remotely supports 
the defendants suggestion that the government acted with a 
retaliatory motive in seeking additional charges stephens added 
barry lawyer r kenneth mundy said the government has refused to 
provide the names of the alleged coconspirators in the new 
indictment 
mundy said there is a presumption of vindictiveness and that 
the government should be required to justify charging a conspiracy 
spanning five years less than a month before trial 
stephens said the timing of the new indictment was not 
unreasonable and that the government is not required to disclose 
the identity of unindicted coconspirators or its witnesses 
the us attorney said he has filed the coconspirators names 
with the court requesting that they be turned over to barry 
without being publicly disclosed 
the original indictment accuses barry of three felony counts of 
lying to a federal grand jury about his alleged involvement with 
drugs and five counts of cocaine possession one possession count 
stems from his jan 18 arrest in an fbi sting operation at the 
vista hotel where officials said he was videotaped smoking crack 
cocaine

horseback riding swimming and sunbathing add up 
to summer fun for millions but government health researchers are 
warning that its also the season for broken necks drownings and 
skin cancer 
the national centers for disease control in three reports 
thursday urged caution for people participating in those popular 
but hazardous outdoor activities 
the cdc said horseback riders should wear helmets sunbathers 
should protect their skin and swimmers should limit their alcohol 
intake though researchers said they still are not certain about 
the relationship between drinking and drowning 
the main issue here is people can be seriously injured riding 
a horse and there is a safety mechanism and it is a helmet said 
dr david nelson the cdc epidemiologist who wrote the report on 
horseback riding 
about 30 million americans ride horses each year and the rate 
of serious injury per riding hours is higher than that for 
motorcyclists and car racers the cdc report said 
in 1987 and 1988 according to the cdc horseback riding 
accounted for 92763 injuries of which 99 percent required 
hospitalization of those hospitalized 422 percent had head or 
neck injuries 
one study quoted by the cdc said fewer than 20 percent of those 
falling off a horse were wearing a helmet 
even when riders wear headgear the headgear may be decorative 
or improperly secured thereby providing limited or no 
protection the cdc said 
nelson said several medical and trade organizations have 
endorsed the use of helmets by horseback riders though it has not 
been as well publicized as efforts to get motorcyclists to wear 
headgear 
a separate report released thursday by the cdc was based on a 
study in massachusetts that showed almost onequarter of 221 people 
responding to a survey drank alcohol while participating in aquatic 
activities including swimming and boating 
among the alcohol users 29 percent reported having more than 
four drinks from two hours before the activity until the end of the 
outing the cdc said 
though 25 percent to 50 percent of the annual 8000 adolescent 
and adult drownings in the united states involve alcohol 
consumption a researcher said the link between drinking and 
drowning is unclear 
the prevalence of drinking when youre out in the water is 
really quite high its much higher than drinking and driving 
said dr jonathan howland of boston universitys school of public 
health 
we can determine with some accuracy how many people who drown 
are drinking but we need to know more about the behavior of people 
who drink and didnt drown said howland who helped compile the 
report 
with current information however howland said there is no 
doubt that drinking contributes in general to injuries 
another cdc report said the new jersey state department of 
health in response to a study showing a high death rate for a type 
of skin cancer is preparing a publicity campaign emphasizing the 
danger of excessive exposure to the sun 
the cdc suggested that people avoid heavy exposure to the sun 
from 10 am to 3 pm wear hats and use a waterproof sunscreen 
according to the new jersey study from 1979 to 1985 an average 
of 381 males and 324 females were diagnosed annually in the state 
with malignant melanoma an average of 111 males and 79 females 
died each year from the cancer

memorial day it will mark the first time remains have been handed 
over since 1954 
jong ho north koreas deputy permanant representative at its 
un mission said we are happy to settle this issue in a 
humanitarian way 
we are sensitive to the feelings of the families concerned and 
to the appeals of veterans groups he said

delegation in the truce village of panmnujon ho said north korea 
was prepared to follow up with discussions in the same spirit 
to return other remains 
the north korean envoy said one of the men whose remains were 
being handed over was believed to have been a pilot but he said

for the time being 
the move is an eloquent illustration of north koreas 
willingness to settle pending issues with the us government in 
a good way ho said

sidelined by the 1988 us characterization of the north korean 
government as a state sponsor of terrorism north korea denied the 
accusation

the nations first bone marrow transplant 
using umbilical cord blood from one sibling to start blood 
production in another was a success hospital officials said 
officials at childrens hospital medical center said thursday 
that 6yearold eric miller of mcfarland wis is making good 
progress since the april 17 transplant 
in that operation similar to an ordinary blood transfusion 
eric was given umbilical cord blood that had been frozen since the 
birth of his 6monthold brother ethan 
doctors had waited until ethan was 6 months old in case more 
blood was needed if another transfusion had been necessary they 
did not want to subject a newborn to the procedure 
matching blood characteristics is vital to a bone marrow 
transplants success not all family members have compatible bone 
marrow but siblings often are a good source and umbilical cord 
blood is particularly rich in stem cells from which the body forms 
marrow 
eric suffers from fanconis anemia a rare inherited disorder 
that causes severe bone marrow failure 
hospital officials said erics operation was the first of its 
kind in north america although two other operations of this type 
have been performed in france 
at the time of the transplant doctors said it would take 
several weeks to determine its success 
hospital spokeswoman margaret devereux said thursday that the 
bone marrow has grown and reproduced in eric he was listed in good 
condition and was expected to be released from the hospital within 
two weeks she said

gonzalo pereira plans to get to his 
polling station early for sundays presidential election the less 
time spent standing in line the less chance of being killed by a 
bomb he says 
a lot of colombians are saying the same thing as car bombs 
explode in major cities most are believed set by drug lords trying 
to sabotage the vote 
at least eight bombs have exploded across the country in the 
past two weeks alone killing 34 people more than 200 people have 
died in attacks since the government declared war on drug 
traffickers in august 
the latest fatal bombing was thursday in medellin where five 
people died when a car bomb exploded another blast in the city 
friday injured three people 
i get nervous every time i walk by a parked car thinking this 
could be the next one to blow up said pereira an oil industry 
executive 
pereira said he figures that by showing up when polls open at 8 
am the line will be short and he can vote in perhaps 15 minutes 
most voting will take place at wooden sheds placed side by side 
along sidewalks and streets 
it is difficult to have a conversation with a colombian these 
days without the subject getting around to bombs and other 
terrorist acts 
the violence is keeping people away from public areas and 
overwhelmingly reducing their activities it might also keep people 
at home for the elections camilo castellanos a social 
scientist told the associated press 
a low voter turnout could wrest legitimacy from the winner that 
may be exactly what the perpetrators of the violence are seeking in 
their campaigns to destabilize politics officials say 
the terrorism is overshadowing major election issues such as 
constitutional reform and negotiations with leftist rebels 
instead staying clear of an indiscriminate terrorist attack is on 
the minds of most people 
restaurant business at night is off sharply said an american 
who owns one of bogotas biggest restaurants people are scared of 
bombs he said refusing to be identified 
soldiers forced their way into dozens of houses a week ago in 
search of bombs the army says it had learned of a drug 
traffickers plan to pack a house with tons of dynamite and set it 
off 
cars entering parking lots at shopping centers and supermarkets 
are inspected for bombs 
schoolchildren are being taught to take cover under desks in 
case of a bomb army officers are giving speeches to neighborhood 
housing organizations on evacuation and disaster control 
the army and police said they were mobilizing about 230000 
troops to ensure peaceful elections 
bogota is an armed camp military checkpoints line major streets 
and highways and armored personnel carriers mounted with machine 
guns patrol the cities soldiers are everywhere 
security concerns have prevented many candidates from appearing 
in public forcing them to conduct their campaigns through 
television and radio three of the main presidential candidates 
have been murdered during the campaign 
these are the most tense and difficult elections in colombian 
history antonio navarro the presidential candidate for the 
leftwing m19 party told reporters wednesday 
navarro took over as m19 candidate after his predecessor 
carlos pizarro was murdered in april by an assailant who shot him 
to death on a commercial jetliner over bogota 
the candidate who is expected to win the race cesar gaviria 
has sunk into a bunker mentality in the campaign gaviria 
candidate for the ruling liberal party has a security force of 
about 200 men the current president virgilio barco is barred by 
the constitution from seeking a second consecutive term 
according to the bogota daily newspaper el tiempo gavirias 
office is a superprotected bunker with steel enforced doors 
and ironclad windows designed to absorb dynamite blasts 
he leaves the room only when absolutely necessary the paper 
said 
being a presidential candidate is obviously a very risky 
business in colombia said castellanos 
the lifeanddeath issue dominates much of the campaigning 
alvaro gomez centerright candidate for the national salvation 
movement woos voters with the slogan to live again

among those evacuated were 80 residents of a nearby nursing 
home they were returned there this morning 
three train cars caught fire and were allowed to burn through 
the night beside its medical uses ethyl alcohol can be used as a 
fuel and a chemical solvent 
whaley said there were 17 other cars carrying hazardous 
materials the fire did not reach them he said 
it was touch and go at first because we were afraid vinyl 
chloride or the poisons could have been part of the fire he 
said referring to the other cars it had us worried it was 
scary

plo leader yasser arafat today accused israel of 
waging a war of extermination and called on the united nations 
to set up an international force to protect the arab population in 
israelioccupied lands 
in a 50minute speech that opened the special session of the 
15member un security council the palestine liberation 
organization chief also urged the creation of a separate united 
nations observer team charged with helping end the 23yearold 
israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
israel which has rejected the presence of united nations 
observers in the territories accused arafat of using lies and 
distortions in his speech 
arafat addressing the council for the first time also urged a 
ban on all israeli settlements in the occupied territories and the 
appointment of a permanent un representative to deal with the 
arabisraeli strife 
clad in his customary uniform and headscarf and speaking in 
arabic arafat did not give any details about either of the two 
un teams he was requesting for deployment in the occupied 
territories 
it was the first time the security council had met in geneva 
the gathering was moved from new york to avoid a showdown with the 
united states which in the past has refused to give arafat an 
entry visa 
the plo demand for safeguards for the 17 million palestinians 
in the occupied territories followed a renewed outbreak of violence 
triggered by the slaying on sunday of seven palestinian laborers by 
an apparently deranged former israeli soldier subsequent rioting 
left at least 15 arabs dead most by gunfire from israeli troops 
and more than 800 injured or wounded 
arafat denied that the killing of the palestinian laborers was 
an isolated attack by a disturbed man he said it was instead an 
outgrowth of israels illusions of defunct racial superiority 
and the stupid arrogance of military superiority 
he demanded sanctions against israel for refusing to comply with 
un resolutions and what he said was a violation of the geneva 
convention protecting civilians in time of war 
the situation now requires urgent action in order to enforce 
reverence for international legitimacy he said 
during the palestinian uprising he said the israeli 
occupation forces have been waging a war of extermination on all 
fronts 
he denounced terrorist and barbaric treatment of 
palestinians and vowed the uprising would continue until the 
occupation ended 
the plo chief also urged immediate moves by the united nations 
toward an international middle east peace conference and said the 
plo was prepared to deal flexibly with all international peace 
initiatives 
arafats comments drew 45 seconds of applause from the security 
council members and 20 observers present 
before the session began israels deputy foreign minister 
benyamin netanyahu told reporters that israel regards the gathering 
as an attempt to cynically exploit the solitary act of a crazed 
madman 
a us official also speaking before the opening of todays 
session said the american delegation would not speak at the 
meeting 
there seems to be a consensus here that the recent outbreak of 
violence in the occupied territories in particular should cease as 
rapidly as one could bring it about said the us official who 
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
secretary of state james a baker iii said wednesday the united 
states was ready to discuss the idea of setting up a un force in 
the occupied lands 
but on thursday the state department softened that somewhat it 
said in a statement that baker had in mind temporary visits by un 
observers to check out the situation in the occupied 
territories rather than a permanant force 
no decision was likely to be made in geneva according to the 
chief un spokesman francois giuliani he told reporters the 
security council would vote on the issue when delegates reconvene 
in new york probably on tuesday 
giuliani said the united nations sent the united states a 
request on arafats behalf to allow him entry but did not make a 
formal application 
the geneva session is open to all un members who wish to speak 
on the issue giuliani said the session could continue until late 
tonight and possibly reconvene on saturday 
arafat who was also to meet with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar planned to leave geneva on friday afternoon 
in december 1988 at a special un general assembly session in 
geneva arafat renounced terrorism and recognized israels right to 
exist that paved the way for a dialogue with the united states 
after a 13year american refusal to deal with his palestine 
liberation organization 
to date 720 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians since the arab uprising began in december 1987 in the 
occupied territories 
an additional 216 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israel fortythree 
israelis have died

customs agents went on strike friday 
and blocked one of the citys main roads to demand better pay and 
witnesses said some police fired into the air in apparent support 
of the strikers 
this west african nation once considered the economic miracle 
of black africa has been jolted by a wave of strikes and protests 
for more than two months 
soldiers police bus drivers shipyard workers and others have 
struck each time president felix houphouetboigny has met a 
delegation of the strikers and promised to improve their salaries 
and working conditions 
the government has been unable to pay its foreign debt for two 
years and has had difficulty meeting government payrolls it 
attributes the problem to sharply reduced earnings for exports 
particularly cocoa but critics say houphouetboigny has wasted 
hundreds of millions of dollars on personal projects and indulged 
his top advisers with fancy homes and cars 
the protests were triggered by an attempt to impose pay cuts and 
other austerity measures in march the measures were withdrawn but 
government employees whose salaries have been frozen eight years 
have kept up their pressure on the government 
the protests forced the closure of the countrys schools for the 
rest of this school year houphouetboigny also gave into demands 
to permit opposition parties 
his ivory coast democratic party has ruled the nation as a de 
facto oneparty state since independence from france in 1960

a judge today convicted winnie 
mandelas former bodyguard of killing a black teenage activist and 
said mrs mandela was at home the day the kidnapped boy was brought 
there and beaten 
supreme court justice brian odonovan convicted jerry richardson 
of murdering 14yearold james stompie seipei moeketsi on jan 1 
1989 
he also was convicted of kidnapping and assault in cases 
involving stompie and three other men who were abducted and beaten 
at mrs mandelas home in soweto township according to testimony 
in addition richardson was convicted of attempted murder in a case 
unrelated to the abductions 
mrs mandela the wife of black nationalist leader nelson 
mandela and a prominent antiapartheid activist herself was not 
charged in the case even though witnesses testified that she 
participated in the beatings mrs mandela has said she was not at 
her house when any assaults took place 
richardson once was mrs mandelas chief bodyguard and the coach 
of the mandela united soccer team whose members also served as 
guards 
his sentencing was postponed until aug 6 while he undergoes 
psychiatric examinations if no extenuating circumstances are 
found the death penalty is mandatory 
however president fw de klerk suspended executions in 
february as part of his efforts to encourage negotiations between 
the white minority government and black organizations such as the 
african national congress nelson mandela is deputy president of 
the anc 
three men testified during the 23day trial that richardson and 
other bodyguards kidnapped them and stompie from a methodist church 
house in soweto on dec 29 1988 
they said they were taken to mrs mandelas home and that she 
beat them and stompie with her fists and a whip then allowed her 
bodyguards to continue assaulting them 
eight other former bodyguards face trial on lesser charges mrs 
mandela did not testify at richardsons trial although his 
attorney asked her to do so 
mandela said wednesday that the government was trying to ruin 
his wifes reputation by deliberately not charging her in a case 
which centers on her however he said he was not calling on the 
government to prosecute his wife 
mrs mandela has made no public statement on the case since last 
year when leaders of major antiapartheid organizations accused 
her of complicity in the abductions and assaults and called on the 
soweto community to ostracize her 
a few months later she reappeared on the stage at antiapartheid 
rallies however and she has accompanied her husband at most 
public engagements since he was freed feb 11 after serving 27 
years in prison 
mrs mandela has denied committing any crime but said the 
abductions were justified she claimed that a methodist priest was 
engaging in homosexual activity with men at the church house the 
church investigated and cleared the priest of the allegations 
justice o donovan ruled that most of the assaults occurred on 
dec 29 1989 i find that mrs mandela was present on the 29th 
for at least part of the time he said 
he made no further comment on mrs mandelas involvement

consumer spending posted a moderate 06 
percent gain in april the government said friday in a report that 
analysts said was another sign the sluggish economy will avoid a 
recession 
the commerce department said consumer spending totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 368 trillion that followed 
05 percent increases in both february and march and was the 
largest gain since it jumped 12 percent in january 
consumers are willing to spend on goods and services if given 
a bargain said david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston 
amp co a new york government securities dealer 
even though spending is selective and moderate it is holding 
up well and is likely to keep the economy out of a recession this 
year jones said 
consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health 
since it accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic 
activity 
but the department said personal income increased only half as 
fast as spending for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 469 
trillion that was the lowest increase since last septembers 02 
percent and it followed 8 percent annual rate gains during each of 
the three previous months 
as a result americans savings rate savings as a percent of 
disposable income slipped from 58 percent in march to 55 
percent in april the rate had been 55 percent in february up 
from 53 percent in january 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill a lexington 
mass forecasting organization said recent spending levels are 
not sustainable without matching levels of income growth 
i dont think consumers on their own will push the economy 
into a recession she said so while spending will slow it is 
not likely to turn negative 
personal consumption which includes everything except interest 
payments on debt rose 219 billion up from marchs 194 billion 
increase 
purchases of durable goods products expected to last at least 
three years rebounded 38 billion from a 32 billion drop in 
march ms latta said much of the gain was in automobile sales 
purchases of nondurable goods also bounced back gaining 13 
billion after falling 400 million the previous month services 
gained 168 billion on top of a 23 billion rise in march 
the department said both the april and march increases in 
personal income were affected by farm subsidy payments excluding 
subsidies personal incomes rose 05 percent in both months 
the report said americans income after taxes slowed to a 02 
percent increase from a 08 percent gain in march and a 07 percent 
jump in february it had risen 09 percent in both december and 
january 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 191 billion at an annual rate after a 154 billion gain in 
march

president samuel doe said friday he is 
ready to step down or hold early elections under international 
supervision to help end a northernbased rebellion in which 
hundreds of liberians have been killed 
doe made the offer at a progovernment rally the day after his 
forces announced their first victory against rebels the recapture 
of the strategic atlantic port of buchanan in southeastern liberia 
the rebel national patriotic front of charles taylor did not 
respond immediately to does offer the two men have refused to 
hold direct negotiations as the united states has suggested 
it was not possible to confirm the governments claim its forces 
had recaptured buchanan diplomats said they were receiving 
conflicting reports on who held buchanan liberias main port 
which rebels took sunday telephone lines to the city were down 
doe told the rally he did not want to remain president if it 
meant liberians had to suffer and die 
i can go into private life while continuing my education at 
the university here he said no no we want doe supporters 
shouted in response 
the rally began with a march through the streets of monrovia 
demonstrators carried placards denouncing burkina faso ivory coast 
and libya for allegedly supporting the rebels 
gadhafi kills peace said one of the banners ivory coast 
unfriendly neighbor burkina faso unfriendly country 
doe also said that if liberians wished it he would invite 
international observers and an independent electoral commission to 
supervise early elections 
but the rallying group shouted that it would be interference in 
the west african nations internal affairs 
internal and exiled opposition parties have said their 
experience at previous polls which observers said were rigged 
left them with no confidence in elections due to be held next year 
doe did not say when he might hold earlier elections 
at a news conference friday deputy information minister moses 
washington said 350 rebels were killed in a government ambush as 
they tried to infiltrate past gbarnga a garrisoned town 107 miles 
northeast of monrovia 
washington said government forces retook buchanan after moving 
in slowly to minimize civilian casualities he gave no figures on 
deaths in the buchanan fighting saying only that troops were 
pursuing rebel commander moses duopu a former liberian cabinet 
minister who led forces in the port 
this appeared to contradict reports that duopu had broken with 
taylor another former doe aide and was commanding a separate 
rebel force in northern liberia 
forces loyal to doe had mostly avoided contact with the rebels 
who invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 many soldiers fled to 
neighboring guinea when the insurgents attacked the rebels 
controlled nimba county where the invasion began and most of two 
other counties 
doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ended domination by 
freed american slaves who founded liberia in 1847

vice president dan quayle told 3000 high school students

what the teachers and kids realize is here is a guy who is on 
the road constantly giving speech after speech and under public 
scrutiny so those things happen fischer said he probably 
misread a card

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev today 
branded the leaders of secessionist lithuania adventurists and 
called on them to rescind their march 11 declaration of 
independence 
we have great reserves of willpower but we are looking for 
ways to end the impasse gorbachev said at a news conference with 
visiting french president francois mitterrand 
he repeated an earlier appeal to the lithuanians to back away 
from their independence declaration and follow a new soviet law 
that requires a referendum for any of the 15 republics to secede 
lets return to march 10 and start the constitutional 
process he said at the news conference which was broadcast live 
on soviet television 
gorbachev halfjoking said the lithuanians had decided not 
to make a gift to president gorbachev on the eve of his visit to 
the united states where he is to meet with president bush next 
week 
he also justified the use of army troops to occupy communist 
party buildings in lithuania in march and economic sanctions that 
included cutting off oil and natural gas shipments 
what happened in lithuania was that a group of adventurists is 
speculating on such issues as independence he said 
i can say that in a similar situation the american president 
would put the situation under control in 24 hours 
gorbachev also has decreed that the other two baltic states 
latvia and estonia violated soviet law by taking more moderate 
steps toward independence 
leaders of the three republics all forcibly annexed in 1940 
say they are willing to compromise but will not surrender their 
goal of seceding from the soviet union 
gorbachev has refused to negotiate with lithuania unless it 
suspends the independence declaration he told four lithuanian 
legislators on thursday that if they agreed to suspend the 
declaration and follow moscows procedures for secession lithuania 
could gain independence in as little as two years said one of the 
legislators vaidotas antanaitis 
as a result of kremlin sanctions against lithuania numerous 
factories across the republic have been forced to shut down 
throwing an estimated 19000 people out of work lithuanian 
officials said that central hot water supplies were shut off 
throughout the republic today because regional distribution 
stations had run out of oil 
in the latvian capital of riga legislative today leaders 
rejected gorbachevs may 14 order voiding their declaration of 
independence a spokesman said 
ivars embrekts a spokeseman for the presidium or executive 
council of latvias supreme council said the body sent gorbachev 
a telegram that said the constitution of the ussr does not 
give the president of the ussr the right to repeal laws or 
decisions which have been taken by the supreme council of the 
republic of latvia 
it said the dispute should be resolved in negotiations 
in tallinn centrist and radical deputies clashed today over 
what role the new estonian congress elected by ethnic estonians 
should have in relation to the republics traditional supreme 
soviet 
in vilnius the lithuanian capital a spokesman for lithuanias 
supreme council said that legislatures executive council met 
behind closed doors to hear a report on thursdays talks in moscow 
between gorbachev and the four lithuanian lawmakers 
but another spokesman aidas palubinskas said later the issue 
did not come up today 
antanaitis speaking in a telephone interview said that at 
thursdays meeting gorbachev also threatened to impose presidential 
rule on lithuania unless it suspends its declaration of 
independence 
on the one hand there were concessions but also threats that 
if you continue taking action on your own well take such 
measures antanaitis said of gorbachevs statements 
the new york times today quoted other participants in the 
meeting as saying that gorbachev acknowledged there was pressure on 
him to impose presidential rule but he said he did not see that as 
a reasonable act in this case 
presidential rule would be a major escalation in the test of 
wills between the kremlin and the republic of 38 million people 
under such rule lithuanias parliament and government could be 
replaced with officials appointed by moscow 
ethnic russian residents of lithuania who oppose independence 
as well as some soviet politicians have pressed gorbachev for 
weeks to impose presidential rule but he said on april 10 that 
such a step would be extreme and used only in a civil conflict

president bush called the presidents 
of nicaragua and panama today to tell them 720 million in us 
help will soon be on its way after congress finally approved his 
emergency aid package for the hemispheres two newest democracies 
bush will sign the aid bill as soon as he receives it 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart said that could 
come later today or saturday he added 
the white house announced as bush arrived here for a memorial 
day weekend vacation that he had telephoned both nicaraguan 
president violeta chamorro and panamanian president guillermo 
endara to inform them that congress had finally passed the 
emergency aid early today 
the two latin leaders expressed their gratitude for the 
congressional action and thanked bush for his efforts on behalf 
of their countries hart said in a statement 
they stated that this is a major step forward in solidifying 
and supporting the growth of democracy in panama and nicaragua 
said hart 
congress gave final approval to the 420 million for panama and 
300 million for nicaragua as the lawmakers rushed to adjourn for 
their own holiday weekend recess bush had asked for 800 million 
in early march 
the lawmakers whittled that down and padded the bill with 4 in 
hometown spending for every dollar of latin aid 
when finally sent to bush on a 308108 house vote the measure 
had swelled to more than 4 billion it included programs that 
ranged from filling in a collapsed utility tunnel on a street in 
salisbury nc to giving the samoan islands a 750000 ferry boat 
chamorro is seeking to revive nicaraguas government after 11 
years of sandinista rule while panama is still recovering from 
us trade sanctions and last decembers invasion 
it also included other foreign assistance 75 million to meet 
refugee needs around the world 45 million in antinarcotics aid 
to bolivia and peru 30 million for aid to caribbean countries and 
30 million for africa 
but overshadowing those amounts was several billion dollars in 
domestic programs such as the 12 billion needed to make up a 
shortfall in food stamp funds for the current fiscal year which 
ends sept 30 545 million for veterans benefits 166 million for 
head start and 432 million for fighting forest fires 
in what amounts to the first application of a peace dividend 
from reduced eastwest tensions roughly half of the new spending 
is being financed by cuts in this years proposed pentagon budget 
cuts agreed to by the administration 
the measure includes 110 million to help the census bureau 
finish its lagging 1990 head count and 216 million for disaster 
aid primarily for southern states affected by flooding and 
hurricanes most of that was wanted both by lawmakers and by the 
white house 
but there were many other items that could make bush hold his 
nose when he signs the measure most pet projects of individual 
members of congress 
among the items approved were nearly 40 individual grants 
through the department of housing and urban development totaling 
28 million most of them for communities whose members of congress 
are on the house and senate appropriations committees 
on the list was 400000 to fill in a collapsed utility tunnel 
in salisbury nc sought by rep bill hefner dnc and 
990000 to fix up a waterfront park in bay city mich in the 
district of democratic rep bob traxler 
rep robert walker rpa complained that the porkbarrel 
allocation process was no different than the political favoritism 
that led to the hud scandal congress is now investigating if 
its corrupt at hud its corrupt here walker said 
a 6 million provision sought by rep neal smith diowa would 
buy land near des moines iowa from a power company and turn it 
into a wildlife refuge smith argued on the house floor that the 
purchase was an unusual and unexpected opportunity 
republicans complained the provision was a specialinterest item 
and noted that it was opposed by the fish and wildlife service but 
the democraticcontrolled house voted 246160 to leave the 
provision in 
among other additions were 
transfer of a 750000 ship from the defense department to 
american samoa to provide transportation among the islands the 
provision was written into the bill by sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii a senior member of the senate appropriations panel who 
found it difficult to get around during visits to the islands 
an order for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration to build an experimental fish farming laboratory at 
stuttgart ark the state of democratic appropriations committee 
member sen dale bumpers a democrat 
12 million to modify the mormon island auxiliary dam in

congressional investigators said today their 
tests did not support the navys finding that sabotage caused the 
explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the uss iowa 
the congressional report which came a day after the navy 
reopened its investigation into the disaster said the explosion 
could have resulted from gunpowder bags in the ships guns being 
rammed at higher than normal speeds 
the report was presented to the senate armed services committee 
by the general accounting office which investigated the navys 
controversial finding that gunners mate clayton hartwig probably 
sabotaged the battleship in the april 19 1989 explosion 
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga said todays 
testimony by the gao report cast grave doubts on the navys 
findings that foreign material had been found in the gun barrel 
defense secretary dick cheney responding to the gao report 
said he would reserve judgement until further investigation 
they did the best job they could now theres new evidence 
new information that warrants reopening the investigation cheney 
said but i think at this point id want to keep my powder dry 
so to speak until we have a better sense of exactly what this new 
information may contribute 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina who attended the hearing told 
reporters my brother was only a victim i hope after today 
this will get rid of any doubt in anyones mind 
retired capt fred moosally the uss iowas skipper at the time 
of the explosion and an outspoken critic of the investigation sat 
in the front row during the hearing but he declined to comment 
saying im only here to listen 
the navy issued a statement saying it will continue to test 
additional theories dealing with the possible causes of the 
explosion 
technical tests continue and results of that testing will be 
made public as soon as the analysis and report is completed and 
reviewed by the secretary of the navy the statement said any 
further discussion on aspects of the additional testing would be 
premature at this present time 
on thursday the navy ordered a halt to any firing of 16inch 
guns aboard the services four battleships after an unexplained 
ignition of some gunpowder bags during testing 
nunn said the gao finding will essentially eviscerate the 
navys conclusion that the explosion aboard the uss iowa was the 
result of a wrongful intentional act 
the gao said tests at the sandia national laboratories could 
not corroborate the navys technical finding that an improvised 
chemical device initiated the explosion 
last fall the navy said hartwig who was killed in the 
explosion most probably had placed some type of detonation 
device between gunpowder bags when he supervised the loading of 
the warships guns 
the gao analysis made no mention specifically of hartwig in its 
report 
the report said the sandia laboratory was confident in its 
findings which conclude that the foreign materials that the navy 
found were not inconsistent with the nominal levels found 
throughout gun turrets and were consistent with the maritime 
environment 
elements of calcium and chlorine which the navy contended came 
from a detonator placed between the gunpowder bags were readily 
found in turret no1 aboard the iowa and in turrets on the 
battleships new jersey and wisconsin the report said 
therefore sandia could not corroborate the navys finding 
that such foreign material was evidence of a detonator the 
report said 
the sandia laboratory testing also questioned the navys finding 
that impact and compression of the gunpowder bags did not 
contribute to the iowa explosion 
sandia believes that a possible alternate scenario to the 
navys finding of a deliberate act is that an unintentional 
highspeed overram of the powder bags combined with the impact 
sensitivity of the powder led to the explosion the report said 
sandia does not consider its study complete in the sense that 
a clear and definite cause of the explosion has been identified 
and it recommends areas of further investigation by the navy 
the gao also recommended in its report that because of problems 
with manning and training for the world war iiera battleships and 
their complex gun systems the battleships that remain in the 
navys fleet seem to be top candidates for decommissioning as we 
look for ways to scale back us forces 
all four of the navys battleships are now in port the uss 
iowa and the uss wisconsin at norfolk va and the uss new jersey 
and the uss missouri at long beach calif the iowa and new jersey 
are slated for retirement this year to save money and the 
investigators suggestion that the missouri and wisconsin be 
mothballed would remove all battleships from the nations arsenal 
sen john warner rva the committees ranking republican 
disagreed with statements asserting that the navy had been involved 
in a coverup and should apologize its far too early to make 
such conclusions warner said 
earlier in the day sen howard metzenbaum dohio said i 
think some of those who headed up the investigation ought to be 
called on the carpet i think it is posible some heads will 
roll 
the navys report last fall said the fireball aboard the iowa 
most probably was an intentional act by hartwig who it said 
was upset about the breakup of his friendship with another crew 
member kendall truitt 
its long overdue truitt said today of the navys decision 
to reopen the investigation 
hartwigs father earl hartwig himself a navy gunners mate in 
world war ii said in cleveland this is what weve been saying 
all along my son is not guilty the navy was barking up the wrong 
tree 
the ignition of several gunpowder bags came thursday during 
followup testing which the navy has been doing periodically as 
new theories were brought forward since the iowa blast and the 
navys review of it the service said 
after conducting a fourmonth examination of the iowa explosion 
and about 20000 technical tests of gunpowder blasts the navy 
contended in september that it had found no technical reason for 
the explosion 
the service admitted it only had circumstantial evidence for its 
finding because all witnesses died in the fire 
members of congress and others attacked that conclusion as 
unsupported by evidence and faulted the investigation as inadequate 
ten days ago nunn wrote adm carlisle ah trost the chief of 
naval operations to complain the service was not moving fast 
enough to act on evidence that the iowa blast might have been 
caused by a friction problem pentagon sources said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the navy 
was informed several weeks ago about the results of tests conducted 
by the sandia laboratory in albuquerque nm 
in the new experiment five 96pound bags filled with gunpowder 
pellets were dropped in a vertical column with weights on top of 
them in an attempt to recreate the force that rams the bags 
through a 16inch gun barrel on a warship 
on the 18th try they got a detonation said the source who 
asked not to be quoted by name

the revolution that toppled oneparty rule 
in poland last year remains a workinprogress and the next stage 
of demolition occurs sunday in democratic elections for 52000 
local council members nationwide 
they are the first fully free elections since world war ii and 
are expected to root out thousands of communist holdovers many of 
whom ran their towns and villages as virtual dictators from their 
last bastion of authority 
the aim is to restore after a fourdecade absence the concept 
of freely chosen local governments empowered to raise and spend 
local revenues and free from direct control of the central 
government 
regardless who wins the elections it will be the end of 
totalitarian authority in poland election commissioner jerzy 
stepien said at a news conference 
this is the most important event in poland in the last 40 
years said 23yearold medical student jerzy kryszton studying 
a list of solidarity civic committee candidates posted at a warsaw 
campaign office 
first of all these are the first really democratic and free 
elections in poland secondly this will be the only chance and the 
only way to get rid of the local mafias to get rid of the local 
communist activist who still controls everything in the 
countryside 
although the electoral battles are being fought locally the 
results are being watched nationally in the country of 38 million 
as an important test for the solidarity movement whose unity is 
strained between its trade union and political wings 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki took to the hustings in the 
campaigns closing days to build support for the ballot and for the 
candidates being put forth by the solidaritylinked citizens 
committees still polands most potent political force 
scores of new independent political parties have arisen since 
last years parliamentary elections the voting will show if any of 
them is developed enough to grab a significant chunk of 
solidaritys following 
among those vying are the confederation for an independent 
poland and the christian national union on the right wing the 
environmentally minded green party the libertarian union of real 
politics the centerright christian democratic party of labor 
several similarly named peasant parties and at least four socialist 
parties 
the main successor to the nowdissolved communist party the 
social democracy of the polish republic is struggling to remain on 
the political stage 
in addition to those endorsed by political groups about 40 
percent of the approximately 146000 people seeking seats are 
independents or are backed only by local resident or neighborhood 
associations 
government officials hope for a high turnout but fear many poles 
alienated by the painful economic policies will stay away in a 
passive protest 
polls so far indicate a 60 percent turnout slightly lower than 
the 62 percent that took part in the partially free parliamentary 
voting last june that gave solidarity a landslide and paved the way 
to the east blocs first noncommunistled government in september 
im not going to vote said stalislawa czajkowska a 
40yearold secretary i have lost all hope that things might 
change for the better here solidarity has achieved nothing but an 
even bigger mess she said citing rising crime and higher prices 
i doubt it is possible to achieve anything in this country 
with this society said photographer antoni gontarki 42 who 
said he probably would stay home election day if he did vote it 
would be for one of the extreme anticommunist parties like the 
confederation for an independent poland 
poland had independent local councils and mayors during its 21 
years of independence between world war i and world war ii but by 
1950 the communists who seized control had done away with the 
local governments that reappeared after the war 
after the adoption of a sovietmodeled constitution in 1952 
local peoples councils were established but candidates could only 
run with communist party approval and the councils were essentially 
local agents of the central government in warsaw which provided 
all their operating money and could dismiss council members and 
reverse decisions 
a large part of the governments role in the elections has been 
simply to explain to people what local governments are and how they 
function in the west 
the elections will also mark a huge divestiture of wealth from 
the central government which owns more than 90 percent of polish 
property about onefifth of these assets including land 
buildings and factories will be turned over to the newly 
established local governments overnight

president mikhail s gorbachev said today that the 
soviet union would review its policies on european arms control and 
security negotiations if a reunited germany joined nato 
the soviet leader told a news conference that western leaders 
seem to be assuming a unified germany would join the north atlantic 
treaty organization and said moscow was very wary of that prospect 
what should we do then about all the negotiating processes 
including the european process the csce process the vienna 
disarmament processs then we must take a fresh look at whether we 
should pursue the same policy whether we should base it on the 
same approaches gorbachev told reporters in the soviet foreign 
ministry press center 
the superpowers are involved in negotiations on reducing their 
nuclear and conventional forces and hope to reach some agreements 
during the summit between president bush and gorbachev in 
washington from may 31 to june 3 csce refers to the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe which deals with 
military security economic cooperation and human rights 
gorbachevs remarks contained the kremlins most dire warning 
yet about what steps it would take if a reunited germany joins the 
western military alliance the soviet preference repeated by 
gorbachev today was that a reunited germany belong to both nato 
and the warsaw pact 
gorbachev said discussion of german reunification took up 70 
percent of his talks earlier in the day with french president 
francois mitterrand who also appeared at the news conference 
the bush administration favors nato membership for a reunited 
germany 
the soviet leader did not say his country would withdraw from 
the european negotiating processes which cover reductions of 
troops and tanks on the continent and other security issues and 
did not specify how the kremlins positions in those talks might 
change 
he justified the policy review by saying nato would take similar 
action if the shoe were on the other foot 
if a unified germany should find itself part of the warsaw 
treaty then im sure the western countries would immediately get 
together to discuss how they should proceed further gorbachev 
said 
skewing a reunited germany in either direction he said would 
upset the strategic balance in european negotiations 
there is a question whether these processes would not become 
hostages to that kind of imbalance he said 
the kremlin chief told reporters he issued the warning not to 
try to scare any of you so that you would begin to reflect right 
away what kind of trump card is being prepared by the soviet 
union but to appeal for a joint search for the right 
solutions so that we not weaken the positive processes in 
international relations

members of earth first said bari and cherney were targets of 
the bomb after receiving several death threats in recent weeks but 
sims said there was strong evidence from searches of various 
locations that the two were knowingly transporting the bomb 
based on our determination of the placement of the device in 
the car we believe they should have known it was there we believe 
it went off accidently sims said 
he said officers found no more explosives in their searches but 
turned up other evidence he would not discuss 
i dont believe it said mark huntington a friend of the 
pair and an earth first supporter if the police produced 
evidence and put it on tv i still wouldnt believe it i think 
they planted it the fbi has a lot of reasons to get rid of 
darryl and judi and shut down redwood summer 
for them to say they could possibly be involved in what was 
obviously a threat on their lives is really outrageous said mike 
roselle an earth first founder 
they would never have anything to do with bombs or guns they 
are completely nonviolent no way said earth first 
spokeswoman kelpie wilson 
as many as 50 members of earth first and their supporters 
crowded the police department lobby in what they called a vigil 
vowing not to leave until cherney was released the crowd sang 
played guitars and made signs reading free cherney trees not 
bombs and smash fbi frameups 
police also refused to say why officers on thursday night 
blocked the headquarters of the group seeds of peace which has 
worked with earth first officers searched a van parked near the 
peace groups headquarters on the oaklandberkeley border and 
removed several items from the van 
cherney of piercy and bari of ukiah in northern california 
were in the san francisco bay area to drum up support for a summer 
campaign to slow timber cutting in the oldgrowth forests of 
northern california 
cherney was driving baris station wagon near oakland high 
school when the bomb went off inside the car shortly before noon 
the car continued on about a block before hitting two parked cars 
both injured activists were organizing the redwood summer 
campaign of continual demonstrations to block what some 
environmentalists call excessive logging earth first spokeswoman 
wilson said 
pacific lumber co which has been a target of earth first 
protests issued a statement late thursday saying the company does 
not condone or promote violence be it spiking trees blowing up 
power lines or bombing cars and hopes bari and cherney fully 
recover from this appalling incident 
wilson said bari is a wellknown eco warrior who advocated 
tree spiking the driving of long metal spikes into trees to 
damage lumbering equipment

the us trade deficit shrank to 264 billion 
from january through march the smallest quarterly imbalance in 
more than six years the government reported friday 
the commerce department said the 82 percent improvement in the 
trade balance was a result of recordhigh export sales that offset 
the highest volume of foreign oil shipments in more than 12 years 
the improving trade performance if it continues would be good 
news for the us economy over the past three years rising 
exports have accounted for more than onethird of total domestic 
growth as american manufacturers enjoyed a boom in foreign sales 
in other economic news friday the commerce department reported 
that consumer spending shot up by 06 percent in april however 
the national association of realtors reported that sales of 
existing homes fell 21 percent in april 
the betterthanexpected performance sent many economists 
scurrying to revise their trade forecasts for the year many had 
been expecting that weaker foreign demand and a rising oil bill 
would translate into a worsening trade deficit 
we have continued strong export growth and that is leading to 
better trade numbers than a lot of people were predicting 
including us said howard lewis vice president for international 
economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co said 
export growth should continue to be an important source of strength 
for the us economy for some time to come 
europe and germany in particular and to a lesser degree asia 
will be the locomotive for us growth he said 
however some analysts cautioned that it was too soon to tell 
whether the first quarter performance would continue for the rest 
of the year they noted that oil imports are surging because us 
production has dropped to 25year lows and that the strength of the 
us dollar in comparison to the japanese yen could start showing 
up in rising imports of japanese products 
cynthia latta an economist at drimcgraw hill said her 
forecasting company was still expecting only a small improvement in 
the overall trade deficit when compared with 1989 
for the first quarter us exports rose 47 percent to an 
alltime high of 9604 billion imports were also at a record 
level reflecting the surge in oil demand they climbed 16 
percent to 1224 billion 
the report friday on merchandise trade as calculated on a 
balanceofpayments basis confirmed trends already noted in the 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports they showed a first 
quarter deficit of 239 billion 
the disparity in the two figures comes from the fact that 
fridays report excludes military sales by the us government and 
makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures 
the increase in consumer spending was the biggest gain since 
january and was double the 03 percent rise in personal incomes 
last month 
analysts said the strength in consumer spending coupled with the 
strong gains in export sales were good indications for future 
economic growth 
the decrease in sales of existing home was the third decline in 
the past four months with high mortgage rates blamed for the 
weakness 
the firstquarter trade performance marked the second 
consecutive quarterly improvement in the deficit in the fourth 
quarter the gap between exports and imports had fallen 35 
percent to 287 billion 
exports of machine tools industrial supplies and consumer goods 
climbed 4 percent to a record 851 billion in the first quarter 
more than onehalf of this increase was attributed to a rise in 
civilian aircraft shipments after the end of the boeing strike 
exports of farm products were up 7 percent to 11 billion with 
increases recorded in overseas sales of wheat vegetables fruits 
and nuts corn exports were down reflecting sharply lower 
shipments to the soviet union 
average prices of corn and cotton increased 2 percent while 
prices of other commodities changed little the government said 
imports of petroleum surged 17 percent in the first quarter to 
156 billion with the average number of barrels imported daily 
climbing to 89 million the highest level since the third quarter 
of 1977 
the average price per barrel increased to 1947 the highest 
since the first quarter of 1986 when the price per barrel was 
1765 
americas deficits declined with several countries including 
japan down 19 billion to 104 billion for the first quarter

imelda marcos reportedly met recently with a 
lawyer hired to fight the philippine governments effort to seize 
billions of dollars she and her late husband allegedly stashed in 
swiss banks a witness testified today 
sergio salvioni an attorney representing the government in 
manila told a us district court jury he was told of the new york 
meeting by bruno depreux who he said had identified himself as 
representing mrs marcos the former philippine first lady 
he said he met ferdinand and imelda marcos in honolulu two 
times and he met imelda marcos one time here in the continental 
united states salvioni said the last time was more or less 
two to three weeks ago here in new york 
under questioning by assistant us attorney charles labella 
salvioni quoted depreux as saying he originally was hired to 
represent both mrs marcos and her husband after marcos ouster as 
president of the philippines in early 1986 marcos died last year 
in hawaiian exile 
and now he represents mrs marcos and her heirs salvioni 
said 
mrs marcos is accused of having helped her husband steal more 
than 220 million from their countrys treasury using the money to 
support a luxury lifestyle and investments including four secretly 
purchased new york office buildings 
salvioni a member of the swiss parliament flew to new york 
from geneva to testify prosecutors hoped he would help prove the 
marcoses used secret accounts in at least eight swiss banks to hold 
some of the embezzled funds during marcos 20year reign 
judge john f keenan allowed salvioni to testify before jurors 
on certain details after rejecting defense protests that his 
information would be explosive and prejudicial to mrs marcos 
keenan turned aside defense arguments that salvionis remarks 
quoting depreux were hearsay and therefore inadmissible but 
barred any references to actual details of the bank accounts 
mrs marcos wearing her customary black showed no visible 
emotion as the swiss lawyer explained the efforts by president 
corazon aquinos government to gain access to the swiss accounts

the united states will make the first 
invitation for foreign participation in the superconducting super 
collider to japan and south korea deputy secretary of energy 
henson moore said friday 
moore and a team of administration officials are scheduled to 
visit japan and south korea next week to discuss the project with 
government officials 
the point is to begin the process to officially ask them to 
join us to answer their questions and to discuss with them what we 
think is appropriate participation and get their feedback 
moore said 
moore said foreign participation was typical in all large 
science labs and congress has insisted on it for the collider to 
be built south of dallas 
the collider will be a 54mile tunnel where protons will crash 
into each other at high speeds at the direction of superconducting 
magnets scientists hope the particles will break apart yielding 
clues to the fundamental nature of matter 
a similar trip to europe is likely in october moore said 
although india is the only country that has formally expressed 
interest in the collider it sent a letter of intent to pledge 50 
million 
japan and south korea have been waiting for this visit to 
officially begin their considerations within their governments 
moore said 
but moore said both countries had indicated interest in the 
giant atom smasher he refused to elaborate 
it may well be a year before we have any kind of solid feeling 
from the japanese government and korean government moore said 
we hope to have some indication of interest on this trip 
the house earlier this month authorized spending 5 billion on 
the approximately 8 billion project the rest is to be made up 
from outside sources such as foreign investors texas has pledged 
1 billion

a beleaguered soviet premier appealed to consumers 
friday to stop their panic buying of food triggered by his 
announcement of plans for sharp price increases and urged 
lawmakers to quickly approve economic reforms 
opposition deputies in parliament demanded a noconfidence vote 
aimed at bringing down premier nikolai i ryzhkovs government but 
he got one important voice of support for his program from 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
im hoping in the end after all the debates and they wont 
be simple well agree that we have to move toward a market im 
sure of this gorbachev said at a news conference 
ryzhkovs plan broadcast on national television thursday 
proposes tripling the price of bread and other flourbased products 
on july 1 and increasing the prices of most other consumer goods in 
january 
it envisions a fiveyear gradual shift to a governmentregulated 
market economy by freeing most prices raising taxes selling off 
state property and reducing central control of industry 
announcement of the plan triggered immediate rushes to stores 
for macaroni and bread ryzhkov told reporters at the kremlin 
now this wave for bread and bread products has already rolled 
through half the country and its gotten to moscow he said 
i am appealing for restraint and calm said ryzhkov looking 
haggard and with his voice ragged from fatigue 
tension is growing were getting a lot of telegrams 
expressing concern how are we going to live ryzhkov told the 
supreme soviet parliament that must approve his economic plan 
the premier who bears responsibility for the economic program 
indicated that if it led to a vote of noconfidence against his 
government he would abide by the outcome if there is no 
confidence in the government then what he asked a new 
government will work 
opposition deputies in the supreme soviet have already demanded 
a noconfidence vote after the legislature votes on the economic 
plan they have said they expect it to fail but believe they have 
to make the political gesture 
deputy after deputy both conservatives and radicals took the 
podium friday to attack the government plan 
ryzhkov said the criticism had helped the government see the 
weak sides of the program and should continue into next week but 
urged a quick decision on whether bread prices should rise as 
planned you have to decide because this question is so 
difficult for us and for the people he said 
bread is the staple of the soviet diet virtually the only 
product thats always readily available and remains cheap at about 
32 cents a loaf 
in the ukraine long known as the soviet unions breadbasket 
the republics prime minister said his government would fight 
ryzhkovs plan ukrainian activists reported 
miners in the ukraines donetsk coal region will consider 
calling for a countrywide coal strike to protest the plan when they 
meet june 11 according to the rukh press an arm of the ukrainian 
popular front 
supreme soviet deputy mikhail bronstein warned that the entire 
country would need a ration card system to make it through the 
transition period 
ryzhkov indicated after his report thursday that increased 
rationing might be needed most regions of the country already have 
some form of rationing 
radical economist pavel bunich told the supreme soviet the 
government had rejected more severe shock therapy reforms only 
to offer shock therapy without the therapy reforms that will 
hurt without leading to a real market system bunich proposed 
putting the whole plan back on the government drawing board 
ryzhkov acknowledged that the country will have to live 
through a pretty hard period as the market reforms take effect 
but he pledged government support for lowincome families and other 
measures to cushion the bumpy economic ride ahead in which 
economists have predicted millions of unemployed 
announcement of the economic program has already prompted 
muscovites to stock up 
at food shop number one on gorky street a shop assistant who 
asked not to be identified said panicstricken buyers are 
literally clearing full shelves for hoarding 
at another food shop near the center an unusually long line of 
25 to 30 people were packed into the grocery department this is 
the first time i saw people lining up like this for some cheap 
cereals a regular customer said 
at the novoarbatsky supermarket however manager valentina 
aramasova said the situation was normal the same as the days 
before the economic program was announced

president fw de klerk of south africa said friday 
his government will consider lifting the nationwide state of 
emergency that has been in force for four years 
winding up his ninenation european tour de klerk also said he 
senses that there is an emerging consensus that economic sanctions 
imposed on south africa because of its apartheid policy should be 
lifted 
my impression is that it is becoming more and more clear to 
everybody concerned that sanctions are becoming irrelevant he 
told reporters after meetings with italian government and business 
leaders 
de klerk left for south africa on friday evening 
the state of emergency in south africa was imposed june 12 
1986 by de klerks predecessor pw botha to quell political and 
racial violence 
the decree gives police wide powers to detain people without 
charge ban political rallies restrict the movement of journalists 
and prohibit any act deemed a threat to public order 
the proclamation comes up for reconsideration in june as it 
does each year 
we will consider all alternatives at that time de klerk 
said we sincerely believe that the state of emergency must go as 
soon as possible there are various alternatives at which we 
will look i dont want to raise any expectations apart from saying 
we will be looking at this fundamentally 
we can only afford to lift it should the level of violence go 
down de klerk said in some areas it is extremely high 
fighting between rival black factions has wracked many urban 
areas in recent months 
de klerk said his european tour had confirmed international 
support for his reform policies he visited france greece 
portugal belgium britain west germany switzerland spain and 
italy 
since assuming power in august he has released black leader 
nelson mandela after 27 years in prison legalized black opposition 
groups and pledged to share power with the black majority south 
africas white minority now controls the government and de klerk 
has stopped short of supporting black majority rule 
de klerk visited european nations last year as leader of the 
national party and he said friday that there was much less 
skepticism now over whether south africa was committed to change 
they wanted to believe us but they wanted to see he said 
now i found credibility south africa is being believed 
he described the international sanctions imposed on south africa 
as a dismal failure that contributed to unemployment and the 
volatile atmosphere in 1986 the european community banned imports 
of south african iron steel and gold coins and prohibited new 
investments in the country 
italian premier giulio andreotti and president francesco cossiga 
expressed support for de klerks policies 
the road taken is the right one andreotti said 
continuing on this path de klerk can count on the help of italy 
and europe 
giovanni agnelli chairman of fiat said italian industrialists 
will be interested in doing business in south africa

a wildcat rail strike spread to the port 
city of gdansk on friday and cut off all rail traffic to polands 
baltic coast and a government spokesman said workers and officials 
were at an impasse 
the strikes for higher pay and railroad reforms began sunday and 
represented a growing challenge to polands first postcommunist 
government and its program to establish a market economy 
the government cannot meet the pay proposals being put forward 
and will not agree to discuss them in the conditions of a strike 
paralyzing everything prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki told a 
crowd at a local election rally friday in the southwestern city of 
wroclaw 
solidarity leader lech walesa said on nationwide radio that 
demagogical forces were trying to exploit workers legitimate 
grievances 
the government has refused to negotiate with workers because the 
strike was not organized through legal unions 
the opzz union the onetime communistbacked labor federation 
endorsed the strike thursday the union is challenging solidarity 
for the support of workers and walesa accused its leadership of 
manipulating the strikers in a game that will solve nothing but 
may lead even to a civil war 
there were some signs of easing tensions late friday a hunger 
strike by 42 rail workers six of them hospitalized was suspended 
three rail stations in northern poland reopened officials said 
but transport ministry spokesman stefan pozniak said the labor 
dispute remained at a total impasse 
the entire coast is affected by the strike now and there is 
not a single port working normally its getting really 
serious pozniak said 
freight stations in gdansk joined the strike friday at the 
nations busiest port in szczecin 12 ships awaited unloading 
pozniak said freight headed to those ports from southern poland 
czechoslovakia and hungary was blocked 
two dozen rail junctions in northwestern poland were idled and 
the army was moving perishable and essential goods 
officials said thousands of the 400000 railroad workers 
nationwide were on strike but could give no specific number it 
takes only a few people to block traffic pozniak said 
walesa canceled a trip to scandinavia and presided over a 
meeting of solidaritys national commission on the dispute 
i hope that reason will win he said in an afternoon radio 
interview the strikers should be given a way of out it with 
honor because they are right 
he also said the route of strikes leads nowhere even though 
i am unhappy and almost the entire society is unhappy 
the railway workers are demanding that their basic monthly 
salary be raised to 8 above the average monthly salary of 79 
the government says granting the pay increases would unleash a 
torrent of demands from other sectors of society and ruin its 
economic reform program begun jan 1 
mazowiecki a top adviser to the solidarity union before taking 
charge of the east blocs first noncommunist government said the 
strikes show societys fatigue and impatience 
they also are evidence a lack of understanding of the essence 
of our economic changes he said 
in addition to strictly controlling wages the government has 
raised prices to market levels and ended government subsidies to 
industry as a result poles real incomes have been reduced by an 
estimated 40 percent 
there have been signs of slackening public support for the 
economic reforms but a poll by the prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza 
newspaper friday showed overwhelming opposition to the rail strike 
the survey found 619 percent opposed it 166 percent supported 
it and 215 percent had no opinion no details on the poll methods 
were given

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will travel 
to canada tuesday for talks with prime minister brian mulroney 
giving both men a brief respite from domestic troubles stirred up 
in restive provinces 
gorbachevs 36hour visit also will allow him to recover from 
jet lag before heading to washington for his summit with president 
bush 
officials here bristle at suggestions the short stopover is just 
an afterthought to the ussoviet summit but they acknowledge it 
is unlikely gorbachev would have come to ottawa at this time 
otherwise 
that is particularly so because mulroney was just in moscow in 
november the first official visit by a canadian prime minister 
since pierre trudeau went in 1971 mulroney and gorbachev discussed 
a wide range of issues and signed 14 agreements on issues ranging 
from the environment to arctic cooperation 
were pleased with the visit and dont like to think of it as 
a mere rest stop en route to washington said a canadian official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity we realize it is a difficult 
time for him especially with the trouble in the baltic countries 
emerging nationalism in the soviet union is one of the biggest 
headaches facing gorbachev who has been locked in a war of nerves 
with lithuania latvia and estonia over their moves toward 
independence 
in canada the desire of frenchspeaking quebec for recognition 
as a distinct society has led to the biggest political crisis 
of mulroneys career the subject of quebec independence once again 
is the topic of the day 
quebec did not sign canadas 1982 constitution a proposed 
amendment containing five major points sought by the quebecois was 
agreed to and signed by mulroney and all 10 provincial premiers in 
1987 but governments changed in three provinces and the new 
premiers balked creating the present crisis 
because they covered most of the bilateral issues in november 
mulroney and gorbachev are expected to focus on more global matters 
the canadians pride themselves on being the only country that 
participates in nato summits g7 economic summits commonwealth 
summits and francophone summits giving them a special role in 
eastwest matters 
gorbachev is concerned about german reunification the question 
of nato membership for the new germany certainly will be a point of 
sovietcanadian divergence the official said adding that the 
emergence of a new stronger germany raises concerns everywhere 
both sides are also concerned about the new architecture of 
europe he said everybody would like to see a stronger eastern 
europe economically and culturally 
ottawa wants to learn gorbachevs vision of a new soviet union 
and a new europe 
our view is that mr gorbachev is the best man to have around 
at this time the official said 
canada is most eager to talk about the conference on security 
and cooperation in europe the mechanism created by the 35nation 
conference at helsinki finland in 1975 the canadians believe the 
csce is the best framework for soviet participation in the new 
europe 
we want to reaffirm in soviet eyes that we are north american 
but still an important part of the european process the official 
said stressing that canada is not a superpower and doesnt 
threaten anybody 
in moscow on friday gorbachev said the soviet union would 
review its policies on european arms control and security 
negotiations including csce if a reunited germany joined nato 
gorbachev arrives in ottawa at midday tuesday and goes for a 
private lunch with mulroney at his official residence later in the 
afternoon he plans to meet governor general ray hnatyshn 
on wednesday there is a wreathlaying ceremony at the national 
war memorial followed by another meeting with mulroney a late 
afternoon luncheon at the national gallery of art will precede 
gorbachevs departure for washington

into the mississippi river officials said 
its diesel fuel im told its not as heavy as the motor oil 
you put in your car its somewhere between that and gasoline 
said senior chief petty officer joe gibson of the us coast guard 
the spill occurred at 825 pm thursday at algiers point in new 
orleans when the 800foot stonewall jackson ran into empty barges 
the coast guard said the ship and the barges belong to waterman 
industries 
the accident ripped three holes in the freighter rupturing 
several tanks of no 6 fuel oil and allowing 50000 to 60000 
gallons of the 300000 gallons aboard the ship to spill 
workers on friday were transferring the ships remaining fuel to 
other tanks and shifting cargo and ballast to keep the damage above 
the water line gibson said 
the collision was under investigation gibson said 
the leading edge of the slick was at port sulfur 58 miles 
downriver from new orleans by noon friday gibson said 
its possible it could reach the gulf gibson said of the 
slick as fast as the river is moving it could get down there 
it depends on a lot of conditions and how much it pools up along 
the banks of the river 
a number of communities including new orleans draw their 
drinking water from the mississippi river but the accident 
happened below the new orleans intakes and only threatened one 
intake for the town of pointe a la hache gibson said 
rubark co of new orleans was contracted by waterman to clean up 
the spill and the company planned to put booms at the pointe a la 
hache water intake to prevent contamination the coast guard said 
rubark also planned to place booms at two other places in the 
river gibson said 
our pollution response team is studying aerial video tapes of 
the spill to determine how to clean it up theyll look to see 
where the concentration is the heaviest and clean it up there 
first gibson said

here are some comments concerning fridays 
hearing involving the explosion aboard the uss iowa 
in its report to congress the general accounting office said 
the tests conducted from january to may 1990 at the sandia national 
laboratory could not corroborate the navys technical finding 
that an improvised chemical device initiated the explosion 
furthermore sandia has identified a potential hazard the 
impact sensitivity of the gunpowder in combination with an overram 
at higher than normal speeds which could have caused the explosion 
sandia believes further testing on this is needed to confirm its 
finding 
 
defense secretary dick cheney on the navy investigators they 
did the best job they could now theres new evidence new 
information that warrants reopening the investigation but i 
think at this point id want to keep my powder dry so to speak 
until we have a better sense of exactly what this new information 
may contribute 
 
the navy issued a statement saying it will continue to test 
additional theories dealing with the possible causes of the 
explosion any further discussion on aspects of the additional 
testing would be premature at this present time 
 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
at the outset of this hearing i stated that i anticipated 
that the testimony we would receive this morning would expose 
significant shortcomings in the navys investigation and would cast 
grave doubt on the conclusions the navy drew as a result of their 
investigation i believe that the testimony we have heard has done 
that and more moreover this mornings testimony has identified a 
very plausible if not probable explanation for the explosion 
 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on senate armed 
services committee its far too early to jump to any 
conclusion 
 
kendall truitt navy friend of clayton hartwig i think we 
should all be thankful that nobody else had to die before they 
started looking at this i knew from the beginning my friend didnt 
do it 
 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina who attended the hearing my 
brother was only a victim i hope after today this will get rid 
of any doubt in anyones mind 
 
retired capt fred moosally the uss iowas skipper at the time 
of the explosion from his frontrow seat at fridays hearing

a powerful rabbi who two months ago helped 
bring down the government of prime minister yitzhak shamir is now 
accusing shamir of frequently eating nonkosher food 
rabbi ovadia yosef made similar accusations thursday night about 
former defense minister ariel sharon saying the two politicians 
routinely ate foods considered impure such as pork and shellfish 
the accusations came at a politically sensitive time shamir is 
having trouble persuading ultraorthodox religious parties to join 
a coalition cabinet to be led by his rightwing likud bloc 
the allegations about shamir and sharon both leading members of 
the rightwing likud bloc were secretly recorded as the rabbi 
addressed activists of his ultraorthodox shas party 
portions of the tape were broadcast on both israel radio and 
armed forces radio israel radio said it obtained the tape from an 
unidentified person who made the recording without the rabbis 
knowledge 
shamir refused to respond to questions about the matter during 
an interview with israel radio to be broadcast saturday 
sharon aides could not be reached for comment 
yosef said of shamir he eats only impure fish thats what he 
likes about sharon he said he doesnt eat shellfish but he 
really loves pork 
yossef azran head of the shas faction in parliament told army 
radio that the remarks on the politicians dining habits were taken 
out of context 
the rabbis speech was about the special budget allocations made 
to religious institutions shas rabbis and activists have 
threatened to split from the party because they felt their 
institutions werent getting their fair share of the funds 
in march shamirs coalition government with the leftleaning 
labor party lost a crucial vote of confidence in parliament after 
yosef ordered his six shas lawmakers to abstain in the vote

vandals have desecrated about 70 
graves in three cities nearly half of them belonging to jews 
officials said friday they also struck the presumed graves of 
executed dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife 
the ceausescus were secretly buried on opposite sides of a path 
in a public cemetery under different names shortly after the 
december revolution that ended nearly half a century of communism 
they were executed dec 25 
ceausescus presumed grave was topped by a common oak cross with 
the inscription col popa dan 19201989 
elena ceausescus assumed grave which last week looked as 
freshly dug as her husbands had an identical wooden cross 
carrying the name of col enescu vasile 19211989 
the authorities fearing the couples graves could be desecrated 
by revengeful romanians never disclosed the actual burial site 
but after a highranking official last saturday confirmed rumors 
the ceausescus were buried at the ghencea civilian cemetery in 
bucharest the crosses vanished 
the chief administrator of the cemetery virginia cismarescu 
said at least 30 graves were desecrated in the past two days 
it is a disaster i do not know who can actually be 
against crosses she said 
i think it is the police who want to take away the myth of 
ceausescu and leave the grave unmarked said a grave digger who 
refused to be identified 
the staterun news agency rompres quoting the jewish community 
office reported that within the past two weeks 28 jewish graves 
were vandalized in the jewish cemetery in the transylvanian town of 
tirgu mures eight more were desecrated in the eastern city of 
galati at eternity cemetery 
the incidents may have been inspired by the desecration of a 
jewish cemetery in carpentras france two weeks ago said bernard 
zauber president of the jewish community in tirgu mures 
this was done on purpose because people who survived the 
horrors of auschwitz were buried there zauber told the 
associated press 
the jewish community numbers only 300 people aged 63 or older 
in tirgu mures 
of the 28 graves vandalized there five were destroyed zauber 
said 
the desecrations outraged the dwindling jewish community of 
romania where latent antisemitism continues there are some 
20000 jews left in romania and many have applied to emigrate to 
israel

the soviet union said friday that a massive 
housing shortage back home has forced it to suspend indefinitely 
the withdrawal of nearly onetenth of its troops from east germany 
in december 1988 soviet president mikhail s gorbachev promised 
the unilateral withdrawal of onetenth of the red army soldiers in 
east germany officials in bonn say it was to include about 36000 
troops 
west german authorities say the soviets have pulled out about 
12000 military personnel soviet officials say the number is 
higher 
the suspension comes as moscow apparently is balking at signing 
an overall troop reduction agreement for central europe 
in recent days the soviets have been hesitating about signing a 
treaty that would reduce soviet forces and us forces to 195000 
for each side in central europe that area includes east germany 
soviet diplomats at a news conference in east berlin on friday 
insisted that housing rather than politics was behind the 
suspension 
mikhail logvinov a counselor with the soviet embasssy said 
the housing shortage is a problem that will take years to solve 
western experts have said that some of the troops being pulled 
out of eastern europe have been kept in tents back home while they 
wait for permanent homes 
the army barracks are still filled with refugees from the 
earthquake area of armenia and azerbaijan where there has been 
unrest logvinov said 
the army has been put into action building apartments for 
these people he said now sufficient numbers of apartments 
must be built for the officers junior officers and their families 
returning from abroad 
he estimated that number at 100000 the soviet union also has 
agreed to pull tens of thousands of troops from hungary and 
czechoslovakia 
the superpowers are involved in negotiations on reducing their 
nuclear and conventional forces in europe and hope to reach some 
agreements during the summit between president bush and mikhail s 
gorbachev that begins may 31 
gorbachev said in moscow on friday that the soviet union would 
review its policies on european arms control and security 
negotiations if a united germany joined nato 
the soviet union wants germany to belong to nato and the warsaw 
pact the bush administration favors nato membership only 
gorbachev justified the policy review by saying nato would take 
similar action if the soviet union insisted on warsaw pact 
membership for a united germany

a top aide to prime minster yitzhak shamir said 
friday that plo leader yasser arafats speech to the un security 
council was full of lies and distortions 
in his speech arafat accused israel of waging a war of 
extermination against palestinians and urged the united nations 
to set up an international force to protect palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories 
here again arafat has used the united nations as a platform 
for a vicious attack on israel making accusations that are full of 
lies and distortion shamir aide avi pazner told the associated 
press 
he said arafat raised proposals which he knows have no chance 
whatsoever to be accepted by israel 
danny naveh a top aide to foreign minister moshe arens charged 
that arafat was personally responsible for the murder of many 
innocent victims and that the plo is still engaged in 
terrorism 
israel refuses contact with the plo arguing that it is a terror 
organization the jewish state also has rejected arafats december 
1988 declaration in which he renounced terrorism 
earlier friday shamir said he opposed any un observer force 
in israelicontrolled territory 
in arab east jerusalem arafats speech was broadcast over 
loudspeakers set up in a tent at the red cross where dozens of 
palestinian activists have been on a hunger strike since sunday to 
press for a un observer force 
when the speech ended applause erupted among the scores of 
listeners who jumped up from mattresses in the tent and began 
chanting long live abu ammar abu ammar is arafats nom de 
guerre 
faisal husseini the most prominent plo supporter in the 
occupied lands and a potential peace negotiator with israel said 
arafat was not only fighting for the liberation of his own 
people but for peace in the whole area 
husseini also said the demands by arafat especially the call 
for an observer force originated among activists in the occupied 
lands who daily confront israeli troops 
representatives of the four main plo factions including those 
usually critical of arafat were also in the tent 
we are united against our common enemy and we are united 
behind the demands of arafat said riyad malki a west bank 
university lecturer whose views have been identified with those of 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine the pflp is a 
radical marxist faction backed by syria 
israeli media played down the arafat speech 
the first item on israel radios hourly newscast after the 
speech was the drowning death of a 4yearold girl in its report 
on the speech the radio carried a brief summary but not arafats 
voice israel telvision continued with its scheduled program a 
usmade adventure film 
the plo demand for un observers gained momentum after an 
outbreak of violence in the occupied lands to protest the slaying 
of seven palestinian laborers by an israeli gunman on sunday 
israeli officials say the gunman was deranged 
at least 15 arabs were killed most by gunfire from israeli 
troops and more than 800 hurt in subsequent clashes 
since the start of the palestinian uprising more than 29 months 
ago 710 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
civilians and 43 israelis have been slain by palestinians at least 
216 other palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most as 
suspected collaborators with israel 
an israeli army spokesman said four palestinian laborers armed 
with knives stabbed a jewish settler in the chest friday while 
working in his orchard in the occupied west bank the victim was in 
fair condition 
the army spokesman said the motive for the stabbing apparently 
was palestinian nationalism 
the attack came as the army continued to enforce widespread 
curfews in the occupied territories confining more than a million 
palestinians to their homes to prevent further violence 
during this weeks upsurge in violence the army placed most of 
the occupied lands under curfew journalists were only allowed to 
enter with a military escort and could not roam freely

a judge on friday convicted 
winnie mandelas former chief bodyguard of murdering a black 
teenager after beating him at mrs mandelas home while she was 
present 
jerry richardson 41 was found guilty of murdering 14yearold 
black activist james stompie seipei moeketsi on jan 1 1989 
he was also convicted of assaulting and kidnapping the teenager 
and three black men who testified that mrs mandela had beaten all 
of them with a whip and her fists on dec 29 1988 and then 
allowed her bodyguards to continue the assaults mrs mandela is 
the wife of black leader nelson mandela 
richardson was also convicted of attempted murder in a case 
unrelated to stompies death supreme court justice brian odonovan 
delayed sentencing richardson until he receives a psychiatric 
report on aug 6 
odonovan commenting on the evidence said whips with traces of 
human blood were found in the house and blood matching one of the 
surviving victims was found on walls and curtains of a room in mrs 
mandelas soweto township home 
stompies decomposed body with three stab wounds in the neck 
was found in a soweto field on jan 6 1989 it was not identified 
until after community leaders got the surviving victims out of the 
house and the case became public 
odonovan ruled that most of the assaults occurred on dec 29 
1989 he added i find that mrs mandela was present on the 29th 
for at least part of the time he said nothing else of her 
involvement 
mrs mandela has made no public statement on the case since last 
year when she denied committing any crime or being home when any 
assaults took place 
the court also heard evidence that nelson mandela had sent his 
attorney to mrs mandelas home to try to get the three men 
released but had failed 
mandela was freed feb 11 after serving 27 years of a life term 
for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the white minority 
government he is now deputy president of the african national 
congress the leading group fighting south africas apartheid 
system of racial separation 
last year leading black antiapartheid activists accused mrs 
mandela of complicity in the abductions and assaults and they 
urged soweto to shun her a few months later however she 
reappeared on stage at antigovernment rallies and has accompanied 
her husband in public since his release 
mandela accused the government wednesday of deliberately 
defaming his wife by not charging her in a case that centers on 
her however mandela said he was not saying the government should 
prosecute her 
eight former associates of mrs mandela including her driver 
and other bodyguards are scheduled to face trial beginning next 
week on charges of abduction and assault with intent to do serious 
bodily harm in connection with the same case 
if no extenuating circumstances are found for richardsons 
actions the death penalty is mandatory however president fw de 
klerk suspended all death sentences in february as part of his 
program to encourage negotiations between the government and black 
groups he is trying to bring blacks into the nations political 
system 
though denying involvement mrs mandela has said the abductions 
were justified claiming stompie was staying at a churchrun house 
where a methodist priest was engaging in homosexual activity 
however odonovan said there was no evidence of homosexuality 
at the churchrun house he said richardson had given no 
explanation for the assaults on stompie 
the witnesses testified mrs mandela had accused the teenager 
of having been a police spy when he led an organization of youth 
activists in the orange free state

president mikhail s gorbachev on friday branded 
the leaders of secessionist lithuania adventurists and repeated 
his demand that they back down from their march 11 declaration of 
independence 
we have great reserves of will power but we are looking for 
ways to end the impasse gorbachev said at a news conference 
after meeting with visiting french president francois mitterrand 
as a result of an economic embargo by the kremlin lithuanian 
factories have been forced to close throwing an estimated 19000 
people out of work lithuanian officials said hot water supplies 
throughout the baltic republic were shut off friday because 
regional distribution stations had run out of oil 
gorbachev repeated an appeal for the lithuanians to follow a new 
soviet law that requires a referendum for any of the 15 republics 
to secede lithuanian leaders say the law does not apply to them 
as it was passed after they declared the republic independent 
lets return to march 10 and start the constitutional 
process gorbachev said at the news conference broadcast live on 
soviet television 
halfjoking the soviet leader said the lithuanians had decided 
not to make a gift to president gorbachev on the eve of his visit 
to the united states gorbachev meets with president bush next 
week in washington 
gorbachev defended the use of army troops to occupy communist 
party buildings in lithuania in march he also defended the 
economic sanctions he has brought against the republic which 
include shutting off oil and natural gas shipments 
what happened in lithuania was that a group of adventurists is 
speculating on such issues as independence he said 
i can say that in a similar situation the american president 
would put the situation under control in 24 hours he added 
gorbachev also has decreed that the other two baltic states 
latvia and estonia violated soviet law by making gradual moves 
toward independence without moscows approval but gorbachev has 
imposed economic sanctions only against lithuania 
he told lithuanian legislators on thursday that if the republic 
agreed to suspend its declaration of independence and follow 
moscows procedures for secession lithuania could gain 
independence in as little as two years said one of the 
legislators vaidotas antanaitis 
meanwhile in the latvian capital of riga legislative leaders 
rejected gorbachevs recent order voiding their declaration of 
independence a spokesman said 
the presidium or executive council of latvias supreme council 
sent a telegram to gorbachev saying he exceeded his authority may 
14 when he issued a decree that latvias declaration was illegal 
said legislative spokesman ivars embrekts 
the constitution of the ussr does not give the president 
of the ussr the right to repeal laws or decisions which have 
been taken by the supreme council of the republic of latvia the 
telegram said the decree does not have the force of law in the 
republic 
the three baltic republics forcibly annexed in 1940 are taking 
varied approaches toward secession while lithuania has proclaimed 
immediate independence estonia and latvia are following a more 
cautious path by declaring a transition period 
in the estonian capital of tallinn centrist and radical 
deputies clashed friday over what role the new estonian congress 
elected by ethnic estonians should have in relation to the 
republics traditional supreme soviet 
the chairman of the new congress tunne kelam opened its 
session with a complaint that it was being ignored by the 
republics supreme soviet legislature and given only an observers 
role during the transition to independence the estonian news 
agency eta reported 
the congress with 499 representatives has no formal political 
power but considers itself the highest representative of ethnic 
estonians living in the republic and abroad 
we are not being allowed into the family room where everyone 
else is kelam was quoted as saying we are not an illegitimate 
son we have the right to join our halfsister 
prime minister edgar savisaar responded that giving the congress 
the right to legislative power alongside the elected supreme soviet 
would result in a dual power structure 
this can only work against us savisaar said 
he also said estonia should learn from lithuanias experience 
the events in lithuania have sobered us up to the fact that 
the west is not about to help us to any great degree the 
estonian leader told the congress 
despite a recent tour of western capitals by lithuanian prime 
minister kazimiera prunskiene lithuania has not been granted 
diplomatic recognition by the united states or european powers

a group of art supporters urged congress on 
friday to reauthorize the embattled national endowment for the arts 
without any provisions restricting federal support for works some 
may consider obscene 
the panel representing major organizations supporting the arts 
issued a statement that also recommended no change in the method of 
distributing money to state arts councils for use in subsidizing 
artists 
the panel was gathered by a key congressional supporter of the 
nea rep pat williams dmont in an effort to head off 
increasing criticism of the endowment in light of controversial 
grants for art many considered to be offensive 
the arts groups said the nea would not support obscene art but 
at the same time it said the nea should consider only artistic 
merit and that obscenity was a matter to be left to the courts 
the endowment can and should only determine artistic 
excellence in our system of government only the courts can and 
should determine constitutional issues of obscenity the art 
leaders said in their statement obscenity is without artistic 
merit is unprotected by the first amendment of the constitution 
and we do not support it 
williams chairman of a house subcommittee considering 
legislation to continue the endowment said he would support the 
proposals in hearings early next month 
williams invited the arts leaders to come up with suggestions 
and the group met privately for four days 
williams told the group he believed it would be difficult to win 
congressional approval of a reauthorization that had no limits on 
the neas ability to fund obscene works 
the bush administration has backed legislation to renew the nea 
in its present form for five years an alternative proposal offered 
by reps thomas coleman rmo and steve gunderson rwis would 
distribute a majority of federal arts money directly to state arts 
agencies 
the groups statement called for other changes in the nea that 
include creating a new program of arts education and accessibility 
to be paid for with a new appropriation of up to 40 million and 
require policy meetings of the neas council on the arts be open to 
the public 
joining in the statement were 16 arts groups including the 
american council for the arts the national assembly of state arts 
agencies and four independent citizens and artists 
recent debate over the nea was triggered by several 
controversial artistic exhibits including photographs by the late 
robert mapplethorpe of homosexual acts and nude children the nea 
had given 30000 to a philadelphia museum to show mapplethorpes 
work 
since then an exhibit of his work by the corcoran gallery of 
art in washington was canceled and a cincinnati museum and its 
director were indicted on obscenity charges for displaying 
mapplethorpes pictures 
a group of 61 house members wrote bush urging him to support 
restrictions against federal funding of obscene indecent or 
sacrilegious works

franz schoenhuber the exnazi waffen 
ss soldier whose ultrarightist republicans became the shooting star 
of west german politics quit as party leader friday complaining 
extremists had taken over 
mainstream politicians in bonn said his decision marks the 
nearcertain demise of one of europes most controversial political 
parties which went from a mushrooming political force to a fringe 
group in disarray 
otto lambsdorff head of chancellor helmut kohls junior 
coalition partners the free democrats said friday the remains 
of this party will soon scatter themselves into the wind 
the republicans main office in munich said schoenhubers former 
deputy johanna grund 56 would replace him until a new 
chairperson is elected 
schoenhuber 66 said small clique of extremist 
functionaries existed at top party levels and he was quitting 
because he felt unable to oppose them 
his resignation further splintered a party already reeling from 
ideological bickering and from major election setbacks that 
reversed the partys meteroic rise 
schoenhuber led the republicans to headspinning fame last year 
championing xenophobic and rightwing platforms to appeal to west 
germans tired of competing with foreigners for scarce jobs and 
housing 
beginning with west berlin in january 1989 the republicans 
scored large gains in state and local elections and also won 72 
percent in last junes elections for the european parliament 
landing schoenhuber a seat there 
but the wind went out of schoenhubers sails after the east 
german revolution last fall and the sudden realization that german 
reunification was no longer just a dream 
with every mainstream party embracing unification the 
republicans lost much of their nationalist appeal 
the party says its membership climbed from 18000 to 26000 the 
past year 
whatever their actual membership its clear their voter support 
has taken a beating 
in recent state elections the republicans mustered less than 2 
percent of the vote they slipped badly in national polls far 
below the 5 percent needed to gain seats in the federal parliament 
in scheduled dec 2 elections 
schoenhuber told reporters in munich he would try to create a 
new leadership to challenge his successor but republican officials 
said efforts were already under way among the leadership to oust 
schoenhuber from the party 
in recent days schoenhuber repeatedly cautioned that the party 
was heading too far right and was becoming an extremist rightwing 
group his charges drew fire from other party leaders 
schoenhuber said friday he could not take further responsibility 
for the party following clashes between police and party members 
during recent rallies for oct 14 bavarian state parliamentary 
elections he said he himself was withdrawing as a candidate for 
parliament in those elections 
one republican candidate franz glasauer was recently fined 
5000 marks 2975 for telling a rally a work camp should be 
created for riffraff and scum he was charged under a law 
banning incitement of the public 
farright political parties in west germany have a history of 
fizzling out unable to sustain strong membership in a nation where 
the nazi past makes the electorate especially sensitive

a man who lost his college scholarship and his job 
when he was convicted of assaulting a police officer during an 
antiwar demonstration has cleared his name with a 20yearold 
photograph 
the photo taken by a newspaper photographer but not published 
until this week shows malcolm emory with an armload of books at 
about the time police said that he had thrown a rock he had said 
he had just left the library 
emory now 39 maintained he was wrongly convicted of the 
assault which allegedly occurred during a protest at northeastern 
university in 1970 he never served time for the offense but the 
conviction cost him his college scholarship his job doing research 
for the navy and a promising future as a physicist 
but this year using a newspaper photograph taken at the 
protest emory got his conviction set aside and won a new trial on 
wednesday the suffolk county district attorneys office said it 
would drop the case rather than retry it and on thursday 
northeastern university awarded emory who has spent most of the 
last 20 years as a welder a full scholarship to complete the 
physics studies he began there in 1969 
its a great relief im very happy to have this solved 
emory said 
a police officer vincent logan maintained that emory threw a 
rock at police during the antiwar protest of jan 29 1970 emory 
said was attacked by the officer after he left the library and 
decided to take a look at the protest 
emory was arrested on a charge of assault and battery on a 
police officer he was convicted on the testimony of logan he was 
given a sixmonth suspended sentence and put on probation for three 
years 
he also lost his college scholarship and his navy security 
clearance he had been working his way through college as a 
government researcher 
for the first few years i was very angry about what had 
happened emory said i really expected some sort of apology 
from logan but after four or five years and nothing was 
forthcoming i realized i had to get on with my life 
so after his probation ended emory became a welder and worked 
in machine shops and shipyards 
while at the library five years ago emory found in the boston 
globe a frontpage photograph that showed him surrounded by police 
in the midst of the 1970 demonstration his books could not be seen 
in the photograph but he hoped there might be others that would 
support his claim 
he found that the globe will release photographs only only if 
there is a subpoena 
it was a legal catch22 said his lawyer john legasey 
you can only get a subpoena if there is a motion for a new trial 
you can only move for a new trial if you have new evidence and we 
only had new evidence if there was another photo we needed a 
subpoena to find out 
last year the globe relented and emory found one picture of 
him holding his books as he was being dragged away by police 
superior court judge sandra hamlin ruled this year that the 
photograph provided sufficient grounds for a new trial 
logan the arresting officer continues to dispute emorys 
story saying he was careful to keep his eye on the person who 
threw the rock which injured another officer standing near him 
all i saw was blood splatter and i keep my eye on the guy who 
throws the rock he said 
he said the photograph of emory holding books was taken after 
his arrest but he doesnt know where the books came from 
although he can never regain the life he lost emory says he 
hopes to finally finish his physics degree he enrolled at 
northeastern again last fall and now with his full scholarship he 
hopes to complete his bachelors degree next year 
if this hadnt happened i would have continued on in the same 
direction i would have been a physicist emory said 
when i when to the library that night i expected to come 
back he added id never been involved in students protests i 
wasnt politically active i just wanted to study and come back 
but i came back completely different

west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher and secretary of state james baker said friday they had 
signs soviet leaders were willing to make progress in talks to cut 
conventional forces in europe 
genscher said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told 
him earlier this week the soviets are keen on concluding these 
negotiations soon 
baker called the meeting between genscher and shevardnadze 
significant 
now time will tell said baker who met last week with 
shevardnadze and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
however gorbachev warned friday that the soviet union would 
review its policies on european arms control and security 
negotiations if a reunited germany joined nato 
gorbachevs remarks contained the kremlins most dire warning 
about what steps it would take if a reunited germany joins the 
western military alliance 
baker who made his comments before gorbachev spoke in moscow 
said he didnt want to predict that us and soviet negotiators 
would make progress toward an arms cut as early as next week when 
gorbachev meets with president bush in washington 
we have not seen a lot of progress over the course of the past 
few weeks as you know and we took note of that fact when i was in 
moscow last week baker said we need to see some concrete 
action but im hopeful that we will begin to see that 
baker and genscher said their discussions coming barely eight 
days after the foreign minister was last in washington with 
chancellor helmut kohl for talks with bush also included plans for 
german unification and a summit conference of nato leaders 
we find ourselves in practically total agreement on all of 
these issues baker said its a rather amazing of degree of 
convergence of views and represents the fact that we have spent 
quite a bit of time in very close consultation and cooperation in 
this period of rapid change in europe

russian lawmakers cast ballots friday night in a 
vote to determine whether populist boris n yeltsin would become 
president of the soviet unions largest republic 
yeltsin a onetime gorbachev ally ousted two years ago as moscow 
communist party chief after calling for faster reform gained a 
double boost friday russian deputies and soviet media praised a 
key campaign speech he made and the candidate backed by president 
mikhail s gorbachev withdrew 
but yeltsin 59 needs backing from 531 of the 1059 members of 
the russian congress more than he himself has estimated he could 
count on official results from voting late friday are expected by 
saturday morning 
the candidate backed by gorbachev russian premier alexander 
vlasov withdrew from the race after it became clear he lacked 
yeltsins popularity 
vlasovs departure left ivan polozkov a communist party chief 
from the southern russia city of krasnodar as yeltsins main 
rival the third remaining candidate aviation instructor vladimir 
morokin did not appear to have any chance of winning 
russia by far the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
comprises more than twothirds of the countrys territory it is 
home to half the soviet populace 
a yeltsin victory would mean an important setback for gorbachev 
who has clashed repeatedly with his former protege gorbachev spoke 
out wednesday against yeltsins plan for increased russian 
autonomy claiming it would mean the breakup of the soviet 
union 
yeltsin however pledged friday that if elected he would 
defend the republic from moscow interference while not letting 
personal conflicts interfere with his kremlin dealings 
i am for businesslike relations dialogue and negotiations 
with the president and the government but on the principle that 
russias sovereignty is not damaged yeltsin told the russian 
congress the russians use the term sovereignty to mean 
increased autonomy not secession 
with his bass voice booming through the hall of the great 
kremlin palace yeltsin pressed a pointbypoint program on 
promoting for russian sovereignty unleashing market forces 
increasing housing and flooding stores with consumer goods 
vremya the nightly news program on staterun soviet 
television gave yeltsin high marks for his platform having 
heard all the contenders i can say his program for the rebirth of 
russia came off the bestargued and thoughtthrough the vremya 
report said 
the people believe in boris nikolayevich yeltsin deputy 
nina sivova told the congress his great force of will is needed 
today 
in an early indication of yeltsins plans if he wins his speech 
blasted the government program announced thursday for a transition 
to a free market economy he said it had already created panic in 
the stores today 
instead he backed an alternative program involving sale of 
government property full independence for enterprises more 
liberal laws on ownership and foreign loans 
yeltsin is already a member of the national congress of peoples 
deputies and a member of the communist party central committee 
he has made a remarkable political comeback from disgrace two 
years ago when he was ousted from his post as moscow party chief 
and ostracized by the kremlin elite including gorbachev yeltsin 
has continued to level public blasts of criticism at gorbachev for 
his halfway reforms 
if no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first 
round the election goes into a runoff between the top two 
votegetters

the death of a doonesbury character 
who suffered from aids didnt prompt any angry phone calls the 
strips syndicator said friday 
universal press syndicate has received complaints about 
doonesbury in the past and once did not distribute strips that 
dealt with abortion the strip was created by garry trudeau 
it wasnt a big shock at all said lee salem editorial 
director for universal press i think garry is always known for 
dealing with major issues of social concern and i think the way 
our society copes with aids is certainly within that 
the character andy lippincott who has appeared in the strip 
since 1976 died in the panels that appeared in thursdays 
newspapers the character who was gay began as a law school 
student and evolved into an attorney and a political aide to 
another character 
its not the first time in doonesbury that a character died 
salem said dick davenport another character died a few years 
ago of a heart attack 
but andys death was apparently the first time aids killed a 
comic strip figure andy was diagnosed with aids in the strip in 
early 1989

palestinian leader yasser arafat urged the un 
security council on friday to send an emergency force to protect 
arabs in the israelioccupied territories from a war of 
extermination 
opening an emergency council session arafat called for an end 
to israels 23yearold occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
a ban on jewish settlements in the territories and international 
sanctions against israel 
the violence has reached an extremely dangerous and explosive 
point the palestine liberation organization chief said 
the situation now requires urgent action in order to enforce 
reverence for international legitimacy he said over 30 
months the israeli occupation forces have been waging a war of 
extermination on all fronts 
arafat said the palestinian uprising which began in december 
1987 would continue until israel is ousted from the occupied areas 
home to 17 million palestinians 
he urged appointment of a permanent un envoy to monitor the 
situation a security council investigation into all crimes 
allegedly committed by israel against palestinians and immediate 
preparations for an international middle east peace conference 
initial responses from other delegates were largely 
noncommittal france and the soviet union said the council should 
consider a un observer force 
in israel a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
arafats speech was full of lies and distortions 
secretary of state james a baker iii reiterated in washington 
the united states opposition tostationing a un observer force in 
the territories but said the idea of the secretarygeneral 
sending one of his top aides to take a look at the situation and 
return is something quite different 
baker also said he believed some people misinterpreted a 
statement he made wednesday when he said the bush administration 
was willing to discuss sending observers into the west bank and 
gaza strip the comment had touched off speculation the united 
states would support permanent observers 
asked to appraise arafats speech baker said he had not read it 
arab delegations called the emergency meeting of the 15nation 
security council to consider ways to quell a surge of arabisraeli 
clashes in the territories and israel 
the violence followed the killing of seven unarmed arab workers 
by an israeli on sunday 
arafat challenged israels claim that sundays killings were the 
act of an isolated madman saying the primary responsibility 
falls on the insanity and derangement of the whole system 
israeli deputy foreign minister benyamin netanyahu rejected 
sending observers which he called a bid to end israels role as 
the responsible governing power in the territories 
what we are now facing is a further attempt to delegitimize 
israel and jewish immigration to it he told the council 
the councils session was shifted from new york to geneva to 
allow arafat to speak arab delegations wanted to avoid a showdown 
with the united states which has barred the plo chief from entry 
in the past 
it was the second time in 18 months a un session was moved to 
geneva from the world bodys new york headquarters so arafat could 
address it 
in december 1988 arafat addressed the un general assembly to 
renounce terrorism and acknowledge israels right to exist 
meeting two us demands that led to the opening of a dialogue 
between the plo and the united states 
after a sixhour debate the council session was adjourned until 
saturday with no decisions made 
the session is likely to resume tuesday in new york un 
spokesman francois giuliani said 
for his first speech to the security council arafat wore his 
traditional kaffiyeh arab headdress and military uniform 
french ambassador pierrelouis blanc said the council should 
consider sending a un factfinding mission to the occupied 
territories 
he urged israel to accept such a mission which could come up 
with concrete proposals on the establishment of un observers 
in the area 
soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov also backed sending 
international observers who would later become a permanent body in 
the occupied territories 
britain said it was ready to look at proposals for further 
un involvement to ease the tense situation and appealed for 
restraint by both israel and palestinians 
clovis maksoud the arab league ambassador told a news 
conference he supports international monitoring broadly along the 
lines put forward by arafat 
in his fivepoint proposal arafat urged the security council to 
adopt a resolution to provide international protection to the 
palestinian people to safeguard their lives properties and holy 
places in the occupied territories under the flag of the united 
nations and by means of international emergency forces 
arafat did not elaborate on what kind of forces he meant 
he also urged the deployment of a un observer force with the 
purpose of ending completely the israeli occupation 
the permanent members of the security council which have veto 
power are the united states soviet union britain franc and 
china current temporary members are canada colombia ivory coast 
yemen cuba ethiopia finland malaysia romania and zaire

imelda marcos was almost certainly the owner of 
four manhattan commercial buildings a real estate developer 
testified friday 
victor politis recalling a meeting where mrs marcos was 
briefed on the status of the buildings said he would have to 
consider myself a fool not to believe she was the owner 
defense attorneys expressed private dismay conceding the 
testimony may have been a sharp setback to mrs marcos claim that 
she was never involved in the dealings 
under an increasingly hostile crossexamination by her attorney 
gerry spence the prosecution witness said mrs marcos never spoke 
to him but that her closest friend had confided that she was the 
principal or owner of the buildings 
you dont have the slightest idea whether what mrs gliceria 
tantoco told you was true or not do you spence demanded in the 
hushed courtroom 
if i had not met mrs marcos and she had not acted like the 
owner you would be right politis replied but i would have to 
consider myself a fool not to put two and two together 
mrs marcos is charged with fraud and embezzlement she is 
alleged to have helped her late husband former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos steal more than 220 million from their 
countrys treasury 
the money was allegedly used to support a luxury lifestyle and 
investments including the four secretly purchased new york 
properties 
earlier a geneva attorney testified that mrs marcos reportedly 
met as recently as two weeks ago with a swiss lawyer hired to fight 
the philippine governments effort to seize billions of dollars 
allegedly stashed in swiss banks by her and her late husband 
sergio salvioni a swiss lawyer representing the manila 
government said he was told of the new york meeting by bruno 
depreux who he said had identified himself as representing the 
former philippine first lady 
under questioning by assistant us attorney charles labella 
salvioni quoted depreux as saying he originally was hired to 
represent both mrs marcos and her husband following marcos 
ouster in early 1986 marcos died last year in hawaiian exile 
and now he represents mrs marcos and her heirs salvioni

a federal judge friday refused to dismiss 
criminal charges or suppress videotapes in the drug case against 
mayor marion barry 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson rejected 
defense arguments that the government engaged in prosecutorial 
vindictiveness in bringing two indictments against the washington 
dc mayor since february 
barry is scheduled to go to trial june 4 on cocaine possession 
conspiracy and perjury charges 
there was no evidence of actual vindictiveness by the 
government the judge said in ruling on a series of pretrial 
motions 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy alleged the government 
jeopardized barrys life by with the fbi sting operation jan 18 at 
the vista hotel designed to coerce him into smoking crack cocaine 
but no violence occurred and no coercion was employed in 
the vista incident the judge said in refusing to throw out the 
charges 
the judge said the fbi videotapes from the vista were taken with 
the permission of the rooms occupant exmodel rasheeda moore who 
cooperated with the government to persuade barry to come there 
jackson refused to bar the government from using the videotapes at 
the trial 
jacksons decisions came at the end of a day of courtroom 
arguments on aspects of the 14count indictment 
i feel very good about today barry said afterwards were 
ready to go to trial 
a feb 15 indictment accused barry of cocaine possession in the 
sting operation and with four other misdemeanor counts of 
possessing cocaine and three felony counts of lying to a federal 
grand jury a superseding indictment adding five new possession 
charges and a conspiracy charge was returned may 10 
the government on friday provided barry with a list of the 
alleged coconspirators and agreed to provide the times and places 
of the alleged cocaine possessions 
mundy will decide by tuesday whether he wants to ask for the six 
new charges to be separated from the earlier counts which would 
mean having a second trial at a later date 
on the political front barry campaign officials said they 
intend to pick up petitions for the upcoming mayoral race such a 
move would be the first formal step barry can take to enter the 
sept 11 democratic primary 
the washington post said friday a poll showed barry has suffered 
no significant erosion in his political base since his arrest he 
and councilman john ray were tied with 23 percent each of the 760 
democrats polled by the newspaper about their preference for the 
democratic mayoral nomination the rest were split among four other 
challengers 
barry has not publicly disclosed his political plans but has 
made a series of campaignstyle appearances across the district of 
columbia in recent weeks 
top barry political aides speaking on condition of anonymity 
say the mayor intends to seek a fourth fouryear term 
mundy said a cardiologist had concluded there was a high 
risk to the life of mr barry when the government offered him 
89 percent pure crack cocaine 
mundy said three very heavy drinks of cognac were poured 
just before the crack cocaine was smoked during barrys 
videotaped hotel room visit 
fbi agents who burst into the room to arrest the mayor told 
barry to stay calm that a doctor was present and that we are 
aware of your prior cardiac problems said mundy 
barry has no history of heart trouble according to medical 
records the mayor released last year 
mundy wanted the cardiologist to testify but the judge said his 
testimony would be legally irrelevant and denied the request

a freight train derailment and explosion 
that forced the evacuation of 750 people could have posed a greater 
danger if it had occurred just two miles farther down the line 
authorities said friday 
fifteen cars of a 90car illinois central train derailed in a 
rural area on the southern edge of this western tennessee city of 
6100 at 1030 pm thursday authorities said 
one tanker filled with ethyl alcohol exploded and three other 
cars caught fire but no one was hurt 
we were lucky it occurred there and not two miles away in 
downtown covington said cecil whaley operation officer for the 
tennessee emergency management agency in nashville 
whaley said the biggest concentration of people that had to be 
evacuated was 193 from a nursing home on us highway 51 which 
runs parallel to the train tracks 
we were very fortunate there were no injuries he said 
the cars that piled up were almost on top of each other 
there was tremendous damage to the train bed itself 
the cause of the accident was under investigation friday by a 
field representative from the chicago office of the national 
transportation safety board and officers from the tennessee public 
service commission 
the ntsb in washington said it was unlikely the cause would be 
determined quickly 
we cant say a lot until we develop information at the 
scene said dave watson of the ntsbs railroad division 
people within a threemile radius of the accident site were 
evacuated but were returning to their homes friday 
the exploded tanker and the two other cars that caught fire were 
left to burn themselves out overnight one was still burning friday 
afternoon 
of the derailed cars eight contained denatured alcohol and the 
rest contained rock soybeans and corn said covington police chief 
jerry craig 
routine tests on the trains crew for drug or alcohol use would 
be sent to a laboratory chosen by the federal railway 
administration said tom utroska transportation superintendent at 
illinois centrals chicago office 
there were no reports from the scene that the crew was impaired 
he said 
roy davis assistant superintendent of transportation for 
illinois central said the train originated in champaign ill it 
was headed to memphis 40 miles southwest of covington 
lt mike craig of the covington fire department said railroad 
traffic would have to be rerouted 
theres no way they can get through here he said it just 
completely mangled the rails theyre backed up from here to i 
dont know where 
nellie wilson business manager of the covington manor nursing 
home said local people helped evacuate the residents by school 
buses and ambulances 
local authorities and the community came together and were 
just wonderful she said 
denise edmundson a floral designer said she returned to her 
floral shop thursday night to check on damage from the explosion

an abortion rights group friday endorsed 
democrat don avenson for governor saying prochoice forces should 
unite behind a single candidate in the democratic primary even 
though two of three candidates support abortion rights 
the stakes are too high for prochoice leaders to remain on 
the sidelines said shelley bain head of the iowa affiliate of 
the national abortion rights action league 
the group picked avenson over former banker john chrystal 
another pro choice democrat avenson speaker of the iowa house 
chrystal and attorney general tom miller an opponent of abortion 
are all running in the june 5 democratic primary 
after the avenson endorsement an angry chrystal called naral 
tinhorn wouldbe kingmakers from washington 
iowa democrats wont let these wouldbe kingmakers tell them 
how to vote chrystal said in a statement he said naral does 
not in any sense represent the views of iowa voters concerned about 
freedom of choice 
miller echoed that sentiment labeling the group an outside 
narrow negative singleinterest group with their own agenda 
avenson called the reaction of the other democrats sour 
grapes and said every one of them would love to have it but 
once we got it theres something wrong with it 
the primary is the first major election in iowa since the us 
supreme court last summer handed states new freedom to restrict 
abortions the exchange illustrates why many prochoice activists 
worry that avenson and chrystal will split the prochoice vote and 
give miller the nomination 
ms bain said that political analysis brought the naral

the final appeal by four of nicolae ceausescus top henchmen 
against life sentences for backing the communist dictators order 
to shoot in the december revolution the state news agency rompres

a womans decision to donate seven 
frozen embryos she won in a custody fight rather than use them to 
become pregnant does not end the battle her exhusband said 
friday 
i am totally against it junior lewis davis who produced 
the sperm for the embryos said of his exwifes decision to donate 
them to another childless couple 
there is just no way i am going to donate them davis said 
i feel thats my right if there was a child from them then i 
would be a parent to it and i dont want a child out there to be 
mine if i cant be a parent to it 
davis 31 and his exwife mary sue davis stowe 29 have been 
locked in a legal battle over the fourtoeightcell embryos 
conceived through in vitro fertilization in 1988 while they were 
still married 
in the only contested issue in their divorce blount county 
circuit judge w dale young ruled in september that temporary 
custody of the embryos should go to mrs stowe who at the time 
said she wanted to try to bring a child to term 
the judge taking the unprecedented step of ruling that life 
begins at conception accorded the embryos the same rights as 
children he said it would be in the embryos best interests to be 
with mrs stowe 
davis has appealed the decision which touched off a nationwide 
debate on its impact on reproductive rights the tennessee court of 
appeals scheduled oral arguments for june 6 
mrs stowe who agreed she would not try to become pregnant with 
the embryos until the case is settled filed a response thursday to 
davis appeal 
in it her attorney kurt erlenbach wrote that if the court 
rules in her favor her intention is not to implant the 
embryos she wants authority to donate the embryos so another 
childless couple may use them 
erlenbachs wife and law partner susan erlenbach said that 
mrs stowe did not wish to disclose her reasons for deciding not to 
have the frozen embryos implanted 
all i can say is its been a long and painful process in 
making the decision mrs erlenbach said friday from her office 
in titusville fla where mrs stowe now lives 
if faced with the options of implantation or destruction 
through nonuse mrs stowe would strongly argue for the right to 
implant the embryos erlenbachs brief said 
the former mrs davis seeks in this case only to preserve what 
she has created while mr davis seeks to destroy the potential for 
life he very willingly and intentionally created 
but davis said that was very willingly and intentionally only 
on the grounds of marriage in trying to produce a child 
they need to be disposed of in my view they are not life i 
realize they are the potential for life no matter how small the 
percentage of successful pregnancy is but they are not life 
davis said his position has nothing to do with concern over any 
potential legal obligations to children born from the embryos 
its really that it is my right to decide if i want to become a 
parent he said 
davis appeal and a friendofthecourt brief by the american 
civil liberties union argues that young overstepped the bounds of 
tennessee law and the us constitution in his ruling 
because judge youngs decision is inconsistent with the 
existing laws if not reversed it will give rise to future 
anomalous and absurd legal quagmires davis appeal said 
fortyeighthourold fertilized embryos kept frozen will 
enjoy enhanced protection while first trimester fetuses will 
continue to be aborted the appeal said 
mrs stowes response contends that the case has nothing to do 
with abortion rights or parental privacy rights and has no impact 
beyond the fight between herself and her exhusband

west of here within 90 minutes of the shooting thursday afternoon 
but didnt find the suspects 
we were about 30 minutes behind them though sedgwick 
county sheriff mike hill said friday morning we now believe they 
probably are no longer in that area

thursday on interstate 135 about eight miles north of downtown 
wichita without knowing its occupants were suspected of having 
robbed a savings and loan in omaha that morning 
as he approached the car to write a ticket one of two men 
inside opened fire with a 9mm pistol 
hersh returned fire apparently wounding one suspect 
authorities said 
the trooper was able to talk to officers who came to his aid 
he was conscious he was able to give us good information 
said patrol sgt george westphal 
the suspects drove off and headed south for about a mile then 
left the highway and pulled into the driveway of a house near the 
suburb of valley center at about 4 pm 
one man went into the house and confronted a baby sitter and 
three children 
a few minutes later the childrens mother kathy george 35

fields and hedgerows with two airplanes helicopters dogs and 
horses 
we really feel like weve done the best we can at this point 
both on the ground and in the air so were going to call it off

in a child abuse case that has sparked an 
outcry from advocates for battered women a woman and her former 
husband have been indicted in the beating death of the womans 
2yearold son 
a travis county grand jury on thursday returned indictments 
against robbi zuliani and gerald christopher zuliani both 23 
zuliani is accused of beating christopher wohlers ms zulianis 
son from a previous marriage and slamming him into a bathroom wall 
on jan 2 the toddler died the next day 
the boy had been hospitalized dec 22 after apparently being 
abused but was returned to the zulianis according to a department 
of human services investigation and a probe by the texas attorney 
generals office 
ms zuliani is accused of murder for failing to protect the 
child or remove him she and her exhusband both face up to 99 
years in prison if convicted 
it wasnt the first time criminal charges had been brought in 
connection with abuse of the the boy last summer ms zulianis 
thenboyfriend wayne michael hoffman pleaded guilty to charges 
that he forced the boy to sit in scalding water he was sentenced 
to 10 years in prison 
ms zuliani married gerald zuliani in december and divorced him 
last month 
she has said she was the victim of repeated abuse from zuliani 
and did not intervene for her child because she was afraid for 
herself and her 4yearold daughter a psychologist has testified 
that ms zuliani has a dependent personality disorder and suffers 
from posttraumatic stress syndrome 
the charges against her triggered a courthouse protest by people 
carrying signs that said stop blaming the victim and arrest 
criminals not battered women 
the fact that the child was abused by a previous mate does not 
make ms zuliani any more to blame said kimberly bryant vice 
chairman of a group called the formerly battered womens task force 
that just indicates how serious of a cycle of victimization 
that any battered woman can be in she said 
but district attorney ronnie earle said the law provides for 
the same kind of punishment whether the crime is done by act or by 
omission 
he added however that it doesnt mean we will seek the same 
punishment for the two defendants she could be placed on 
probation he said 
zuliani remains in the travis county jail in lieu of 50000 
bond ms zuliani is free on bond

chancellor helmut kohl urged moscow on 
friday to stop fighting nato membership for a united germany 
saying history shows european stability is best assured when 
germany is firmly anchored to an alliance 
there must be no second versailles said kohl referring to 
the 1919 treaty that resulted in german isolation and paved the way 
for the rise of nazism 
speaking at the end of a 113nation disarmament conference in 
bonn kohl also said he favors reducing nuclear weapons in europe 
to a minimum but not their complete removal 
he was addressing the international parliamentary union which 
is made up of federal lawmakers from around the world who meet 
periodically to discuss disarmament and other matters 
the organization has no actual powers 
the soviet union rejects natos demand that a united germany 
belong to the western alliance 
but kohl said such membership was actually in the best interests 
of the soviet union and all europe 
the first and most important lesson which history has taught 
us is that peace stability and security were guaranteed in europe 
whenever germany maintained firm bonds with its neighbors 
in a relationship marked by mutually beneficial exchanges said 
kohl 
alluding to two world wars waged by the germans kohl added 
whenever germany chose out of overbearing blindness or criminal 
hubris to pursue a separate path or when former enemies forced it 
into isolation following its defeat the immediate consequence for 
europe was conflict instability and uncertainty 
for this reason there can be no thought of united germany 
being neutral demilitarized or nonaligned 
we germans therefore want to exercise our sovereign right we 
want to belong to an alliance namely to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
kohl said only nato can create true equilibrium in europe 
in east berlin east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
said he would like to see a new collective european security 
system with a united germany as member 
it was not clear if de maiziere was saying he opposed at least 
temporary nato membership for a united germany until such a 
security system is created de maiziere has been vague on the issue 
kohl sought to soothe soviet worries about a shift in the 
european balance of power after unification saying nato does not 
wish to gain any unilateral advantage 
but he also indirectly criticized the soviets for slower 
progress at conventional forces negotiations in vienna 
i appeal to all participants do not squander the historic 
opportunity to make headway now in europe toward a more secure and 
stable balance of conventional forces at lower levels kohl said 
he said germans will continue to renounce the possession 
manufacture and control of nuclear biological and chemical 
weapons 
the chancellor said he favors not only keeping us troops in 
europe but keeping nuclear weapons on the continent he said 
natos nuclear capability has guaranteed the longest period of 
peace in modern history in europe 
kohl proposed a summit every two years of leaders of the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe and 
creation of paneuropean institutions such as a conflict 
prevention center and one for the verification of arms control 
agreements 
earlier friday kohls government renewed its warning that 
delays in the planned july 2 economic merger with east germany 
could trigger discontent among the east german populace

the shooting death of a disillusioned 
devotee played a key role in the indictment of a hare krishna swami 
and two followers on murder and racketeering charges a federal 
prosecutor said friday 
the indictment thursday by a special federal grand jury in 
elkins charged that kirtanananda swami bhaktipada 54 previously 
known as keith ham was part of a conspiracy to kill stephen bryant 
of suburban detroit 
bhaktipada was named in five racketeering counts including 
conspiracy to commit murderforhire and six counts of mail fraud 
bryant whod launched a oneman campaign against bhaktipadas 
new vrindaban community about 80 miles southwest of pittsburgh was 
gunned down on a los angeles street in may 1986 he had accused 
bhaktipada and others at the commune of drug trafficking 
prostitution and child abuse the indictment said 
there was never one particular break in the case us 
attorney william kolibash said friday the fbi has been involved 
in this investigation back about five or six years ago based upon 
some of bryants allegations 
but what really got us all involved in the case was the bryant 
murder kolibash said thats when it appeared there was some 
federal jurisdiction 
the 46page document alleged that bhaktipada authorized bryants 
killing and the 1983 murder of charles st denis a fringe member 
of new vrindaban 
thomas a drescher who once lived at new vrindaban was 
convicted of st denis murder he also has been charged with 
bryants slaying and is awaiting trial on a murder charge in los 
angeles 
in addition to the alleged murder conspiracies and racketeering 
operations the indictment said bhaktipada was involved in a 
childs abduction in 1979 and used the mails in a fraudulent 
charity scam and to defraud an insurance company 
also named in the indictment were terry sheldon 31 also known 
as mr scam and tapahpunja steven fitzpatrick 36 also known as 
sundarakara new vrindaban community inc govardhan inc and the 
cathedral of healing inc 
kolibash said bhaktipadas representatives have assured the 
government that the swami would appear for his arraignment which 
is to be held within the next two weeks 
bhaktipada was expected to return to new vrindaban late friday 
night or early saturday said gadadhar das a spokesman for the 
community 
sheldon and fitzpatrick are not in custody and remain fugitives 
according to bob reutter head agent in the fbis pittsburgh office 
leaders of the community on friday called the charges spurious 
and entirely without merit 
millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on the investigation 
yielding those trumpedup charges against swami bhaktipada the 
community said in a statement but we welcome the opportunity 
because it will establish our innocence 
the three racketeering counts against bhaktipada each carry a 
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of 250000 
kolibash said 
interstate travel to commit murder for hire carries a maximum 
penalty of life in prison and a 250000 fine conspiracy to travel 
in interstate commerce to commit murder for hire conspiracy to 
commit mail fraud and mail fraud each carry a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison and a fine of 250000 
the corporations named in the indictment face only fines and no 
corporate officers were charged kolibash said 
federal prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of any holdings 
that bhaktipada sheldon or the corporations have in new vrindaban 
that were gained as a result of the alleged racketeering 
the government also is seeking a temporary restraining order to 
prevent the destruction or alteration of buildings on the 
compounds 4000 acres

india will continue under tighter control because of irregularities 
discovered in an audit 
the food supply may be reduced temporarily until catholic 
relief services improves the management of the program said john 
metelsky a spokesman for the us agency for international 
development crs has already reduced the number of feeding 
centers in india 
catholic relief services had been receiving 25 million a year

food is reaching the poor and that is the point of the 
program he added 
the audit by the us accounting firm of price waterhouse was 
ordered by aid officials and concluded last december 
it said officials of indias roman catholic church drew up bogus 
lists of food recipients and used donations to run businesses 
clergy also purposely exaggerated the amount of aid they 
distributed and filed false reports to hide the abuses the audit 
said 
the audit estimated that records for food distribution and 
actual food distribution differed by about 4 million

argentina will be allowed to draw 240 million 
of a 17 billion international monetary fund loan from which 
payments were suspended last february a source said friday 
the disbursements were suspended after imf said president carlos 
menems government had failed to meet conditions 
the source speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
argentina could use part of the 240 million to buy back some of 
its 60 billion debt at a discount it owes about 40 billion to 
banks most of them in the united states last week that part of 
the debt could be bought on the new york market for 14 cents on the 
dollar 
a portion of the new disbursement also could be used to reduce 
the south american nations 4 billion annual loan payments the 
source said one official said the amount available for that 
purpose would be more than 25 percent of the 240 million 
argentina is 6 billion behind on payments 
the spokesman said future drawings also could be used for 
reduction of argentine debt and payments but whether they would be 
permitted depends on whether the fund decides that menems 
government is meeting new requirements 
menems government has been following the kind of austerity 
program the fund usually requires as a condition for aid budget 
cuts have been made price controls have been lifted and plans have 
been announced for privatization of governmentowned companies 
the funds decision was made behind closed doors by the 22 
members of the imfs board of executive directors who represent 
the 152 countries that own the fund it rarely gives details of its 
decisions saying its up to the borrowers to disclose them

pope john paul ii on friday said the 
roman catholic church must be allowed to play its historic leading 
role on malta despite recent churchstate tensions on this 
mediterranean island nation 
john paul flew in from rome for a threeday visit the first by 
a pope to malta the vatican says malta south of italy is 99 
percent catholic 
during his visit the pontiff stressed the unique and lasting 
contribution that the christian faith has made to malta he also 
made thinly veiled references to the problems the church has faced 
the maltese say their christian tradition dates to the year 60 
when saint paul was shipwrecked on the island however a visit by 
the pope was considered unthinkable under the previous socialist 
government 
ruling from 1971 until an electoral defeat in 1987 the labor 
party carried out a campaign the church said was aimed at 
undermining its dominant role in maltese life 
the government barred private schools including catholic ones 
from charging tuition it also ordered the church to hand over 
property it could not prove the it owned 
some of the bitterness stemmed from the 1960s when the church 
was at odds with socialist officials and supporters 
john paul praised the new climate is this country of 350000 
residents under the nationalist administration of eddie fenech 
adami a regular churchgoer 
in remarks to prime minister adami and president vincent tabone 
the pope sketched his vision of the role of the church in malta 
it is important that the church should enjoy freedom in the 
institutional and administrative spheres and that she should be 
free from all undue pressures obstacles and manipulation john 
paul said 
in a word it is essential that the church should be enabled 
to act effectively in fulfilling her mission to all people 
scores of maltese in a holiday mood lined the popes motorcade 
route as he drove in from the airport friday and passed the 
fortresses built by the knights of malta mobilized in the 16th 
century to defend christian europe against the ottoman turks 
on saturday john paul will cross in a catamaran to gozo the 
second largest island in the archipelago and address workers in a 
labor party stronghold 
the maltese pilgrimage is john pauls 48th foreign tour as pope 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev met at 
malta for a summit in december

the president of the world bank will not hold 
back 450 million worth of proposed loans for china despite 
pressure from congress and uncertainty by the bush administration 
a spokesman said friday 
he has no intention of withdrawing them said peter 
riddleberger a spokesman for president barber conable 
of the total 400 million would be lent at less than 1 percent 
annual interest 
opponents say the loans should not be granted because of chinas 
suppression of human rights the bush administration has said that 
loans should be only granted for basic human needs 
conable has said the bank lends only on economic considerations 
and the delay of 780 million worth of loans after the brutal 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations last june was to gain 
time to look into the economic effects of the action 
pastor sison a bank asia specialist said a projected 300 
million for planting trees in 15 chinese provinces would be the 
biggest loan ever granted for forestry 
that loan and another for 150 million to improve roads and 
waterways in the nanjing area are due to be considered behind 
closed doors on tuesday 
the decision will be made by a 22member board of executive 
directors who represent the 152 countries that own the bank the 
united states holds about 20 percent of the voting power on the 
board 
one official who spoke on condition he not be named said the 
bush administration was opposing the transport loan and was still 
considering its stand on the forestry loan friday 
robert levine a spokesman for the treasury said he would have 
nothing to disclose on the us position until after the vote 
on thursday the office of rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
chairman of the house banking committee distributed copies of a 
letter he sent to treasury secretary nicholas brady arguing 
against the loans gonzalez said approval would make it hard to get 
approval of more money for the world bank and would raise 
opposition to the new bank for european reconstruction and 
development being established to help the new democracies of 
eastern europe 
last year the bank lent 135 billion to china but in 11 months 
of the current fiscal year loans to china have totaled on 140 
million

the navy should pay millions in damages after a congressional 
report rejected the services finding that a sailors sabatoge 
caused last years fatal uss iowa explosion an attorney for the 
sailors family said friday 
i am more convinced than ever that we have a legitimate claim 
for intentional and negligent infliction of emotion distress 
against the navy kreig brusnahan said from his cleveland office 
brusnahan represents the family of gunners mate clayton 
hartwig one of 47 sailors killed when an explosion and fireball 
ripped through the battleships no 2 turret april 19 1989 
a fourmonth 4 million investigation by the navy concluded 
hartwig most likely caused the explosion by inserting a detonating 
device between bags of powder in the 16inch guns 
but thursday the navy announced it was reopening its 
investigation and was suspending the use of the 16inch guns after 
an explosion at a test site 
and on friday a general accounting office report to the senate 
armed services committee said it could not support the navys 
original findings the gao report suggested that gunpowder bags may 
have been unintentionally rammed too hard and too far into the 
barrel 
it is my belief that the navy spent in excess of 4 million to 
frame clayton hartwig brusnahan said they ought to give the 
family at least that much to compensate for the hell they have put 
them through 
the navys original report triggered protests from some of the 
families of the 47 sailors other families said they were satisfied 
with the report 
the protests prompted the senate and house armed services 
committees to hold hearings on the navys investigation earlier 
this year the house committee issued a report highly critical of 
the navys probe 
with the investigation reopened many of the families are hoping 
the questions they had about the explosion will be answered 
the gao report said the navys battleships were troubled by lack 
of qualified sailors in the turrets 
thats what my husband always complained about said sharon 
ziegler her husband reginald was the senior enlisted man in the 
turret 
he had to spend a lot of extra overtime in training the kids 
they pushed a lot of people into the turret but most of them 
didnt know what to do she said from her home in rushville ny 
kathy kubicina hartwigs sister raised questions about the 
powder used in the 16inch guns the gao report pointed to the 
arrangement of gunpowder pellets in the bags as a possible cause of 
excess friction that may have caused detonation 
what were driving for is for them to get rid of all that 
powder nancy lewis said the northville mich woman was in 
washington with ms kubicina for the senate hearing mrs lewis 
son richard died in the explosion 
brusnahan expects to submit a claim to the navy within 90 days 
the navy will have six months to respond if the claim is rejected 
brusnahan said he will file with the federal courts 
several of the families said the best result of the reopening of 
the investigation was the clearing of hartwigs name 
im glad that that family has finally gotten some relief out 
of this mrs ziegler said 
not only have they lost their son they have had to suffer 
with the accusation that their son killed 46 other people i cant 
conceive the pain and heartache they must feel said darleen 
schelin of el toro calif mrs schelins son geoffrey was among 
the 47 killed 
at a minimum the navy should be ashamed of itself for 
allowing the other families to believe that clayton hartwig killed 
their sons brusnahan said 
the navy issued a statement saying it will continue to test 
additional theories dealing with the possible causes of the 
explosion

two of three women who tried to kill and 
dismember a man with an ax in an attempt to resurrect jack the 
ripper were sentenced friday to five years each in prison 
catherine lipsham 23 and ramona barry 27 pleaded guilty last 
month to attempted firstdegree intentional homicide in the may 
1989 attack on jeffery meka 27 who suffered a severe gash above 
the eye 
deborah kazuck 27 who a jury ruled wielded the ax was found 
insane by a judge in the second phase of her trial and sent to a 
mental hospital 
attorneys for ms lipsham and ms barry asked the court for 
leniency friday saying the women suffered from mental illness and 
past abuses and had not actually committed the assault 
but milwaukee county circuit judge william d gardner called 
them members of an immoral cult of three and sentenced them to 
prison 
although the two women cooperated with prosecutors during ms 
kazucks trial the victim could have been killed if he was less 
strong or if the blow had been more appropriately placed the 
judge noted 
meka testified he was lured to an apartment and attacked by the 
three women who sprang from behind a shower curtain chanting 
redrum murder backwards and struck him with the ax 
ms lipsham and ms barry could each have received a maximum 
prison term of 20 years assistant district attorney mark williams 
citing their cooperation asked that they be sentenced to six to 
eight years 
at her trial ms kazuck testified she struck meka with an ax 
because he tried to sexually assault her ms lipsham and ms barry 
said that was untrue 
all three women told police they had participated in satanism 
ms barry admitted luring meka to an apartment she shared with 
ms lipsham so they could kill and dismember him and drain his 
blood in a ceremony they called kacking 
prosecutors said ms kazuck believed she was jack the rippers 
mother and that the trio hoped to resurrect the 19th century 
british serial killer 
at least five prostitutes fell prey to the rippers knife in 
londons seamy east end in 1888 most were mutilated the crimes 
were never solved 
ms barry and ms lipsham originally pleaded innocent by reason 
of insanity psychiatrists found both competent to stand trial

mcdonalds corp on friday declared that 
it has not and will not buy or serve irradiated food products to 
applause from a food purity group and an order of roman catholic 
nuns 
mcdonalds announced its ban on radiationexposed foods at its 
annual shareholders meeting in this chicago suburb 
the fastfood giant also reaffirmed its policy of using only 
locally produced and processed beef 
we do not have not and will not purchase beef from rain 
forest or recently deforested rain forest land mcdonalds said 
in a statement this policy is strictly enforced and closely 
monitored 
the statement on irradiated foods came in reponse to a 
resolution filed last fall by a coalition of the companys 
shareholders requesting a clarification of corporate policy on the 
issue said christina roessler of food amp water inc a new 
yorkbased food purity group 
the resolution was written by the dominican sisters of adrian 
mich and the dominican sisters of the sick poor in ossining ny 
both orders have holdings in mcdonalds 
this move reflects an important commitment to food safety and 
to our consumers mcdonalds is the first restaurant to establish 
this farsighted policy sister pat day of the dominican sisters 
said at the meeting 
a number of food companies including hj heinz quaker oats 
ralston purina and borden foods announced this year they would not 
use irradiation in making their products or buy irradiated foods or 
ingredients roessler said 
irradiation exposing foodstuffs especially meats to 
radioisotopes such as cobalt 60 and cesium 137 has been proposed 
as a food preservation method since at least the early 1960s 
proponents say the technique reduces the need for potentially 
dangerous chemical preservatives lowers refrigeration costs and 
leaves no harmful radiation in the food 
opponents say it can leave trace radioactivity or harmful 
residues in food 
the food and drug administration approved irradiation may 1 for 
the treatment of commercially sold poultry 
last july new york state passed legislation banning irradiated 
foods there for two years new jersey passed similar legislation in 
december and maine has enacted an indefinite ban on such products

a white parolee with a history of racial 
hatred was charged thursday with murder and attempted murder in a 
shooting that left a young black man dead and his companion 
paralyzed authorities said 
daniel amos pilot 21 of theodore was arrested wednesday while 
driving to a construction job said mobile county sheriff tom 
purvis 
district judge mike mcmaken ordered pilot held without bond on 
murder and attempted murder charges in the killing of darren 
jessie 21 and the wounding of joseph ocain 17 
mcmaken said pilot was in violation of his parole and that a 
hearing on revoking his parole would be held later 
the heavily tatooed suspect his hands cuffed and his head 
lowered walked by reporters without making any comment 
jessie was shot to death march 31 while sitting in a car outside 
a grocery in theodore a predominantly white suburb of mobile 
ocain was shot in the back as he fled the car 
jessies mother catherine mccants had concluded the shooting 
was racially motivated because her son was dating a white clerk at 
the store 
im glad they got him she said thursday i feel more 
comfortable now that they got somebody but im still worried and 
upset 
purvis told a news conference that the investigation of the 
shooting determined pilot didnt know jessie or his girlfriend and 
that the interracial romance was not the motive the sheriff said 
pilots hatred for blacks appeared to be the motive but 
declined to elaborate 
pilot was paroled from a state prison march 12 after serving 
four years of a 12year sentence for receiving stolen property 
said state prisons spokeswoman debbie herbert 
the sheriff would not say what words were spoken between the 
gunman and the two victims but said jessie and ocain were 
innocent of any provocation or wrongdoing

black 19yearold michael donald was picked at random from a city 
street and beaten to death his body was hanged from a tree

a greyhound bus driven by a replacement 
driver crashed thursday injuring eight passengers authorities 
said 
the driver told investigators a tractortrailer forced him off 
the road but at least three witnesses indicated he may have fallen 
asleep at the wheel said patrolman steve kelso of the highway 
patrol 
investigators from the national transportation and safety board 
went to the scene 
greyhound has reported at least 30 incidents of violence against 
the company including shootings of buses since its drivers began 
a nationwide strike march 2 
kelso said the greyhound bus carrying 46 passengers went off 
interstate 80 just east of wamsutter early thursday when it failed 
to make a curve the bus crossed the median and went into a 
drainage ditch 
all 46 passengers were taken to carbon county memorial hospital 
in rawlins and eight were being held for overnight observation and 
treatment hospital administrator dick mills said all eight were 
in stable condition said mills who did not know the extent of 
their injuries 
the driver 50yearold bobby williamson of chicago was not 
hurt 
kelso said williamson told him a large truck had played 
highway tag repeatedly passing the bus then slowing to make 
the bus pass until the bus was finally forced off the road 
however the patrolman said there were reports from at least 
three witnesses who were awake either during or immediately before 
the accident that williamson had been drowsy and was crossing lanes 
greyhound spokesman bill kula said the driver had fulfilled the 
rest quota prescribed by the department of transportation before 
getting behind the wheel in cheyenne 
the driver had had a 13hour rest and break period which more 
than met dot requirements kula said he had all the rest he 
needed it would not have impaired his driving ability in the 
least 
george gravely another greyhound spokesman said the company 
was investigating whether the bus was forced off the road 
i dont want this to sound like weve lost confidence in the 
driver or support everything he said but typically we will review 
everything he says 
williamson is a replacement driver who began driving for 
greyhound when members of the amalgamated transit union went on 
strike gravely said

neonazi magazines from west germany calling the publications 
racist and antisemitic 
the order follows the desecration of a jewish cemetery two weeks 
ago in southern france that prompted further desecrations protests 
from jews and others and nationwide soulsearching about 
antisemitism 
in thursdays order interior secretary pierre joxe banned 
distribution and sales of the three magazines which are translated 
into french for distribution to extremeright groups none of the 
magazines have large circulations 
however joxe said the works threaten the public order because 
of their apologies for nazism racism and antisemitism 
his authority to ban them comes under a 1939 law controlling 
foreign publications 
france has been ungoing a wave of protests and recriminations 
since a jewish cemetery in carpentras was desecrated two weeks ago 
a corpse was mutilated and 34 tombs desecrated and the case 
remains unsolved 
since then similar incidents have been carried out in france

the remark in 1987 
judge lefoyer de costil said freedom of expression has a 
limit he also ordered le pen to pay 720 to each of the groups 
to cover legal fees 
this decision only takes into account the interpretations of 
my political enemies and not at all the explanations i provided 
le pen said this irreversible judgment is proof of political 
persecution against me 
the 61yearold politician has been increasingly ostracized 
since the desecration of the cemetery at carpentras

congressional findings cast grave doubt on 
the navys official conclusion that a troubled sailor probably 
caused the blast that killed 47 servicemen aboard the battleship 
uss iowa lawmakers said friday 
the new investigation by the general accounting office 
suggests the explosion may well have been an accident 
congress report came one day after the navy reopened its own 
investigation citing unexplained ignition of gunpowder in a test 
the navy in a report last september concluded that gunners 
mate clayton hartwig probably set off the april 19 1989 explosion 
by inserting a chemical detonator between bags of powder in one of 
the warships 16inch guns 
the service resumed testing after congress sought advice from 
scientists at the sandia national laboratories in albuquerque 
nm who then conducted an independent analysis of the navys 
initial findings 
sandia analysts said at a senate hearing friday they believed a 
possible cause of the iowa explosion was the unintentional 
highspeed overramming of gunpowder bags in the barrel the gao 
said forms of some of the chemical constituents of what the navy 
had theorized was an ignitor were either commonly used in the 
turrets or are part of the maritime environment

a magnificent chronicle of josef stalin the 
great and evil soviet leader who built the 20th centurys most 
powerful communist state on the bodies of 20 million people opens 
tonight on pbs 
his life and the totalitarian nation he devised from a backward 
19th century peasant kingdom are chillingly evoked in stalin a 
threepart series coproduced by bostons wgbhtv and britains 
thames television 
its executive producer is phillip whitehead who won an emmy in 
1974 for the world at war the bbcs landmark world war ii 
chronicle he brings the same thoughtful research and production 
values to stalins life 
rare archival footage some released by the soviets for the 
first time is combined with interviews of gulag survivors 
bodyguards and living relatives of stalin including his rarely 
interviewed daughter svetlana alliluyeva and his rivals lenin 
trotsky bukharin and kirov 
even the series graphics are powerful and effective from the 
compelling main title sequence to maps and mug shot layouts 
that trace the rise of stalin and the fall of his politburo rivals 
the first episode revolutionary chronicles the obscure 
origins of iosif vissarionovich dzhugashvili a poor boy from the 
provinces who fled the seminary to become a revolutionary and took 
the name stalin or steel 
young stalin impressed vladimir lenin with his revolutionary 
zeal and is inducted into the central committee of lenins 
bolshevik party there he eliminated his rivals until he becomes 
the sole soviet ruler in 1929 
the second episode despot relates how stalin used state 
terror to force central control of industry and collectivization of 
agriculture inducing a famine that killed 7 million people in 1932 
and 1933 
no footage of that famine survives only still photos of 
emaciated children and corpses and newsreel film of the increased 
grain exports stalin ordered to obtain industrial machinery while 
his own people starved 
despot for the first time implicates stalin and his secret 
police in the assassination of popular leningrad party leader 
sergei kirov a rival whose death triggered the socalled great 
purge of 193438 in which 20 million people were killed and 8 
million imprisoned in labor camps 
the episode also shows how stalin used the propaganda machinery 
to create his own cult of personality which enshrined him as a 
beloved uncle and teacher at the same time he was ordering mass 
arrests and executions 
the final episode generalissmo covers stalins career as a 
military leader who took the baltic states in the illfamed 1939 
nonaggression pact with nazi germany and was utterly surprised 
when germany invaded in 1941 
by the wars end he had imposed communist regimes throughout 
eastern europe and relations with the west were rapidly 
deteriorating in 1953 he had just begun another purge when he was 
stricken by a fatal cerebral hemorrhage 
when he took russia on it only had wooden plows says one 
soviet and when he left it it was equipped with nuclear 
weapons at his death stalin left russia one of the two most 
powerful states of the modern world 
they say even in the gulag he was mourned 
stalin is the second excellent pbs documentary to emerge 
from glasnost soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of openness 
in soviet society 
the first was former new york times correspondent hedrick 
smiths superb look at contemporary soviet society inside 
gorbachevs ussr 
both documentaries complement each other and both in their way 
are tributes to the indomitable character of the soviet people who 
survived a monster like stalin and are beginning to dismantle the 
nightmare he created

it is one of the sadder ironies of latin america that blades a 
panamanian argentine actress norma aleandro and brazilian director 
sergio toledo each have felt the brunt of dictatorships in their 
own homelands 
aleandro best known for her role in the official story 
about an adoptive mothers discovery of abuses by argentinas 
military dictatorship had to flee that country with her family 
after receiving death threats 
blades has close friends who were in danger from dictator manuel

repression i would never consciously align myself with what i 
consider wrong aleandro said 
i am not interested in working as an actor in propaganda 
films that i wont do said blades 
toledo said that viewers of the hbo movie will be able to 
identify with the tragedy of the filartiga family whether they have 
lived under a repressive regime or not 
every time you go deep into the heart of the characters i 
think you can achieve a kind of universalization what i hope is 
that we can create an empathy between audience and characters

well is there or is there not a credit crunch 
the federal reserve which should know says more than half the 
banks it surveyed recently said they have tightened lending 
standards for small and mediumsize businesses 
but the national federation of independent business which 
insists it should know becs members more than 
500000 independent businesses finds no evidence of credit 
tightening nationally 
in contrast sindlinger amp co which claims to have firsthand 
information on the ause it claims abasis of about 1000 telephone interviews 
each 
week throughout the year says a credit crunch recession is 
under way 
gail fosler chief economist of the conference board which 
keeps tabs on business and economic matters disagrees there is 
no evidence of a credit crisis managed or otherwise brewing in 
the financial system she says 
in that case what should you make of an informal survey of 60 
business people at a meeting of sbane the small business 
association of new england asked if a crunch existed eight 
replied no four were unsure 48 said yes 
or this statement by martin perlman president of the national 
association of home builders 
the results of the survey 1142 buildert 
experiencing more difficulties than others 
neither they say does it means that credit conditions are 
not somewhat more troublesome today than two or three months ago 
but for now they conclude what is called a credit crunch is 
more smoke than fire though the smoke is thick enough to warrant a 
watchful eye

skyscrapers will provide the backdrop instead 
of cornstalks when mikhail s gorbachev follows the footsteps of an 
earlier soviet leader into americas heartland 
gorbachevs sixhour stop in minneapolis on sunday to meet with 
captains of industry and agriculture promises to bear little 
resemblance to nikita khrushchevs 1959 visit to an iowa farm 
if you want to go to a place in the midwest that is different 
than new york and you want to go to a place that is not a rust 
belt center but a place on the cutting edge it could be that 
minnesota is the place said thomas noonan a russian studies 
professor at the university of minnesota 
fourteen fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the twin 
cities area more than in all but three other us cities 
one of those companies control data corp has been such a 
loyal trading partner with the soviets that it once accepted 
shotguns and rare books as payment for mainframe computers said 
control data spokesman rick berglund 
minnesota also is the base of one of the soviet unions biggest 
trading partners in grain giant cargill inc 
as the home of many worldfamous artists composers 
playwrights authors and musicians plus two orchestras two 
museums and two theaters with international reputations minnesota 
also has long cultivated its cultural image the twin cities area 
alone has more than 200 theater companies 
minnesota does represent an ideal american condition in so 
many ways a hardworking and civic conscious population high 
standards of excellence in all endeavors an openness to new ideas 
a sense of leadership said martin friedman director of the 
walker art center in minneapolis 
minnesota is a national leader in the arts a public 
accustomed to quality openminded tolerant a public that 
encourages invention he said 
envelope magnate and bestselling author harvey mackay said 
gorbachev should find in minnesota a sense of our good ol work 
ethic strong individualism that this is not just a visit to do 
business with the soviet union to feather our nests 
you cant xray a persons bankbook here by looking at the cut 
of their suit or the grille on their car mackay said 
much of what minnesota is may not come as a surprise to soviet 
visitors because the state has been a leader in ussoviet 
exchanges said liza malott program officer for the presidents 
ussoviet exchange initiative with the us information agency 
exchange visits have involved minnesota and soviet artists 
actors students bicyclists scuba divers and mushers 
minnesota and soviet chemical dependency counselors discussed 
cooperation on alcoholism rehabilitation research the 
international diabetes center in suburban minneapolis is involved 
in a cooperative venture to build a diabetes center in moscow 
childrens theater companies from moscow and minneapolis traded 
performances and a minnesotasoviet bicycle team is in the midst 
of a twin citiessoviet union trek 
minneapolisst paul has a sistercity relationship with 
novosibirsk and duluth is a sister city to petrozavodsk 
to stimulate more trade minnesota will open trade offices in 
moscow and budapest this summer said richard bohr executive 
director of the minnesota trade office 
william c norris founder and chairman emeritus of control 
data said several minnesota companies enjoy favored status in the 
soviet union because they have demonstrated loyalty during rocky 
political times 
when the soviet union intervened in afghanistan in 1979 for 
example norris lobbied against the trade embargo imposed by former 
president carter 
it was a mistake norris said of the embargo we have so 
much to gain by tapping into their economy 
karin berkholtz a latvian member of the governors commission 
on eastern europe said there are up to 12350 ukrainians 
latvians estonians and lithuanians living in minnesota some of 
whom plan to demonstrate while gorbachev is in town 
others in the state however may be oblivious to the soviet 
leaders visit in southwestern minnesota for example farmers may 
be preoccupied with the grasshopper plague the insects devoured 
whole fields last year and are expected to be worse this year 
but dairy farmer tom hirsch of rural sleepy eye is enthusiastic 
about the upcoming visit 
its a great idea hirsch said weve got the wholesome 
rural life and i think hes interested in that i think hes 
really a headsy person to come to minnesota 
hirsch said gorbachevs visit should help minnesota farmers sell 
their crops to the soviets i think it will have some positive 
effects on the trade negotiations he said 
one of the few similarities in the soviet visits to iowa and 
minnesota will be the hype 
in iowa armed guards and an unruly press corps of 300 shadowed 
khrushchev in minnesota gov rudy perpich has proclaimed the 
gorbachev visit bigger than the super bowl which the twin 
cities will host in 1992 
no one really knows yet how this will develop said peter 
zidek a supercomputer consultant from apple valley but its big 
and it will open a lot of eyes to the twin cities

perhaps nowhere in europe will there 
be as much interest in this weeks summit meeting between george 
bush and mikhail gorbachev as in the two germanys east and west 
with 380000 soviet troops stationed in east germany and 250000 
us troops in west germany the two nations that are about to 
become one have the keenest interest in superpower negotiations to 
drastically reduce foreign forces stationed on their soil 
along with the troops some of the worlds deadliest weapons are 
kept on german soil hightech jet fighters nucleartipped 
shortrange rockets and thousands of atomic artillery shells 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said earlier this 
month that it was up to germans to decide the internal aspects 
of unification on troop levels baker said outsiders could become 
involved in the discussions but here too the germans were in 
charge of their future 
the troop negotiations being conducted in vienna austria by 
nato and the warsaw pact have been flagging and will be one of the 
prime topics when bush and gorbachev meet for four days in 
washington beginning thursday 
bush himself said last week that the talks havent gone as far 
or as fast as i would like to see maybe we can find some way 
at the summit or before the summit to move cfe the talks 
forward 
us officials have said they feel moscow is reluctant to 
conclude a conventional forces in europe treaty unless there are 
assurances that the large west germany army will not pose a threat 
after unification 
one us official who requested anonymity said recently that 
it would be difficult to complete a treaty this year because of the 
german issue and also because of soviet concerns about the 
steadfastness of the east european allies 
the day before bush spoke however soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze said after meeting with his west german 
counterpart hans dietrich genscher that moscow advocates an 
acceleration in the vienna negotiations 
west german officials were quoted in geneva where the two men 
met as saying the us perception of soviet hesitancy on the 
treaty might be a misunderstanding 
shevardnadze himself asked if could confirm the purported 
soviet position on the german military replied no 
in december the two superpowers agreed to slash their central 
european forces to 195000 each with the united states allowed to 
keep an additional 30000 troops in britain and southern europe 
there are now 305000 us troops and an estimated 565000 soviet 
troops in europe 
looking toward the summit capt stefan lang a spokesman for 
the west german defense ministry commented recently we hope 
important signals in the direction of arms controls come out of the 
summit but what exactly they will be we dont know 
no one is more eager for major superpower cutbacks than the 
germans 
west german chancellor helmut kohls government says it wants 
the eventual complete removal of soviet and us shortrange 
nuclear weapons from german soil 
we believe that the lance missile and nuclear artillery have 
lost most of their significance and therefore there should be 
thoughts about how these rockets can be negotiated away lang 
told the associated press 
he stressed however that the lance missiles should be removed 
only in negotiations because the soviets still have a huge 
superiority in this area this should occur in a balanced way 
an agreement to reduce conventional forces would open the way to 
negotiations on the superpowers nuclear arsenals in europe 
washington and the other nato allies have said they are ready 
for talks with the soviets on the shortrange nuclear weapons most 
of which are based in germany 
but nato has not taken a clear stand on negotiating the numbers 
of these weapons down to zero 
a feud could break out within nato if attempts are made to 
replace shortrange nuclear weapons in west germany with 
airlaunched rockets 
i am warning against a new atomic arms race new weapons are 
not needed genscher said recently 
the future of nato and of american troops in europe could 
become a bone of contention as well 
some west german politicians including genscher have warmed up 
to the soviets idea of creating new european security 
structures to take the place of nato and the warsaw pact 
but washington and other nato partners say they are vehemently 
against replacing nato 
the social democrats kohls main political rivals have also 
said nato and the warsaw pact should be transformed into a new 
europewide security arrangement 
the social democrats are pressing nato to make major changes 
that would better reflect the rapid waning of the oncemighty 
sovietled warsaw pact 
it would be very good if the americans prepared the way for 
this with constructive proposals during the summit horst 
ehmke disarmament expert for the social democrats said

the recent downswing in interest rates isnt the 
only development that has encouraged analysts as they follow 
changes in the cost of borrowed money 
a good many observers also have been heartened to see the 
yield curve which tracks the differences between short and 
longterm interest rates bending into a positive shape 
now that longterm interestbearing investments carry yields 
higher than their shortterm competition these analysts see 
potential benefits for investors of many kinds 
the historical record suggests that this is a reason to be 
optimistic about the prospects for common stocks says mark 
stumpp research director at pdi strategies a part of the 
investment management affiliate of prudential insurance company of 
america 
a normal yield curve is supposed to have a positive slope 
that is show a gradual increase in yields as maturities increase 
on debt securities of the same or comparable issuers 
in theory at least a longterm treasury bond should yield more 
than a shortterm treasury bill because its owners expose 
themselves to greater risks in particular regarding inflation 
changes in the inflation rate dont have much time to affect the 
purchasing power of the money an investor ties up in a treasury 
bill that has a life of only three or six months 
in the case of a bond that wont come due for as long as 30 
years by contrast inflation can have a devastating impact 
a 30year commitment involves a lot of other unknowns as well 
including such seemingly remote possibilities as the chance that 
the credit standing of even a bluechip borrower like the federal 
government might diminish over time 
when the yield curve flattens or inverts as it did for much of 
the past couple of years it often is regarded as a symptom of 
economic imbalance or uncertainty 
as recently as six months ago the yield curve for treasury 
securities was practically a level line with yields hovering just 
under 8 percent whether you were looking at a 90day bill or a 
30year bond 
then through the first four months of 1990 longterm interest 
rates rose while shortterm rates barely budged that helped tilt 
the yield curve to a positive slope that has persisted as rates 
turned downward this month 
toward the end of last week yields in the treasury market 
ranged upward from 792 percent for threemonth bills to 811 
percent for sixmonth bills and 815 percent for oneyear bills 
the longestterm bonds meanwhile were yielding 860 percent 
though between about sevenyear and 30year maturities the curve 
was still flat 
according to stumpp this offers considerable food for thought 
for anyone with a stake in the future direction of the stock market 
over the last 30 years he says stocks have fared far better in 
sixmonth periods after the yield curve in december or june had a 
positive slope than they did in the relatively few comparable 
periods when it was flat or inverted 
prices rose in more than threequarters of the periods ushered 
in by a curve with a positive slope and fell almost twothirds of 
the time when they started out with a flat or inverted curve 
as those calculations show stumpp acknowledges the yield 
curve indicator for stocks cannot be taken as infallible 
nevertheless he concludes judging by the historical 
record of this indicator stocks look better than they did late 
last year

for a long time he feared hed be known as 
sen bill bradley former new york knick for the rest of his 
life 
the image of a man wearing short pants in drafty arenas 
didnt seem to enhance the credibility sought by new jerseys young 
senator when he arrived here in 1978 
so the rhodes scholar with a great baseline jumpshot 
deliberately shunned the key 
dollar bill a nickname he earned from his pro teammates 
because of his frugal handling of his affairs set out to apply 
his sense of discipline to mastery of parliamentary procedure he 
built support for tax reform forging alliances until congress 
overhauled the tax system in 1986 
he fought for the superfund cleanup bill child nutrition 
programs more medicaid money for poor mothers and children all 
the while plunging himself into details of foreign policy third 
world debt and international trade 
the important thing is to get things done he says 
twelve years after what he calls his divorce from basketball 
bradley returns alone in the summers to a court near his mountain 
home in denville nj to relax with his famous fivespot warmups 
but not the jumpers you understand he says goodhumoredly 
the heart is willing but the knees arent the former 
knicks forward laments 
about all he puts them through in washington these days are 
sessions shooting hoops with his 13yearold daughter theresa 
anne aides say the daughter he devotedly drops at school each 
morning and cares for four days a week shows signs of catching up 
with her fathers legendary technique 
playing with her has helped him put basketball back into 
perspective after several years in which he believed he could only 
be taken seriously on capitol hill by pushing his nba career firmly 
into the past 
now i look back and i can think more easily about it the fact 
of the matter is that i like the game says bradley 
the senator picks his 6foot5 frame up from his office chair 
during an interview over coffee to point out reminders of what hes 
mastered in his 46 years a golden gavel for presiding 100 hours in 
his first senate session and photographs from his 1970 and 1973 nba 
championship victories with the new york knicks 
he takes equal pride in the gavel and the shot of him wrapped in 
a bearhug around willis reed triumphant after the knicks 1973 
championship 
sports metaphors occasionally punctuate his conversation 
in basketball and in politics the only score that counts is 
the one at the final buzzer he says when asked about republican 
predictions that his opponent will do well to capture 38 percent of 
the november vote 
bradley also says hell serve out another sixyear senate term 
to the buzzer despite recurring speculation that he will seek the 
presidency 
his supporters take his word at face value 
i believe that in his heart and his head he believes he is 
going to serve out his full term says harold hodes once chief 
of staff to former new jersey gov brendan t byrne but he adds 
between 1991 and 1992 a lot of things can happen 
would waiting until 1996 hurt him are supporters pressuring him 
to run 
its a very funny thing bradley responds i assume thats 
what people talk about sometimes but thats not what they talk 
about with me i think people respect my sense of service they 
know that if they mention anything to me about that that i will 
say look my interest is new jersey 
still bradleywatching has become a pastime within both parties 
roger stone a republican consultant who helped elect ronald 
reagan says bradley is conservative enough and independent enough 
to appeal to gop voters 
our party could nominate a bill bradley stone says if 
you look at his votes on contra aid defense issues the mx 
missile the b1 bomber he looks at issues onebyone 
and looking at bradleys command of 64 percent of the vote in 
his last reelection bid stone adds a lot of republicans 
obviously voted for him in 1984 
bradleys fairtax policies have appealed to even some of the 
most conservative voices 
hes not one of those democrats who has never met a tax hike 
he doesnt like says howard phillips chairman of the 
conservative caucus 
the most common negative that people on both sides say about 
bradley is he lacks charisma the word comes up again and again 
along with references to improvements in his oncesleepinducing 
speeches 
i think there isnt any bradley charisma but its obvious 
that he cares about people its obvious he listens stone says 
on a oneonone basis hes easy to like 
christine todd whitman the gop candidate who hopes to unseat 
him in november has criticized bradley for endorsing proposed 
campaign spending reform legislation when his own campaign kitty is 
way above the 55 million limit that would apply in new jersey 
for his part bradley bemoans being forced to spend so much to 
buy television time in the expensive new york and philadelphia 
media markets because new jersey has none of its own 
you end up being collectors for television he says 
but he says he needs to raise the money to fend off any possible 
negative gop campaign the cautious nature is part of bradleys 
style 
for the past two years he also has been playing in national 
political circles hodes notes he has spent countless hours 
jetting to podiums around the country on behalf of campaigning 
colleagues 
remember the early endorsement of michael dukakis at a very 
critical time for dukakis the decision to back ron brown for 
democratic national committee chairman new jersey was a swing seat 
for brown and bradley endorsed him hodes says 
and at the same time bradley has quietly been learning about 
issues outside new jersey for example although new jersey has a 
strong agriculture industry the senator made several visits to a 
south dakota wheat farm to study another regions farm problems 
i went back over time bradley says i have to physically 
experience things its not enough for me to read the book

it won the velvet revolution 
runs the government and smiles on every village from its happyface 
symbol but civic forum has tough competition in the nations first 
free elections since 1946 
polls show it leading but with less than a quarter of the total 
vote civic forum appears likely to lose to the christian democrats 
in slovakia the more rural and roman catholic of the two 
constituent republics 
campaigning began officially april 29 with rallies posters on 
practically every available surface and endless spots on radio and 
television each of 23 parties fighting for seats in the federal 
parliament and the czech and slovak legislatures gets four hours of 
time 
czechoslovaks will vote friday and saturday 
few differences are evident among the parties all reject the 
communist past including the communists all favor a market 
economy and parliamentary democracy 
civic forums membership cuts across the political spectrum it 
claims to be neither left nor right and emphasizes its wellknown 
personalities including president vaclav havel experience aninciples 
civic forums competition comes from a flock of new or remodeled 
parties chief among them the christian democrats buoyed by recent 
centerright victories in east germany and hungary 
we shall win but i dont know how big it will be said 
jana ryslinkova a mathematician who speaks for civic forum i 
think it wont be less than 30 percent 
havel civic forums biggest asset with voters is officially 
setting himself apart from organization he helped found on grounds 
his office requires impartiality 
the immensely popular president does help indirectly by 
participating in events organized by civic forum he opened its 
indooroutdoor exhibit on recent czechoslovak history which draws 
large crowds 
under a new proportional system a party whose candidate list 
gets 5 percent of the vote nationally is guaranteed representation 
in parliament up to six parties could qualify forcing civic forum 
to make a powersharing arrangement 
parties variously describe themselves as right center or 
centerleft but the main distinctions involve economic control and 
social benefits 
leftist parties such as the communists socialists and social 
democrats favor slower conversion to capitalism and some retention 
of benefits the christian democrats reject any degree of 
socialism empasizing their identification with christian values 
and tradition 
some civic forum leaders want to retain elements of socialism 
a survey last month by the state polling organization said civic 
forum picked up strength in april to 22 percent from 19 percent 
the previous month the christian democrats had 15 percent overall 
but led civic forums partners in slovakia 22 percent to 12 percent 
in november civic forum seemed to be the countrys only 
authentic political force its rallies attracted hundreds of 
thousands of people and persuaded communist leaders to step aside 
peacefully 
since then the government it dominates has improved 
czechoslovakias image abroad negotiated a deal for withdrawal of 
soviet military forces by june 1991 and erased myriad symbols of 
the old order 
radical overhaul of the economy must wait until after the 
election however in part because of divisions in the government 
over how fast to go 
ms ryslinkova the civic forum spokeswoman said the edge goes 
to civic forum over parties offering similar programs because 
what we have more than the other parties is the people able 
to lead 
hoping to overcome it is the christian democratic alliance of 
the peoples party formerly allied with the communists the 
christian democratic party in in the czech republic and the 
christian democratic movement in slovakia 
the alliance has joined forces with associations of wouldbe 
entrepreneurs and farmers and appeals to those with christian 
values said miroslav bartos a peoples party candidate and one of 
the parliamentarians appointed in december to replace resigning 
communist deputies 
communist spokesman josef hora said his party which ruled from 
1948 until last year might get 10 percent to 12 percent of the 
vote the party claims a membership of 900000 in the population of 
155 million 
hora complained that critics dont take the partys renewal 
seriously and still blame it for the repressions of the past

the label on a chocolate box makes a 
metaphor for the troubled tale of postwar poland 
formerly e wedel it says in large letters in tiny print 
a footnote adds 22nd of july confectionery industry works 
three generations of wedel family labor were erased by communist 
fiat in the postwar zeal to nationalize private industries it took 
four decades to figure out it was all a big mistake 
now that poland is embracing capitalism once again the 22nd of 
july confectionery industry works also will be formerly the 
new label is not expected to commemorate it 
the chocolate company is to be one of the first five state 
enterprises offered for sale to private investors as postcommunist 
poland tries to revitalize a crumbling economy 
from the stateowned industries private companies are to be 
formed to flourish or fail without government subsidies 
first for the auction block are those deemed to have the 
greatest chance of success and wedel occupies a special place in 
poland as a prewar company that still means quality to consumers 
otherwise awash in shoddy goods 
when the means of production were liberated from the 
capitalists it is said the workers at wedel spontaneously 
called for it to be renamed in honor of july 22 1944 when a 
sovietbacked committee proclaimed itself the government of poland 
the candyloving class and wedels foreign customers were not 
impressed 
as the communist economy staggered through its last years 
apparatchicks in the confection section finally admitted the 
blunder 
the wedel name went back on the packages with the delicate 
addition of formerly and the official name became a postscript 
this year the national holiday was changed from july 22 to may 
3 the date of a polish constitution in 1791 
andrzej karbowniczek who runs the factory said regardless 
of political changes we have never been ashamed of the example of 
a man who achieved very good results in the chocolate business 
that man was jan wedel thirdgeneration capitalist his 
grandfather karol wedel opened a warsaw candy shop in 1851 and 
the familys fortunes were sweetened by the second generation 
emil who sent his own son jan to paris and london for 
instruction in chemistry and management 
when jan returned the business expanded further the wedels 
opened a paris shop in 1937 and flew the candy to it in their own 
airplane 
jan wedel is remembered with reverence in warsaw 
the company was wedels family the weekly tygodnik 
solidarnosc said he attended name days birthdays weddings 
granted loans helped solve lifes problems 
wedels factory was occupied by the germans during world war ii 
and partially destroyed then says a promotional booklet from the 
mid1980s the liberation of warsaw began the socialist 
expansion of the factory 
one day in 1949 the company was nationalized by peoples poland 
and no longer belonged to the wedel family 
people close to mr wedel said he was most happy that the old 
machinery was replaced by modern machines said karbowniczek the 
factory director 
happy to lose his familys legacy 
well karbowniczek said wedel was a clever man he did not 
intend to fight because he knew it was useless 
tygodnik solidarnosc said that wedel was allowed to return as a 
technical managers assistant but that the factory register shows 
him leaving after less than a year due to poor health 
the newspaper suggested the real reason for his departure was 
harassment by communist party operatives at the factory 
witnesses often saw wedel sit for hours on a bench in the park 
across the street staring at the factory the paper reported 
in 1950 one boleslaw w identified as a candy wrapper wrote 
to the communist party daily trybuna ludu it has been five years 
since the factory has been reopened by the polish communist party 
years of comrades efforts to improve production and improve 
working conditions production and the existence of the factory 
itself have now nothing to do with the capitalist wedel and owe 
everything to the working class 
up to this moment against logic the factory has been working 
under the old name wedel how can it be how is it possible to 
export under the capitalists name our export production must be 
our tool of propaganda of production of working people without 
capitalists 
the name 22nd of july 22 lipca in polish was adopted 
whether by spontaneous demand of workers or by the apparatus 
karbowniczek said the decision was not too fortunate i had a 
lot of problems with foreign trading partners who were asking who 
that mr lipca was 
there are said to be wedel heirs two nephews and the children 
of jans last wife but the management said none had inquired about 
reclaiming the factory 
parliament is still drafting laws on selling state companies and 
returning nationalized properties to former owners 
with agreement in principle first steps have been taken at such 
major enterprises as the gdansk shipyard where solidarity was born 
and the universal foreign trade company but complex mechanics have 
yet to be resolved 
what for example should be the balance between ownership by 
poles and foreigners and by investors and workers 
how is the value of a company to be established when standard 
western accounting principles have never been applied 
bid low was the advice of a western businessman helping 
organize the sales 
the wedel factory which has about 3000 employees made sweets 
last year valued at 126 billion zlotys or 132 million roughly 
20 percent of its production was exported including the trademark 
wedel chocolate wafers in round blueandwhite boxes 
wedel is one of the first enterprises to be privatized because 
we are one of the best said jozef rutkowski the factorys 
financial manager we belong to the group of enterprises that can 
guarantee to their shareholders that their capital will be quickly 
multiplied 
the company suffered with the decline of polands economy in 
1983 under martial law there was not enough foreign currency to 
buy raw materials and chocolate production ceased for the first 
time in wedels history 
managers say the company has enjoyed relative financial health 
however in part because of the loyalty of customers and employees 
karbowniczek the manager did not appear to grasp the irony of 
a company outliving four decades of communism because of quality 
stemming from its capitalist founders to become one of the best 
candidates for return to private hands 
he did see a parallel with poland 
it is like the history of our nation because regardless 
of whether it was private a stock company or a stateowned 
enterprise it survived

the man who captured the spirit of the 1989 
prodemocracy movement by stopping a column of tanks has vanished 
an associated press photograph and television pictures showed 
the man in a white shirt standing defiantly before the tanks near 
tiananmen square on june 5 the pictures appeared around the world 
and became a symbol of the prodemocracy protests 
some chinese sources believe it is almost certain the young man 
was arrested and executed soon afterward a london newspaper the 
sunday express identified him last june as wang weilin a 
19yearold student and quoted wangs friends as expressing fears 
he was put to death 
no other foreign news or human rights organization has been able 
to identify the man or obtain hard evidence of what happened to 
him some expressed doubts about the name wang weilin 
after stopping the column the man climbed onto the turret of 
the lead tank and pleaded with the soldiers to turn back and stop 
killing people ultimately bystanders led him away and he 
disappeared into the crowd 
communist party chief jiang zemin said in an interview with abc 
television may 2 that the dramatic pictures illustrated the armys 
forbearance 
he said the pictures showed tank drivers would not run down a 
citizen and proved the allegations of tanks crushing demonstrators 
were lies 
jiang said he could not confirm whether the man was arrested 
when asked whether the young man had been executed jiang replied 
in english i think never never killed

daniel patrick moynihan was 15 when he got his 
social security card in 1943 he promptly lost it 
it didnt look like anything worth keeping the new york 
senator recalled it did not suggest its importance 
moynihan who chairs the senate subcommittee on social security 
for more than a decade has been crusading to replace the paper card 
with something more impressive and tamperresistant 
i think it a rather simple proposition that a plastic 
counterfeitproof social security card would reduce fraud and 
enhance public confidence in our social security system he said 
at a recent subcommittee hearing 
we should have a durable plastic card that people can carry 
around in their wallets and feel that they have something a card 
that gives them a sense of membership in the social security 
system 
that simple proposition however keeps bumping up against 
longstanding fears that the social security card would become a 
national id card the government could use to keep track of people 
those concerns were born with the social security system itself 
in the 1930s when there were worries that the giant retirement 
system would become a bureaucracy that had everyones number and 
knew all about them 
as a result the government designed social security cards to 
be pulpy and wear out in six weeks or whatever and not give any 
sense that the third reich was appearing in the united states 
moynihan said 
a more enduring card would help instill confidence in social 
security and reduce crimes based on false identities perpetuated 
with counterfeit cards according to moynihan 
but even now when the use of social security numbers is widely 
accepted for a variety of purposes the government is wary of 
making any changes that would suggest a national identification 
system 
the administration has always had fundamental concerns about 
the possibility of the social security card and number becoming a 
universal identifier in this country louis d enoff the 
agencys deputy commissioner of programs said at a hearing of 
moynihans subcommittee last month 
the general accounting office in a march report to congress 
suggested that debate already may be largely moot 
many would argue that we already have an almost universal 
identifier in the country the social security number the gao 
said it noted that a social security number is needed to report 
income earned from work to claim children 2 and older as 
dependents for tax purposes and to obtain drivers licenses in 
many states 
moynihan thought he had succeeded in improving social security 
cards in 1983 when congress enacted legislation requiring the 
government to come up with a new counterfeitresistant card but 
the new cards although more difficult to tamper with look much 
like the old ones and still are made of paper 
his crusade is receiving renewed attention this year because it 
has been linked with the issue of employment discrimination by 
employers afraid of being punished for hiring illegal aliens 
under the nations 4yearold immigration law workers can 
establish their legal eligibility to work by presenting any one of 
17 documents including social security cards 
the gaos report said discrimination might be reduced by 
simplifying the process for checking work eligibility perhaps by 
relying on a revised social security card or a drivers license 
with a verified social security number 
using a single card would reduce employer confusion and make 
it easier for employers to comply with the laws verification 
requirements without discriminating the agency said 
but enoff told the subcommittee that social security does not 
need a better card and that there are less expensive ways to 
address employment discrimination 
gene mcnary commissioner of the immigration and naturalization 
service said immigration law prohibits the establishment of a 
national identity card but does allow the creation of an 
employment authorization document 
we have to work to find a way to produce the latter without 
violating the restriction of the former he told the subcommittee 
last month 
we dont want a card that is going to have to be carried that 
is going to cause people to feel they live under big brother 
the justice departments andrew strojny warned the panel that 
designating any one card as a universal work authorization document 
could create a major change in the relationship between the 
government and its citizenry 
had i been required to produce my social security card for 
inspection when i was hired by the department of justice i would 
be unemployed today he said i lost my social security card 
over 20 years ago

elizabeth rose von hohen kneaded and cut 
thousands of hungarian noodles over the decades following a recipe 
that existed in her minds eye and in her practiced hands 
her family like families everywhere nagged her for years to 
write down the recipes before they were lost forever she finally 
did and the result is grandmothers cookbook a folksy 
compilation by mrs von hohen and a granddaughter carrie j gamble 
mrs von hohen 81 provides the recipes for austrianhungarian 
dishes she learned from her mother while ms gamble illustrates 
the beginning of each chapter with watercolors of wildflowers her 
grandmother treasured while growing up in rural pennsylvania 
each wildflower elicits a remembrance the wisteria that covered 
an arbor over the driveway for example the big clusters of 
purple flowers looked like bunches of grapes and were so fragrant 
they were always full of bees too in fact we had a beehive in our 
attic because of the wisteria i remember our neighbor helped us 
take it down one day and we got a washtub full of fragrant honey 
from it 
mrs von hohen in a recent telephone interview from her home in 
hatboro pa said shes mystified in the renewed interest in such 
traditional favorites as cabbage noodles liver dumplings 
potatoe balls and jelly buns 
nowadays they put so many flavors together and these are so 
plain she said 
ms gamble in a phone interview from her home in doylestown 
pa is not so modest in assessing her grandmothers cooking 
twenty years later people will remember a cake my grandmother 
made 
mrs von hohen grew up on a 42acre farm in bucks county that 
she refers to as the homestead in her book she remembers that all 
the cookies she made as a child were either round or halfmoon 
shapes cut out using a glass because they had no cookiecutters 
we raised everything homemade butter chickens we didnt 
have to skimp on what we cooked with things really tasted good 
then i dont think butter today has any taste she said 
when she was 16 she went to philadelphia to cook for a wealthy 
family and expanded her repertoire 
when i first came to the city i couldnt eat the chicken 
because i didnt think it had any taste because i was used to 
freshkilled chicken or eggs either i couldnt eat them because i 
was used to fresh on the farm we had an apple orchard and peach 
orchard and you made your own jellies and preserves 
she quit her job three years later to get married and began 
cooking for her husband and his family there were always a lot 
of people to cook for she said with a laugh 
mrs von hohen has three children 11 grandchildren and two 
greatgrandchildren her husband died in 1985 and since then she 
has lived alone in an apartment her cooking these days is confined 
to meals for herself and wednesday night suppers she prepares for 
her one of her daughters and ms gamble she also cooks special 
treats for holiday gatherings like the poundcake and saffron bread 
she made for easter 
asked if any of her children or grandchildren are good cooks 
mrs von hohen said all of her granddaughters were given copies of 
the book and are trying out the recipes theyve had good luck 
with them most of my granddaughters just got married she said 
although she never used the term mrs von hohens kind of 
cooking is called comfort food these days she doesnt own a 
microwave or food processor those things are a pain and her 
only concession to modernity is a hand mixer she uses when her 
shoulder bothers her 
her recipes are written in a language that is usually clear if 
somewhat untraditional instructions for one dish tell the reader 
to cut bread into 1inch squares and fluff the squares with 
melted margarine 
mrs von hohen said her favorite recipe in the book is the 
goulash here it is verbatim 
hungarian goulashequals 
put 1 tablespoon oil in a pan finely slice 1 large onion and 
fry in oil until golden brown add 1 teaspoon paprika stir it 
around and add the meat you can use chicken beef or veal add a 
piece of green pepper a stalk of celery a tomato fresh or 
canned 1 bay leaf and 2 cloves salt and pepper to taste steam 
the meat until it draws juice then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour 
on the meat add 1 or 2 cups of water and simmer until tender this 
usually takes about 2 hours add 1 or 2 diced potatoes for the last 
hour i like to serve this with rice noodles or bread dumplings

states should set tougher standards for board 
and care homes to ensure that elderly and disabled residents 
receive proper care a federal report recommends 
almost all states set board and care standards on personal care 
fire safety sanitation and licensure according to the report from 
the inspector generals office at the department of health and 
human services 
however only limited attention is given to the level of 
care needed by residents training and dealing with unlicensed 
facilities the report said 
board and care facilities offer residents room meals help with 
activities of daily living and some degree of supervision more 
than 1 million elderly and disabled individuals live in such 
facilities the report said 
use of board and care homes has grown with the 
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill the availability of 
supplemental security income benefits for the aged and disabled 
and a shortage of nursing home beds and other longterm care 
services the report said 
it recommended that states improve their ability to identify 
unlicensed facilities and to encourage board and care homes to 
become licensed 
it also recommended that states enforce their requirements with 
sanctions such as fines restrictions on new admissions and closing 
homes procedures for handling complaints should be publicized so 
that complaints reach the proper authorities it said 
as an outgrowth of abuses in board and care homes congress in 
1976 enacted legislation requiring states to set standards assuring 
that ssi recipients do not live in substandard facilities 
the hhs study was based on interviews with federal and state 
officials board and care operators and advocates for residents 
visits to board and care homes and an analysis of current 
standards 
nearly half the state officials interviewed felt their states 
assigned a low priority to board and care regulation and a 
majority felt the 1976 legislation could not be enforced 
nearly threefourths of state officials and 80 percent of care 
providers and advocates recommended a common set of national 
minimum standards these would include basic safety and service 
requirements ways to deal with unlicensed facilities staff 
training and requirements for different levels of care

older people who speak loudly may not 
be hard of hearing they may be responding to negative stereotypes 
about them a speech communication researcher says 
stereotypes sometimes include cranky weak and ill said 
linguistics professor harry hollien founding director of the 
university of floridas institute for advanced study of 
communication processes 
older people who have trembling breathy or jittery voices may 
be negatively stereotyped as grouchy or frail he said 
hollien published a study called old voices what do we really 
know about them and has categorized distinct voice 
characteristics of different age groups 
aging reduces the number of sensory nerve endings often causing 
impairment of vision hearing and reflexes hollien said 
hollien also found that voices of aging men and women become 
similar after menopause 
in preadolescent ages boys and girls voices can hardly be 
told apart he said after puberty the characteristics go in 
opposite directions and after menopause they start to become alike 
again 
other vocal characteristics of the elderly include change in 
vocal fry the lowest voice register in human frequency as a 
person ages the vocal fry becomes lower adding a rough 
jittering quality to the voice 
breathiness or air loss during talking also correlates with 
aging hollien said

in todays consumeroriented society most people 
have possessions and in some form or another many people have 
plans to pass their wealth to their children or other young 
relatives 
whether at the prompting of a financial adviser to get some tax 
savings by shifting income to another person or solely out of 
generosity many people begin transferring their property during 
their lifetimes 
however when the recipient is legally a minor a problem 
arises state property laws restrict minors from possessing 
owning managing selling or transferring property in addition 
third parties often assume a greater risk dealing with minors 
because children may disaffirm or renounce any contract they have 
entered 
the solution to these complications can take many forms trust 
arrangements courtappointed guardianships or custodianships and 
even stateauthorized means of transfer 
all states have special laws that make it easier and legally 
safer to make a gift to a minor these laws primarily take two 
forms the uniform gifts to minors act which has been adopted in 
almost all states or the uniform transfers to minors act which at 
last count was in place in 34 states 
ugma which has been in effect since 1956 provides that an 
adult donor may make a gift of securities money or a life 
insurance product to a minor by having it registered in the name 
of and delivering it to an adult either the donor or another 
adult or institution to hold as custodian for the minor 
utma a creation of the uniform law commissioners in 1983 is 
much broader in its scope it allows any kind of property real or 
personal tangible or intangible to be given as a custodial gift 
and unlike ugma also applies to such property transactions as 
repayments of loans borrowed from minors and tranfers of property 
from trusts guardianships or estates 
under both forms the minor acquires legal title to the property 
gifted the adult relinquishes all title 
under either act after a gift is made custodians generally 
maintain the same powers over the transferred property that 
unmarried adult owners already have the custodian may invest 
manage or dispose of the gifted property on the minors behalf for 
any purpose whatsoever short of using the income from one property 
to fulfill a legal obligation of support toward the child 
when income produced by a custodial gift relieves an individual 
such as a parent of a legal obligation to feed and clothe a child 
the law taxes that income to such an individual 
of course grandparents or other family member donors unless 
they also have been appointed the childs legal guardian need not 
be concerned with this problem 
both acts provide for turning over the custodial property after 
the child reaches a specified age the ugma legislation originally 
established the time of the distribution as age 21 however in 
many states this has been reduced typically to 18 in some 
states the age at which the child is entitled to receive the 
property can be extended by the donor but in no event beyond age 
21 
utma sets the age for distribution of gifted property at age 21 
and at 18 or other statespecified age for property other than a 
gift one should consult individual state law regarding what age 
applies 
overall ugma and utma transfers provide a simple inexpensive 
means to a desirable end both allow an adult to make a substantial 
gift of property to a child without the child having to assume 
control of the property while still a minor in addition the 
parent or other relative may continue to monitor or manage the 
growth of the transferred property while achieving his or own 
personal financial planning goals

youll probably win the argument if you contend 
that an outofcontrol budget deficit is the reason why higher 
taxes are being considered 
repeat it often enough and it sounds right sort of like that 
old sales trick of asking the customer to answer a series of simple 
questions with an obvious yes answer and then springing the 
big one on him 
and of course you do want this new life insurance policy 
dont you 
same with the deficit many people accept the notion that it is 
now more oppressive than it has been in years and theyll even 
give you the reasons such as tax cuts in the reagan administration 
and slow revenue growth now 
but the facts have little kinship with the belief in relation 
to the gross national product a measure of the economys size the 
deficit is now at a rate less than half what it was in 1983 when 
it reached 63 percent 
in that decade of the 1980s during which so much attention was 
paid to tax cutting a series of undistinguished increases 
followed by a socalled major tax reform doubled tax receipts to 
more than 1 trillion a year 
it is one of several prevalent beliefs that rory costello for 
one would like to see put to bed costello economic analyst at 
dean witter has a long list it includes these 
inflation is continuing to rise were already in a recession 
housing is collapsing and the united states must raise interest 
rates in order to compete for capital all exaggerations he 
suggests 
of these the one most discussed of late seems to be the budget 
deficit in part because of president bush softening his antitax 
stand and stating his willingness to discuss the possibility of 
raising revenues 
advocates of higher taxes often suggest the government is 
revenuestarved says political economist daniel mitchell who 
responds in both nominal and inflationadjusted dollars taxes 
are at the highest level in us history 
mitchell is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation which 
tends to make his opinion significant since the foundation a 
conservative think tank has enjoyed considerable influence in both 
the reagan and bush administrations 
the foundation maintains that member opinions do not necessarily 
reflect its views but that might be likened to the laundry saying 
it isnt responsible for returning your clothes the foundation 
loudly promotes its members views 
mitchells view is this 
the cause of the deficit is not a lack of revenue but runaway 
government spending to raise taxes now would mean a recession and 
consequently even lower revenues to raise taxes would merely fuel 
more spending 
moreover he suggests there is a matter of political integrity 
stated thusly 
president bush repeatedly promised the american people that he 
would not raise taxes candidate bush correctly promised to veto 
any tax increase president bush should follow through on that 
commitment 
mitchell states that even though annual tax revenues have 
climbed 540 billion since 1980 the deficit is higher because of 
the approximately 610 billionplus increase in federal spending in 
that period 
his conclusion 
george bush has distinguished himself first and foremost by 
his antitax hike policy now his credibility integrity 
commitment to principles and political and economic wisdom are put 
to the test 
if bush expects to keep the support of the people who put him 
in office he must read their lips they are saying mr 
president keep your promise no new taxes

president bushs oneyear extension of 
preferential trading status to china assures it will remain a 
leading buyer of key us exports ranging from grain to lumber to 
heavy machinery business people say 
they said the bush decision announced thursday also assures no 
supply disruption or price jumps in important consumer imports from 
china including a wide array of clothes and shoes toys and small 
appliances 
bush rejected congressional pressure to suspend chinas 
mostfavorednation status which it has held for a decade and 
entitles the country to low tariffs in selling goods to the united 
states 
critics wanted bush to scrap the status to punish chinas 
government for its crackdown on dissent which began nearly a year 
ago when troops attacked student protesters in beijing us 
businesses that rely on china trade said such punishment would hurt 
the wrong people and invite certain retaliation 
we felt that in the interest of keeping trade lines open and 
allowing us farm products to flow into china it was critical 
that this be extended said jack king spokesman for the american 
farm bureau federation in park ridge ill i think history has 
shown that when we turn our back on foreign customers theres 
always another country willing to fill the need 
steve halloran director of the grain department of the national 
farmers organization in corning iowa said a chinese withdrawal 
from the us wheat market likely would have depressed prices much 
like the soviet grain embargo did a decade ago hurting farmers for 
a problem they didnt cause 
anytime you interfere in trade relationships with political 
mandates such as this youre going to see a negative impact on the 
prices he said unfortunately its always a long climb back 
up the price ladder 
one of the most ardent lobby groups that pressed for the 
mostfavored nation extension was the united stateschina business 
council a coalition of companies with longstanding investment 
commitments and operations in china 
the council had argued mfn status was not a concession to china 
but rather the standard treatment the united states extends to 
almost all its trading partners including such countries as south 
africa iraq and syria the soviet union does not have mfn status 
china has emerged as one of the most important us trading 
partners since commercial relations first were established nearly 
two decades ago in that time twoway trade has gone from near 
zero to about 18 billion a year 
the trade also has moved sharply in beijings favor with 
exports to the united states about double the level of us sales 
to china 
experts in uschinese trade estimate that china now provides 
onethird of the toys sold in this country 10 percent of the 
footwear and 15 percent of all imported clothing 
it also is a leading buyer of us wheat purchasing more than 
1 billion worth last year or about 20 percent of total us 
exports to the country american aircraft machinery lumber and 
highquality cotton are other important products purchased by the 
chinese 
were very pleased that the president has decided to renew 
mfn said jodi levin spokeswoman for the toy manufacturers of 
america in new york which had expressed strong concern about a 
possible suspension for industry and american consumers and for 
that matter chinese working in the factories overseas this seems 
to be a resolution that will make the most people happy 
without mfn status toys from china would be subject to a 70 
percent tariff vs 68 percent now us customs regulations show 
tariffs on sweaters would have gone from 6 percent to 60 percent 
electric hair dryers from 39 percent to 35 percent womens 
trousers from 177 percent to 90 percent

researchers at ibm say they have found a new 
way to produce blue laser light that could squeeze four times as 
much information on computer optical disks 
moving the process from the lab to an end product is years away 
michael ross a spokesman for international business machines 
corp said thursday 
nevertheless analysts and manufacturers said ibm could reap big 
profits if the process helps the optical storage industry still in 
its infancy take its place beside magnetic disks and tape 
current optical disks use infrared diode lasers to make marks as 
small in diameter as 08 microns a micron is a millionth of a 
meter 
scientists from ibms almaden research center in san jose used a 
quarterinchlong potassium niobate crystal to convert infrared 
light to blue laser light which has half the wavelength 
the blue laser can focus on a spot 04 microns in diameter half 
the diameter of a conventional laser that potentially could permit 
an optical disk to hold four times more information the 
equivalent of perhaps 800 bibles on a 5inch disk 
william j kozlovsky an ibm research staff member and wilfried 
lenth manager of advanced lasers told the conference on lasers 
and electrooptics in anaheim thursday that the process was at 
least five times more efficient than others at converting 
electricity into blue light 
its almost the holy grail of the optical data storage 
industry said bob abraham of freeman associates inc santa 
barbarabased consultants to data storage companies its been 
long recognized that the wave length of the laser beam has been the 
big limiting factor 
he said ibm had been researching optical disk technology for 
years although the company today produces only magnetic disks 
it may be a few years yet before we see products abraham 
said but whether they choose to manufacture or license it 
theyre likely to be making a great deal of money 
optical disks which look much like cds or the small storage 
disks used in many pcs can store enough data to replace whole tape 
libraries of computer information optical storage is a more secure 
way to store data than magnetic disks because it is much harder to 
erase accidentally 
one us company that already makes optical disks and would be 
interested in licensing the rights if ibms process becomes 
practical is maxoptics a division of san josebase maxtor corp 
at this point its a little early to tell how useful its 
going to be but it certainly appears the potential is there to 
quadruple the information stored said joe davis maxtors vice 
president of advanced product planning 
we eagerly await more information so we can begin studying 
it davis said 
the storage capacity of both optical and magnetic disks has 
reached stunning levels 
maxtor recently began shipping a 5inch optical disk that can 
store the equivalent of 200 bibles davis said it also markets 
what he said was the highestcapacity storage disk in the world a 
magnetic disk that can handle the equivalent of 400 bibles 
davis said that even if the improved optical disk pans out its 
far too early to write off magnetic disks particularly when 
information needs to be erased or written over the storage 
capacity of magnetic disks also known as winchester disks is now 
about 100 times greater than 10 years ago he noted 
lets suppose it does work out as they say davis said 
this breakthrough took several years contrast that with 
winchester technology where every two years you seem to double the 
capacity

ivan boesky survived two days of hostile 
questioning on the witness stand but it remains to be seen if the 
same can be said for his credibility 
in a third day of testimony thursday the former speculator said 
he was able to write off on his income taxes half of the 100 
million penalty he paid to settle the biggest insider trading case 
in wall street history 
he also said his wrongdoing didnt end with his guilty plea he 
admitted violating prison rules by paying other inmates to do his 
laundry 
boesky gave his first public testimony about his crimes at the 
securities fraud trial of his former friend and associate john a 
mulheren jr he is the prime witness for the government which 
alleges mulheren broke the law to help boesky cheat on his taxes 
and evade federal securities laws 
in two days of heated cross examination defense attorney thomas 
p puccio tried to destroy boeskys credibility by portraying him 
as a greedy liar who had turned on a former friend to save his own 
skin 
i think we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish with mr 
boesky puccio said at the end of the day 
mulheren and boesky were once close friends when mulheren was an 
arbitrager at jamie securities but the relationship soured when 
boesky fingered mulheren and other alleged coconspirators as part 
of his plea bargain under which boesky pleaded guilty to one 
conspiracy charge spent two years in prison and paid 100 million 
to the government 
on thursday boesky revealed that he had deducted 50 million of 
the penalty from his 1986 income taxes that amount had been a 
repayment of the illegal profits he reaped from insider trading in 
1985 the other half of the penalty was a fine 
boesky lawyer charles davidow said he did not know whether the 
deduction taken as a capital expense was legal but he assumed 
boeskys tax attorneys or accountants had reviewed it at the time 
us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum allowed defense 
attorneys to discuss the deduction to attempt to show that the 
penalty was not as painful or expensive as it appeared 
although confirming the deduction boesky said he could not 
remember exactly how much he made in illegal profits in 1985 
puccio claimed illegal profits based on insider information from 
investment bankers dennis levine and martin siegel actually totaled 
187 million 
boesky again was temperamental under cross examination refusing 
to answer numerous questions unless he saw documentation to refresh 
his memory 
puccio asked him a dozen times whether he has revealed to the 
government all of the crimes he ever committed boesky said he 
revealed all the crimes he was required to tell under the plea 
bargain 
he said his net worth fell from at least 100 million in 1986 to 
nearly nothing when he was sentenced in late 1987 but he would not 
say whether he transferred his funds to his wife as puccio 
suggested 
i do not recally any financial activities of 1986 he said 
repeatedly 
he deflected puccios accusations that he was greedy saying 
that in 1986 in the midst of his downfall his holdings weighed on 
his mind less than you might think 
he also denied committing any wrongdoing with his money to avoid 
having to pay 1 billion in damages to parties that have sued him 
boesky said none of those lawsuits has been settled 
boesky did admit one violation in response to puccios question 
about whether he broke the law while in prison boesky said he 
violated a rule by paying someone else to do his laundry 
there were a couple of chaps who did laundry there and i gave 
them a few quarters to do my laundry he said 
boeskys testimony under cross examination only grazed over the 
charges against mulheren 
the government alleges mulheren manipulated the price of gulf amp 
western inc stock for boeskys benefit and held stock in unocal 
corp for boesky so the arbitrager could cheat on his taxes 
boesky implicated mulheren on those charges earlier in the week 
under direct examination by assistant us attorney e scott 
gilbert 
mulheren faces 41 charges of conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and recordkeeping violations 
the trial resumes tuesday with boeskys chief trader michael 
davidoff on the stand he testified briefly thursday afternoon 
saying he had met mulheren 10 or 15 years ago and had both a 
business and social relationship with him

new englands economy is in for another 18 
months of sluggish growth even though the regions credit crunch 
may be easing a panel of experts said 
legislators economists and bankers gathered at a symposium on 
the tightened credit market in the northeast agreed the worst may 
be over 
federal regulators have largely completed their intensive review 
of real estate lending in the region and the slowdown in lending 
caused by that review appears to be diminishing the participants 
said 
but wayne ayers chief economist of the bank of boston said 
thursday the end of the crunch does not mean that credit will 
automatically begin to flow freely again 
the economy in new england has been and i think will continue 
to be pretty soft for the next 18 months ayers said 
high wages and housing prices are discouraging businesses from 
moving into new england ayers said and commercial and residential 
construction fed by the boom years of the 1980s has far outpaced 
demand leading to a severe contraction of that industry 
the new england economy has yet to bottom ayers said 
there are no sleeping beauty industries out there that can 
realistically be expected to rejuvenate the regions economy 
the symposium was called to address the extent to which 
steppedup federal regulation in new england may be accelerating 
the regions economic slide 
that question remained unsettled but participants agreed that 
recent moves by the office of the comptroller of the currency the 
federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corp have eased 
the concerns of bankers 
rep barney frank dmass a member of the house banking 
committee said a meeting two weeks ago between the heads of those 
three federal regulatory agencies and the american bankers 
association was a key step in easing fears of a regulatory clamp on 
lending 
in that meeting the federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan along with the comptroller and the head of the fdic urged 
bankers to continue making loans to creditworthy customers 
i cant remember the last time the three top regulators 
thought it important to tell bankers to lend money that was at 
least implicit acknowledgement that things were too tight frank 
said the secretary of commerce does not meet with iacocca smith 
and whoever runs ford and say gee i think you guys should sell 
cars 
frank maguire deputy comptroller of the currency said the 
major purpose of that meeting was to thwart what the occ viewed as 
an overreaction by bankers to regulators 
frank disagreed saying there was strong evidence indicating 
that the occ was being overly strict in ordering new england banks 
to reclassify loans as nonperforming that step forces banks 
to add more money to their loan loss reserves money that might 
otherwise be loaned 
regardless of who was at fault for the credit crunch there was 
little doubt among the panelists that it had some downward impact 
on the economy 
in connecticut more than 80 percent of the 2000 businesses 
that responded to a survey sensed a shortage of available credit 
according to john rathgeber vice president of the connecticut 
business amp industry association 
more than 60 percent of those responding rathgeber said 
reported that they were unable to get credit on the same terms they 
had always enjoyed the problem was concentrated in the working 
capital area money loaned to help businesses maintain daytoday 
operations 
the unavailability of working capital has tremendous spinoff 
effects on the economy rathgeber said for connecticuts 
economy and for new englands economy we need access to credit 
markets

top corporate executives spend nearly three 
months a year writing letters memos and reports but waste much of 
the time because they cant get to the point according to a recent 
survey 
motivational systems of west orange which provides business 
writing and management training programs to corporations and 
government agencies said a survey of 200 corporate vice presidents 
found few knew how to write effectively 
its incredible how much time people spend on the rewriting of 
communication said roger flax president of motivational 
systems its costing america billions of dollars 
flax said much of the writing hes seen in 20 years as an 
instructor is too wordy poorly organized or confusing 
we have found that people have what we call blue book 
disease he said referring to the bluecover examination 
booklets that high schools and colleges use to administer tests 
what managers and executives do is they write to fill up a 
report and theyre not concise he said 
business writers should try to limit sentences to 15 words and 
paragraphs to four lines and avoid cliches flax said 
the problem is in the schools schools are not teaching 
conciseness he said the kids are getting so hung up on 
grammar that they cant put their thoughts on paper 
howard carroll a spokesman for the national education 
association in washington said blaming teachers for bad executive 
writing was ludicrous 
writing is not easy for anyone i think depending on what 
standards were talking about youll find most professional people 
do not write well he said 
christine kelly a professor of management communications at new 
york universitys graduate school of business administration said 
writing difficulties usually reflect more basic problems 
the problem the survey seems to be responding to is more 
fundamental than that its the ability to express yourself said 
ms kelly who also is director of the management communications 
department 
most of the students who apply to the business school have had 
at least five years of professional experience she said but their 
admissions essays reveal a lack of confidence in their writing 
theyve been told at work that theyre too verbose she 
said what i see in the writing is not well developed ideas 
which tells me they have problems expressing what theyre 
thinking 
ms kelly said writers should worry about getting their thoughts 
on paper the nipping and tucking can be saved for later 
writing is a craft and a skill and it can be developed she 
said the underlying problem is that you first have to get your 
ideas down you have to be able to write freely and comfortably 
flax who earned a bachelors degree in psychology from the 
university of maryland said poor writing in the workplace leads to 
lost productivity and sales low morale and job insecurity 
he suggests one way to write better is to write as you would 
speak 
conversational writing leads to more credibility and more 
conciseness he said 
another point is they should really proofread aloud if they 
proofread aloud theyll hear their mistakes he said 
if the thought of reading aloud is unsettling flax suggests a 
ruse pick up the phone and proofread to yourself

exports of essential oils the kind that 
smell and taste good rose to an alltime high last year says the 
agriculture department 
last years exports of essential oils reached nearly 144 
million a 17 percent increase over a year earlier and well above 
1987 exports of 114 million according to an annual report 
essential oils are obtained from natural raw materials by 
distillation or through a mechanical pressing process the oils are 
widely used in perfumes cosmetics and pharmaceutical products and 
to flavor food and soft drinks 
as income levels in foreign countries increase certainly the 
markets there will have an increase of these export items says 
rex dull of the deparments horticultural and tropical products 
division countries are utilizing more of them in their 
confectionary products and markets for them are growing rapidly in 
these countries 
in fact exports of peppermint oils increased by 22 percent to 
1510 tons with japan replacing the united kingdom as this 
countries largest export market for these oils us exports of 
orange oil were up 61 percent nearly doubling in value to 102 
million lemon exports also doubled yearearlier levels largely 
reflecting increased sales to japan and the united kingdom 
while exports of most essential oils increased us imports of 
the same products fell 12 percent from 1988 to 132 million the 
decline largely reflecting smaller imports of sandalwood vetiver 
nutmeg geranium and cassia oils and good crop yields by us 
farmers 
peppermint yields in midwest producing areas were well above the 
droughtdamaged levels in 1988 and prices have fallen accordingly 
but demand for peppermint oil continues strong which has kept 
prices from falling further despite the large 1989 harvest and 
prospects of another good outturn this year 
reversing a trend dating back to the 1960s consumers now favor 
natural flavorings over synthetic ingredients dull in a telephone 
interview thursday attributed this trend to the changing health 
habits of consumers 
in recent years people have become more health conscious and 
want to move toward consuming more natural flavored products he 
said people are afraid of what artificial flavoring will do to 
their bodies 
industry studies estimate that natural flavors now comprise 
threefourths of the us market and artificial flavors the 
balance whereas the reverse was true in the 1960s

mushroom growers have new hope in fighting 
their worst enemy flies 
a new natural organism might be the weapon to eliminate mushroom 
flies that threaten the 500 millionayear mushroom industry 
according to two agriculture department scientists they say the 
organism would allow growers to avoid using insecticides to 
eliminate the pests 
mushroom flies breed so quickly in mushroom beds that their 
increasing population usually requires growers to use insecticides 
to save the crops if not the flies lay their eggs in the compost 
that growers feed to mushrooms then the hatched fly larvae eat 
the mushrooms 
but the scientists say the organism steinernematid nematodes 
added to the mushroom bedding burrow down into the compost there 
these microscopic whiplike organisms devour fly larvae 
right now we can achieve 85 percent control of the flies by 
adding 600 steinernematids per square centimeter of compost about 
4000 per square inch says william nickle of the departments 
agricultural research service

a boost for soybeans and revisions in the 
governments sugar price protection program will be among the 
provisions in the 1990 farm bill going before the house 
the house agriculture committee approved a section of its bill 
thursday that put soybeans in a government subsidy program designed 
to cost taxpayers nothing 
the panel also voted for some changes in the sugar program that 
drew praise from producers and criticism from the manufacturers of 
candy and other sweets 
the house bill addresses the complex us sugar program in a 
manner that will benefit consumers producers and foreign quota 
holders said luther markwart chairman of the american sugar 
alliance 
thomas hammer president of the sweetener users association 
called the committees plan more outrageous than the current 
domestic sugar subsidy program that he said hurts consumers 
the government regulates prices by limiting the amount of 
imported sugar that can be sold in the united states the 
manufacturers of sweets say that drives prices up sugar cane 
sugar beet and corn sweetener producers say it stabilizes prices 
the house bill would 
maintain the current 18 cent loan rate with discretionary 
authority to increase it based on cost of production or other 
factors 
extend the term of the loan from six to nine months 
guarantee a minimum import level of 125 million tons 
provide for triggered mandatory domestic marketing allocations 
for cane and beet sugar to guarantee minimum imports if it looks 
like theyre falling below 125 million tons 
limit marketing of crystalline fructose to 200000 tons when 
marketing allocations are in effect 
create a reexport program that would allow poor 
sugarproducing countries like those in the caribbean and central 
america to sell us refiners raw cane at 7 cents over the world 
market level thus enabling refiners to sell the sugar on the world 
market 
make disaster payments to louisiana sugar producers whose 1990 
crop is severely damaged by the 1989 freeze 
the committees plan for soybeans is an effort to boost 
production without costing the government any money 
it gets the soybean producer into the program in a way that 
provides him with an insurance policy on his price said rep dan 
glickman dkan chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans 
and feed grains 
its not all the oilseed community may have wanted but its 
more than they could have expected said rep fred grandy riowa 
congressional economists say the plan wont cost the government 
because the loan rate of 525 to 551 a bushel is below the 
predicted market price in every year of the five years covered by 
the bill 
the government only bears a financial loss if it loans more 
money or guarantees higher prices than farmers get on the open 
market 
its a modest beginning said rep bill emerson rmo it 
brings to the commodity the recognition it deserves 
the house committee also voted to freeze target prices for wheat 
and feed grains at current levels but allow farmers a slight 
increase in that price if they cut back on the number of acres they 
plant 
that plan also was designed to comply with the tight budget 
constraints placed on the committee by house budget writers 
the target price would be 4 a bushel for wheat and 275 a 
bushel for feed grains 
the committee has been wrestling with efforts to improve soybean 
production since it began writing its farm bill earlier in the year 
the united states which used to lead the world in soybean 
production has fallen behind because government programs have made 
it more profitable for farmers who could grow soybeans to plant 
wheat or corn instead

the coast guard says it would rather not push 
for a greater us role in the safety of luxury cruise ships that 
carry 7 million passengers a year out of us ports 
coast guard commandant paul yost in a letter released thursday 
rejected national transportation safety board proposals that would 
give the us government more authority over ships that are 
usowned and carry mostly american passengers but are registered 
abroad 
while unilateral actions are tempting as an easy fix yost 
said i continue to believe that efforts through international 
channels must be the principal route to achieve improvements 
when a cruise ship is registered under a foreign flag it is not 
subject to us labor laws or safety regulations 
the letter to the ntsb agreed with some of the boards 
recommendations for improving cruise ship safety 
but yost said he favors pursuing most safety improvements 
through the international maritime organization since the rules 
then would apply to vessels worldwide and protect more americans 
to pursue a twotiered approach to passenger safety would not 
be in the interests of all our citizens he said the board had 
asked the coast guard to sponsor legislation to gain more authority 
over foreignregistered ships while also pursuing international 
agreements 
the board recommendations came in a report in october that 
proposed a stronger us role in ensuring the safety of cruise 
ships that operate out of us coastal cities it cited crews who 
speak no english a lack of life vests inadequate safety 
equipment unsafe ship designs and other problems 
the safety board said 264 people have died in cruise ship 
incidents or accidents over the past 25 years and more deaths 
could occur in the future 
yost acknowledged that foreignflagged vessels operating out of 
us ports require close monitoring and said some ships lack 
sufficient maintenance and crew training 
he said there are communication problems but rejected a board 
proposal for legislation requiring that 75 percent of crew members 
speak english if a ship operates in us waters 
this would be detrimental to our efforts at the international 
level yost said noting that the coast guard is pushing for 
international rules to improve crewpassenger communication 
yost also rejected an ntsb proposal that us safety 
investigators be given greater access and authority over incidents 
in international waters when they involve a foreign ship operating 
out of a us port 
accidents which occur aboard foreign vessels outside us 
territorial waters are as a matter of national sovereignty 
properly beyond our normal jurisdiction he said 
yost said however while i may disagree with some of the 
statements in your report i fully support the general notion that 
close attention needs to be paid to the safety of passengers 
traveling on cruise vessels 
legislative hearings on some of the ntsb proposals are scheduled 
next month

advocates battling for a cigarettefree society 
have begun a divestment campaign they compare to the one apartheid 
opponents used against south africa 
officials at the bostonbased tobacco divestment project said 
thursday they have begun pressuring hospitals universities and 
state retirement funds to sell their holdings in tobacco companies 
were hoping that much like the antiapartheid movement 
brought about a shift in the way south africa was viewed this 
will bring about a shift in the way tobacco companies are viewed 
said patrick reynolds whose grandfather founded rj reynolds 
tobacco co and died of smokingrelated emphysema 
the antismoking campaign recently appears to have gained 
momentum health secretary louis sullivans called thursday for a 
ban on cigarette vending machines harvard university and city 
university of new york said recently they would sell all stock in 
companies that manufacture tobacco products 
sullivan testifying before the senate finance committee also 
proposed creating a licensing system for tobacco retailers and 
establishing penalties for those who sell cigarettes to minors 
the world conference on lung health at a meeting here issued 
resolutions that included a call for the international community to 
sever all forms of support to the tobacco industry 
we believe all this will really tighten the vice around 
tobacco firms said brad krevor the divestment projects 
executive director 
krevor said the projects 12member board and grassroots 
activists around the country are asking institutions to reexamine 
their investment portfolios and where necessary sell 
inappropriate holdings 
we will no longer allow the predatory marketing practices of 
these tobacco companies to continue he said 
george knox a spokesman for philip morris cos said the 
tobacco maker was aware of the divestment effort but far from 
panicked 
we are not sitting here biting our fingernails he said in a 
telephone interview from new york but clearly we are not 
unconcerned with the issue 
he said investors buy and sell stock based on a variety of 
criteria but that so far weve still had a healthy market in our 
stock and expect that to continue 
krevor health and life insurers would be a particular project 
target because they offer breaks for nonsmokers while 
simultaneously investing funds from policies in tobacco stocks 
we certainly are holding tobacco company stocks but i havent 
found anyone interested in talking about the divestment project at 
this time said charles mcgillicuddy a spokesman for john 
hancock mutual life insurance co in boston 
krevor said he was optimistic that targeted stockholders would 
be receptive to the divestment campaign because in many cases 
people dont even know they have tobacco holdings 
in his may 18 announcement harvard president derek bok wrote 
that the schools board was motivated by a desire not to be 
associated with companies engaged in significant sales of 
products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to 
other human beings 
divestment project officials who launched their campaign here 
may 10 said beyond applying financial pressure they hoped to sway 
legislators toward higher tobacco taxes and a ban on cigarette 
advertising 
cigarettes health officials say cause about 390000 premature 
deaths annually from lung cancer heart disease and other 
cardiovascular disorders

amtrak trains are unaffected by president 
bushs veto of a bill authorizing 2 billion in spending for the 
passenger rail service the presidents objection deals with a 
provision on who can buy railroads 
it was bushs first veto of 1990 he returned 10 bills to 
congress in his first year in office last year congress has yet to 
override a bush veto 
amtrak spokesman clifford black said the veto would not affect 
daily train operations because the railroad is working with money 
that congress already had appropriated for 19891992 
bush took issue with a provision that would require the 
interstate commerce commission to approve the acquisition of 
railroads by nonrailroad companies 
this requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the 
financial restructuring of the railroad industry bush told 
congress in a veto message thursday 
the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter line 
between washington dc and its northern virginia suburbs black 
said the bill contained technical provisions necessary for the 
project to open 
the legislation sent to bush may 10 would authorize a new 
threeyear government subsidy of 2 billion to amtrak the national 
rail passenger service actual spending levels are set by separate 
appropriations bills 
black said amtrak supports the provision that prompted bushs 
veto although it applies only to private freight railroads 
the spokesman said amtrak relies on private freight lines for 
its tracks outside the northeast corridor and does support icc 
oversight of takeovers of railroads by nonrailroad companies 
bush attributed the rejuvenation of the rail industry since 
1980 largely to an easing of burdensome federal regulations he 
said the amtrak bill would reverse that trend 
the bill contains an unprecedented new regulatory review 
requirement and represents a step backward for the entire rail 
industry bush said 
he said the additional regulation would interfere with the 
ability of the nations largest freight railroads to obtain needed 
capital or to change existing capital structure 
the provision also would impose a new barrier to any attempted 
takeover of a rail line by the carriers own management or 
employees bush said 
the president said existing law provides adequate protection of 
the public interest in rail acquisitions 
bush administration officials had complained earlier that the 
bill amounted to a government subsidy of about 29 a passenger 
however bush did not refer to the measures cost in his veto 
message 
a presidential veto can be overridden only by twothirds 
majorities of both the house and senate rather than try to 
override the amtrak veto congress more likely will remove the 
provision that bush finds objectionable and return the modified 
bill to the white house for his signature

if these winstons didnt taste good like a 
cigarette should it could be because they were counterfeited in 
cuba 
three men including a former rj reynolds tobacco co 
engineer were convicted wednesday of violating export laws and the 
us trade embargo against cuba by shipping equipment to the island 
to make imitation winstons 
they exported a cartonstuffing machine cigarettewrapping 
equipment red and gold ink and other items through panama to cuba 
where the fake winstons were manufactured for export according to 
prosecutors 
it should be a big embarassment for cuba said keith prager 
who supervises the investigating us customs unit this case 
shows how desperate the cuban government is that they are down to 
counterfeiting cigarettes 
customs officials heard about the scheme after a tip on some 
equipment shipments in march 1989 and the discovery of 1800 cases 
of cubanmade winstons in the netherlands in august 
prosecutors claimed that sales of the american cigarettes could 
have made 2 million for cubas foreign exchangestarved economy 
it wasnt clear whether any of the cigarettes were eventually sold 
convicted after a nine day trial were former rj reynolds 
engineering foreman michael macko emilio ortiz de zevallos the 
peruvian director of a panamanian export company and frank van 
ameringen who ran several small tobacco companies from his home in 
miami 
they face prison terms of 15 to 21 months us district judge 
lenore nesbitt set sentencing for july 23 
de zevallos attorney michael tarkoff said the federal 
government was in effect making a civil matter into a criminal 
prosecution 
these are regulatorytype crimes civil actions he said 
the lawyer said the government never proved the men intended to 
violate the laws they were charged under

the airline industry is screaming 
like pigs to slaughter over a bill that would create the nations 
first stateowned airline to ferry passengers on cheap california 
flights the sponsor says 
the measure proposing golden state air will be considered by the 
state senate next month but democratic sen art torres isnt 
optimistic 
the chances are tough he said thursday going up against 
the airline industry has not been an easy task 
the air transport association of america an industry group 
opposes the 1cent per gallon jet fuel tax torres has proposed to 
pay for the 13 million to 28 million startup cost of the 
governmentrun airline 
the group had taken a neutral stance on the bill until it was 
amended last monday to include the fuel tax which could cost the 
industry 24 million to 30 million a year commercial air carriers 
currently are exempt from jet fuel taxes in california 
now theyre screaming like pigs to slaughter torres said of 
the airlines theyre afraid were going to be competitive 
torres said he has received overwhelming support from businesses 
upset over seemingly irrational fares for commercial flights within 
california 
he said people who regularly fly on business have been mailing 
him advertisements for 160 fares to florida and complaining about 
400 to 500 costs for a roundtrip between los angeles and 
sacramento 
they just cant believe that it costs more for a onehour 
business trip that it does to fly to washington dc torres 
said 
he blamed federal deregulation of the industry for allowing 
large airlines to swallow smaller companies that operated instate 
commuter flights 
the state public utilities commission said in december that 
rates for flights within california increased an average of more 
than 40 percent between 1979 and 1989 after adjustments for 
inflation 
the air transport association disputes those figures the 
industry group claims that most californians are satisfied with 
airline service and that average california air fares dropped 
between 1980 and 1988 when adjusted for inflation

truck traffic resumed across the 
canadianus border after canadas transport minister persuaded 
drivers to end their blockade and automakers began reopening 
plants shut by parts shortages 
chrysler corp recalled 3200 workers to its windsor minivan 
plant today after independent canadian truckers lifted a blockade 
of the ambassador bridge a major supply route for usmade auto 
parts 
the situation is looking better by the hour said chrysler 
canada spokesman walter mccall the flow of materials has been 
restored and the likelihood is good that workers will be on their 
full shifts today 
but truckers at some other southern ontario border points 
including fort erie across the niagara river from buffalo ny 
and niagara falls remained snarled late thursday 
trucks still were blocking a lane of the lewistonqueenston 
bridge at niagara falls allowing only cars to pass state police 
said 
trucks were not being allowed across the peace bridge linking 
buffalo and fort erie and about 100 to 200 trucks were parked on 
each side of the span bridge officials said 
in windsor the blockade of 300 trucks strangled traffic 
wednesday and part of thursday on the span between windsor and 
detroit but gave way to a steady stream of trucks moving in a 
single lane by thursday evening 
the work stoppage was lifted after canadian transport minister 
doug lewis said he would take up with the cabinet the truckers 
complaints about taxes and the freetrade agreement with the united 
states 
i am pleased to have had the opportunity to learn directly 
from them their concerns about what they consider to be an unlevel 
playing field he said 
lewis met thursday morning in windsor with a delegation led by 
wayne whitney a protest organizer and bill wrye ontario minister 
of transportation 
about 5 pm thursday the crowd of protesters dispersed 
apparently pleased with the agreement said windsor police staff 
sgt r nichols 
there were about 200 people and another 100 to 150 trucks 
there but the truckers were happy got into their trucks and drove 
away nichols said 
a sign thanking us truckers for their support during the 
blockade hung at an intersection where truckers had congregated 
during the strike 
the protest was sparked by proposed increases in canadas goods 
and services tax that will affect the goods that truckers haul as 
well as the tires insurance and diesel fuel they buy 
the uscanadian trade agreement which will remove almost all 
tariffs by 1999 will further handicap canadian truckers 
protesters said 
the truckers said taxes and the freetrade agreement are 
crippling their ability to compete with us drivers 
the blockade also forced the shutdown of three general motors of 
canada ltd plants in ontario and production cutbacks at one in 
quebec some 13000 auto workers were affected production also was 
disrupted at ford of canada 
ford plants closed early thursday in dearborn and wayne mich 
lorain and avon ohio louisville and minneapolis said company 
spokesman peter olsen 
at mazda motor corps plant in flat rock mich 20 miles south 
of detroit workers went home early wednesday and thursday said 
spokesman tom mcdonald 
protesters also had blocked the truck lanes at the canadian end 
of the blue water bridge between sarnia and port huron mich 
while in sault ste marie supervisor jim blain at the 
international bridge said he received conflicting reports about the 
work stoppage 
at fort erie about 200 trucks jammed the approaches to the 
international peace bridge to buffalo ny at blackpool quebec 
just across the border from champlain ny a heavily armed squad 
of police persuaded quebec truckers to dismantle their blockade 
thursday morning 
no violence was reported at any of the blockaded border points

first they shed their shoes and socks next 
came the shirts then the street vendors more than 200 of them 
removed their trousers 
they stood in their underwear outside the municipal assembly 
building to protest police harassment their flabby bellies and 
calluses testifying to lifetimes of hard work and bad food one 
woman was in the group 
we wanted the authorities to reflect on what those naked 
bodies represented in terms of unemployment health problems of 
vulnerability one of the leaders luciano jimeno huanosta said 
after the stripin 
it was a startling tactic in this conservative society but the 
vendors were desperate before the protest in april police 
responding to shopkeeper complaints had blocked their turf for days 
and the vendors couldnt work 
more than five hours after the disrobing city officials agreed 
to withdraw the police the unconventional tactic worked but was 
only one maneuver in an increasingly bitter conflict between 
mexicos formal and informal economies 
the war between shopkeepers and vendors is a symptom of a sick 
economy 
an estimated 40 percent of mexican workers are unemployed or 
underemployed a million new jobs a year are needed just to keep up 
with population growth 
for many especially the very young and very old there is no 
choice but making a living on the streets 
if they want to get vendors off the streets they have to 
create jobs said federico garcia hernandez 29 a 
secondgeneration street salesman 
street vendors always have been part of mexico but their 
numbers have risen steadily since serious economic problems began 
in 1982 
the national chamber of commerce in mexico city which has done 
studies on the informal economy for three years estimates the 
capital has 200000 street vendors if they keep increasing it 
says vendors will outnumber regular merchants in a few years 
the main field of battle is the heart of mexico city a 
440squareblock labyrinth of commerce colonial churches aztec 
ruins cantinas and cafes known simply as el centro 
you can buy anything in el centro from a stuffed twoheaded 
calf to the dried powdered encapsulated skin of rattlesnakes to 
the latest vcr 
it has streets of shops that sell lingerie and lace other 
streets that sell lights spare parts sporting goods housewares 
you can buy from shops behind walls encrusted with layers of 
handbills or on curbsides so old they are worn down to street level 
its cheaper on the street 
on foreign goods they can undercut us by almost 50 percent 
said shopkeeper alberto gaona they dont pay the 20 percent 
import tax and they dont pay the 15 percent value added tax and 
id estimate that 70 to 85 percent of their goods are foreign 
the shopkeepers who must pay utility bills rent salaries and 
taxes say the vendors are driving them out of business 
we have dead zones now areas where all the merchants have 
shut down said guillermo gazal jafif founder of procentrico a 
group of downtown merchants its a direct attack on the formal 
economy 
procentrico estimates 30000 street salesmen are competing in el 
centro with 12000 established merchants merchants have pestered 
city hall for more than a year to evict the vendors who clog the 
areas narrow streets 
the vendors have resisted with demonstrations sitins 
petitions and the nowfamous disrobing 
there have been vague promises that the dispute would be 
resolved but no action other than sporadic police sweeps against 
vendors 
both vendors and merchants agree on the reasons for inaction 
street vendors are a lucrative source of bribes and payoffs and 
part of the political machinery of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party known as the pri 
an elaborate system of payoffs is run by leaders of vendor 
unions 
more than 50 such unions are said to operate in el centro alone 
all but a few are formally affiliated with the pri the chamber of 
commerce says and the occasional crackdowns are almost always on 
independents 
vendors and merchants say the minimum payment by a vendor is 
10000 pesos a day about 3 which buys a piece of turf free of 
harassment by policemen or competitors the union leader keeps part 
of the money and uses the rest for bribes 
the acknowledged queenpin of the priaffiliated vendors is a 
hefty woman named guillermina rico who can muster as many as 
18000 vendors for party rallies and is said to have a swiss bank 
account 
mrs rico 54 operates from a warehouse crammed with video 
recorders and other electronics behind an anonymous iron door at 
the teeming la merced market the walls are hung with photos of her 
with presidents and mayors and other party luminaries 
the chamber of commerce says union leaders collected an 
estimated 22 billion pesos in payoffs in 1988 about 1 million at 
the prevailing exchange rate 
it has proposed dismantling the system and using the money to 
build markets where the vendors could set up shop procentrico also 
favors building markets 
the vendors exist because of a deteriorating economy official 
corruption and politics said sergio rios lara one of 
procentricos directors 
things cant continue like this mexico is in a era of change 
things cant keep working like they used to

campbell soup co said today it plans to 
sell several of its european food units in an effort to focus on 
its more profitable businesses 
on the auction block are d lazzaroni amp c spa of italy 
campbell seafoods division which operates in the united kingdom 
and belgium the vegetable division of campbell foods plc in 
england and campbell irish foods ltd and mallow foods ltd both 
of ireland 
the latter three companies were acquired when campbell took over 
freshbake foods group plc of britain in 1988 total sales of all 
the businesses to be sold exceed 200 million the company said 
campbell whose board of directors approved the divestiture on 
thursday said it expected the sale to result in a 55 million 
charge against fourth quarter earnings 
the result will be a more focused european enterprise 
delivering stronger operating profits along with superior returns 
and cash generation campbell chief executive david w johnson 
said in a statement 
he noted that campbell is committed to rebuild the frozen 
convenience food operation which promises international synergy 
and longterm potential 
campbell has faced increasing problems over the past year and 
has been frequently rumored as a takeover target because of its 
sluggish performance and depressed stock price some members of the 
founding family have urged a sale of the entire company 
the firm has sought to remain independent by divesting 
underperforming businesses and closing plants cutting costs and 
laying off hundreds of workers 
the companies to be divested have excellent positions in their 
respective markets that should make them attractive to a number of 
prospective buyers officials said 
lazzaroni based on saronno makes premium biscuits and seasonal 
cakes under the lazzaroni and borsari trademarks but the unit has 
suffered from operating losses 
the uk vegetable division has a 20 percent share of the frozen 
green vegetable market in britain while irish foods holds a 42 
percent market share in ireland its sister company mallow foods 
is a leading supplier of dehydrated vegetables with a 25 percent 
share of the european market in dried peas

sales of existing homes fell 21 percent in 
april their third drop in four months as they continued to lose 
momentum due to high mortgage rates a real estate trade group 
reported today 
the national association of realtors said resales of 
singlefamily homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
333 million units down from the march rate of 340 million 
existing home sales hit their 1989 peak of 356 million units in 
november and december and then fell in january february and april 
sales were unchanged in march 
according to the federal home loan mortgage crop rates ranged 
from 1025 percent to 1056 percent during april they had dipped 
to 1033 percent by today 
john a tuccillo realtors chief economist said the high rates 
are keeping many prospective buyers out of the market in hopes of 
future rate declines 
but despite the cost of mortgages the sluggish northeast market 
posted the only gain in april sales rose 40 percent to 520000 
units in what the realtors president norman d flynn called a 
buyers market caused by supply exceeding demand 
sales slipped 11 percent to 900000 units in the midwest and 
dropped 37 percent to 131 million units in the south but they 
plummeted 79 percent to 580000 homes in the west 
the realtors said the national median price for an existing home 
in april was 95300 down 10 percent from march but up 26 
percent from april 1989 the median price means half of the homes 
cost more half less 
the median price fell in all regions it was down 54 percent to 
140700 in the northeast down 49 percent to 134900 in the 
west down 24 percent to 75300 in the midwest and off 03

a discount retailer laden with takeoverrelated 
debt taps the junk bond market to raise 300 million 
that may sound like just another tale from the easymoney days 
of the 1980s but the deal took place last week notwithstanding 
the current talk of a credit crunch and the death of the junk 
market 
the fact that the caldor discount chain was able to raise a 
hefty sum to refinance existing debt showed that some investors 
still have appetites for noninvestment grade credits bankers say 
caldor and most other recent junk issuers have had to raise 
their funds via private placements rather than in the public bond 
market however theyve also had to structure their financing 
deals more conservatively with tighter covenants to lure buyers 
the buyers are really in the drivers seat said john 
crotty a highyield bond specialist at first boston corp for 
insurance companies and other big institutions willing to buy junk 
they can really tailor the bonds that they are buying 
so far this year only four borrowers have made public offerings 
of junk bonds to raise a total of just 382 million said david 
unger who tracks the highyield market for first boston 
in the same period last year before the bankruptcy filing of 
campeau corps retailing arms and the collapse of drexel burnham 
lambert inc virtually shut down the market the total exceeded 11 
billion 
for all intents and purposes the public market is dead 
said anthony napolitano who tracks private placements at mccarthy 
crisanti amp maffei 
so caldor looked for financing in the private junk market which 
at an estimated 170 billion is nearly as large as the public 
market 
caldor was taken private last october when a group of investors 
that included management and the investment bank donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette securities corp bought the discount chain from may 
department stores co in a 552 million debtfinanced deal known as 
a leveraged buyout 
garrett moran a managing director of dlj said the bank sat 
down with insurance companies pension funds mutual funds and 
japanese institutions to hammer out longterm financing to replace 
the buyout groups temporary bridge loan 
the result was a threepart deal 160 million of senior 
floating rate 7year notes paying interest of 2 percentage points 
over the london interbank rate 40 million of 7year 12 percent 
senior notes and 100 million of 10year subordinated notes paying 
interest of 15 percent and carrying 7year warrants to buy 12 
percent of caldors equity 
it took a month to hammer out the deal and sell it to about 50 
institutions moran said compared to the two to three weeks it 
used to take to launch a public bond issue caldor also had to 
include stricter covenants and include equity warrants unlike the 
heydays of the junk market he said still it got the money 
it shows that reasonable deals can get done in good size 
moran said 
in recent weeks bankers say more than 1 billion in deals have 
been done for borrowers such as the furniture company ethan allen 
inc drug chain operator jack eckerd corp and multimedia corp 
the publishing and broadcasting company 
hal guenther senior vice president who handles private 
placements at kemper financial services said the private market 
could be capable of absorbing a couple hundred million worth of 
bonds a week whats more borrowers can save money because they 
dont have to pay the hefty underwriting fees of a public issue he 
says 
guenther says his company hasnt found any of the recent deals 
attractive enough to buy but he welcomed the trend toward giving 
bondholders better protection against default and away from 
notorious features like payinkind bonds and coupon resets 
homer rees president of prudential capital corp agrees terms 
are becoming more realistic than a few years ago especially when 
equity options are included as in caldors deal he said 
people are being paid more commensurately with the risks that 
are being taken he says

general motors corp will begin making cars in 
east germany later this year company chairman roger smith said 
today as he addressed shareholders at his last gm annual meeting 
if gm starts production as planned in october the worlds 
largest corporation will become the first us automaker to make 
vehicles in the region undergoing rapid political and economic 
reform 
smith who retires july 31 after 9 years as head of gm said 
the company will make opel vectra cars for sale in europe under a 
joint venture with east germanys automobilewerke eisenach 
the company will assemble about 10000 of the cars this year 
production of the fourdoor sedans about the same size as the 
chevrolet cavalier is expected to increase to about 150000 
annually by the mid1990s gm spokesman jack harned said 
chysler corp has planned a joint venture to make minivans in 
austria ford motor co is studying vehicle assembly plans in east 
germany but has yet to announce any specific plans 
automobilewerkes factory in eisenach currently makes the 
wartburg automobile harned said production of the vectra will be a 
separate operation 
its not gm taking over wartburg he noted gm currently 
makes the vector in russelsheim west germany 
smith said the joint venture with automobilewerke is the first 
step of gms new europe strategy in addition to making cars 
gm will begin building engines and assembling a small number of 
cars in hungary by early 1992 
during smiths tenure gms share of the us car and truck 
market fell to about 36 percent from about 44 percent 
also at the meeting gm shareholders voted to double the 
pensions of 3350 top executives by changing the formula for 
calculating them from one that considers salary alone to one that 
bases pension on both salary and bonuses of 503 million 
shareholder votes 833 percent favored the proposal 
smith weathered some personal attacks during debate including 
opposition from corporate gadfly evelyn davis of washington 
roger in due respect to you you dont need this type of a 
pension she said 
the proposal also had been opposed by michigan state treasurer 
robert bowman who administers 88 million shares about 1 percent 
of outstanding stock through five pension funds 
the proposal would cost about 42 million annually bowman has 
said there are better uses for the money including product 
development further plant modernization and beefing up an 
underfunded pension plan for other employees 
bowman said before the meeting he would ask incoming chairman 
robert stempel to reject any such approved increase

computertriggered selling on the chicago 
futures markets helped cause the sharp loss in the value of shares 
on the new york stock exchange last oct 13 federal regulators say 
index arbitrage and other program selling significantly 
accelerated and exacerbated the market decline the securities 
and exchange commissions division of market regulation said in a 
report the report was presented to the house commerce finance 
subcommittee on thursday 
the dow jones industrial average lost 19058 points or 691 
percent of its value on oct 13 overall the nations securities 
markets lost 190 billion in value including 160 billion in the 
last 90 minutes of trading on the next business day monday oct 
16 another selloff was followed by a sharp upswing in heavy 
trading before the markets stabilized 
the investigators found a large number of futures sales by 
speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange during critical 
times on oct 13 cme floor traders did not provide net liquidity 
to the market the report said 
given current market and regulatory structures there can be 
no assurance that the extraordinary volatility of oct 13 and 16 
will not be repeated or surpassed in the future the 
investigators concluded 
the report said a circuit breaker mechanism that was 
developed after the 1987 stock market crash may have slowed the 
market decline last year the mechanism which temporarily limits 
price swings was imposed after a 12point drop in the price of a 
standard amp poors basket of futures 
imposition of the circuit breaker coincided with a steep decline 
in the level of program selling on the new york stock exchange and 
a reduction in the rate of the price decline in nyse stocks the 
report said 
while a direct causal relationship is difficult to establish 
at a minimum the divisions findings do not indicate any harm to 
the markets attributable to the imposition of the circuitbreaker 
mechanisms the report said 
the sec and the bush administration have been pressing congress 
to give the sec authority to regulate stockindex futures the 
commodity futures trading commission now regulates such trading

high mortgage rates continued to dampen sales 
of existing homes through much of the nation in april although the 
northeast posted its first gain since last fall a real estate 
trade group said friday 
the national association of realtors said overall resales of 
singlefamily homes slipped 21 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 333 million units it was the third drop in four 
months as mortgage rates remained in double digits sales were 
unchanged in march 
the federal home loan mortgage crop said rates ranged from 
1025 percent to 1056 percent in april they had dipped back to 
1033 percent by friday 
rates also have affected sales of new homes which fell for four 
consecutive months through march the commerce department will 
release the april sales figures wednesday 
although mortgage costs remained high sales of existing homes 
in the northeast increased for the first time since october 
purchasers bought at an annual rate of 520000 units in april up 4 
percent from the 500000 units sold the previous month 
norman d flynn realtors president said inventories have risen 
while prices have fallen and the buyers market caused by supply 
exceeding demand attracted buyers despite the high rates 
the median price of an existing home in the northeast was down 
54 percent to 140700 compared to the national median of 
95300 the median price means half of the homes cost more half 
less

continental airlines employees who lost wages 
and benefits in 1983 when the company was allowed to reject its 
labor contracts are entitled to damages a federal appeals court 
said friday 
but the 5th circuit court of appeals rejected the employee 
unions contention that the bankruptcy court judge who originally 
ruled in the matter should have removed himself from the case 
shortly after his ruling judge t glover roberts accepted a 
partnership in the law firm that represented continental 
roberts risked an appearance of impropriety when he accepted the 
position the appeals court said but the judges said the job was 
offered after roberts had ruled in the case 
glover had ruled in favor of continental in rejecting employees 
claims for future wages and benefits the unions had claimed they 
were entitled to wages and benefits they would have received if 
their labor contracts hadnt been dumped when continental filed 
chapter 11 bankruptcy papers in 1983 
the employees kept working under emergency work rules approved 
by the bankruptcy court 
recognizing that the agreements here at issue do not guarantee 
employment we hold that the difference between the wages and 
benefits set out in the agreements and the wages and benefits 
actually paid under the emergency work rules are recoverable as 
unsecured claims to the extent that work would have been available 
had the agreements not been rejected the appeals court said 
the court sent the case to the bankruptcy court to determine 
when continental would have had to cease operations had it not 
cancelled the contracts and to calculate appropriate damages

corn futures prices rose strongly friday on the 
chicago board of trade extending the gains of the two previous 
sessions amid rain forecasts that threaten to further delay 
planting progress in the midwest 
other grain and soybean futures also advanced 
forecasts for scattered showers corn belt through the memorial 
day weekend and well into next week overwhelmed everything else 
in the market friday said victor lespinasse an assistant vice 
president in the grain trading division of dean witter reynolds inc 
about 20 percent of the nations corn crop remains to be 
planted lespinasse said and if farmers dont get the seed in the 
ground within the next 10 days yield losses are likely 
that propect was reflected in steeper losses in the contracts 
for delivery of corn from the upcoming crop than in the july 
contract which represents the last of the oldcrop corn 
the pattern was reversed in the soybean market reflecting the 
possibility that farmers will plant soybeans on acres they had 
planned to sow with corn 
indications of strong export sales of us grains supported all 
the markets analysts said 
at the close wheat futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 330 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 5 cents higher with july at 284 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 154 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cents to 4 cents higher with july at 620 a bushel

the owners of ms magazine say reader response 
to their plans to resurrect the publication without advertising was 
strong enough to proceed but they have delayed its reappearance 
until late july 
the 17yearold feminist magazine suspended publication last 
december because of heavy losses and a sharp decline in advertising 
in march plans were announced to resume publication without ads 
starting in june but andrea kaplan a spokeswoman for the 
magazine said thursday that the relaunch date now has been set for 
july 31 
she blamed the delay on a lot of launch details that must be 
addressed 
lang communications inc a new yorkbased company that acquired 
ms last fall previously said that barring ads from the magazine 
would free writers to pursue topics without worrying about how 
advertisers might react 
but magazine executives indicated earlier this year that 
resumption of publishing would depend on getting enough people sign 
up for subscriptions which were set at 40 a year more than 
double the previous 16 rate 
the magazine will appear six times a year down from 10 
previously 
ms kaplan declined to say how many people have signed up for 
subscriptions 
she said chairman dale lang and other magazine executives met 
two weeks ago and decided to proceed she said the subscription 
response was close to their projections and that it was 
particularly strong from young women just out of college 
industry analysts warned that it would be difficult to generate 
enough revenue from circulation alone to be profitable 
particularly because many other magazines have taken up some of the 
topics on which ms built its franchise with feminists 
but lang hired noted feminist author robin morgan as its new 
editor in chief and she has said the magazine will address topics 
that have not been explored fully enough in womens magazines 
she has cited as examples stories on the role of women in the 
upheavals in eastern europe homeless women and violence against 
women the magazine also will feature fiction and poetry from women 
and investigative reporting 
ms founder gloria steinem helped drum up support for the 
relaunch writing a pitch for the magazine that was included in a 
march mailing to about 600000 potential subscribers people 
including those who had been subscribing to ms when publication 
was suspended 
ms kaplan said the magazine is continuing to solicit 
subscriptions and expects a total circulation of less than 
100000 
she said lang expects to break even on the publication for the 
first year without advertising

rh macy amp co incs cash flow crucial to the 
companys ability to reduce its heavy debt rose 4 percent during 
the retailers third quarter a spokesman said friday 
based on preliminary results macys cash flow its earnings 
before interest taxes and depreciation rose to 1602 million 
from 154 million a year earlier spokesman jim fingeroth said 
the company suffered a net loss in the quarter which ended 
april 28 of 631 million down from 641 million a year earlier 
final figures for the quarter were expected to be released in 
midjune 
the news followed months of concern about the companys 
financial health and was welcomed by investors who bid up the 
price of macys junk bonds friday 
the company which remains saddled with debt after a 36 
billion leveraged buyout in 1986 is dependent on its cash flow to 
pay its bills 
investors have been concerned about macys results since the 
company suffered a 39 million loss in its second quarter 
the second quarter included the critical christmas shopping 
season a time when retailers expect to earn as much as half their 
annual profit but this past christmas macy was forced to take 
heavy markdowns on its merchandise to compete with campeau corps 
department stores and its profits vanished 
the campeau units also struggling after billiondollar buyouts 
had slashed their prices to bring in sales in an unsuccessful 
attempt to avoid a bankruptcy court filing 
macys creditors also have been concerned about the retailers 
financial state on thursday heller financial corp a company 
that lends money to macy suppliers said it was reconsidering its 
standards for financing shipments to the retailer 
macys junk bonds fell sharply thursday in response to hellers 
announcement but the issues recovered some ground friday

anheuserbusch inc said friday it was ending 
production of la the brewers poorselling reducedalcohol beer 
that apparently lost its niche and could not find a new one 
the beer with about half the alcohol of regular beer was 
introduced six years ago as the first response from a major brewer 
to the trend toward more responsible drinking las slogan was 
for the way you live your life todayla 
but the trend la tried to ride ended up spelling its demise 
analysts said 
on friday anheuserbusch executives said they were getting rid 
of the la brand because they didnt want the beer to take sales 
away from its new noalcohol beer odouls 
it was clear to us that the two brands came to compete for 
essentially the same consumer segment said jim hunter vice 
president of sales for the st louisbased brewer and it became 
clear that odouls was emerging as the consumers choice 
hunter said odouls which was introduced nationally earlier 
this year has exceeded sales projections by more than 30 percent 
he said the company plans to increase production of the beer once 
la production ends june 30 
other nonalcoholic beers including miller brewing cos 
sharps and pabsts na brand also are starting to get more room on 
store shelves around the country 
some analysts said friday that the demise of la would not 
necessarily mean the new noalcohol brews were doomed 
odouls and other noalcohol brews are considered a clear 
alternative to regular beer not a halfstep like la 
the beer drinker either wants the regular beer or the lower 
calorie beer or no alcohol at all said julie niemann of stifel 
nicolaus amp co inc in st louis this was a 
neitherfishnorfowl kind of thing 
robert weinberg professor of marketing management at washington 
university and a beer industry consultant said it was not 
enough of an alternative it seemed like a hybrid product sort of 
a compromise 
weinberg said he drank la occasionally at a restaurant near his 
office until the restaurant stopped stocking the beer because he 
was the only customer requesting it 
the demand was indeed small even though it was marketed 
aggressively weinberg said so i think it was a matter of 
time 
la beer never was a highly popular product for anheuserbusch 
in 1984 la sales totaled about 300000 barrels a fraction of 
the 80 million barrels of beer anheuserbusch company makes 
annually according to industry estimates sales steadily fell and 
were about 20000 barrels for all of 1989 analysts said 
anheuserbusch did not expect either la or odouls to be big 
sellers one analyst said 
both la and odouls are meant not only to be profit makers 
but in my opinion they have been introduced to fill a social 
need said george thompson of prudentialbache in new york 
i think that in that context the company really isnt 
terribly concerned that they make a lot of money the point is to 
provide an alternative 
thompson said las failure indicated consumers were not that 
interested in having an alternative to regular beer 
the fault lies here not with anheuserbusch but with the 
consumers thompson said anheuserbusch knows how to sell 
beer if theres a willing consumer base if there isnt a willing 
consumer base then even the good lord couldnt sell it

treasury security prices closed lower friday 
after a series of reports that spelled bad news for the bond 
market including consumer spending figures that were rosier than 
analysts had expected 
the governments bellwether 30year bond which lost 716 point 
thursday fell another point or about 625 per 1000 face 
amount its yield which rises when prices fall rose to 866 
percent from 861 percent late thursday 
trading was extremely light due to the long memorial day weekend 
analysts said the market was affected by the governments report 
that consumer spending increased by 06 percent in april the 
largest increase since it rose 12 percent in january the increase 
was seen as a good indication of future economic growth 
traders had been expecting an increase of about 04 percent 
said mike casey international economist at maria ramirez capital 
consultants inc bond prices usually decline on signs of economic 
improvement because it decreases the likelihood that the federal 
reserve board will ease interest rates 
casey said the market also soured as the treasury announced 
plans to sell 12 billion in cash management bills wednesday to 
raise new cash 2 billion more than expected an increase in the 
supply of a security often causes prices to fall 
in addition analysts said the market was affected by weak 
bidding in thursdays auction of 85 billion in fiveyear treasury 
notes as well as the dollars sharp drop against the japanese yen 
in european trading early friday 
there wasnt any tremendous blow but just a series of small 
unfortunate things that happened over the course of the day 
casey said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell from 332 point to lsqb point intermediate 
maturities fell from lsqb point to 1732 point and longterm issues 
dropped point according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 314 to 114799 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell lsqb point to 91 932 the average yield 
to maturity rose to 754 percent from 753 percent late thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 799 percent as the 
discount rose 7 basis points to 774 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 816 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 
774 percent yields on oneyear bills increased to 822 percent as 
the discount rose 8 basis points to 766 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 516 percent unchanged 
from late thursday

have reflected the surge in demand that usually accompanies the 
summer driving season which unofficially begins with memorial day 
natural gas prices declined the july contract fell to 1592 
per 1000 cubic feet from 1600 thursday 
beutel said trading in each of the energy futures categories was 
volatile and active at times during the session but he said prices 
were driven mostly by technical factors including the reluctance 
of traders to hold vulnerable positions in the market over a 
threeday weekend

national semiconductor corp said 
friday it signed a pact with nec corp to sell one of the japanese 
companys leading edge computer memory chips and explore deals in 
marketing manufacturing and technology 
the initial agreement between the two electronic giants covers 
tokyobased necs highvolume sram chips a static random access 
memory device with 256000 bytes of memory 
this agreement broadens our memory products portfolio to 
include sram products required by manufacturers of a variety of 
communications products said john hekking vice president of 
national semiconductors memory division 
hajime sasaki vice president of necs semiconductor group said 
the agreement will contribute to the companys memory products 
business but more importantly it will promote necs policy of 
international cooperation 
national semiconductor said it would begin offering the nec 
memory devices in july 
its just one more step in the partnering in the semiconductor 
industry said analyst daniel l kleskin of prudential bache 
research in san francisco texas instruments and intel also are 
selling japanese chips its a recognition by them and others 
that a semiconductor company cant be all things to all people but 
they need to provide a full line to their customers so it makes 
sense to work with other companies to provide products they dont 
have 
kleskin said the national semiconductornec pact can be a 
winwin deal 
theres not a high margin of profits for national because nec 
has to make a profit but the risk is minimal because they dont 
have to build a plant to make the chips he said for nec 
which is about a 5 billion company its a very small deal but 
it shows a willingness to work with american companies

five of the six family members 
controlling the champion insurance co empire pleaded guilty to 
mail fraud charges friday in a deal with the federal government 
us district judge frank polozola accepted the pleas but 
delayed a decision on justice department recommendations for light 
sentences until after an investigation 
the indictment had charged that officials of the company 
concealed over 2 million that was provided to louisiana insurance 
commissioner doug green for use in his 1987 election campaign 
green was not indicted and has denied any involvement with champion 
under the plea agreement champion owner john eicher and his 
son naaman would receive no less than 37 months or no more than 
46 months each indicted on 19 counts of mail fraud they pleaded 
guilty to four each count carries a normal maximum sentence of 
five years 
patricia eicher wife of the owner tina eicher wife of the 
son and meredith eicher the owners daughter pleaded guilty to 
two counts each 
as part of the arrangement with us attorney ray lamonica the 
women would be sentenced to no more than six months each with the 
possibility of no jail time 
the women along with ashley eicher another daughter of the 
owner were indicted on 11 counts each of mail fraud 
ashley eicher is scheduled to go on trial in july unless an 
agreement is reached in her case as well 
there may be some action next week that would eliminate the 
need for a trial said lamonica 
the eichers also must agree to cooperate with the government in 
the ongoing investigation of champion and to testify at any trials 
defense attroney john di giulio was asked later if that part of 
the agreement was aimed at an investigation of commissioner green 
possibly he said the government didnt tell me 
prosecutors alleged greens 1987 campaign was bankrolled by a 
champion subsidiary green a personal friend of naaman eicher 
also had business dealings with eicher prior to his election 
in addition to the federal charges a state grand jury in baton 
rouge a federal grand jury in new orleans and a grand jury in 
montgomery ala have also named the eichers on dozens of counts 
ranging from forgery to mail fraud in connection with champion 
the company was louisianas thirdlargest insurer of autos with 
100000 policyholders when it collapsed in june 1989 
champion got a clean bill of health in february 1989 from an 
audit ordered by green the audit said the company had 195 
million in surplus assets 
the failure left 150 million in unpaid claims in louisiana and 
an undetermined amount in the states of alabama and tennessee where 
it also operated 
nine subsidiaries fell shortly after champions collapse

a 21month investigation into alleged tax fraud 
by southern co and its utility subsidiary in georgia has ended 
with no criminal charges filed the federal government said friday 
us attorney ray rukstele said he notified southern and georgia 
power co that he would not seek indictments against the companies 
or any individuals in the tax probe 
however rukstele said he has suggested that the internal 
revenue service consider pursuing civil action against southern he 
declined to comment on whether a related investigation into 
possibly illegal campaign contributions by another subsidiary was 
continuing 
an irs spokeswoman in atlanta refused to comment on the case 
the atlanta journal quoting unidentified sources reported that 
federal investigators also were continuing to look into alleged 
improprieties in the steering of southern pension funds to a 
brokerage firm that employs the son of company president edward l 
addison 
rukstele said his decision against pursuing criminal charges 
pertained only to tax accounting practices involving southern and 
georgia power co 
georgia power president aw dahlberg said at a news conference 
friday that ruksteles announcement validates the companys 
position that its methods of accounting for spare parts the focus 
of the federal probe were proper 
dahlberg said he could not comment on whether other aspects of 
the investigation were continuing 
the investigation began in august 1988 when a georgia power 
accountant told the irs that the company may have failed to account 
properly for spare parts at issue was at what point the company 
was required to deduct the cost of emergency spare parts when they 
are purchased or when they are used 
the probe shortly afterward was widened to include political 
campaign contributions and took a bizarre turn with a 
stillunexplained plane crash in april 1989 that killed an 
executive and two southern pilots 
southerns florida subsidiary gulf power co pleaded guilty 
last november to conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions 
and was fined 500000 the plea agreement placed most of the blame 
for the scheme on jake horton the gulf power vice president who 
was killed in the crash 
authorities said at the time that the plea did not preclude 
further action in other areas of the case 
during the tax investigation federal agents raided the offices 
of southern and georgia power to confiscate tax records an 
internal investigation by georgia power found that no wrongdoing 
had been committed 
in addition to gulf and georgia power southern is the corporate 
parent of mississippi power alabama power and savannah electric 
and power

iran will direct an unprecedented 5 
billion in hard currency credits to its oil industry this year oil 
minister gholamreza aqazadeh said friday 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted aqazadeh as saying 
the economic backing was made possible with cooperation between 
the ministry of economy and finance and irans central bank 
the massive investments underline irans commitment to rebuild 
and update its oil industry which was badly battered in its 
eightyear war with iraq 
oil and gas related industries which earn more than 90 percent 
of irans foreign exchange were deprived of funds for maintainance 
and development as funds were channeled to the war effort 
but tehran began rebuilding immediately after the united 
nationssponsored ceasefire halted the conflict in august 1988 
the credits announced friday comprise about 6 percent of the 
countrys 80 billion budget for the current year which began 
march 21 
while inaugurating a methanol plant in southern iran on friday 
aqazadeh said irans current sustainable production capacity will 
be boosted from 33 million barrels a day to 37 million barrels a 
day in four months and 4 million barrels a day next year 
he said products from the new plant would help produce glue 
paint pharmaceuticals petrochemical products as well as car and 
jet fuel according to tehran radio 
because domestic demand for methanol would be low until other 
industries develop he said the excess methanol would be exported 
earning iran 12 million a year 
irans deputy oil minister ahmad rahgozar said last month that 
an additional 5 billion will also be invested in the petrochemical 
industry over the next five years 
after more than a decade of isolation and xenophobia iran is 
encouraging foreign investment in its projects aqazadeh said last 
march that the country was talking to numerous companies about gas 
and oil development 
at present iran is cooperating with soviet japanese and south 
korean firms to develop its oil fields

general motors corp shareholders approved a plan 
friday to boost executive pensions nearly doubling the annual 
retirement pay of outgoing chairman roger smith to about 11 
million 
pensions for executives vs those for hourly workers doubtlessly 
will be a hot topic when negotiations between gm and the united 
auto workers union open in july just a few weeks before smith 
retires july 31 
also at the fourhour annual meeting smith said the automaker 
would begin building cars in an east german joint venture in 
october becoming the first us automaker to make vehicles in 
eastern europe 
the company said 833 percent of the 503 million voting shares 
supported the proposal to boost the pensions of 3350 top 
executives including smith who received 25 million in 
compensation from gm in 1989 
technically the gm board didnt need shareholder approval to 
increase the pensions and smith expressed dissatisfaction over the 
process 
we dont expect to do it again smith said it 
apparently was an experiment gone astray 
under the revised plan the base used in figuring pensions was 
changed from salary alone to salary plus bonuses putting the 
proposal to a vote may have been sparked by a desire to limit bad 
feelings if word of such a boost arose for the first time during 
contract negotiations 
i would certainly much rather go to bargaining with the uaw 
knowing where we are as opposed instead of going through 
bargaining and all of a sudden having a surprise incoming gm 
chairman robert stempel said at a news conference after the annual 
meeting 
uaw vice president stephen yokich head of the unions gm 
department called the pension increases unjustifiable 
he praised the stance of michigan treasurer robert bowman who 
voted the 88 million shares of gm stock he controls through five 
pension funds against the retirement benefit proposal 
bowman said the 42 million annual cost of the pensions should 
go toward product development plant modernization and an 
underfunded pension plan for hourly employees 
i think mr smith can eke out a retirement without the 
increase bowman said 
said yokich its encouraging to see michigans top officials 
provide leadership for an emerging consensus that todays world 
requires that big corporations make consumers communities and 
workers a bigger priority than satisfying the voracious economic 
appetites of their executives 
the gm pension proposal snared attention earlier this week at 
the unions bargaining convention in kansas city one of the items 
high on the unions agenda this summer will be pension improvements 
for its 446000 retired members who make up almost half its 
membership 
opposition to the executive pension plan at gms annual meeting 
got personal at times friday 
you sir with all due respect will do extremely well said 
shareholder louis gilbert of new york 
stockholder evelyn y davis of washington a fixture at 
corporate annual meetings said roger in due respect to you 
you dont need this type of pension 
gm said it studied dozens of large companies and found that gms 
executive pension plan ranked in the bottom fifth smith said gm 
recently lost 60 of its executives partly because of the pension 
plan 
smith declined to say who they were or to list their specific 
objections to the previous plan 
during smiths 9year tenure as gm chairman the corporation 
lost market share closed plants laid off tens of thousands of 
hourly workers and slashed its executive payroll the company also 
underwent an aggressive plantmodernization program and cut more 
than 12 billion in costs since 1987 
gm plans to increase its presence in europe especially in 
eastern europe where rapid political and economic reforms are 
opening new markets 
gm said it will make fourdoor opel vectra cars in a joint 
venture with automobilwerke in eisenach east germany the company 
plans to assemble about 10000 of the cars this year a volume 
expected to grow to about 150000 annually by the mid1990s 
chrysler corp has planned a joint venture to make minivans in 
austria beginning in mid1991 ford motor co is studying vehicle 
assembly plans in eastern europe but has announced no specific 
plans 
automobilwerkes factory in eisenach makes the wartburg 
automobile gm spokesman jack harned said vectra production will be 
separate from wartburg manufacturing 
its not gm taking over wartburg harned said gm currently 
makes the vectra in russelsheim west germany 
smith said the joint venture with automobilwerke is the initial 
stage of gms new europe strategy besides making cars gm will 
begin building engines and assembling a small number of cars in 
hungary by early 1992

an administrative law judge found brian p 
monieson former head of the chicago mercantile exchange guilty 
friday of failing to adequately supervise two employees accused of 
defrauding customers 
monieson chairman of gnp commodities inc was barred from 
futures trading and ordered to pay a 500000 fine 
gnp commodities was found guilty of similar charges and ordered 
to close all customer accounts within 30 days and pay a 500000 
fine 
moniesons attorney jerrold e salzman said the penalties 
against his client and the trading firm are on hold while the 
ruling is appealed to the full commodity futures trading commission 
the two traders ira p greenspon and norman k furlett also 
were found guilty by judge george painter of the cftc a lawyer 
said they were considering an appeal 
the fraud in this case was committed against the retail 
customers a euphemism for relatively small public customers who 
are virtually defenseless painter said 
the shame of this case is that gnp and monieson were so 
callously indifferent to the wrongs done to their most vulnerable 
customers he added 
cftc attorneys said greenspon and furlett engaged in 
allocated trades that bilked customers of thousands of dollars 
the term refers to initiating futures contracts without the 
required customer account numbers then keeping profitable trades 
for themselves while socking customers with the losses 
the facts set forth in this matter constitute a pernicious 
widespread and institutionalized scheme of cheating and defrauding 
customers painter said 
he banned greenspon and furlett both of malibu calif from 
the futures industry and fined them 75000 each 
moniesons attorneys argued that as chairman of chicagobased 
gnp commodities he was not involved in daily oversight of his 
employees and should not be liable for failing to stop any 
wrongdoing 
painter dismissed those claims referring to testimony from 
others who said monieson was clearly a handson manager 
it appears that moniesons misplaced allegiance to furlett and 
greenspon overshadowed his greater duty to the customers they were 
defrauding the judge said 
monieson of northbrook ill and gnp commodities were found 
guilty of failing to adequately supervise the two traders from 
september 1984 through may 1986 monieson was merc chairman from 
1983 to 1985 
futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities ranging from 
agricultural products to stocks and bonds at a specified price on 
a future date people trade futures contracts either to lock in 
commodity prices in advance thereby reducing their financial risk 
or to speculate on price changes 
in chicago gnp commodities issued a statement calling painters 
decision unprecedented and unwarranted 
if executives are responsible for their traders misdeeds even 
when the executives did not personally benefit no firm could 
continue to do business the statement said 
mark s boyle one of two attorneys representing greenspon and 
furlett said he had not seen the entire 135page ruling but was 
considering an appeal 
we still maintain they did nothing wrong boyle said 
neither of the men currently works for gnp commodities he said 
meanwhile in chicago the merc on friday fined gnp commodities 
100000 and told the firm to continue its voluntary effort to pay 
300000 to customers who may have been harmed 
under a proposed settlement with the merc gnp commodities 
neither admits nor denies violating exchange rules

the procter amp gamble co one of the nations 
largest television advertisers is negotiating a 
multimilliondollar multiyear contract to advertise on the mtv 
cable network 
pampg spokesman terry loftus acknowledged friday that negotiations 
are in progress but declined to elaborate on terms being discussed 
with the music and entertainment network advertising age a trade 
publication said the potential deal includes a sixyear contract 
that could exceed 50 million 
loftus said he did not know how long the negotiations would take 
advertising on mtv would fall in line with pampgs shift since the 
mid1980s to reduce the amount it spends to advertise on the nbc 
abc and cbs television networks while spending more on ads designed 
to reach specific markets mtv targets viewers in their teens to 
mid30s 
pampg a cincinnatibased maker and seller of consumer goods 
health beauty care and food products was for years the nations 
largest advertiser but in 1988 its us advertising budget of 
1507 billion was topped by philip morris cos 2058 billion 
advertising age said when spending outside the us is included 
pampg is the worlds largest advertiser with a combined budget of 
24 billion 
in october 1987 procter amp gamble signed a multimilliondollar 
contract for commercials on wtbs in atlanta an independent 
television station whose programs are shown nationwide and six 
independent tv stations owned by tribune broadcasting co 
including wgntv in chicago pampg also advertises on news corps 
fox network 
analysts said pampg began spending less on network tv advertising 
because viewer loyalty to the networks was declining and the 
company wanted to tap regional niche markets 
pampg has sponsored racing cars and a racing boat auto and gem 
giveaways 21 barry manilow concerts and a twoyear national tour 
of the ringling bros barnum amp bailey circus it has also 
advertised in informational brochures in doctors and dentists 
offices through whittle communications of knoxville tenn and on 
whittles channel one news program shown in secondary schools 
our advertising strategy hasnt really changed over the years 
loftus said our goal is still to communicate with the consumer 
the difference today is that we are finding our consumers in 
different places than they were some years ago

the federal pension insurance funds 22 billion 
claim against ltv corp should be reduced according to a ruling by 
a judge who also rejected an effort by the fund the pension 
benefit guaranty corp to push its claim ahead of others in the 
companys bankruptcy case 
the size and status of pbgcs claim against dallasbased ltv has 
been a key issue in the 2yearold bankruptcy case one of the 
largest in corporate history 
the decision released by the company friday could cost the 
pbgc more than 1 billion if the agency also loses a related case 
pending before the us supreme court 
if allowed to stand the bankruptcy courts illfounded ruling 
will severely undercut our ability to reduce or prevent losses to 
the pension insurance program said pbgc executive director james 
b lockhart 
pbgc intends to challenge the ruling in federal district 
court lockhart said 
the 67page ruling by us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland in 
new york turned aside pbgcs effort to set the size of its own 
claim it also set aside the agencys assertion that the claim took 
precedence over other creditors including banks bondholders and 
tradesmen 
the pbgc is basically advocating that it is entitled to 
promulgate and enforce even in a bankruptcy case regulations 
which violate fundamental bankruptcy provisions and principles 
lifland wrote 
the pbgc claimed that its expertise in pension funding gave it 
the authority to determine the size of future pension payments but 
lifland said bankruptcy courts are often and routinely called 
upon to determine the present value of projected future payments 
the value of a claim over time and the value of a recovery which 
is in the form of payments over time 
as for the claims standing the pbgc has no legal basis for 
arguing that its claims should have a priority status he said 
liflands ruling answers the question of where does this claim 
stand and how much is it said analyst gary heinz at delaware bay 
co in new york 
this is almost as if not more significant than the basic 
issue before the supreme court heinz said 
the government has asked the supreme court to decide whether the 
pbgc which insures pension funds has the right to force ltv to 
reassume responsibility for three pensions funds terminated when 
subsidiary ltv steel co filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986 
the high court heard arguments in the case in february and a 
ruling is expected before the court adjourns for the summer in late 
june or early july 
if the supreme court decided to leave ltv pension plans with 
pbgc the bankruptcy court could reduce pbgc recoveries and 
increase losses to the insurance fund by as much as an additional 
1 billion said a spokeswoman for the fund 
lifland has chosen his timing to make this statement to 
emphasize his opinion of the case law said bankruptcy expert 
chriss street at seidler amdec securities inc in chicago 
given his highly respected position on the national bankruptcy 
bench as the jurist who has handled the most complex and difficult 
cases street said the decision could have farreaching impact on 
bankruptcy cases in addition to the complicated ltv case lifland 
is the judge in eastern airlines bankruptcy case and handled the 
petition by manville corp 
judge lifland has sent a pretty strong message to federal 
agencies that they dont possess the confiscatory powers that some 
of the bureaucrats in the agencies would have us believe heinz 
said 
in 1986 ltv corp filed for protection for the parent company 
and its 65 subsidiaries including ltv steel ltv aerospace and 
defense and ltv energy products it listed assets totaling 206 
billion and liabilities of 15 billion 
primarily because of disputes over the pbgc claim the company 
has yet to file a reorganization plan

and the freetrade agreement with the united states 
i am pleased to have had the opportunity to learn directly 
from them their concerns about what they consider to be an unlevel 
playing field he said in a statement 
the protest was sparked by proposed increases in canadas goods 
and services tax that will affect everything from the goods that 
truckers haul to the tires insurance and diesel fuel they buy 
the uscanadian trade agreement which will remove almost all 
tariffs by 1999 will further handicap canadian truckers 
protesters said the truckers contended that taxes and the 
freetrade agreement are crippling their ability to compete with 
us drivers 
the blockade dried up the flow of usmade auto parts to 
canada forcing the shutdown of three general motors of canada ltd 
plants in ontario and production cutbacks at one in quebec some 
13000 auto workers were affected production also was disrupted at 
chrysler canada and ford of canada

milling near the foot of the bridge the negotiators drew shouts 
catcalls and curses after saying lewis could promise only to relay 
their concerns to prime minister brian mulroney and his cabinet 
we want answers right now bellowed a voice from the crowd 
we havent been here two days for nothing well be here another 
week if we have to
