when donald kowalski retired from the 
backbreaking life of a miner on minnesotas iron range he looked 
forward to years of peace and leisure 
instead the 58yearold kowalski and his wife della are 
spending their golden years at war with a lesbian professor over who 
should care for their severely braindamaged daughter sharon 
the professor karen thompson says she deserves to be ms 
kowalskis caretaker because the two secretly considered themselves 
married before ms kowalski was paralyzed in a 1983 automobile crash 
caused by a drunken driver 
kowalski and his wife say the claim is bogus they insist 
thompsons interest in their daughter centers on money thompson has 
generated by publicizing the case in speeches across the country and 
a book 
i hate her with a passion kowalski said from his home in 
rural nashwauk in northeastern minnesota i cant picture an end 
to this 
thompson says the money is intended to help ms kowalski and she 
questions her parents motives they would rather she be a 
vegetable than a lesbian she said until sharons rights are 
protected i will fight this 
thompson who has become a national spokeswoman for gay and 
lesbian rights has helped establish two funds for her friend and 
organized rallies in 21 us cities in august to observe free 
sharon kowalski day 
according to court records the two women had lived together for 
four years ms kowalski 32 who was a high school physical 
education teacher had named thompson 41 as the beneficiary of her 
50000 life insurance policy before the accident 
the courts have acknowledged the relationship but have kept 
kowalski as his daughters guardian giving him power to make 
decisions for her and initially allowing him to deny thompson 
visiting privileges 
but in december a judge ordered a reevaluation of ms kowalski 
to determine how soundly she thinks and whether she is capable of 
making decisions about her own care 
ms kowalski who is in a nursing home near nashwauk has lost 
the use of her limbs and is unable to speak but can use the fingers 
of her right hand and communicates by typing shaking her head and 
using an alphabet board 
under the judges new order anyone is allowed to see her if she 
reliably requested to see them ms thompson said she was 
granted supervised visits because ms kowalski asked to see her in 
interviews with a psychiatrist 
a week ago the two visited over four days for the first time in 
3 years 
i think sharon is soon going to let everyone know that she can 
control her own future thompson said from ms kowalskis bedside 
she smiles and she chuckles and she has responded so well shes 
been happy to see me 
after the reevaluation the judge could go as far as declaring 
ms kowalski competent to handle her own affairs but her parents 
say such a finding would be impossible they say thompson has 
exaggerated ms kowalskis mental abilities and her chances for 
rehabilitation 
were never going to have the real sharon kowalski back said 
her mother you might get a good response from sharon one day and 
the next day nothing it would take a miracle to see her recover 
thompson who teaches physical education at st cloud state 
university said ms kowalski wants to go home with her to st 
cloud the kowalskis say their daughter has never expressed that 
desire to them 
thompson said she could provide better care for ms kowalski 
because she has more talent and education than her parents 
i made a lifetime commitment to sharon and i want to honor 
that thompson said 
ms kowalskis doctor william wilson opposes moving her from 
the nursing home he said home care would be out of the question 
because thompson is not certified to care for someone as severely 
disabled as ms kowalski 
meanwhile thompson admits she has started other relationships 
i have found that there are several people in the world that i 
can have relationships with thompson said but i dont know if 
i can fall deeply in love with another person like i did with 
sharon 
kowalski and thompson say they are likely to be battling each 
other as long as ms kowalski is judged incapable of handling her 
own affairs 
if this keeps up i probably dont have much time left said 
kowalski who has suffered two heart attacks in the past year that 
he attributes to the stress my heart can only take so much

thousands of people prayed for rain in northern 
italian churches and some parched communities planned religious 
processions hoping to bring an end to one of the worst droughts in 
years 
at 1300 roman catholic churches in the diocese of milan on 
sunday priests invoked the rain that restores the earth and 
air according to the diocese 
churchgoers in bergamo and genoa have also been praying for rain 
as sunny dry weather threatens crops and left ski slopes bare 
several parishes in small towns south of milan were planning 
processions along the adda river if rain did not arrive in the next 
few days the italian news agency ansa reported sunday 
italy has received only half the precipitation it usually gets in 
the septemberjanuary period the milan area has had one rain shower 
since november 24 while genoa has been dry for four months 
the lack of rain has prompted limits on private water use and 
contributed to brush fires that have scorched thousands of acres in 
northern italy 
the dry weather is the result of a highpressure system that has 
remained over the mediterranean for months meteorologists say

in returning michael manley to power 
jamaicans opted for a new style of leadership decisively rejecting 
the tough economic solutions and autocratic demeanor of conservative 
incumbent edward seaga 
the island also emerged from its short but tense election 
campaign with an improved record on controlling political violence 
preliminary indications were that the charismatic manley a 
radicalturnedmoderate leader with a new probusiness image won 44 
of 60 seats in parliament in thursdays voting 
jamaicas leading political analyst and pollster carl stone of 
the university of the west indies said he thought there would be no 
fundamental policy shifts under manley who was prime minister from 
1972 to 1980 
there will be the same policies but a different style of 
leadership stone said he really feels obsessed with correcting 
his mismanagement during the 1970s 
seaga a technocrat and hardnosed manager was regarded as a 
friend of big business which is wary of manley 
there definitely are going to be memories of what happened in 
the past said peter thwaites president of the private sector 
organization of jamaica the countrys main business group but he 
said if manley carries out his current proposals there will be 
very little change in the economic policies of the country 
manley appropriated private farms and heavily taxed business 
during his previous government now he says he has abandoned all 
thoughts of nationalization and wants to give private enterprise a 
free hand in developing the economy 
seaga improved the islands economy especially tourism but he 
did it by doubling the foreign debt to about 4 billion raising 
taxes laying off thousands of workers and cutting back spending on 
health and education 
prices rose sharply leading to food riots in 1985 
the program he seaga has carried out has been very rigid 
said stone and hes paying the price for it 
seaga a staunch ally of the united states and close political 
friend of ronald reagan said he was afraid the results of his 
economic measures had not reached enough people 
you see the results yes but the results have not reached 
enough people so that enough people will say yes well we took 
the medicine and weve benefited he said recently 
he said he was forced to take unpopular measures because of the 
nearbankrupt state of the economy when he took office in 1980 after 
eight years of manley rule and the collapse of the bauxite industry 
in 1983 
he said younger voters had no memories of how bad things were 
under manley 
manley known by his most ardent supporters as joshua after 
the old testament prophet pledged to revitalize schools and 
hospitals he said were neglected for eight years under seagas 
costcutting administration 
as prime minister manley gained an international reputation as a 
firebrand socialist he forged close ties with cubas fidel castro 
and brought in scores of cuban doctors and technicians 
in recent years he has turned sharply to the political center as 
a social democrat the 64yearold leader has been saying he is an 
older and wiser man and on election night thursday he thanked the 
jamaican people for giving him a second chance 
manley said he would restore relations with cuba but was more 
interested in working with the bush administration and western 
lending institutions such as the international monetary fund and the 
world bank 
he said his first foreign trip as prime minister will be to 
washington to establish the widest and most constructive 
relationship possible with the new administration 
the bush administration wont be pleased that manley is reopening 
the cuban embassy which was closed by seaga but us officials say 
they are encouraged by manleys pledge to limit the cuban presence 
and influence to formal diplomatic ties 
policy issues were overshadowed during the campaign by fears that 
bloodshed among rival political supporters would further split the 
nation of 24 million and wreck tourism which brings in 600 
million a year and is jamaicas top earner of foreign exchange 
the tourism industry still is recovering from a sharp drop in 
visitors in the aftermath of hurricane gilbert which slammed into 
the island sept 12 killing 45 people and causing 1 billion in 
damage 
in 1980 when jamaicas last nationally contested election was 
held an estimated 700 people were murdered over a ninemonth 
campaign this time 13 died in campaignrelated shootings and 
stabbings 
but in comparison with the mayhem of 1980 the election appeared 
to mark a turning point in jamaican politics

the gunfire has stopped the dictator 
is gone and the celebrating is over paraguayans now must get down 
to the business of adjusting to life without the only president most 
of them have ever known 
on the surface the future looks brighter for this south american 
nation of nearly 4 million holding promises of new leadership and 
perhaps a more representative government 
the likelihood that another general will replace ousted leader 
gen alfredo stroessner now in exile in neighboring brazil bothers 
few paraguayans 
neither does the certainty that political power will remain in 
the hands of the ruling colorado party a pillar of stroessners 
support throughout his nearly 35 years in power 
it doesnt make any difference what kind of government we get 
it has to be better than the one we had said 20yearold celso 
gonzalez one of the thousands of citizens who went into the street 
to celebrate the fall of the 76yearold dictator 
gen andres rodriguez whose tanks and troops ousted stroessner 
in a violent coup feb 3 seems to be many things his predecessor 
was not 
rodriguez quickly dissolved congress and called for elections may 
1 in which all parties except the communists can participate he 
promised to respect human rights freedom of expression and the 
roman catholic church 
he named an 11man cabinet that even opposition members 
grudgingly admit includes paraguays most successful and talented 
administrators and technocrats 
the new government will have to deal with urgent problems 
including poverty economic stagnation 30 percent annual inflation 
and a foreign debt of nearly 2 billion 
the church which had become a leading opposition body in this 
predominantly roman catholic nation promised the new president its 
support 
rodriguez 65 has denied rumors he may be linked to drug 
traffickers who move cocaine through paraguay and he pledged to 
cooperate with the united states and international agencies seeking 
to end the drug trade 
in paraguays first presidential press conference the affable 
selfassured cavalry general left open the possibility he may run 
for president 
i am simply a soldier not a politician rodriguez told 
reporters however if i can be useful to my country i will do 
what i am asked 
luis maria argana the new foreign minister who was seen as the 
partys most likely presidential choice quickly denied reports he 
would run and endorsed rodriguez 
the colorado party which claims membership of 14 million and 
has ruled since 1947 has said it will call a convention soon to 
select candidates and new party leaders 
the 101yearold party was badly split in august 1987 when a 
small but fanatical prostroessner group usurped party leadership in 
a battle over how to prepare for poststroessner rule 
the stroessner backers an inner circle of militant government 
and party officials favored continuation of hardline authoritarian 
rule possibly under stroessners eldest son gustavo an air force 
colonel 
the majority calling themselves traditionalists favored 
some relaxation of iron rule and the eventual replacement of 
stroessner with a civilian president 
recently the situation was complicated by stroessners failing 
health the nation accustomed to seeing his picture every day in 
the newspapers was astounded in september when he vanished for two 
weeks for an unannounced prostate operation 
in a nation where virtually every decision was made by the 
president the wheels of government ground to a halt 
the president used to personally sign most government 
documents said a foreign diplomat some of our transferring 
personnel even received shipment orders for their household goods 
signed by him 
rodriguezs decision to act diplomats and politicians say came 
when stroessner ordered him to give up command of the powerful first 
army corps and retire or accept a political post possibly defense 
minister without command of troops 
stroessners downfall sent citizens 70 percent of whom had 
known only stroessner as president into the streets to celebrate 
rival politicians bitter enemies for years embraced danced and 
sang 
the nations opposition political parties face new problems most 
were unrecognized because they had not been allowed to participate 
in the political process 
the hinges of our political limbs are rusty from lack of use 
said euclides acevedo president of the leftleaning revolutionary 
febrerista party 
domingo laino popular head of the national accord a loose 
grouping of four opposition parties suggested the opposition needs 
as much as a year to organize to effectively compete with the 
colorados in elections 
political leaders largely discount the possibility that 
stroessner or his son gustavo could effectively organiize any effort 
to return to power 
stroessner supporters were hard to find after the coup and they 
spoke with reluctance 
i have to admit that i dont think that stroessner was all 
bad said a taxi driver as he drove through streets of happy 
demonstrators following the coup he gave us peace and he built 
schools for our children and roads where there were only mudholes 
before 
look at those people he said nodding toward the 
demonstrators if stroessner were still in power most of them 
would be cheering for him instead of rodriguez

when your name is herbert hoover you have 
to have a sense of humor just ask him 
i remember once i needed a reservation at a washington dc 
hotel and i called and made it in my name herbert hoover said 
recently 
but when i showed up they had no reservation they thought it 
had been a prank call 
you cant take it seriously or your life would be miserable 
said hoover who works for the nebraska technical assistance center 
hoover was born in mississippi in 1931 during his namesakes 
presidential administration given his name its only natural he 
once bought a pickup truck from a man named warren harding not the 
29th president and that his office mate when he worked for the 
us department of agriculture at the university of missouri was 
oliver wendell holmes not the former us supreme court justice 
he said most people have forgotten former president hoover but 
many kid him about the hoover vacuum cleaner 
you have to get used to people laughing at you he said 
my name shocks people hoover said so i started saying 
herb over the phone but a few years ago burger king had an 
advertising campaign featuring a guy named herb and i started 
finding wheres herb posters all over my office 
although he hasnt changed his name hoover has given his son a 
different start 
my sons name is michael hoover said i would never do 
that name him herbert children have enough to worry about

north carolina sweet potato growers have 
an identity crisis on their hands 
just last month they finally got rid of the name yam from 
the name of their trade group to make a distinction between their 
product and the related african tuber the state grows no yams but 
its 60 million crop represents 40 percent of the nations sweet 
potatoes 
now the federal government has decided sweet potato is really one 
word sweetpotato the us department of agriculture is apparently 
worried that consumers might think a sweet potato is an irish potato 
thats sweet 
thats the government bureaucracy for you grumbled milton 
horne a salesman for corbett farms in wilmington 
the usda wants the states growers and their trade group to go 
along the nc sweetpotato commission has agreed says billy 
yeargin executive director of the group 
but the sweet potato council of the united states a 
washingtonbased grower group stands by its spelling 
just because the usda does it that way means north carolina 
does also said director howard hoecker noting with pride but 
we at the council do not

the senates oldboy club which for 
generations has cheered on former senators if they advanced into the 
upper reaches of the executive branch has come unglued under the 
weight of former sen john towers nomination to be secretary of 
defense 
towers senate confirmation is in serious jeopardy the nominee 
battered by unproven accusations of heavy drinking womanizing and 
lack of objectivity when it comes to defense contractors 
many had expected that towers nomination to be the nations 
defense chief would enjoy an effortless slide down a carefully 
greased chute 
tower after all had been one of the powers of the senate where 
he served for two dozen years and presided as chairman of the armed 
services committee the same panel now being asked to confirm him 
if he expected special treatment he didnt get it 
instead his nomination became snared in a web of allegations and 
fbi investigations 
sen sam nunn dga the current armed services chairman had 
made clear months before last falls election that he intended to 
subject new nominees for top pentagon positions to intense scrutiny 
in an effort to improve the quality of key officials 
i said several times that it wasnt going to be an oldboy 
hearing that we were going to have a thorough review nunn says 
the presumption that it was going to be something less was wrong 
from the beginning period 
nunn calls the tower screening the most exhaustive process and 
investigation anyones gone through in my memory in the senate 
i think everybody thought that the oldboy network would work 
as it always has and john tower would go sailing through but it 
hasnt worked that way said sen james exon dneb the armed 
services committees secondranking democrat 
many members including nunn speak of the process of sifting and 
judging the merits of allegations against tower in terms of personal 
pain 
the pain is evidently more intense against the backdrop of a 
courtly clubby institution in which members routinely refer to 
colleagues as distinguished and honorable and hasten to 
smooth over the wounds of legislative combat with flowery 
compliments 
this is a painful process nunn says its painful for the 
nominee painful for the president painful for the committee and 
painful for me its frustrating its not enjoyable 
in part towers troubles may stem from the fact that he 
apparently entered the confirmation process with a relatively low 
reservoir of good will among his former colleagues 
many senators say privately that they were not fond of what they 
say was towers testy temper and autocratic operating style 
few are willing to say that in public but some are 
tower is a former member of the senate but it is probably also 
the case that he doesnt have a lot of intimate friends here or any 
aura of popularity or good will said sen richard lugar rind 
who was chairman of the senate foreign relations committee at the 
time tower headed armed services 
he is not necessarily a person who ingratiates himself with 
anybody lugar said 
some republican senators are saying that while they remain 
publicly supportive of the tower nomination it is more out of a 
sense of loyalty to president bush rather than out of any sense of 
loyalty or affection toward tower 
they are saying we owe it to the president not tower 
lugar said 
i dont notice anything clubby in this one at all he said 
the question inevitably is raised of whether the tower nomination 
is being hammered by oldfashioned partisan politics 
some republican operatives are saying exactly that accusing the 
democrats who control the senate of causing difficulties for the new 
administration in part to assert their majority status and in part 
as an expression of frustration over their partys defeat in last 
years presidential contest 
not so says nunn whose own credentials are hardly those of a 
leftwing pentagon basher sen john warner rva a former 
secretary of the navy and the panels ranking republican backs him 
up 
the two lawmakers say they have worked as 5050 partners 
throughout the hearings and investigations and constantly shared 
information 
sam nunn has been fair equitable and steadfastly he has 
been nonpolitical warner said late last week 
warner said he put the question of fairness directly to tower 
himself 
i said john if you were in the position sam nunn and i now 
find ourselves in would you do it any differently 
the answer 
sen tower looked us right in the eye and said no warner 
said

the soviets are bending over backwards to 
comply with the treaty calling for destruction of all 
intermediaterange missiles a sign that they are eager for a more 
sweeping pact to slash nuclear arsenals says the chief us 
inspector 
the whole thing is going a whole lot better than we expected 
said brig gen roland lajoie who in 19 previous years of dealing 
with the soviets had found little reason to love them 
lajoie 52 has served two stints as a military attache in moscow 
and was commander of the us liaison office in east germany in 1985 
when soviet soldiers shot and killed american maj arthur nicholson 
each of us has some unpleasant little anecdote said lajoie 
whose face was smashed when the truck in which he was riding was 
rammed from behind by a red army vehicle in east germany five months 
after the nicholson incident 
but says lajoie we are professional officers 
and there is a political will on both sides to make this thing 
work but i am under no political pressure to whitewash the 
process lajoie said in an interview 
he said the soviets clearly view verification of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty as a foundation 
for cooperation on the more ambitious strategic arms reduction 
treaty start to cut longrange superpower weapons by 30 to 50 
percent start talks are stalled while the bush administration 
reviews overall us policy 
start said lajoie is going to be much more complicated to 
verify because the number of weapons involved is much larger and 
because it calls for reduction rather than elimination of specific 
systems 
overhead satellites will remain the backbone of us 
verification said lajoie but like the inf pact start calls for 
onsite inspections on demand at dozens of locations in the united 
states western europe and the soviet bloc 
under the inf regime the united states also is allowed to keep 
30 inspectors outside a soviet mobile missile plant in votkinsk 700 
miles east of moscow while the soviets leave a similar group in 
magna utah 
lajoie and the other 250 americans assigned to the inspection 
agency consult regularly with the start negotiators and some of the 
military officers on the start team have accompanied the inf 
inspectors on their rounds to make sure that lessons are learned 
there are certain minor provisions for which we would prefer 
different wording said lajoie noting a requirement that 
inspectors tour a facility within one hour of arrival no matter 
what time they get there 
since lajoie supervised the creation of the onsite inspection 
agency in april 1988 the soviets have destroyed 308 percent of 
their 1836 short and mediumrange missiles and the united states 
has destroyed 305 percent of its 867 pershing 2 and groundlaunched 
cruise missiles 
were both a little ahead of the curve for the threeyear 
destruction period said lajoie the treaty negotiated over six 
years and signed in december 1987 bans groundlaunched superpower 
missiles with ranges of 3003000 miles 
he acknowledges that there have been a lot of minor glitches 
they have been resolved in a gentlemanly way there is a tradition 
now of resolving these at the lowest possible level 
one glitch cannot be blamed on the soviets said lajoie an xray 
machine to be used at votkinsk has not been delivered yet forcing 
the americans to rely on their eyes to spot any mediumrange ss20 
missiles the soviets might try to sneak out of the factory among 
longer range ss25s 
last month sen jesse helms rnc a conservative opponent of 
arms control accused the soviets of preventing use of the xray 
device and therefore violating the treaty 
lajoie however said it is not a sovietimposed delay 
if the americans are suspicious said lajoie they can always 
demand to inspect the inside of the missile canister a right they 
can exercise eight times a year the treaty bans all ss20 missiles 
lajoie who spent much of his time as a military attache peering 
at the outside of soviet bases under the suspicious gaze of russian 
counterintelligence agents marvels at the unique access his 
team is given on strategic rocket bases 
everything we have observed is something we havent observed 
before he said 
but thats not a license to spy 
neither side wants the other to move into a sensitive area with 
a lot of gear said lajoie each team is allowed to carry only one 
camera a quickdeveloping model to photograph disputed items 
since completion of baseline inspections last summer to 
verify the actual number of weapons in each arsenal only one 
photograph has been taken by the soviets of a groundlaunched 
cruise missile that already had been partially disassembled a minor 
deviation from protocol according to an administration official 
another small misunderstanding arose after an american failed to 
count one item on a list of weapons components to be destroyed the 
misunderstanding was cleared up quickly through an exchange of 
telegrams according to the official who spoke on condition he not 
be further identified

former gov orval faubus sold memorabilia 
from his long political career but he couldnt part with a few 
mementos like documents validating his election to six consecutive 
terms as governor 
i still have six certificates of election faubus said 
sunday a day after he took in 5000 from the auction at his 
mansion atop governors hill 
i think we had about 1000 items listed a few large and most 
of it small stuff political memorabilia must have been nearly half 
of it said the 79yearold faubus who served as governor from 
1955 to 1967 he has lost three comeback bids for governor most 
recently in 1986 
one item that fetched 40 was a boat paddle embossed with a 
likeness of faubus and the slogan faubus for arkansas from his 
1964 race the most popular political items were license tags

led by their communist mayor the people of 
terni have launched a crusade to reclaim st valentine the patron 
saint of lovers who has attained greater fame abroad than in his 
native country 
on sunday the city in central italys umbria region launched a 
yearly award ceremony dedicated to acts of love around the world 
next year it plans to offer free honeymoons to newlyweds 
this steel town wants its decapitated 3rd century bishop to 
really be its valentine 
the roman catholic saint for lovers has been as much a mixture of 
myth religion and tradition as easter bunnies or st nicholas who 
eventually became a jolly redsuited santa claus 
the vatican congregation for the causes of saints says 17 
valentines are listed in the official encyclopedia of saints 
including ones from italy france spain and germany 
but we are relatively sure that ternis is the real valentine 
because he is the oldest says ivani rossi president of the 
valentian cultural center he has been working to bring back what he 
says is real significance to the festivity rather than a 
growth in the valentine gift industry 
according to historical accounts from the middle ages placido 
the prefect of rome had the spiritual head of ternis christians 
beheaded on february 14 of the year 270 after having him imprisoned 
and whipped 
valentino had a garden where according to legend he allowed 
children to play or lovers to meet while he was jailed valentino 
handed the keys of the garden to two carrier pigeons with a message 
inviting the children of terni to return there during his absence 
after his martyrdom valentinos body was brought back here by 
his followers and buried the funeral urn was discovered in a 
cemetery during the 17th century and is now kept in a basilica 
minus a tooth given at the time to leopold of austria who venerated 
the saint and funded the basilicas construction 
benedictine monks spread the cult of the saint to anglosaxon 
countries including england and the united states 
although valentino remained the patron saint of terni town 
residents as well as most italians didnt realize how famous he 
was becoming abroad according to the current bishop of terni 
franco gualdrini 
we found for example that people knew more about the american 
mafia st valentines day massacre than about st valentine 
himself gualdrini said in an interview referring to the 
prohibitionera slaying of seven men in a chicago garage by al 
capones mobsters 
the commercial value of st valentine outstripped his spiritual 
value he said this was something we had to change considering 
terni had probably the worlds best known saint 
a few years ago the traditionally communist administration of 
terni led by mayor giacomo porazzini decided to work with the 
local church on a mutually beneficial project restoring some 
luster to terni and its saint 
a tourist marketing test in japan showed the city and the area 
with spectacular waterfalls and walled medieval towns and churches 
had potential appeal 
now more than 20000 japanese tourists stop at the basilica and 
tour the area each year and terni has its annual love awards 
ceremony 
among winners sunday were nobel peace prizewinner mother teresa 
of calcutta american erich segal bestselling author of love 
story actor peter ustinov and an italian rescue brigade that 
recently returned from the armenian earthquake zone 
next year the prize ceremony will be carried on a worldwide 
satellite television program and the city will begin to offer free 
oneweek honeymoons to selected newlyweds

the democrat who is set to become bush 
administrations top aide for latin america was once a strong 
supporter of the nicaraguan contras but now believes other 
strategies should be pursued for achieving a settlement in central 
america 
bernard aronson who once advised president carter and vice 
president walter mondale believes the new administration should 
make an allout effort to build on the peace agreement the five 
central american presidents signed in august 1987 
aronsons views were outlined in a littlenoticed paper he 
coauthored last october which was intended to influence the debate 
over central america as the reagan administration was bowing out 
the report was published by freedom house a human rights group 
based in new york 
eight others participated in writing the paper titled peace 
through democracy a bipartisan initiative for the central american 
crisis 
although there have been some objections to aronsons prospective 
appointment administration aides say secretary of state james a 
baker has indicated that his decision is final 
baker has placed high priority on filling the post vacated last 
month by elliott abrams with someone who will have more success 
than abrams did in forging a bipartisan policy on central america 
while the policies of the new administration are still in the 
planning stage the central americans themselves are engaged in a 
flurry of diplomatic activity 
central american foreign ministers met in new york last week and 
the five regional presidents were opening a twoday meeting today in 
san salvador to discuss the future of the nicaraguan contras and 
other issues 
aronson 42 helped write a procontra aid speech for president 
reagan several years ago but the report he helped write last fall 
suggests his views on rebel aid have shifted in light of new 
developments 
baker has discussed the central america issue only in general 
terms but what he has said appears to be consistent with the 
substance of the report coauthored by aronson 
while hinting that contra aid may be a last resort at some point 
the report suggests that continued pursuit of that approach is 
tactically unwise because of hostile public opinion in the united 
states 
those who favor the immediate resumption of military aid to the 
nicaraguan resistance are in danger of once again launching a 
military policy from a weak political base the report said 
it said few believe there is a broad enough consensus in support 
of contra aid to sustain that approach for a substantial period 
instead the report recommends giving a rigorous test to the 
esquipulas agreement signed by the five central america presidents 
18 months ago 
among other provisions the agreement commits nicaraguas leftist 
government to establish democracy and also bars continued us aid 
to the contras 
six months after the agreement was signed congress suspended 
military aid to the rebels most of whom have since fled to camps 
along the honduran border where they receive us humanitarian 
assistance 
the reagan administration was deeply mistrustful of the 
agreement seeing it as a mechanism that would relieve contra 
military pressure on the sandinista government without ensuring a 
democratic outcome in nicaragua 
american officials have repeatedly accused the sandinista 
government of dragging its feet in adopting democratic reforms 
abrams maintained that contra military pressure was the only way 
to ensure a democratic evolution in nicaragua aronson suggests that 
the reagan administration should have pursued more vigorously the 
opening created at esquipulas the site in guatemala where the 
agreement was signed 
the freedom house report said the accord has greater moral and 
political validity than other approaches being considered 
on the other hand it said the agreement has a number of 
weaknesses including a lack of compelling verification and 
enforcement mechanisms and a reluctance to confront soviet and 
cuban involvement in the regions turmoil 
among other recommendations the report calls for the 
establishment of a bipartisan task force to determine whether the 
agreement is an appropriate instrument for bringing about peace and 
democracy in the region

the image and words heartened members of the 
congressional military reform caucus 
there was president bush standing on the deck of the 
1048footlong carrier america last month at the huge norfolk naval 
base and telling navy personnel and contractor employees that he 
wants tighter controls and higher standards in weapons 
procurement 
im very hopeful i know the president intends to make 
changes says sen william roth jr rdel 
we have a tremendous opportunity in the next few years said 
rep barbara boxer dcalif 
roth and boxer representatives of different sides of the aisle 
and different sides of the capitol last week were named cochairs 
of the caucus an informal bipartisan organization of house and 
senate members 
the republicandemocratic housesenate mix is standard during 
the 100th congress the caucus membership totaled 136 with 27 
members of the senate and 109 members of the house seventyeight 
were democrats and 58 were republicans 
members are of a like mind concerned about reform in the 
military said boxer 
at times during the eightyear tenure of bushs predecessor 
ronald reagan the caucus was frustrated 
for example in 1983 it led the fight for the creation of an 
independent pentagon operational test and evaluation office but the 
reagan administration delayed the installation of a test director 
until two years later 
during the reagan presidency and the accompanying record 
peacetime military buildup scandals surfaced about pentagon payment 
of exorbitant prices for hammers wrenches and toilet seats 
of a more serious nature the justice department has been 
pursuing a twoyear probe of alleged purchasing fraud the case 
involves charges that private consultants hired by military 
contractors bribed pentagon officials to obtain inside information 
that gave companies an edge in bidding for defense department work 
ronald reagan is the true father of the caucus said rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed services 
committee and a frequent critic of the past republican 
administration 
the caucus says its purpose is not to advocate overall 
increases or decreases in defense spending only more effective 
expenditure of those dollars allocated for national defense 
the notion is not to argue what weapons are needed were 
trying to find a way to make the most of the military for less 
money said boxer 
the caucus began in 1981 after former rep g william whitehurst 
rva noticed an article in the wall street journal on military 
reform the storys author was former colorado senator and onetime 
presidential candidate gary hart 
in reading the article whitehurst found that he shared some of 
the same views as hart the senator and the congressman huddled on 
military reform joined forces with a handful of others and formed 
the caucus 
initially the organization concentrated on such military reforms 
as maneuver tactics and leadership training later as the caucus 
increased in numbers it turned its attention to purchasing reform 
and conventional weapons 
the organization says its activities are intended to support 
the regular committee work for a more effective national defense 
weve held hearings we couldnt get the armed services 
committee to hold the caucus has pushed armed services boxer 
said 
the caucus has no budget no dues not even an official phone 
number its staff is the staff of the cochairs who handle mailings 
and pay for events 
the caucus holds frequent briefings and seminars for members on 
such issues as the bradley fighting vehicle the military budget and 
conventional defense 
this congressional session the focus will be on promoting 
legislation to strengthen the procurement system and whistleblower 
protection and tighten the revolving door between the pentagon and 
the defense industry said boxer and roth 
affecting the reform effort will be the budget crunch facing the 
pentagon in his speech thursday bush proposed a 3088 billion 
defense budget for fiscal 1990 eliminating the 2 percent increase 
proposed by reagan in january 
with less funds available it will be critically important that 
we get the biggest bang for the buck said roth centralized 
procurement within the department this kind of approach is the 
highest priority on the agenda 
roth who has been called a cheap hawk jokes that he has to 
live up to his reputation

when it comes to livestock it may be hard to 
realize today that the united states was once a nation of sheep not 
cows 
not anymore of course the agriculture department reported last 
week that the nations cattle inventory although down slightly 
totaled nearly 995 million head on jan 1 the number of sheep and 
lambs increased a bit for the third straight year to 108 million 
even milk cows at 102 million head nearly matched the us 
sheep flock and dairy cow numbers were the smallest since 1872 
sheep and lamb production has long been an important segment of 
our economy the departments agricultural statistics board said 
in a supplemental report since colonial times production of 
sheep and lamb for meat and wool has substantially contributed to 
our food and fiber industry 
before the 1900s wool production was most important while sheep 
and lamb output for meat was incidental but the report said there 
was a marked change from 1870 to 1920 as the production of lambs 
for slaughter became increasingly important 
the usda began officially estimating sheep and lamb numbers right 
after the civil war on jan 1 1867 those totaled 463 million 
head having a value of about 108 million or about 240 per head 
there were about onethird more sheep than cattle in this 
earliest count the report said by 1884 sheep and lamb numbers 
increased to 533 million head but exceeded cattle numbers for the 
last time 
according to usda records the cattle inventory in 1867 was 286 
million head worth an estimated 5479 million an average of 1913 
per head 
by 1884 when sheep totaled 533 million head cattle were at 
498 million the following year in 1885 sheep were estimated at 
496 million 
sheep and lamb numbers passed through many cyclical phases 
the report said inventory declined after 1884 until 1897 and then 
increased again until 1909 when almost 508 million head were on 
us farms and ranches 
the next peak for sheep and lambs was in 1932 when nearly 54 
million head were reported the alltime high was in 1942 when 562 
million head were being raised to help with the us effort in world 
war ii both for wool and meat 
inventories dropped after the war declining to fewer than 30 
million head by 1950 and then mostly leveled off after 1960 through 
most of the 1970s sheep and lambs continued to decline and than 
hovered just under 13 million head from 1977 to 1982 
the us flock dropped to below 10 million head an alltime low 
on jan 1 1986 before the modest recovery of recent years 
a number of causes are blamed for the demise of the us sheep 
industry the report said mostly it has stemmed from a reduced 
demand for wool reflecting the intrusion of synthetic fibers and 
cheaper substitute materials plus a declining demand for lamb in 
consumer diets 
one big problem has been the difficulty in obtaining and keeping 
reliable herders to manage and care for range flocks which are 
located mostly in the west the increased competition for public 
range land also was cited 
another important factor which has contributed to the decline 
is the increasing problem of predators such as coyotes in many 
range and farmflock producing states the report said also 
relatively large imports of lamb and mutton have contributed to the 
decline of the domestic sheep industry

last months trade figures released by the 
commerce department showed an impressive gain in the value of 
agricultural exports from levels the year before says an 
agriculture department analysis 
agricultural exports in november the most recent figures 
reported topped 33 billion up 500 million from a year earlier 
and the highest for a single month since december 1984 the report 
said the gains reflect higher export prices due to tighter us 
supplies stemming from last summers drought 
but from a volume perspective the gains were more modest the 
report said november shipments rose 2 percent from a year earlier 
to 114 million metric tons 
so far this year us agricultural exports are commanding 
a 50 per ton premium on the world market over yearago levels 
the report said the largest price increases have been in those 
commodities most severely affected by last summers drought wheat 
feed grains and soybeans and products

gun owner groups are opening fire on 
congressional efforts to outlaw semiautomatic assault weapons such 
as the one used in last months stockton calif playground 
massacre that left five children dead 
i think a lot of people could get hurt politically in voting 
for this bill says john m snyder public affairs director of the 
citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms 
he and other gun lobbyists were on capitol hill last week to 
combat a bill sponsored by sen howard m metzenbaum dohio that 
would halt sales of ak47s israelimade uzis and a host of other 
militarystyle weapons with banana clips wire stocks and 
sinisterlooking snouts that roughly fall under the heading of 
assault rifles 
led by the efficient and well financed national rifle 
association gun lobbyists base their muscle on support from 
hundreds of thousands of hunters and other gun owners across the 
country who fear they will lose their weapons 
lawmakers have long been reluctant to tangle with the nra for 
fear of repercussions at election time 
the nras power however may have waned a bit in recent years 
when lawmakers approved a ban on plastic guns that fail to register 
on metal detectors and required the attorney general to come up with 
a plan to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals 
the nra ended up supporting the plastic gun ban after initial 
opposition failed to scuttle it handing the more complicated 
assignment to the attorney general represented a compromise struck 
after the senate balked at a housepassed plan to do no more than 
study the problem 
opponents of the nra however say there is no question that it 
still wields considerable power 
the nra has intimidated members of congress in a political 
sense with their money and their political muscle says rep 
edward f feighan dohio who was defeated last year in an effort 
to win approval of a sevenday waiting period for gun buyers he is 
trying again this year 
metzenbaum however was reelected handily while under attack by 
the nra 
his supporters say the criticism was offset somewhat by an 
endorsement from the fraternal order of police based in part on his 
support for gun control they say the senate may well pass assault 
rifle legislation this year 
the current round began shortly after a jan 17 incident in which 
a gunman opened fire with an ak47 on 400 children on a playground 
outside the cleveland elementary school in stockton calif 
five youngsters died and 29 were injured along with one teacher 
three persons remain in the hospital 
first to respond with legislation was rep howard berman dcalif 
the slaughter of citizens on the streets and children in the 
schoolyard by weapons designed for slaughter on the battlefield must 
be stopped delared berman 
his bill however has not generated wide support even among gun 
control advocates mainly because it bans possession of assault 
rifles and thus requires owners to turn them in to police or the 
local sheriff by contrast metzenbaums bill would ban sales of the 
weapons but not possession 
trying to collect huge numbers of semiautomatic rifles already in 
private hands could plunge the bill into a political quagmire 
control advocates fear 
other california congressmen including reps vic fazio 
dcalif and fortney h pete stark dcalif have been searching 
for a less stringent formula and any bill clearly has a long hard 
haul to reach floor passage 
in the senate illinois democrat paul simons judiciary 
subcommittee on the constitution is believed to be closely divided 
over whether to push legislation this year but even if it is 
blocked there metzenbaum still can go to the floor and appeal to 
the whole senate to attach his bill to other legislation 
nra lobbyists say guns dubbed assault weapons are not much 
different from more traditional hunting guns they call the major 
difference cosmetic and point to the militarystyle appearance of 
the ak47s and uzis 
there is no functional difference between those firearms that 
are currently being called assault rifles and what would be called 
traditional hunting rifles says nra federal lobbyist david 
conover 
he claims that metzenbaums measure would not only outlaw 
rapidfire grease guns and pistolgripped rounddrummed 
streetsweeper shotguns but such old standbys of the sportsman as 
the woodenstocked remington model 4 
the same disclaimer of any functional difference was 
expressed at last weeks hearing by edward conroy acting deputy 
associate director for law enforcement of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
but he also expressed sympathy with the aim of the legislation to 
take assault weapons out of the hands of criminals 
nra spokesman have been arguing that a ban on the weapon would 
not really work because it would be disobeyed by criminals and kept 
out of the hands of lawabiding hunters and other sportsmen but 
metzenbaum scoffs at that notion 
we know of only one instance in which this was used for 
hunting he declared last week when a psychopath in california 
went hunting school children

actor todd bridges is a sick kid 
victimized by drug addiction according to the mother of the former 
teenage star of diffrent strokes who is jailed on attempted 
murder charges 
its hard to believe its come to this said betty bridges 
adding that family problems and early celebrity status have hurt her 
23yearold son 
earlier this month bridges was charged with shooting kenneth 
clay 25 in both arms and the chest in a house known as a drug 
hangout an associate harvey duckett 30 is accused of slashing 
clays face with a knife 
bridges is being held without bail until his preliminary hearing 
friday and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted 
i dont know what a drug addict is capable of his mother 
said last week but i know that todd bridges my son is not 
capable of shooting someone like that 
the attack came 10 days after bridges was arrested for 
investigation of possessing cocaine near the house police said 
previously he received a suspended sentence in january 1987 after 
pleading no contest to making a bomb threat and he was fined for 
carrying a concealed weapon in 1983 
the drugs and the pressure have made todd a sick kid and he 
shouldnt be made out to be some criminal mrs bridges said in an 
interview in sundays los angeles daily news 
she said her 1984 divorce from james bridges contributed to their 
sons troubles im only just understanding how deeply hurt todd 
was she said 
actor conrad bain who played bridges adoptive father in the tv 
situation comedy diffrent strokes said bridges was angry and 
erratic toward the end of the series apparently because of 
financial problems and his parents divorce 
he was so sensitive bain said just the kind of kid you 
knew wasnt going to handle all the problems real well 
bridges made his first commercial at age 6 and starred in the 
television comedy series fish four years later at age 12 he 
landed the role as gary colemans brother willis on diffrent 
strokes 
johnnie cochran bridges attorney said his clients problems 
are common to young stars after their first big success 
like other child stars todd grew up faster than other kids 
cochran said when the series ended in 1985 the adjustment was 
real tough for him 
bridges had trouble getting work after the shows last season he 
began using drugs 18 months later mrs bridges said 
all of a sudden he started coming home looking strange she 
said 
bridges told his mother last june of his drug problem she said 
he spent one month in a drug rehabilitation center and stayed clean 
until november she said 
but his close friend jesse arragon was killed when his motorcycle 
hit a passing truck prompting bridges to take his first drink in 
six months that night mrs bridges said 
that was the last straw mrs bridges said after that he 
began living with those hoodlums in south central los angeles he 
got so crazy i almost called an insane asylum to pick him up i was 
afraid he would die out there

about 30 leftist rebels lounge in 
the shade of tileroofed porches in the center of this farming town 
taking some time to relax while the government considers their 
proposal to take part in elections 
the fighters some as young as 13 savor soft drinks and snacks 
out of cellophane bags flirt with the towns shy girls cradle 
babies not seen for weeks or months play cards with the townfolk 
three rebels one of them missing half an arm from a prematurely 
exploded grenade kick a soccer ball in the cobbled street 
there has been a sharp decline in fighting since the farabundo 
marti national liberation front said last month that it would 
participate in presidential elections if the march 19 balloting is 
postponed for six months 
the insurgents have also declared a complete truce during the 
meeting of five central american presidents taking place in el 
salvador today and tuesday 
as the lazy afternoon in las flores last week showed the 
guerrillas have been permitted at least a brief respite from their 
arduous life in the mountains 
maria eusebia benavides 65 was looking for the son she hadnt 
seen in eight years among the men lounging in the plaza 
sitting on a rock beneath its only shade tree she cast glances 
full of tentative hope at a tall guerrilla fighter who regarded her 
with equal anxiety 
after a few awkward minutes the rebel leaned his m16 against a 
wall and crossed the 20 yards of sunbaked square separating him 
from mrs benavides 
madre he said as she sure now that they were face to face 
stood 
my son she said 
mrs benavides and her son who goes by the nom de guerre ramon 
embraced 
i didnt recognize him at first mrs benavides said later 
patting her son on the knee as they sat on a stoop smiling a 
campesino smile with more gaps than teeth she said he was just a 
kid when he went away 
ramon was on rampr because the insurgents initiate most combat in 
the nineyearold war against the usbacked government that has 
claimed an estimated 65000 lives 
the jan 24 guerrilla proposal was a dramatic turnabout the 
insurgents would participate in elections if they were postponed and 
if other security and antifraud conditions were met 
the reduction in attacks in recent weeks prevents the guerrillas 
enemies from accusing them of extending an olive branch with one 
hand while delivering blows with the other 
ramon took from his knapsack a photograph wrapped in plastic of a 
young woman and a baby this is your grandson and 
daughterinlaw he said handing his mother the picture 
mrs benavides told of their frustrated attempt at a reunion last 
october advised by a guerrilla correo boys and girls used as 
messengers that ramon would come down from the mountains to las 
flores she made the arduous 10hour bus trip from her southern 
province 
she waited three days in vain before going home the day she 
left he arrived in town 
since no one could give me news of him i thought he was 
probably dead im so happy to be able to see him now said the old 
woman her skin rough and wrinkled from decades of fieldwork im 
in poor health and i know it will be the last time 
if the guerrilla proposal is rejected as appears likely the 
lull that allows reunions is likely to end the rebels say they will 
resume battle with a vengeance 
the people will realize the government and armed forces are not 
interested in peace theyll see there is no alternative but to 
escalate the struggle said olga a midlevel guerrilla officer 
who uses no other name 
at long intervals bombs exploded on the far side of a hill 
outside las flores 35 miles northwest of san salvador 
tests said olga indicating with her chin the direction of 
the blasts 
besides resting the guerrillas are manufacturing and stockpiling 
what they call popular armament mines mortars and grenades 
they make with pipes powder wood rope burlap nails and anything 
else that works 
though they have not definitively rejected it the salvadoran 
armed forces and the government of president jose napoleon duarte 
and have reacted coolly to the guerrilla proposal 
and though the bush administration has called the guerrillas 
proposal a step forward there appears to be little chance the 
overture will prosper

a potential battle is brewing between congress 
and the bush administration over plans to transfer to japan 7 
billion in advanced aircraft technology developed for the us air 
forces f16 fighter 
the controversy over japans proposed fsx warplane casts a shadow 
over last weeks summit visit by prime minister noboru takeshita 
the first foreign leader to be hosted at the white house since 
president bush took office 
under the pending agreement st louisbased general dynamics 
would join forces with japans mitsubishi heavy industries to 
codevelop and coproduce a newgeneration japanese fighter for 
deployment in the late 1990s 
proponents say the deal is the best that could be negotiated in 
view of japanese refusal to buy wholly americanbuilt planes and 
that it fosters beneficial technology transfer in both directions 
with japan while generating income and jobs for us industry 
critics however contend the agreement amounts to a 
technological giveaway that will enable the japanese to compete more 
effectively against this country in the global aviation market they 
argue that tokyo should purchase americanmade fighters to help 
offset the 50 billion us trade deficit with japan 
the fsx issue surfaced during a capitol hill meeting friday 
between takeshita and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine minority leader bob dole rkan and a group of other 
senators involved with trade and foreign affairs 
during the closeddoor meeting questions over the proposed deal 
were raised by sen john c danforth rmo according to japanese 
officials who briefed reporters after the session 
danforth was among 12 senators who signed a letter to bush urging 
that his administration conduct a complete review of the fsx 
agreement which had been negotiated under the reagan administration 
the letter organized by sens jeff bingaman dnm and jesse 
helms rnc said the deal posed complex issues including defense 
burdensharing and the longterm impact on the health and 
competitiveness of the american aerospace industry the only high 
technology area in which the united states remains the undisputed 
world leader 
we are requesting that you order a complete review of the fsx 
program within the administration including the departments of 
commerce labor and energy as well as the office of the trade 
representative and the white house science office the senators 
told bush 
after the letter went to the white house secretary of state 
james a baker iii said at a meeting thursday with japanese foreign 
minister sousuke uno that the administration was in fact reviewing 
the jet fighter project and no decision on it had been made 
japanese officials said uno urged baker to process a license 
quickly and notify congress of the technology export the japanese 
have said they want to start the project before march 31 the end of 
their fiscal year 
a memorandum of understanding on the fsx was signed last november 
by us and japanese officials once the administration finally 
certifies the agreement congress would have 30 days in which it 
could vote to disapprove the deal 
fueling the controversy over the fsx was an article jan 29 in 
the washington post by clyde v prestowitz a former commerce 
department official and outspoken advocate of a hardline us 
stance in negotiations with japan 
prestowitz said the deal would increase the us burden of 
defending japan by diverting scarce japanese defense dollars 
from immediate procurement needs into a 10year project 
also he wrote it will transfer technology developed at great 
expense to us taxpayers at very low cost to a country whose 
primary interest is not defense but catching up with america in 
aircraft and other hightechnology industries 
alvin a spivak a spokesman for general dynamics responded that 
under the deal american industry including the no 2 us defense 
contractor and other companies will receive 35 percent to 45 
percent of the 12 billion being spent on development of the fsx as 
well as a comparable share of the 5 billion production program 
the agreement offers a chance to provide jobs for american 
workers and to bring many hundreds of millions of dollars into the 
american economy that otherwise would stay in japan if they were to 
develop their own fighter aircraft he said 
on capitol hill sen alan j dixon dill called the fsx deal 
a terrible mistake he said he hoped congress will be able to 
discourage the administration from following this course before we 
have a bitter fight about it 
sen alfonse m damato rny said bluntly about the deal 
it stinks its about time we had the courage to stand up and 
say were not going to take this any longer 
damato said if the agreement goes through what will take 
place is that 10 years from now they the japanese will build the 
superior airframes they will have the superior technology that 
weve helped them obtain by turning over some of our technical base 
as well in this deal 
in the house rep mel levine dcalif said he was very 
disturbed about the fsx technology transfer 
we cant prevent the japanese from building their own domestic 
aerospace and defense industries he said but i see no reason 
for us to hand them the blueprints at a very modest price

more than 2000 people invaded a housing 
development to see a little american bird the first golden winged 
warbler recorded in europe 
at one stage sunday police with bullhorns had to control the 
crowd as the birdwatchers equipped with binoculars telescopes and 
cameras strained for a glimpse of the warbler at maidstone kent 
40 miles southeast of london 
some of the visitors were from belgium and the netherlands 
ian mills a british visitor who traveled 270 miles to be there 
said ive been all over the country to look at rare birds and a 
crowd of a few hundred is not unusual but ive never seen anything 
like this 
there were well over 2000 people present when i was there and 
at times roads were choked and traffic could hardly move he said 
this must have been the largest gathering of birdwatchers to 
look at one bird there has ever been said richard millington a 
spokesman for the birdline telephone information service whose 
report about the warbler drew the crowds 
the warbler is thought to have been blown across the atlantic in 
the fall of 1988 while migrating from its breeding territory in the 
northeastern united states and southeast canada to colombia and 
guatemala for the winter

the astronaut who commanded the first 
postchallenger mission was not medically qualified to fly and 
another astronaut who is colorblind received a waiver so he can go 
into space a newspaper reported sunday 
the johnson space center medical qualification board recommended 
last year that space shuttle discovery commander frederick h hauck 
be disqualified because of kidney stone problems but was overruled 
the houston chronicle reported 
sources who asked not to be named also told the newspaper that 
daniel c brandenstein chief of the astronaut corps failed an eye 
test in 1987 but received a waiver to fly again the newspaper said 
in both cases the sources said rear adm richard h truly 
nasas associate administrator for flight operations at washington 
headquarters interceded 
the sources are active members in flight crew operations and in 
the space and life sciences directorate which includes the flight 
medicine clinic and medical operations branch at the space center 
the newspaper said 
truly declined to comment on individual medical cases friday 
i try to do two things truly said i try to make sure from 
the management view that the medical process works that 
individual health problems are treated fairly by the medical 
qualification board and management and secondly to protect the 
rights of the individual involved and the major objective is to get 
healthy astronauts to the launch pad for the mission 
trulys spokeswoman sarah keegan said sunday she also could not 
comment on specific medical cases 
johnson space center director aaron cohen said neither rick 
hauck nor dan brandenstein nor any other astronaut for that matter 
has received preferential treatment in the consideration of 
medical issues 
during october interviews and again last week hauck and 
brandenstein would not discuss their medical records the chronicle 
said 
sources said the space medicine board grounded hauck early in 
1988 because of a kidney stone problem but the recommendation was 
later overruled and subsequently reversed 
brandenstein failed the farnsworth lantern color perception test 
in 1987 sources said but received the only waiver ever issued to 
an astronaut for colorblindness 
some of the most important of about 2000 circuit breakers and 
switches on the shuttle orbiter are colorcoded including some of 
those used in the launch and reentry a source said 
brandenstein is scheduled to command the columbia space shuttle 
in november he has flown on two previous shuttle flights in 1983 
and in 1985 
hauck flew on shuttle flights in 1983 and 1984 as well as 
commanding the discovery flight last september he has said the 
discovery flight was his last shuttle mission 
hauck had a kidney stone dissolved at houstons methodist 
hospital last april but the process doesnt guarantee that another 
kidney stone will not form

nineteen months after the united 
states joined an effort to oust manuel antonio noriega panamas 
defense chief remains in power dominating a dispirited and divided 
opposition 
however with panama sinking deeper into economic crisis both 
his supporters and opponents feel the nation must reach an 
accommodation with the new bush administration 
we have to talk to the gringos said tomas altamirano duque 
a congressman and uncle of carlos duque the noriegabacked 
candidate in the may 7 presidential election 
i think bush is more intelligent than reagan and can be more 
practical 
jorge richa a government critic and former president of the 
industrialists association declared we cannot maintain an 
antagonistic relationship with the united states indefinitely 
but secretary of state james a baker iii has asserted that it 
is difficult to make progress on uspanamanian issues as long as 
gen noriega remains in charge 
washington says noriega reneged on deals to leave the country 
last year 
panamas opposition which began an effort to oust noriega with 
us support in the summer of 1987 now finds itself weaker than 
ever 
the united states indicted noriega in february 1988 alleging he 
protected drugrunners in panama and conspired to distribute 
narcotics 
when president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire noriega later 
that month noriega had panamas congress replace delvalle 
the united states which still recognizes delvalle as president 
then imposed economic sanctions on panama in an attempt to force 
noriega to resign 
it was a total failure said a radio station director who 
demanded anonymity for fear of reprisals it was a bluff and 
noriega knew it was a bluff noriega knows the gringos he has 
worked for them 
noriega appealed to antiyankee sentiment portraying himself as 
a david fighting the us goliath in campaignstyle speeches in the 
countryside 
the panamanian government blames the united states for the 
economic crisis and the opposition says the sanctions only gave the 
government an excuse for poor economic stewardship 
in 1987 there was a 200 million budget deficit said 
industrialist carlos valencia the economy was worn out 
stimulated only by massive borrowing 
until a year ago the construction industry had boomed and 
international banking and business through free trade zones had 
spurred the economy 
in 1988 the gross national product declined by 10 percent 
unemployment rose 22 percent and economic activity fell by 32 
percent 
panama also experienced a severe cash shortage and has stopped 
payments on a nearly 5 billion foreign debt 
we estimate that 60000 people lost their jobs in 1988 said 
valencia 
the opposition has not been able to make political strides from 
the economic hard times in this country of 2 million people its 
only leader with popular appeal arnulfo arias madrid died in 
august leaving the opposition squabbling over his successor 
arias thrice overthrown by the military between 1941 and 1968 
was the only political figure with wide appeal besides populist 
military dictator omar torrijos who died in 1979 in a plane crash 
noriega considers himself torrijos political and military heir 
in a dinner speech jan 17 to roaring crowd of businessmen 
military officers and government officials noriega warned of a 
possible reduction in the bureaucracy and even the elimination of 
some government agencies 
panamas economic problems require a political agreement here and 
abroad said richa the government alone cannot negotiate with the 
united states the opposition alone cannot do it either we need 
unity 
maybe under bush both sides can get an opportunity to save face 
and start again the united states cannot maintain this situation of 
economic deterioration of panama there is too much at stake 
the us maintains several military bases in panama which are 
estimated to put nearly 200 million a year into the panamanian 
economy under treaties negotiated in 1977 the united states must 
turn over control of the panama canal and vacate the installations 
by dec 31 1999 
noriega maintains that the united states wants him out of office 
because he opposes renegotiation of the treaties 
valencia expressed another opposition fear 
we need us economic aid to rebuild the economy but we hope 
the united states does not make a deal with noriega behind the 
oppositions back he said 
the main opposition parties have joined behind a single 
presidential candidate guillermo endara 
there is no real freedom said ricardo arias calderon leader 
of the christian democrat party and vice presidential candidate on 
the opposition ticket but the opposition to noriega is so great 
he will be buried by the votes of the people 
but the government has closed opposition media and sent scores of 
opposition leaders into exile 
in his speech noriega said the military will remain a vital part 
of the nation even if the opposition should happen by some 
chance to win

the dollar was stronger against the japanese yen 
monday while stock prices declined moderately in reaction to a hike 
in the us prime lending rate 
the dollar ended the days trading at 12830 yen up 065 yen 
from fridays close of 12765 yen it traded in a range of 
1282012863 yen and was quoted at 12850 yen at midday 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues a 5356point winner friday closed 14667 points 
or 04 percent lower at 3198532 it finished last week at a record 
high 3213199 points 
a hike in the prime lending rate from 105 percent to 11 percent 
by many american commercial banks and the news of a 
higherthanexpected us producer price index for january both 
announced friday combined to spur the dollars rally said a dealer 
at the bank of tokyo 
the dollar dipped slightly in midmorning selling but rebounded 
somewhat later trading was slow the dealer said 
the dollars direction hinges on what happens to overseas 
interest rates so players here are inclined in the absence of any 
compelling incentives to trade during tokyo business hours to let 
the european and us markets take the lead the dealer added 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the prime lending rate is closely watched because bankers use it 
as a basis for calculating interest on corporate loans and for 
determining various types of fixed and adjustablerate consumer 
loans including home equity loans 
higher us interest rates make the dollar more attractive to 
foreign investors but tend to have a negative impact on stock 
prices 
kazuhiro nakamura of wako securities said tokyo share prices 
declined in reaction to the interest rate hike and also to the 
defeat of the ruling liberal democratic party sunday in a closely 
watched parliamentary byelection 
the election was seen as an indication of public sentiment toward 
the ldp following the passage of a longsought tax reform package 
last december that included introduction of an unpopular 3 percent 
sales tax

say what you will it about the savings and loan 
crisis it has done wonders for the ampersand 
vaguely old fashioned the ampersand that curly little symbol 
that stands for and seemed to be in a decline until the 
financial difficulties of the sampl industry put it on every front 
page for some reason sampls are always abbreviated with an 
ampersand just as footballs super bowls are numbered with roman 
numerals 
like everything else the ampersand has a history according to 
robert hendrickson who wrote the encyclopedia of word and phrase 
origins it was invented by marcus tiro a freed slave and secretary 
to cicero a roman statesman orator and author 
tiros job was taking down ciceros dictation cicero talked 
fast so tiro created the first known system of shorthand including 
the ampersand tiros tironian notes saw wide use in europe for 
nearly a thousand years 
the amp itself was just a quick way of writing et which means 
and in latin the name ampersand is a corruption of the term 
and per se and which means as follows 
the harper dictionary of contemporary usage by william morris and 
mary morris laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and 
abandon their ampersands 
the morrises note that the ad firm of batten barton durstin amp 
osborne switched to simply batten barton durstin osborne 
dropping the ampersand and losing part of the charm which led 
heywood broun to say that the corporate name sounded to him like a 
beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps 
in any event the morrises getting down to business decree that 
the ampersand is to be avoided in writing of formal or semiformal 
nature save for the most impromptu personal notes 
however the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback even 
without the sampl crisis spur of conspicuousness says rick bragdon 
senior vice president in a san francisco firm which does name 
development for companies changing their images 
he said after stiff debate during a yearlong identity program 
for pacific gas and electric it was decided to abandon the and 
in pg and e its old symbol in favor of pgampe 
we had to resolve once and for all how to represent and 
bragdon said 
there were a whole variety of constituencies lots of people 
wanted and and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very 
discrete plus sign would be modern and hip we advocated the 
ampersand as an inalienable part of the name a beautiful stylized 
ampersand 
however to show how shortlived these victories are bragdon 
said his own firm has changed its name abandoning an ampersand in 
the process it used to be sampo consultants 
the final decision was to go with addison design consultants 
over the objections of founder and chairman bob ohrenschalls in the 
old days he was the fellow behind the amp

the episcopal churchs approval of women clergy two years later 
said harris consecration was a major step for the denomination 
i think we still have a long way to go she added my 
experience in the episcopal church is that it really does take some 
pushing and i doubt that thats over 
the ceremony made harris the first woman bishop in the three 
denominations that believe in apostolic succession that church 
leadership can be traced to the apostles commissioned by jesus the 
denominations are the roman catholic eastern orthodox and anglican 
churches the episcopal church is one of 28 national branches of the 
anglican communion 
in her first sermon as a bishop harris told 400 worshipers at 
the cathedral church of st paul on sunday to resist the temptation 
to shut their eyes to issues such as racism and aids 
if jesus had not taken risks we would not be saved said 
harris who became a priest in 1980 in philadelphia if the 
diocese of massachusetts had decided to play it safe i would not be 
here wearing a broche and a chimere and a pectoral cross 
while nearly all of the more than 8000 people who packed the 
convention center shouted their approval others fought to the end 
to preserve the allmale tradition 
john jamieson representing a group of conservative episcopalians 
called the prayer book society said her pretended consecration 
holds church laws in contempt 
the rev james hopkinson cupit jr of new york city said the 
election of a woman may represent an intractable impediment to 
relations with other the roman catholic and eastern orthodox 
churches 
the election of the 58yearold harris as suffragan or assistant 
bishop of the episcopal diocese of massachusetts in september has 
been the churchs most controversial one in recent years 
in addition to being the first woman bishop harris who is 
black is thought to be the first bishop elected after a divorce and 
the first us bishop at least in modern times to lack both a 
seminary degree and an undergraduate college degree she studied 
theology through correspondence courses and with tutors and worked 
in corporate public relations 
while approval of a locally elected bishop is usually perfunctory 
for the national church harris barely won approval from the 
majority of standing committees and head bishops of the 118 
dioceses by saturday only 61 standing committees and 66 bishops 
had given their consent 
but that did not matter to harris when the bishops gathered 
around her to consecrate her into their ranks 
i felt during the laying on of hands a part of the ongoing 
history of the church i truly felt in apostolic succession at this 
moment she said 
i thought it was absolutely incredibly beautiful and moving 
said the rev elizabeth weisner a boston priest who is the author 
of pilgrim and pioneer a journey with god 
she said the diocese has a rough road ahead but i think its 
going to be alright 
for many women the service held a special meaning 
millicent carroll a 66yearold church member from connecticut 
cried when the bishops mitre was placed on harris head 
we didnt think there would be a woman much less a black 
woman said carroll who is black 
i feel very very happy in my life i can see the first woman 
bishop said the rev florence timoi li 81 the first 
clergywoman in the anglican communion it made me hopeful things 
are realized now 
ms li stopped functioning as a priest in 1946 in response to 
pressure from anglican bishops outside china where she was ordained 
in 1944 but she never gave up her holy orders on saturday she and 
other pioneer clergywomen helped consecrate harris 
advocates for women in the ministry said the struggle is not over 
as of december 1987 according to the episcopal church center 
there were 868 active women priests in the 25 millionmember 
church the figure is less than the 1519 women clergy reported by 
the 3 millionmember presbyterian church and the 1460 women clergy 
in the 17 millionmember united church of christ in 1986 
the significant piece is it harris consecration is another 
turning point it isnt the end said marge christie president of 
the episcopal womens caucus both racism and sexism are still 
serious problems in the church as in the world 
christie said many women are becoming assistants or getting 
parttime jobs at churches but it is still almost impossible 
for women to be elected rectors at large churches

with the shepherds crook robes and miter of an 
episcopal bishop the rev barbara harris moves out into a flock 
divided over the question of whether she has the right to hold her 
newly acquired rank 
to the duties of ordaining priests granting communion and 
serving as a liaison among parishes in one of the nations largest 
episcopal dioceses barbara clementine harris must add the burden of 
convincing many doubters within her church and other christian 
denominations that she is suited to her new role 
it is a challenge that harris no stranger to controversy says 
she is ready to take on 
following her consecration saturday as suffragan or assistant 
bishop in the boston episcopal diocese harris pledged to try to 
heal the divisions in the church created by her new rank 
all of us in the office of bishop will be reaching out to as 
many people in the diocese and the whole church as we possibly 
can said harris her voice raspy from a cold i feel good im 
looking forward to getting on with my ministry 
harris 58 became the first woman bishop in any branch of 
christianity that traces its bishops directly to the time of christ 
harris has been involved in church activities throughout her 
life but the first step toward her historic new position may have 
been taken in 1974 when harris led a procession of the 
philadelphia 11 a group of women episcopalians who were ordained 
priests a full two years before the ordination of women was approved 
by the whole church 
i was very much involved in the planning of that service 
said harris who was born and raised in philadelphia it deeply 
affected me 
harris career in private business and the church led her to 
prisons corporate board rooms divorce court and the editorial desk 
of a feisty liberal publication 
because that path did not include a college or seminary degree 
and because of what some view as her extreme leftwing views to 
say nothing of her gender harris consecration touched off heated 
debate 
the issue of a woman becoming a bishop would have engendered 
debate throughout christendom regardless who was nominated but 
harris provoked all the more discussion because of her background 
some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as 
well as her sex said harris who is black 
during the 1960s harris became involved in the civil rights 
movement and participated in the selma ala march led by the rev 
martin luther king jr for a decade beginning in 1958 she worked in 
a public relations firm and beginning in 1968 for sun oil cos 
public relations department ending her career there in 1980 as a 
senior staff consultant 
that year harris assumed the robes of an episcopal priest and 
began a career that took her to counseling sessions in prisons and 
sermons in a city parish in 1984 harris became executive director 
of the episcopal church publishing co an organization not 
officially sanctioned by the church but one with a considerable 
voice through its publication the witness 
it was in the pages of this monthly magazine that harris became 
known to a wider audience through her regular editorials 
she wrote editorials against south africas apartheid policies 
and us aid to rebels in nicaragua she wrote in favor of 
homosexual rights and an end to church discrimination against 
homosexuals she also lambasted conservative wings of the church on 
many occasions sometimes angering as much with her style as with 
the substance of her commentary 
in 1963 after three years of marriage harris divorced raymond 
rollins which also was cited by some critics 
she likes classical music and drinks an occasional glass of 
chablis she prefers any kind of gourmet food but also likes 
soul food especially blackeyed peas i like cooking up a storm 
for a large crowd she said

barbara harris has taken her place as the first 
woman bishop in church that traces its heritage directly to early 
days of christianity despite a stormy break with catholicism during 
the reign of englands henry viii 
the 28 millionmember us episcopal church developed from the 
church of england and is one of the several independent national 
churches that belong to the worldwide anglican communion 
english settlers brought the church to virginia at the turn of 
the 17th century it became a separate group when it adopted a 
constitution and religious laws and a revision of the book of common 
prayer in philadelphia in 1789 
the church of england had separated from the roman catholic 
church in the 16th century after henry viii was denied an annulment 
to his marriage to catherine of aragon who had no sons 
henry secretly married his second of six wives anne boleyn 
rejected the popes authority in england and appointed thomas 
cranmer archbishop of canterbury cranmer approved henrys annulment 
in 1534 parliament declared that the pope had no authority in 
england and made the church of england a separate institution 
the communion contends that its clergy are directly linked to the 
apostles of christ through an unbroken series of ceremonies other 
denominations claims the same kind of historic succession including 
the roman catholic church 
the episcopal church voted in 1976 to allow women priests since 
then about 1200 have been ordained 
the church is governed by a permanent executive council and by 
the general convention which meets every three years

moodaltering chemical also found in the human brain 
win a lottery get a promotion fall in love especially fall 
in love and your pea level shoots up youre optimistic sociable 
and peppy according to chocolate an illustrated history by 
marcia and fredrick morton but if things go wrong especially if 
something goes wrong in your love life you turn listless and 
depressed because your pea level is down 
the taste of chocolate is a sensual pleasure in itself 
existing in the same world as sex sex therapist ruth westheimer 
wrote in her column ask dr ruth

these items from a questionnaire that measures 
beliefs about alcohol are among the most predictive of risk for 
problem drinking says researcher mark goldman 
but he cautions that risk is indicated by the overall pattern of 
responses to all 90 items rather than to individual ones 
subjects are asked to mark true or false such items as 
people understand things better when they are drinking alcohol 
its easier to play sports after a few drinks of alcohol 
drinking alcohol makes people feel more alert

americans widely disbelieve the palestine 
liberation organizations claim to have abandoned terrorism but 
favor the us dialogue with the plo and the establishment of a 
palestinian state a poll shows 
nearly seven in 10 respondents to a media generalassociated 
press survey approved of the united states holding talks with the 
plo and six in 10 said israel should follow suit 
but just 6 percent of the 1162 adults said they believed the 
plos recent renunciation of terrorism and 74 percent said they 
thought the group only made that claim for political gain the rest 
were unsure 
the poll indicated other misgivings about the plo respondents 
were split on whether the organization would coexist with israel or 
still seek to destroy it regardless of its recognition of the 
jewish state in december 
still the public endorsed the basic tenet of the palestinian 
cause sixtytwo percent said the palestinians should have their own 
country eleven percent disgreed twentyseven percent had no 
opinion 
the national poll was conducted jan 412 the month after plo 
chairman yasser arafat said his group was recognizing israel and 
renouncing terrorism the united states responded to arafats move 
by opening its first official talks with the plo 
israel rejected the plo declarations as a ploy and continued its 
refusal to negotiate with the organization the poll found 
acceptance of that position although most favored such talks 67 
percent said the united states should not try to force israel to 
talk with the plo 
but the survey also found some frustration with israels 
supporters in the united states 35 percent said they had too much 
influence on us policy twenty percent said propalestinan groups 
had too much influence 
roughly a quarter of the respondents had no view on many of the 
questions reflecting the distance of mideast issues from the daily 
concerns of many americans significantly more men expressed 
opinions than did women 
bettereducated respondents were more likely to favor dealings 
with the plo while 67 percent overall approved of usplo talks 
for example that number swelled to 79 percent of collegeeducated 
respondents 
six in 10 of the mosteducated group those who had done 
postgraduate study said israel should allow the creation of a 
palestinian state on land it occupies in exchange for recognition 
from the plo among all respondents just 44 percent agreed 
but respondents in all education levels doubted that the plo has 
given up terrorism and 63 percent overall said some group other 
than the plo could represent the palestinians in negotiations with 
israel 
arab countries have declared the plo the palestinians only 
legitimate representative israel has said it would negotiate with 
palestinians but not with plo members because the organizations 
charter calls for israels destruction 
onethird of the respondents thought the plo wants to destroy 
israel about a third believed the plo would coexist with israel 
the last third werent sure more of the mosteducated group 55 
percent said the plo would coexist with israel 
still six in 10 of that group and five in 10 overall said the 
united states should not recognize the palestinian state the plo 
declared in november the rest split between support for recognition 
and no opinion

a desert power plant burns enough cow dung to 
electrify up to 20000 homes thanks to 250000 cattle 37 million 
in taxexempt bonds and an environmentalistlawyer seeking his 
fortune as an entremanure 
its the first commercial power plant that burns only cattle 
chips for fuel although smaller facilities digest manure to 
produce methane to generate electricity said will parish founder 
and president of national energy associates inc 
parish 36 left his job with a san francisco law firm to start 
the mill valley company which he said is dedicated to doing well 
by doing good by building profitable but socially and 
environmentally responsible energy projects 
the 46 million 17megawatt mesquite lake resource recovery 
project financed by the bonds plus 9 million from investors is 
located next to its fuel supply cattle feedlots near imperial in 
the desert about 110 miles east of san diego it fired up in 
november 1987 and began continuous online electricity production 
last october 
it truly is a unique plant said bill mccroskey a project 
development manager for southern california edison co 
we are presently buying power from them under a 30year 
contract the plant satisfactorily passed its operating test last 
fall they are considered a reliable energy source 
the plant runs at 70 percent to 85 percent of its maximum 
capacity as its construction company lurgi corp of frankfurt west 
germany tweaks it toward full net capacity of 15 megawatts 
enough to power 15000 to 20000 homes using 800 to 900 tons of 
manure daily parish said the plant runs on the other 2 megawatts 
it produces 
parish said the plants output represents annual savings of 
300000 barrels of oil that otherwise would be burned for power and 
relieves pressure on imperial valley landfills 
until the entrepreneur came along feedlot owners paid to have 
manure carted away and dumped it has little value as fertilizer 
because it contains too much salt and weed seeds now nea buys the 
dung for 1 per ton from 15 feedlots 
ive been called a manure mogul parish joked my alma 
mater referred to me in the alumni notes as the class of 1975s 
first entremanure 
loaders scoop up manure from some 250000 cattle and about 60 
trucks deliver it to the mesquite lake plant where we stack it 
like a precious commodity parish said 
conveyor belts feed 40 tons of manure an hour into the plant 
where it is dried and dropped into special furnaces the heat 
produces more than 150000 pounds of steam hourly to drive a turbine 
and electric generator 
because the power plant qualified as a waste recovery operation 
the california pollution control financing authority issued 372 
million in bonds to help finance construction nea raised 9 million 
more by forming a limited partnership repayment of the 20year 
investmentgrade bonds is guaranteed by national westminster bank 
usa 
we have seen a number of unusual proposals and this is clearly 
one of them keith seegmiller the financing authoritys deputy 
executive secretary said by phone from sacramento 
parish has called the plant a cash cow because manure costs 
a penny a kilowatt hour and we sell electricity at 7 cents a 
kilowatt hour that translates on an annual basis to a fuel cost of 
about 2 million and gross sales of about 10 million leaving 8 
million to cover other expenses and profits 
while taxfree bonds are attractive parish said it wasnt always 
easy soliciting partners to invest a minimum of 50000 each 
i got questions like what will happen if the cattle get 
constipated parish recalled 
the power plant yields about 160 tons of ash daily but parish 
expects to be selling all of it by years end as an additive to 
paving materials and fertilizer and an absorbent to soak up toxic 
contaminants from geothermal energy wells 
nea now is building a 60 million 17megawatt power plant next 
to the manure plant it will burn manure wood waste and various 
agricultural wastes

every few months david breed loads a bus 
with white people many of whom have lived in tulsa all their lives 
and takes them on a tour of the citys northside 
this is the other tulsa where most of the citys poorest 
families live most of the citys lowincome housing is located 
much of the citys crime occurs and many of the citys vacant 
buildings crumble under neglect 
this is also where most of the citys blacks live 
the tour is really designed to take people out of their way to 
show them a part of tulsa they otherwise would never see said 
breed who is a white volunteer in several groups working on 
problems in north tulsa these problems really do exist here 
city officials and black leaders hope a proposed change in 
government that residents will vote on tuesday will open city hall 
to northside blacks for the first time and begin redressing some of 
those problems 
tulsa was once referred to as a promised land by freed slaves 
escaping the south but a 1987 civil rights lawsuit filed by the 
national association for the advancement of colored people claims 
the city has discriminated against blacks for decades 
the citys 1908 charter established a commission form of 
government with commissioners elected atlarge a black from the 
northside has never been elected 
the lawsuit filed after the naacp won a similar case against 
officials in springfield ill claims tulsas 42000 blacks are 
ignored in this predominantly white city of 360000 that lawsuit 
could become moot if voters approve a new charter calling for a 
strong mayor and a council with members drawn from nine districts 
including one majority black district 
with the very force of his knowledge his influence and yes 
his role in city government a black councilman will make a 
difference to every aspect of this community said jim goodwin a 
black attorney assisting the naacp 
tulsa officials vehemently deny the city has discriminated 
against blacks they say the proposed new charter is an attempt to 
introduce a more efficient form of government not a response to the 
naacp 
still they said a history of segregation has had its effect on 
the citys largest minority 
theres no doubt but that there was a system of segregation 
that effectively kept blacks from being active participants in 
the local government game in this community finance commissioner 
gary watts said as to how rapidly we have opened up as a 
community since the late 1960s i think there would be a great deal 
of debate on that perception 
im still not ready to say that representation has been denied 
on a racial basis i dont believe that mayor rodger randle said 
blacks trace the racial problems to events that led to a bloody 
1921 riot after that tulsa complied with state segregation laws at 
least through the 1960s 
the riot left a legacy of segregation it left a legacy that 
tulsa would tolerate racism said dr charles christopher a black 
leader it has left a second class of citizens that has not been 
treated fairly it has left a legacy of two separate school 
systems 
this city has been so successful in segregation most tulsans 
dont even acknowledge its here some probably dont even realize 
it said state rep don ross a black native of north tulsa but 
just walk through city hall walk through any company go into any 
of the industrial parks in this community and youll see it 
this is not the legal discrimination that i knew as a child 
said ross who was born in 1941 there is today a more rigid 
covert line of discrimination that is more damaging 
a 1985 city development study highlighted the damage in the 
northside home to threequarters of tulsas blacks it found the 
median family income in north tulsa is only about half that of the 
rest of tulsa county and that the median value of homes in the area 
was less than half that in the rest of the county unemployment was 
twice as high as the rest of the county and twice as many of the 
areas workers held minimumwage service jobs 
the mayor said he is optimistic voters will embrace the charter 
despite the failure of four previous attempts at change since 1954 
because many people realize the limitations of the current system

the astronaut who commanded the first shuttle 
mission since the challenger disaster had a kidney stone which 
should have kept him from space a newspaper reported 
another astronaut who is scheduled to command a november mission 
is colorblind a reason for flight disqualification but received a 
waiver to fly the houston chronicle reported sunday 
the johnson space center medical qualification board recommended 
last year that discovery commander frederick h hauck be 
disqualified because of the kidney stone but was overruled by rear 
adm richard h truly nasas associate administrator for flight 
operations in washington the newspaper reported 
the board also said daniel c brandenstein chief of the 
astronaut corps failed an eye test in 1987 but received a waiver 
after truly interceded the newspaper reported 
a chief nasa administrator said no rules were broken in allowing 
the astronauts to fly 
there have been no special dispensations and there has been no 
favoritism and there have been no medically disqualified astronauts 
assigned to the space shuttle missions said aaron cohen johnson 
space centers director 
the newspaper said it obtained the information from members of 
the flight crew operations which includes the astronaut office and 
the space and life sciences directorate which includes the flight 
medicine clinic and medical operations branch at the space center 
truly declined to comment on individual medical cases but said 
i try to do two things i try to make sure from the management 
view that the medical process works that individual health 
problems are treated fairly by the medical qualification board and 
management and secondly to protect the rights of the individual 
involved and the major objective is to get healthy astronauts to 
the launch pad for the mission 
during october interviews and last week hauck and brandenstein 
would not discuss their medical records the newspaper said 
the space medicine board grounded hauck early last year because 
of a kidney stone problem the recommendation was overruled and 
subsequently reversed the newspaper reported 
brandenstein failed the farnsworth lantern color perception test 
in 1987 but received the only waiver ever issued to an astronaut 
for color blindness it said 
the approximately 2000 circuit breakers and switches on the 
shuttle orbiter are colorcoded and some are used in the launch and 
reentry an unidentified source told the newspaper 
brandenstein is scheduled to command the columbia space shuttle 
in november he has flown on two previous shuttle flights in 1983 
and in 1985 
hauck flew on shuttle flights in 1983 and 1984 as well as 
commanding discoverys september mission he has said that the 
discovery flight was his last shuttle flight 
the chronicle said hauck underwent a lithotripsy at houstons 
methodist hospital in april to dissolve a kidney stone the process 
however doesnt guarantee that another kidney stone will not form

whose magnitudes ranged from 24 to 30 on the richter scale 
the sixth quake struck at 1201 am and had a magnitude of 30 
on the richter scale according to the united states geological 
surveys national earthquake information center in golden colo 
it was centered west of the golden gate bridge the same area as

when the first two black families moved into the 
virtually allwhite housing projects of south boston last summer 
they were accompanied by police 
after weeks of protests by neighbors and extensive news coverage 
city officials feared a replay of the 1970s riots over the busing of 
blacks to schools in the working class section instead more than 
six months later the two families report little enmity and much 
hospitality 
im just a neighbor like anyone else said elizabeth 
clinkscales 37 who lives in a threebedroom apartment with her 
20yearold daughter anjanette and grandson jahman 4 
i havent experienced much animosity since ive been here i 
think south bostons in a healing process now 
the move for clinkscales and the family of bessie payne 36 was 
made easier because the two have been friends since high school 
coincidentally they were both given eviction notices about the 
same time and applied for emergency housing with the boston housing 
authority 
my main focus at that time was not to become homeless not to 
go into a shelter said clinkscales who works as an assistant at 
a daycare center and pays 225 a month for her apartment to me 
that was just as frightening as moving to south boston 
payne tells a similar story 
i couldnt see myself in a shelter with the children and i saw 
no reason to be when bha had a threebedroom apartment available 
payne said 
until recently the projects in the predominantly irish catholic 
neighborhood known as southie were 98 percent white and 2 percent 
nonblack minorities but since the clinkscales and paynes moved 
into southie several other black families have been placed in the 
projects 
it was in the same neighborhood separated from downtown by a 
harbor channel where years of protests erupted after courtordered 
busing in 1974 whites stoned buses of black children shuttled from 
the roxbury section 
after federal authorities told boston officials to desegregate 
the projects last year mayor raymond l flynn held meetings in 
south boston to urge acceptance of the plan instead they booed 
flynn a south boston native and called him a traitor 
when clinkscales and payne moved in last july the city had 
developed a longterm safety plan for them in case of trouble 
for the first week the two families were told to check in with 
police when they left their apartments and when they returned 
my image was that there was some prejudice here but im the 
type of person who realizes theres prejudice everywhere said 
clinkscales 
clinkscales and payne said in recent interviews that little has 
happened to make them feel like the targets of bigotry 
when i moved in i expected a lot of turbulence said payne 
37 who is an administrator at a church and shares her apartment 
with her son kimani poles 14 and daughter dadizi poles 9 
when it didnt happen i was really grateful i think the people 
here are willing to accept change now 
the two said they give each other moral support with daily phone 
calls yet the only disturbing incident for both came when 
teenagers once yelled racial slurs outside their apartments they 
said it occurred just once 
clinkscales daughter anjanette said she and her mother 
exchanged christmas gifts with the mahoney family next door and 
counts 18yearold kerry mahoney as a friend 
i was surprised at how nice they were said kerry mahoney 
who said she had never known a black family until the clinkscales 
moved in

the founder of recruit co and three other 
businessmen were arrested today in a stocktrading scandal that has 
shaken japans governing party and contributed to its loss in a 
special parliamentary election 
the countrys largest opposition party victorious in sundays 
byelection demanded today that prime minister noboru takeshita 
resign or dissolve parliament so the people can express their 
will about the recruit scandal 
takako doi head of the japan socialist party told parliament 
her partys victory in the election in fukuoka in southern japan 
showed that public has lost faith in the corruptiontainted 
takeshita adminstration 
the balloting was widely seen as a test of the damage done by the 
scandal 
takeshita refused to dissolve the legislature which would mean 
calling new elections for its lower house 
recruit reportedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares of 
stock at bargain prices to politicians their aides and other 
prominent people the purchasers then profited when the stocks were 
publicly traded and skyrocketed in value the scandal has also 
involved direct political donations by recruit 
prosecutors said they today arrested hiromasa ezoe founder and 
former chairman of the information services conglomerate also 
arrested were a vice president of a recruit subsidiary and to former 
officials of nippon telegraph and telephone japans largest company 
the recruit officials were arrested on suspicion of giving 
bribes the two nippon officials in connection with receiving 
bribes news reports said 
prosecutors said ezoe was taken from a hospital where he had been 
under treatment for exhaustion since the scandal was uncovered last 
summer 
three cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other prominent 
politicians and businessmen have since resigned in the scandal 
which has led to broader questions about political fundraising and 
links between business and politics 
the election sunday showed that people in fukuoka wont put 
up with any more of takeshitas policies ms doi told cheering 
opposition lawmakers today either the entire cabinet must resign 
or the prime minister must dissolve parliament so the people can 
express their will 
a dissolution of japans parliament the diet would force an 
election for the lower house where takeshitas governing liberal 
democratic party has more than 300 of the 512 seats an election is 
scheduled in july for half of the seats in the upper house which 
cannot be dissolved 
in sundays race socialist sadao fuchigami defeated liberal 
democrat kei oma by 751036 to 564301 votes the special election 
was called after the incumbent liberal democratic lawmaker died in 
december 
the election was the first for a national office since the 
recruit scandal came to light last summer and the liberal democrats 
pushed a controversial 3 percent sales tax through parliament in 
december 
the unpopular tax which takes effect in april reduces japans 
heavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upperlevel 
income taxes 
the voting was seen as an indicator of what might happen in the 
july upper house elections severe setbacks in the july elections 
could endanger takeshitas chances next october to win another 
twoyear term as party president and prime minister 
takeshita said he would undertake political reform to restore the 
peoples trust in politics 
i will stake everything on political reform i will carry it 
out tenaciously and patiently without considering a dissolution of 
parliament or a resignation of the cabinet he told parliament 
ms doi called for a ban on corporate political contributions and 
added instead of political reform lets have political ethics 
the recruit scandal erupted when it was disclosed that ezoe sold 
unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary more than 150 
influential politicians bureacrats and journalists before public 
trading in the shares began 
the share prices then rose sharply in value and some of the 
purchasers made more than 80000 in taxfree profits although the 
sales were not illegal in themselves they raised questions of 
possible bribery and influencepeddling

the nasa pioneer who helped develop the 
rocket that took men to the moon says he was very dumb to 
renounce his us citizenship rather than fight charges that he 
committed war crimes in nazi germany 
arthur rudolph 82 is seeking a temporary visa so he can attend 
an apollo space program reunion at the alabama space and rocket 
center in huntsville he was project manager of the apollo saturn 5 
rocket 
the justice department accused rudolph of playing a role in the 
deaths of thousands of concentration camp prisoners during world war 
ii charges he denies 
i did not have the financial resources to go through a lengthy 
court trial and i did not know if after 40 years i could still find 
any witnesses to rebut the charges against me he said in an 
interview last week with the birmingham news at his home outside 
hamburg west germany 
rudolph renounced his united states citizenship at hamburgs 
american consulate in may 1984 after agreeing to return to west 
germany following a series of interviews with the justice 
departments office of special investigations 
he called that decision dumb very dumb the newspaper 
reported sunday 
rudolph regained his west german citizenship last year after a 
lengthy west german investigation concluded he had committed no war 
crimes 
as a member of nazi germanys von braun rocket team during world 
war ii and a member of the nazi party rudolph was in charge of 
production of the v2 missile in the underground mittelwerk factory 
about 140 miles south of hamburg the area is now part of east 
germany 
the justice department said thousands of concentration camp 
prisoners were worked to death or executed at mittelwerk it charged 
that rudolph influenced what happened there 
rudolph who was living in retirement in california when the 
charges were made said he never pleaded guilty but they talk 
anyway about alleged things that i did not proven and im not 
guilty 
walter haeussermann who worked with rudolph in nazi germany and 
again in development of nasa rockets at huntsville said the 
campaign for restoration of rudolphs us citizenship would 
continue but that efforts would focus now on his request for a 
temporary visa 
we think the fight for rudolphs exoneration may take longer 
and we would like to get permission for him to visit here even 
temporarily to be part of the reunion the united states owes him 
that haeussermann said 
in exchange for rudolphs agreement to leave rather than fight 
the accusations the justice department agreed not to challenge the 
american citizenship of his wife martha who lives with him in 
hamburg or his daughter marianne who works for the national 
aeronautics and space administration in southern california 
rudolph also was allowed to keep his nasa pension and medical 
insurance coverage

legislators are having second thoughts 
about a unique law that grants confidentiality to pedophiles who 
confess to psychiatrists 
although the legislature removed some privileges last year 
maryland remains the only state that grants patientdoctor privilege 
if the pedophile discloses sexual abuse of children or even simple 
child abuse that occurred before seeking treatment from a 
psychiatrist who specializes in treating pedophilia 
dr fred berlin head of the johns hopkins sexual disorders 
clinic said in a recent interview that if he were required by law 
to report a pedophiles past that person probably wouldnt come 
forward for treatment 
he and others in his specialty won special confidentiality 
privileges from the general assembly in 1987 to encourage pedophiles 
to get help 
now the lawmakers want to force psychiatrists to report 
instances of past abuse that a pedophile reveals at any time even 
at his initial psychiatric evaluation 
child advocates and social services officials backing the bill 
maintain its more important to protect a childs rights than to 
guarantee any privacy to the offender 
stuart comstockgay the maryland american civil liberties 
unions executive director said the bill presents an interesting 
privacy issue 
the state aclu has yet to take a final position on the proposed 
change which passed the senate last month the house has yet to 
schedule debate on the bill 
theres always a balance between individual rights and another 
interest in the public safety and public health comstockgay said 
im sure on the surface it must seem its good for children to 
report the abuse and bad not to said berlin who believes more 
abuse may be uncovered by encouraging pedophiles to enter treatment 
noting that clergymen who counsel pedophiles and lawyers who 
refer them to psychiatrists for treatment are not compelled by law 
to report them he added my concern is that people who otherwise 
might have come forward would be deterred from doing so 
for example without the assurance of confidentiality one of his 
patients an attorney involved sexually with his daughter never 
would have sought help nor would therapists necessarily have gotten 
his daughter into counseling berlin said 
theres no way he wanted to risk being disbarred he very much 
wanted treatment berlin said 
howard davidson director of the american bar associations 
national legal resource center for child advocacy and protection in 
washington believes some abuse could remain hidden by such 
privileged communications 
it concerns me that the balance with that sort of law tips 
toward protection of the offender said davidson what about the 
rights of all of his victims 
state sen walter baker who introduced the bill to strip the 
reporting exemption subscribes to the onceapedophile 
alwaysapedophile school of thought 
everybody admits they pedophiles cant be cured baker 
said i am of the opinion that they cant even be treated id 
rather see them in jail thats where they belong 
however berlin believes his program of intensive psychotherapy 
in tandem sometimes with hormone treatments can curb pedophilia 
he also said that when a patient appears to be a danger to 
others he wont hesitate to commit him to a hospital ward for sex 
offenders 
its so easy to be in the corner where you seem to be against 
kids or victims when things get pigeonholed it puts pressure on 
legislators and it certainly makes it uncomfortable for me 
berlin said i dont think theres a cure but i do believe 
people with help can control themselves appropriately its like 
alcoholism today we have the betty ford clinic

jerry brown is back in the political 
arena after a sixyear absence promising as state democratic 
chairman to combine oldfashioned organizing and modern electronic 
marketing to expand party ranks 
the 50yearold former governor and twotime candidate for the 
democratic nomination for president won his first election in more 
than a decade by defeating investment banker steve westly a 
longtime volunteer unknown outside of party circles by 1591 votes 
to 777 at the state partys annual convention saturday night 
it feels very good it feels great its been six years but it 
feels like six months brown said as he ended the selfimposed 
political exile that followed his loss to republican pete wilson in 
the 1982 us senate race 
the vote for the previously obscure unpaid post of party chair 
was browns first election victory since he won his second term as 
governor in 1978 he lost a series of presidential primaries in 1980 
and then was defeated for the senate in 1982 
he said he hopes to run for other unspecified offices but not 
during his current fouryear term 
brown said he is seriously devoted to the nuts and bolts of 
party work and he set an agenda that included redefining 
democratic constituencies reviving the local democratic clubs that 
thrived in the 1950s and utilizing computer and telephone marketing 
strategies of the 1990s 
its my objective to build a party that links together the 
elected officials and the grassroots activists he said 
we have to energize and mobilize that party of nonvoters who 
are our natural clientele many are lowincome voters who have not 
had a strong connection with the voting process brown said at 
the same time we have to reach out to the suburban voter and 
those who have been tending in the reagan era to go against our 
candidates 
westly argued that brown would be a lightning rod for political 
criticism breathing new life into republican attacks against 
controversial events of browns tenure as governor such as his 
appointment of unpopular former chief justice rose bird 
other critics said browns notoriously chaotic administrative 
style didnt suit the detailoriented duties of a state chairman 
and they questioned browns new interest in a formal party structure 
that he shunned when he was governor 
brown acknowledged those criticisms alternately joking about his 
reputation and seriously promising that he has reflected on his 
successes and failure during the six years he has spent out of the 
public eye writing meditating and traveling around the world 
i can become the media dark hole that absorbs all the negative 
feedback and allows our candidate for governor to go on to victory 
unscathed brown told the convention in an acceptance speech

the rev allan boesak a 
prominent antiapartheid leader said today he has begun an 
indefinite fast in solidarity with black detainees staging a hunger 
strike to demand their freedom 
none of us wish to die boesak said in a letter to law and 
order minister adriaan vlok but if this is the road we must take 
to make you and your government understand the evil of your ways we 
will take it 
nearly 300 detainees held without charge are participating in the 
hunger strike including some who have not eaten for three weeks 
thirteen reportedly have been hospitalized 
police headquarters said today that news articles about the 
physical condition of the hunger strikers might violate 
stateofemergency regulations which prohibit unauthorized reports 
about the status of detainees unrest security force actions and a 
broad range of statements the government considers subversive 
police also have banned any public meetings intended to show 
support for the hunger strikers but boesak a mixedrace minister 
who is president of the world alliance of reformed churches said he 
planned to hold a solidarity church service this week 
the hunger strikers who demand to be freed or charged include 
105 detainees at st albans prison in port elizabeth and about 170 
at diepkloof prison outside johannesburg some have been held 
without charge since the state of emergency was declared in june 
1986 
boesak released a copy of a letter he has written to vlok 
explaining his decision to fast in support of the hunger strikers 
their action is a dramatic one which could have fateful 
consequences for all of us in this country said boesak 43 who 
was detained for three weeks in 1985 for antiapartheid activities 
it is in itself an extraordinary indictment of your government 
most especially your system of detention without trial 
fasting until death is not part of my religious or 
ecclesiastical tradition boesak said but i cannot stand idly 
by and watch those are struggling for justice in south africa starve 
themselves to death i now know what god wants me to do 
boesak said i know first hand of the pain and uncertainty of 
the terror of solitary confinement and the unspeakable indignity and 
fear it brings 
he called on other south africans to join the hunger strike 
the south african council of churches to which boesak is 
affiliated issued a statement today urging the release of all 
detainees and saying ministers should be allowed to visit the hunger 
strikers 
on sunday relatives of the st albans strikers held an emotional 
church service in new brighton a black township adjoining port 
elizabeth to support the demands for freedom 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

an airline ticket agent at piled up 17 million 
bonus air miles via computer without leaving the ground then sold 
the credits for more than 20000 according to a published report 
ralf kwaschni 28 was arrested sunday when he arrived for work 
at kennedy international airport and was charged with computer 
tampering and grand larceny authorities said 
kwaschni a ticket agent for lufthansa airlines used to work for 
american airlines the daily news reported today police said he 
used his computer access code to create 18 fake american airline 
advantage accounts racking up 17 million bonus air miles 
according to the newspaper 
all 18 accounts five in kwaschnis name and 13 under fake ones 
listed the same post office box according to the newspaper 
instead of exchanging the bonus miles for all the free travel 
kwaschni sold some of them for 22500 to brokers who used the 
credits to get a couple of firstclass roundtrip tickets from new 
york to australia two more between london and bermuda and one 
between new york and paris the newspaper said 
it is legitimate to sell personal bonus miles to brokers port 
authority detective charles schmidt said 
kwaschni would create accounts under common last names the 
newspaper said when a person with one of the names was aboard an 
american flight and did not have an advantage account the 
passengers name would be eliminated from the flight list and 
replaced with one from the fake accounts the newspaper said 
as the plane was pulling away from the gate this guy was at 
the computer literally wiping out passengers schmidt said

an abortion on a comatose woman has not 
ended the legal debate that began when her husband sought court 
permission to arrange the operation he hopes will help his wifes 
recovery 
the abortion was performed saturday on 32yearold nancy klein 
after us supreme court justice thurgood marshall refused to issue 
a stay sought by antiabortion activists 
emotions ran high on both sides throughout the more than twoweek 
debate 
its been a major battle i am tired and wounded i want to go 
on with my life said martin klein of new yorks long island after 
the abortion at north shore university hospital that ended his 
wifes 18week pregnancy 
he began court proceedings jan 26 to become his wifes guardian 
so he could order an abortion which doctors said offered mrs klein 
the best hope of recovery from severe brain damage suffered in a 
dec 13 car accident 
we are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the 
operation went smoothly said mrs kleins mother anne zusselman 
of delray beach fla now we are hopeful that nancys condition 
will improve and that we can move on to therapy for her 
meanwhile antiabortion activist john short vowed to press the 
appeal with the full supreme court to set a precedent so similar 
cases would not occur short and other activists had found doctors 
who said having the baby would not have affected mrs kleins 
condition any more than having an abortion 
but a state appeals court ruling may have dealt a blow to 
opponents who have attempted to intervene in cases where they 
apparently have no clearcut interest legally some lawyers said 
one of the important aspects of this case is that it is the 
first time a court has squarely said to these prolife groups it is 
inappropriate to interfere in the private decisions of a family 
said elizabeth bradford an assistant state attorney general whose 
office was called in to participate in the proceedings 
the appellate division of the state of new york called short and 
broderick absolute strangers who whatever their motivation

former president ronald reagan says there is 
no such thing as an average day since he left the white house 
and began work on memoirs speeches and postpresidential 
politicking 
were glad to be home with our family and friends and are 
enjoying getting back to a more normal life for example going to 
church on sundays reagan said in answering written questions for 
the los angeles herald examiner a story about his responses was 
published in todays editions of the newspaper 
in washington it had been decided our going to church 
represented a threat to too many people in these times of 
terrorism he said 
the reagans were applauded when they showed up at belair 
presbyterian church the weekend after returning to california and 
their new belair home after he left office last month 
reagan 78 keeps an office atop a century city skyscraper where 
he works on speeches for which hell be paid 50000 each believed 
to be the highest fee in the country he also is compiling a book of 
speeches to be published by simon and schuster and is to write his 
memoirs for the same publisher 
contrary to earlier reports that suggested a ghost writer would 
be employed the former president insisted he will do the work 
himself 
i always intended to write my memoirs reagan said because 
i believe the story of any presidency is best told by the 
president 
former first lady nancy reagan is nearing completion of her 
memoirs due to be published in the fall 
there is really no such thing as an average day for either of 
us reagan said lunch is soup or a sandwich at my desk and 
then back to work 
the former president said most days at the new office begin with 
a meeting with his staff of 12 most of them former white house 
aides he spends six to seven hours a day with meetings and writing 
mrs reagans schedule is also busy including appearances for 
the antidrug campaign she began in the white house a drug 
treatment center bearing her name is planned for the san fernando 
valley 
like his wife reagan has named some issues including abolishing 
the twoterm limit on the presidency he will address in his 
postwhite house years 
my change of address has not diminished my interest in these 
issues he said

soviet jews celebrated a measure of religious 
freedom with the opening of the first jewish community center in the 
soviet union in 50 years 
soviet jews and jewish leaders from 70 nations filled the 
building in downtown moscow on sunday for the opening 
elie wiesel an author and winner of the 1986 nobel peace prize 
said the reforms of president mikhail s gorbachev made the center 
possible 
today is a time to say thank you wiesel said i think he 
deserves our trust 
the opening of the solomon mikhoels cultural center named after 
a soviet jewish actor who died in the stalinist oppression in 1948 
represents a significant change in relations between the government 
and the countrys 18 million jews 
it came just a few days after a soviet newspaper made a major 
admission that soviet jews have suffered discrimination for decades 
and that dictator josef stalin destroyed jewish culture in the 
country 
the center is in the moscow jewish musical theater on taganka 
square in the southeastern section of the capital 
for jews greater tolerance by the kremlin has meant a rise in 
emigration including an eightyear high of 20000 in 1988 less 
harassment at jewish holiday celebrations and the opening of a 
private jewish museum and library in moscow 
world jewish congress president edgar bronfman also praised 
gorbachev saying his reforms made it possible to hope for a great 
revival of jewish culture and religion in the ussr 
but he added it will be some years before soviet jews overcome 
their fear of religious repression in the soviet union where the 
teaching of hebrew was once outlawed he also expressed worry that 
the cultural center could become the target of antisemitism 
wiesel said he still hopes to see in history books a 
recognition that the main victims of hitler were jewish because 
they were jewish not because they were communists and russian 
citizens 
sundays ceremony drew jewish leaders from around the world 
including former soviet refusenik yuli edelstein now an executive 
of the soviet jewry zionist forum in israel world jewish congress 
vice president isi leibler of australia and rabbi marvin hier dean 
of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles 
the cultural center is particularly important because decades of 
repression have left most of the soviet unions jews with virtually 
no knowledge of their religion history and culture 
soviet jews are not really jews said edelstein who served 
three years in prison for teaching hebrew 
the cultural center opened with a photo exhibit on the holocaust 
organizers hope to offer classes in yiddish and hebrew films 
exhibits music and a cafe featuring jewish food said director 
mikhail gluz 
the ambassadors of the united states australia canada great 
britain and france also spoke at the ceremony israel which does 
not have diplomatic relations with the soviet union but which has 
had warmer contacts with moscow in recent months sent arie levin 
head of its consular mission in moscow

an 11yearold boy who fell through ice on 
the great miami river and was submerged for about 30 minutes could 
survive the ordeal according to doctors 
deon jones of dayton was listed in critical condition today at 
childrens medical center doctors said he began breathing again 
after rescuers pulled him from the icy water just north of downtown 
sunday afternoon 
we believe he was under about 30 minutes said dr richard 
donnini who treated the boy before he was tranferred to childrens 
medical center he does have a pulse and he is starting to 
respond he does have a chance 
jones fell through the ice sometime after 130 pm sunday 
according to dayton police two other children who were with him ran 
to get help and fire department divers used extension ladders laid 
over the ice to rescue jones who was about 50 feet from shore 
authorities said 
jones was face down in the water said firefighter tom 
bourquin his jacket was making him float a little bit 
officials said the cold water which can reduce many body 
functions and thus limit the need for oxygen gives the boy a better 
chance 
district fire chief jim dunham estimated the boy had been under 
water 20 to 30 minutes and appeared to not be breathing when placed 
in the amblance 
this is one we can save if he hasnt been in there too long 
we can save him dunham said we got to him quick and we had the 
right people with the right training there 
donnini said the boys body temperature had dropped to 80 by the 
time he arrived at the hospital

a survey of police shootings in dade county has 
shown the percentage of black suspects shot by police is similar to 
the percentage of blacks arrested but both figures are more than 
double the percentage of blacks living in the county 
the miami herald reported sunday that during the past five years 
46 percent of the people shot by police in dade county have been 
black although blacks make up only 21 percent of the countys 
population 
but 44 percent of those arrested have been black nearly 
identical to the percentage of those shot 
the paper gathered information on 158 police shootings including 
65 that were fatal from the state attorneys office the dade 
medical examiners office and the 18 police departments and federal 
agencies that had officers involved in shootings since 1983 
the shooting death of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a 
colombianborn policeman led to three days of civil unrest in miami 
last month deaths of blacks at the hands of policemen have caused 
two other civil disturbances during the 1980s 
officials said the statistics showed no significant evidence of a 
pattern of bias among dade law enforcement officers of any ethnic 
background 
we reviewed it about two to three years ago and reached the 
same conclusion said dade state attorney janet reno if there 
is any indication of a pattern we will look at it again 
we dont contest all shootings said aleem fakir executive 
director of people united to lead the struggle for equality a group 
of black church and civic leaders critical of police treatment of 
blacks but fakir said that seldom do whites get shot under cloudy 
circumstances 
the analysis found no unusual racial pattern among the officers 
involved in shooting incidents either 
countywide 9 percent of the police shootings were done by black 
officers 29 percent were by latin officers and 49 percent by anglo 
officers that ratio generally reflects the ethnic makeup of the 
countys combined law enforcement departments the other 13 percent 
of cases involved two or more officers of different ethnic 
backgrounds 
i think most police shootings are colorblind said miami 
police chief perry anderson who is black the shooting is 
precipitated by an unlawful violation it may be related to drugs or 
robbery or burglary you cant say there is prejudice

george bush went before congress last week and 
advocated statehood for an unrepresented region of the united states 
where residents have no right to determine their political power 
some people in the district of columbia sat on the edge of their 
seats expecting that at long last their stateless city would get 
presidential recognition 
but no bush proposed statehood for puerto rico not washington 
dc 
he asked congress in his budget speech last thursday to 
authorize a statehood referendum in puerto rico 
insulting said hilda mason the next day she is a member of 
the city council of the district of columbia representing the 
statehood party 
but some local statehood advocates took heart from the paragraph 
in bushs speech they saw a solution to their long dilemma the 
joint admission of both could send republicans to congress from 
puerto rico while the district would be almost certain to elect 
democrats 
if bush is pushing for puerto rican statehood as gerald ford 
once did he must be sure it would turn out to be republican turf 
they said 
i think it has the makings of a deal said activist mark 
plotkin a member of the dc democratic state committee 
just such a deal brought hawaii and alaska into the union in 
1959 said walter e fauntroy a local minister who represents 
washingtonians in the house as a nonvoting delegate 
except something went awry he said hawaii was expected to elect 
republicans to the senate and alaska to elect democrats it turns 
out that hawaiis two senators are democrats and alaskas are 
republican 
fauntroy said washington has been kept out of congress because of 
the four toos the district is too urban too progressive 
too democratic and for some people too black 
i put the racial thing at the bottom says fauntroy who is 
black 
at the top is that were too democratic and the fact is that a 
rural state would not want to see two more urban senators and 
conservatives dont want progressive what president bush said 
signals to me that there may be hope of bipartisan cooperation 
race is a major factor disagreed plotkin who is white it 
provides an excuse to deny full citizenship to people who are not 
white 
the district with a population larger than those of vermont 
alaska and wyoming is overwhelmingly black 
on the surface the timing could hardly be less favorable for 
washington to make its case 
the mayor marion barry is the subject of two investigations 
into his social ties with people undergoing drug investigations the 
city set a record for homicides last year with 372 surpassing 
detroits rate fauntroys own hiring practices are being 
investigated for possible payroll padding according to 
congressional and fbi sources 
moreover congress after granting home rule for the district in 
1973 took some of it back last year to a bill authorizing 32 
billion to the city to cover the cost of the federal presence it 
attached a rider requiring the city to stop using medicaid money to 
pay for abortions 
congress also overrode the city council and said georgetown 
university could deny facilities to homosexual campus groups and 
congress compelled the city to repeal a law barring insurance 
companies from requiring aids tests of applicants for life insurance 
if the district had none of these problems we would still have 
the partisan political reality that it is not in the interests of 
conservative republicans to see the district become a state said 
fauntroy 
plotkin disagreed the political reality is that the problems 
presented by the mayor and delegate fauntroy provide a readymade 
excuse to block any action 
meanwhile theres evidence suggesting puerto ricans may not want 
to be dealt in in a plebiscite on the island in 1967 60 percent of 
those who voted favored continued commonwealth status under which 
they are us citizens but pay no federal taxes and cant vote in 
presidential elections statehood was favored by 39 percent and 1 
percent voted for independence 
the district voted for statehood in 1981 adopted the name new 
columbia for the wouldbe state and wrote a state constitution 
that was so liberal it became an impediment to the goal 
its case hasnt budged in congress since

an explosion killed a palestinian in the 
occupied territories today and israeli troops critically wounded 
two arab teenagers during a stonethrowing riot the army said 
in jerusalem two leftwing members of parliament said recent 
attacks by israelis on palestinians in the occupied west bank are 
the work of a very efficient and well armed jewish settler 
militia 
the army imposed a curfew on kabatiya village in the west bank 
after an unidentified man accidentally blew himself up in an blast 
that hurt two other villagers a military spokesman said 
a preliminary report indicates they found a suspicious object 
played with it and it exploded said a military statement 
an arab reporter in the west bank said a 4yearold girl and her 
10yearold brother were seriously hurt while herding sheep near 
their tayasir village home the childrens parents said they heard 
an explosion but do not know its cause 
it was not immediately clear whether the army and the arab 
reporter described the same incident tayasir and kabatiya are 10 
miles apart 
a military spokesman denied the man was killed inside kabatiya 
but refused to elaborate 
at least six other children have been reported wounded in similar 
mysterious blasts which the government is investigating 
ehud barak deputy chief of staff of the armed forces has said 
some injuries were caused by flares emitted by fighter jets to 
deflect heatseeking missiles a few flares fall to earth instead of 
exploding he said 
in the occupied gaza strips rafah refugee camp today two 
14yearolds were shot in the head by troops they were in critical 
condition in israeli hospitals a military spokeswoman said 
two jerusalem legislators from the leftwing citizens rights 
movement sent a letter to attorney general yosef harish charging 
there is a wellorganized militia of several hundred settlers armed 
with automatic weapons vehicles and advanced communications sytems 
settler leaders denied an organized militia exists 
the lawmakers letter was sent sunday after 40 settlers stormed 
into a west bank palestinian mayors office to protest stonings and 
firebombings of settlers cars the army spirited mayor mohammed abu 
sneineh out of his qalqilya office and forced the settlers to leave 
we are calling on the attorney general to break up this 
militia said yossi sarid who authored the letter with dedi 
zucker 
sarid said bands of settler vigilante groups started forming a 
few months ago in response to palestinian attacks on some of the 
70000 jewish settlers who uneasily share the occupied lands with 
17 million arabs 
settlers formed the militia because they have lost faith in the 
armys ability to protect them sarid said 
settler leader ron nachman named in the letter as a key militia 
chief said the paramilitary organization was sarids fantasy 
there is a difference between a militia and people getting fed 
up and doing something said nachman mayor of the west bank 
settlement of ariel 
however he added that if the government does not take harsher 
measures to end the 14month palestinian uprising such as deporting 
palestinian leaders more settler violence is likely 
the settlers were protesting the death wednesday of a 37yearold 
jewish taxi driver from the west bank settlement of alfe menashe 
police said albert jerassi apparently was attacked by arabs but 
they have not discovered what caused his car to burst into flames as 
he drove past qalqilya 
jerassis death would raise to 16 the number of israelis who have 
died in the palestinian uprising at least 380 palestinians have 
been killed in the revolt against israels occupation of lands 
seized in the 1967 middle east war

protestant vigilantes said today 
they killed a roman catholic lawyer in his home and irish 
nationalists accused a british government minister of making remarks 
that endangered lawyers 
patrick finucane was slain sunday by three men who stormed his 
home in north belfast his wife geraldine was wounded in the ankle 
by a bullet and was hospitalized in satisfactory condition 
finucane had acted for clients involved in the outlawed irish 
republican armys campaign against british rule 
the outlawed ulster freedom fighters telephoned a coded message 
to the british broadcasting corp in belfast today claiming 
responsibility for the attack 
press association the british domestic news agency said 
finucane was the first attorney killed by extremists in 20 years of 
sectarian violence 
danny morrison vice president of the iras legal political arm 
sinn fein said junior home office minister douglas hogg provided 
the pretext for the slaying of mr finucane 
hogg told a parliamentary committee discussing an antiterrorist 
bill that certain northern ireland lawyers were unduly 
sympathetic to paramilitary organizations his remarks were raised 
in the house of commons on jan 31 
seamus mallon deputy leader of the social democratic and labor 
party said he had warned hogg that his words could compromise the 
safety of lawyers in the province 
i warned him at the time that that was a very dangerous 
statement i warned him that as a consequence some lawyers in the 
north of ireland could become targets for assassins bullets and 
tragically those words have proved prophetically true mallon 
said in a radio interview 
members of the northern ireland association of socialist lawyers 
called for hoggs resignation accusing him of making lawyers 
targets 
kevin mcnamara spokesman on northern ireland for the labor 
opposition said i think mr hogg has got to consider very 
carefully what he said this death must be a tragedy for the legal 
profession in northern ireland as well as for the family of the 
deceased 
finucane 38 was involved in the county armagh inquest into the 
1983 police killings of three unarmed ira guerrillas the families 
of the guerrillas claimed the men were victims of an alleged police 
shoot to kill campaign against irish nationalists 
the inquest was abandoned after finucane acting for the family 
of one of the dead went to the high court demanding that three 
policemen involved in the shooting be forced to attend and give 
evidence at the hearing 
the coroner had initially directed that the policemen need not 
attend but only submit statements 
finucane eventually won his case but on appeal by the 
authorities the inquest was adjourned indefinitely 
finucane succeeded in having charges dropped against a man in 
connection with the killing of two soldiers at an ira funeral last 
year 
the predominantly catholic irish republican army is fighting to 
push the british out of this protestantdominated province and unite 
it with the irish republic

moslem students marched in several 
cities today to denounce the united states because of a book they 
consider blasphemous and to protest the killing of five people in 
rioting sunday 
hundreds of police stood guard in islamabad near the us 
information center which nearly 3000 moslem fundamentalists 
stormed sunday five people were shot to death 83 people were 
injured and at least 65 people were arrested in the threehour melee 
the militant demonstrators alleged the centers library contained 
the 1988 novel the satanic verses by salman rushdie moslems say 
the book is blasphemous because it suggests the prophet mohammed was 
fallible and pakistan and india have banned the novel 
us diplomats who say the library does not have rushdies book 
ordered the information center and the us embassy closed at 
midday today for fear of renewed violence 
about 300 moslem theology students and political opposition 
leaders chanted rushdie should hang during a march today in 
rawalpindi where most stores were closed in mourning for those 
killed sunday 
witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops 
that remained open there were no reports of injuries

hungarys ruling communist party has 
endorsed a multiparty system for the first time but says the change 
must be gradual and orderly 
the partys policymaking central committee announced its new 
position over the weekend after a twoday meeting during which it 
also revised its view of the 1956 antisoviet uprising 
allowing more than one political party would provide a better 
safeguard against abuse of power the communist party said sunday 
in a communique released by the state news agecy mti 
it also said danger exists for the process to become 
destabilized and uncontrollable that is not in the interest of any 
force with a sense of responsibility 
in a halfhour interview broadcast on radio and television sunday 
evening party leader karoly grosz said alternative parties could 
exist only on a socialist basis 
parliament is expected to pass a bill by aug 1 that would allow 
alternative parties making hungary the first east bloc country to 
have a genuine multiparty system 
the communist party daily nepszabadsag today published groszs 
speech at the central committee meeting held friday and saturday 
grosz criticized the extremist wing of potential alternative 
parties he said all parties would have to accept hungarys 
membership in the warsaw pact military alliance and prevent any 
deepening of the nations economic problems 
grosz also praised what he called more composed forces and 
said there is a realistic possibility to establish a lasting 
political alliance with these 
the soviets have not taken a public stand on recent hungarian 
reforms grosz is to visit soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 
march 
hungarian politburo reformer imre pozsgay created conflict among 
communists two weeks ago with a stunning reevaluation of the 
antisoviet revolt of 1956 
pozsgay said the revolt was a popular uprising not a 
counterrevolution as his party had called it for 32 years 
his comments touched off intense public debate and led to the 
central committee meeting 
the committee statement and groszs remarks on television 
indicated there had been a compromise on reassessing the revolt 
grosz said that over the years the party had forgotten those 
popular elements that started the uprising against the stalinist 
regime of matyas rakosi on oct 23 1956 
but he said by the time the soviets had crushed the uprising on 
nov 4 1956 counterrevolutionary forces were leading the revolt 
western diplomats and some hungarians active in the dozens of 
alternative political groups started recently said they believed the 
outcome of the central committee meeting was a victory for pozsgay 
who has pushed hard for a multiparty system

secretary of state james a baker iii left a 
dispute over shortrange nuclear missiles behind in west germany and 
took his nato tour to scandinavia today hoping a solution would be 
worked out before his return to bonn 
baker met first today in copenhagen with danish foreign minister 
uffe ellemannjensen on a stop designed to acquaint the new us 
secretary of state with denmarks skittishness over nuclear weapons 
baker then flew to norway a staunch us ally that considers 
itself the cornerstone of natos northern defense in oslo norways 
leaders expressed reservations about the need to update the north 
atlantic treaty organization missiles 
prime minister gro harlem brundtland said modernizing the western 
alliances battlefield nuclear arms was one of many issues that 
required more discussion 
we believe it should be a wide agenda including both 
deterrence and disarmament negotiations mrs brundtland told 
reporters with baker standing at her side 
norwegian foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg added later 
negotiations could lead to a result which does not make 
modernization necessary 
stoltenberg who will visit washington this month said baker did 
not press for modernizing the nuclear arsenal but only was 
thinking aloud on the policy of the new administration 
the most critical talks of bakers eightday tour of the 15 nato 
allies are being held in bonn west german leaders are trying to 
delay the modernization of lance battlefield nuclear missiles while 
the bush administration wants to upgrade them 
us officials said a statement was being prepared in bonn while 
baker was in scandinavia that baker who was returning to west 
germany tonight would discuss with chancellor helmut kohl and 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
the us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity declined 
to say whether a compromise had been reached or the differences 
would papered over until the issue is addressed at a nato summit 
meeting in may 
west german leaders are concerned that upgrading the missiles 
could threaten further progress in eastwest disarmament talks 
there is strong public opposition to modernization in west germany 
and the country is to hold national elections next year 
baker began talks with west german officials on sunday after 
meeting with british officials in london 
he has said he is not worried about kohls statement last week 
that the lance missiles now deployed are adequate until 1995 
under a nato plan the missiles 70mile range would be extended 
with new rockets that could hit targets about 320 miles away 
nato is expected to make a decision on modernization in three 
months 
on bakers agenda in bonn were two other touchy issues western 
curbs on technology sales to the soviet union and the help west 
german companies gave to libya in the construction of an alleged 
chemical weapons plant 
baker said the british told him they would like to see the curbs 
lifted now that soviet troops are leaving afghanistan 
concerning libya baker said new west german export restrictions 
were quite promising as were recent pledges by the bonn 
government to prosecute violators 
commenting on his meetings sunday with prime minister margaret 
thatcher of britain and sir geoffrey howe the british foreign 
secretary a us source said baker received support on many nato 
issues the source declined to elaborate 
also the source said howe urged baker to plunge into the middle 
east situation to sustain the moderate course the foreign 
secretary said the palestinians had taken 
the source said baker made it clear us dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization which began in december after a 
13year ban would be continued 
bakers trip began friday in canada and took him to iceland on 
saturday his last stop is paris before returning to washington on 
friday

president bush opened a campaign for 
public support of his new budget today by returning to the state 
that propelled him to his white house victory and declared our 
plan is a realistic one 
it is a budget plan that will work but not with business as 
usual bush said in a speech to the business and industry 
association of new hampshire 
meanwhile bushs budget director richard g darman prepared 
for talks with congressional leaders on the 116 trillion plan the 
administration unveiled last week 
bush mixed words of backing for that plan already encountering 
democratic resistance in congress with a sentimental thank you to 
the state that almost one year ago gave him his first victory in the 
race for the republican presidential nomination 
its no coincidence that my very first stop is here in new 
hampshire said bush who came here after a weekend of relaxation 
at his seacoast retreat in maine 
his speech was the first in what aides said would be a series of 
talks around the country as the administration presses for agreement 
with congress on spending cuts 
bush scored a decisive comeback win in new hampshires feb 16 
1988 primary election that restored momentum that had been halted 
with a defeat in the iowa caucuses 
the steadfast support i received gave me the chance to pick 
myself up off the canvas and the rest as they say is history 
a year ago about this time i came to new hampshire under quite 
different circumstances i had just lost in iowa i was up at 650 
am my first morning here holding my coffee in one hand and 
shaking the hands of factory workers with the other 
the columnists had begun to write my political obituary 
bushs speech highlighted the major features of his budget plan 
which calls for restraint in defense spending with a call for 
increases in education aid to the homeless child care and 
environmental cleanup 
however bushs plan has already been criticized by congressional 
democratic leaders for failing to specify what programs would be cut 
to pay for new humanitarian initiatives 
bush did not mention that criticism in his remarks in 
washington darman was to defend the plan in meetings with leaders 
of house and senate budget committees 
i presented to congress a realistic plan for dealing with the 
federal budget bush said he said his plan would keep faith 
with our promise to the american people of no new taxes 
there are some areas in which we would all like to spend more 
but we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order and bring the 
deficit down 
and as he had done in his maiden speech to congress last 
thursday night bush vowed to work day and night with congress 
in coming up with a plan that meets budget targets 
despite bushs nonewtaxes pledge sen warren rudman rnh 
said after the speech that there might have to be some form of tax 
increase next year 
obviously no promise is forever rudman told reporters 
aboard air force one on the way back to washington he predicted a 
good three months of heavy slugging on the budget fight 
bush said he wanted to thank new hampshires people both for what 
they did for him in the past and to thank you for what you can do 
in the future 
the president says his budget proposal will produce a fiscal 1990 
deficit of 911 billion below the 100 billion figure required by 
the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
bush and his wife barbara attended services sunday at the first 
congregational church outside kennebunkport and then the president 
met at his nearby home with a group of soviet scholars 
it was just an intellectual exercise press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said of the afternoon meeting which included national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of 
statedesignate lawrence eagleburger 
similarly scowcroft today described the session as just a bull 
session 
he said the president had invited the scholars mostly from new 
england universities so he could help firm up his own views on 
evolving relations with the soviets it helps him get a better 
feel for our own experts thinking scowcroft said 
bush has said that in the early weeks of his administration he 
wants to reevaluate ussoviet relations before embracing any new 
eastwest diplomatic initiatives 
bush last week proposed some changes in the budget that 
thenpresident reagan submitted to congress in january although the 
two versions are more similar than dissimilar bush did propose 
several initiatives reflecting campaign promises for expanded social 
programs 
bush said he wants to hold military spending increases to the 
rate of inflation but so far he has not spelled where else he would 
make cuts to pay for these new initiatives 
bush has said all along that he would oppose tax increases on 
sunday darman said it would be up to congressional democrats to 
suggest tax hikes 
appearing on cbstvs face the nation darman insisted that 
more taxes are not needed to reduce the deficit 
what would happen in a negotiation is that we are certainly not 
going to bring up taxes he said the president has made his 
position extremely clear 
if the other side wants to bring up taxes we will have to 
discuss that on merits and our position is that the merits dont 
require taxes 
darman said that in his talks with sen jim sasser dtenn and 
rep leon panetta dcalif the heads of the senate and house 
budget committees i look forward to learning a bit more about 
what theyre thinking of as their own possible budget

evangelist jimmy swaggart says his 
television ministry will end this month unless he receives an influx 
of donations to overcome pornographers who are trying to knock 
him off the air 
if for whatever reason this week you close the door in my face 
or you pass me by feb 26 will be the final telecast for this 
ministry swaggart said in his taped television program 
distributed for broadcast this past weekend 
its either the pornographers or us they will have their way 
and eliminate jimmy swaggart from television thats what they 
wanted to do swaggart said 
swaggart did not give any figures of how much money he needed a 
guard who answered the phone sunday said he could not contact 
swaggart and a message left at his office this morning seeking 
further comment was not immediately returned 
in the latest edition of penthouse magazine a new orleans 
stripper said she performed sex acts for swaggart while he watched 
the allegations leveled by catherine mary kampen strongly denied by 
swaggart were similar to those of debra murphree a new orleans 
prostitute that led to swaggarts ouster last year from the 
assemblies of god 
in a tearful confession to his congregation last february 
swaggart said he had sinned but did not reveal specifics he was 
defrocked by the assemblies after refusing to stay away from the 
pulpit for at least one year 
swaggart has not released any hard figures on the ministrys 
financial problems however in the past year there have been 
layoffs at the ministries cancellation of his weekly television 
show by three major cable networks and an exodus of students from 
jimmy swaggart bible college which many faculty members left to 
avoid being defrocked with swaggart

lovers seeking the sweetest of gifts on st 
valentines day would be wise to pay a visit to joseph schmidt a 
chocolatier for a queen and a president who has elevated 
candymaking to an art 
in his shop on a plain city street pink and white candy tulips 
lay on sculptured chocolate bowls thin and smooth like porcelain 
handpainted by the master 
there are white chocolate swans with long slender necks and 
oldfashioned red velvet hearts as large and plush as cushions 
stuffed with truffles chocolate cupids float with bows drawn and 
hotlip lollipops beckon for a kiss 
my goal is to create a dream for clients to fulfill their 
fantasies said schmidt expressing the same childlike joy as the 
hero of the movie willy wonka and the chocolate factory 
like wonka everything schmidt makes is satisfying and delicious 
talk about your childhood wishes you can even eat the dishes 
some of schmidts chocolate flowers and shelllike bowls are part 
of a touring show of confection art organized by the american craft 
museum in new york 
joseph schmidt confections a 5yearold love affair of schmidt 
and partner audrey ryan is no ordinary candy store its artistic 
and tasty creations have delighted queen elizabeth former president 
reagan and thousands of loyal customers 
schmidt who said hes 49 going on 30 once made a chocolate 
replica of the eiffel tower for the french ambassador and a giant 
panda holding bamboo shoots for a wildlife foundation dinner with 
prince phillip 
it is not the size of schmidts creations though that make them 
so startling 
many of his finest works are small with the attention to detail 
of miniature portraits the petals on longstemmed chocolate tulips 
are as delicately shaped as real tulips 
the cost of all this effort schmidt works about four hours on 
each of his sculptured bowls but sells them for only 20 big 
bonbons laced with liqueurs are 1 apiece 
we give away our product because we enjoy it so much said 
ryan who works almost as long as schmidts 18hour days 
the two former pastry chefs and a staff of 90 people at their 
chocolate factory and retail shop each week turn 40000 pounds of 
premium raw chocolate from belgium into treats for the sweet of 
tooth 
all that chocolate adds up to a 1 million a year business ryan 
said 
valentines day easter and christmas are their biggest holidays 
but it seems every week is special 
even groundhog day earlier this month was an excuse for candied 
fantasies with the cute chocolate animals springing up from the 
shelves 
weve created more of an art form ryan said thats joes 
love he spends every night by himself creating 
the biggest problem with schmidts confections is that the 
fragile sculptures dont travel well for the american craft museum 
show which is traveling to museums around the country this year and 
next a museum courier had to handcarry schmidts goodies on the 
plane 
there is a sense of magic when you see joseph schmidts work 
said anthea zonars assistant curator at the american craft museum 
you can go into a chocolate shop and find chocolate roses of all 
types but joseph schmidts are remarkable i think theyre 
beautiful and they make my mouth water 
schmidts sells truffles and bonbons by mail in this country and 
in europe if you want a sculpture though ryan said you 
have to come here and carry it very carefully

the environmental group greenpeace petitioned 
the agriculture department on monday to require that milk cartons 
used in the nations schoollunch programs be made of material which 
which wont put dioxin in the milk 
greenpeace said such cartons should be required for the nearly 5 
billion halfpints of milk that five of the departments programs 
help pay for every year eighty percent of that milk is used in 
school lunches 
no studies of dioxin in us milk have been reported by any 
government agency greenpeace relied on a canadian government study 
in its petition to the agriculture department 
the group said the department should require cartons of 
unbleached paper returnable glass containers or any other 
biodegradable carton that wont put toxic substances in the milk 
paper milk cartons currently are made with bleached paper paper 
bleached with chlorine can contain trace amounts of dioxin the most 
powerful cause of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals and 
related compounds according to industry and government findings 
announced two years ago 
dioxin has never been proved to cause human cancer but in high 
doses it can cause a severe form of acne and recent evidence has 
linked it to reproductive disorders 
the canadian study and greenpeace calculations said that a 
110pound child drinking a single halfpint from a bleached paper 
carton would ingest 06 picograms of the equivalent of the most 
toxic dioxin per kilogram of body weight 
this is 100 times the daily amount that the environmental 
protection agency has estimated is likely to raise the risk of 
cancer by one in a million if continued for a lifetime epa has 
proposed a 17fold reduction in its risk estimates for dioxin but 
has not acted if the proposed risk estimate were in effect the 06 
picograms per kilogram would still represent six times the amount 
estimated to raise the risk of cancer by one in a million 
according to the canadian study milk from plastic and glass 
containers contained only a tenth as many dioxin compounds typical 
of the bleaching process or none at all 
all humans in the united states are believed to have trace 
amounts of dioxin in their fat the compound binds to fatty tissue 
janet hieber of greenpeace told a news conference the affinity of 
dioxin for fat helps account for finding it in milk if the carton 
were filled with water instead of milk chances are the dioxin would 
have stayed in the carton she said 
although no studies of dioxin in us milk have been reported by 
any government agency a washington television station wjla 
conducted its own tests and found levels similar to those found in 
canada according to roberta baskin a reporter for wjla at the news 
conference 
the agriculture department did not immediately return a telephone 
call 
carol raulston vice president for government affairs of the 
american paper institute the industrys major trade association 
said there were questions about the testing procedure in canada 
and neither their government nor ours is relying on those results 
the food and drug administration and the industry have begun milk 
tests using a more sophisticated procedure and results are expected 
in a few months she said and the agriculture department should 
wait for those results 
the industry is committed to providing safe packaging and if 
theres anything theyre uncomfortable with at fda well have to 
address that she said

march 1 will be a late night for this town 
its residents all 16 of them will appear that evening as 
guests on the nbctv show late night with david letterman 
if hes looking for american gothic i think hes going to be 
disappointed said daryl mccready we dont exactly have hats 
and pitchforks we know whats going on in the world 
none of the residents of this northern iowa town which isnt 
even on some state maps has ever been to new york but most are at 
least vaguely familiar with the talk show host famous for his 
stupid pet tricks routine and offbeat humor 
his show is on too late for us although we did all get 
together and watch his seventh anniversary special said 
73yearold ruth hansen it was kind of interesting 
loren nydegger a senior basketball player who attends high 
school at nearby st ansgar said a lot of people are pretty 
excited about this 
they joke about things like when they introduce the team at 
games theyll say and now going to new york and being on the 
david letterman show and also playing guard loren nydegger he 
said 
jodi ross a talent researcher for the show suggested bolan 
after talent coordinator madeleine smithberg came up with the idea 
of inviting an entire town to be guests on the program 
the thing is that theres a lot of little towns across the 
country and bolan is just from everything ive read about the town 
and everything i hear about it theyre just really a special 
little community ms ross said 
letterman known for his sometimes sarcastic behavior with 
guests will make bolan residents feel special she said raised in 
indiana he will get along fine with the iowans 
hes going to be taken with this whole thing of course hes 
going to be dave hes going to joke around but these people are to 
be celebrated because theyre such wonderful folks and because hey 
the whole town came all the way to new york to be on our show she 
said 
the bolan residents will fly feb 28 to new york the show will 
be taped the afternoon of march 1 and broadcast that night the 
network is paying for roundtrip air fare from des moines two 
nights in a hotel meals and spending money 
i just hope someone there will meet us at the airport could 
you imagine the headlines little town gets lost at airport 
joked linda nydegger lorens mother 
the letterman show isnt the first fame for the 103yearold 
worth county town located about 130 miles north of des moines 
it was host to 7000 bicycle riders during a 1987 bike race and 
it made national news during its centennial celebration when 
spectators walked around the town parade because the town is so 
small 
with all new york has to offer what will the iowans do during 
their stay 
daryl mccready said he wants to visit the statue of liberty and 
the empire state building 
i was so proud when i built my pole barn in 1939 and then they 
built the empire state building that was designed to sway 15 feet at 
the top i wasnt too proud of my pole barn then

a questionnaire assessing beliefs about alcohol 
can identify young adolescents at risk for later problem drinking 
according to a study that one expert calls an exciting development 
in fighting alcohol abuse 
when tested with 637 junior high school students the 90item 
questionnaire was an impressively strong predictor of problem 
drinking a year later alcohol experts said 
students who believed alcohol could help them think or improve 
their physical coordination tended to be at particular risk said 
study coauthor mark goldman 
goldman a psychology professor at the university of south 
florida in tampa reported the study results with coauthors from 
the university of wisconsin medical school wayne state university 
in detroit and hope college in holland mich 
the work appears in this months issue of the journal of 
consulting and clinical psychology 
its certainly a very exciting development commented g alan 
marlatt director of the addictive behaviors research center at the 
university of washington in seattle he called it the first 
demonstration that a measure of psychological dependency can predict 
later alcohol use and tendencies toward problem drinking 
peter nathan director of the rutgersaffiliated center of 
alcohol studies in piscataway nj said the study represents an 
advance in identifying what looks like a rather important 
difference that distinguishes early adolescents at risk of an 
alcohol problem 
the predictions were not perfect but nathan called their 
accuracy pretty impressive 
goldman said that since writing the paper researchers have found 
the questionnaire also indicates a risk of problem drinking within 
two years and possibly three 
the questionnaire measured how strongly students believed that 
alcohol could aid them in such ways as helping them relax be 
sexier think better enjoy social gatherings more or perform 
better socially or athletically 
prior research shows that such expectancies strongly affect 
the way a person behaves after drinking quite apart from chemical 
effects of alcohol goldman said 
the research followed the theory that the stronger they believe 
that alcohol has those positive effects the more at risk they are 
for problem drinking goldman said 
if such beliefs can be undermined early that might reduce the 
attractiveness of alcohol and prevent problem drinking he said the 
questionnaire may help by pinpointing the key beliefs that put 
individual teenagers at risk he said 
for example a teen who looks to alcohol for relaxation can be 
taught other methods or perhaps stress in his life can be removed 
goldman said 
the most predictive part of the questionnaire measured the belief 
that alcohol improves social performance its what youd expect 
an adolescent to find important which is how you get along in the 
social scene goldman said 
another risky belief was that alcohol makes you think better 
and maybe perform better physically he said believe it or not 
these kids think you might drive better under the influence of 
alcohol those are the kids who are really seriously at risk 
the study focused on 637 seventh and eighthgraders who filled 
out the questionnaire and a confidential survey on drinking habits 
a year later they again reported on their drinking 
in that intervening year the percentage of students who got 
drunk at least twice a year jumped from 10 percent to 25 percent 
while 7 percent said in the first survey that they had consumed 12 
beers or more at a single sitting 20 percent said so a year later 
those measures and others such as alcoholrelated fights crimes 
and trouble at home or school were used to define problem drinking 
analysis showed that the occurence or degree of problem drinking 
by the students was significantly related to how they had answered 
the questionnaire a year earlier the relationship also appeared for 
the 550 students who had not reported any sign of problem drinking 
at the beginning of the year

the senates oldboy club which for 
generations has cheered on former senators if they advanced into the 
upper reaches of the executive branch has come unglued under the 
weight of former sen john towers nomination to be secretary of 
defense 
towers senate confirmation is in serious jeopardy the nominee 
battered by unproven accusations of heavy drinking womanizing and 
lack of objectivity when it comes to defense contractors 
many had expected that towers nomination to be the nations 
defense chief would enjoy an effortless slide down a carefully 
greased chute 
tower after all had been one of the powers of the senate where 
he served for two dozen years and presided as chairman of the armed 
services committee the same panel now being asked to confirm him 
if he expected special treatment he didnt get it 
instead his nomination became snared in a web of allegations and 
fbi investigations 
sen sam nunn dga the current armed services chairman had 
made clear months before last falls election that he intended to 
subject new nominees for top pentagon positions to intense scrutiny 
in an effort to improve the quality of key officials 
i said several times that it wasnt going to be an oldboy 
hearing that we were going to have a thorough review nunn says 
the presumption that it was going to be something less was wrong 
from the beginning period 
nunn calls the tower screening the most exhaustive process and 
investigation anyones gone through in my memory in the senate 
i think everybody thought that the oldboy network would work 
as it always has and john tower would go sailing through but it 
hasnt worked that way said sen james exon dneb the armed 
services committees secondranking democrat 
many members including nunn speak of the process of sifting and 
judging the merits of allegations against tower in terms of personal 
pain 
the pain is evidently more intense against the backdrop of a 
courtly clubby institution in which members routinely refer to 
colleagues as distinguished and honorable and hasten to 
smooth over the wounds of legislative combat with flowery 
compliments 
this is a painful process nunn says its painful for the 
nominee painful for the president painful for the committee and 
painful for me its frustrating its not enjoyable 
in part towers troubles may stem from the fact that he 
apparently entered the confirmation process with a relatively low 
reservoir of good will among his former colleagues 
many senators say privately that they were not fond of what they 
say was towers testy temper and autocratic operating style 
few are willing to say that in public but some are 
tower is a former member of the senate but it is probably also 
the case that he doesnt have a lot of intimate friends here or any 
aura of popularity or good will said sen richard lugar rind 
who was chairman of the senate foreign relations committee at the 
time tower headed armed services 
he is not necessarily a person who ingratiates himself with 
anybody lugar said 
some republican senators are saying that while they remain 
publicly supportive of the tower nomination it is more out of a 
sense of loyalty to president bush rather than out of any sense of 
loyalty or affection toward tower 
they are saying we owe it to the president not tower 
lugar said 
i dont notice anything clubby in this one at all he said 
the question inevitably is raised of whether the tower nomination 
is being hammered by oldfashioned partisan politics 
some republican operatives are saying exactly that accusing the 
democrats who control the senate of causing difficulties for the new 
administration in part to assert their majority status and in part 
as an expression of frustration over their partys defeat in last 
years presidential contest 
not so says nunn whose own credentials are hardly those of a 
leftwing pentagon basher sen john warner rva a former 
secretary of the navy and the panels ranking republican backs him 
up 
the two lawmakers say they have worked as 5050 partners 
throughout the hearings and investigations and constantly shared 
information 
sam nunn has been fair equitable and steadfastly he has 
been nonpolitical warner said late last week 
warner said he put the question of fairness directly to tower 
himself 
i said john if you were in the position sam nunn and i now 
find ourselves in would you do it any differently 
the answer 
sen tower looked us right in the eye and said no warner 
said

shevardnadze and other soviet officials that the kremlin had given 
the green light for opening the cultural center the world jewish

advocates of statehood for the district of

are taking heart from president bushs endorsement of expanding the 
union to embrace another place the island of puerto rico 
they see a deal in the making the simultaneous admission to the 
union of a puerto rico which would likely send republicans to 
congress why else would bush back the idea they ask and of the 
district of columbia which most certainly would elect i think it has 
the makings of a deal said washington

state committee 
im hopeful said walter fauntroy a local minister who has 
represented the district in congress as a nonvoting delegate for 18 
years 
the fundamental objection to admiting the district has been 
partisan fauntroy said the republicans didnt want to add two 
democrats to the senate but ive known all along that puerto rico 
was viewed as a place where republicans would get two senators 
that would explain why the republican platform plugged statehood 
for puerto rico while the democrats called for statehood for the 
district bush told a joint session of congress last week that he 
personally favors puerto rican statean evelyn waugh novel and if it has

die hard cbsfox home video vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
it is easy to dismiss this bruce willis movie simply because of 
its title and because it stars willis dont be too quick though 
die hard turns out to be a sleeper of a thriller with perky 
dialogue and a believable willis if you can get past his rambolike 
dirty undershirt and ak47 
just about all of the movie takes place in a newly built los 
angeles skyscraper where john mcclane a new york police officer 
has gone to visit his estranged wife holly a top executive for a 
japanese corporation 
the company office party is in full swing when a pack of 
terrorists arrives killing the security people taking over the 
computer so they can run elevators and control communications and 
keeping the party hostage 
john is in the john at the time and escapes also becoming a 
hostage he finally manages to weave his way to another floor and 
the game dear viewer is afoot and what a game it is john plays 
cute little terrorist games with the leader hans alan rickman and 
his psychotic sidekick played by alexander godunov there are lots 
of explosives and hightech weaponry and plenty of cliffhangers 
theres also a nice little plot twist but that would be telling 
john mctiernans direction is tight with the right comedic 
breaks the casting was not in the hollywood tradition it was 
creative and forward thinking costarring clarence gilyard jr as a 
los angeles cop who befriends mcclane and who happens to be black 
mercifully the filmmakers had the intelligence to leave race out of 
it and presented gilyard as just another human being

president jose napoleon duarte 
opened a muchpostponed central american summit today saying the 
five leaders are optimistic about bringing peace and progress to the 
turbulent region 
flanked by presidents jose azcona of honduras daniel ortega of 
nicaragua oscar arias of costa rica and vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala duarte made the brief statement opening the meeting at 
tesoro beach a seaside resort 40 miles southeast of san salvador 
i am sure that we with optimism will analyze the efforts 
weve made according to the esquipulas ii plan and search for 
favorable solutions that will promote peace and progress in central 
america duarte said 
then the presidents went into closed session 
the stalled peace plan was named for the guatemalan city where 
the five presidents decided to sign the august 1987 agreement 
diplomats say nicaraguas four neighbors plan to press its 
government for democratic reforms promised under the peace plan 
the main roadblock in nicaragua has been removed the 
contras said one diplomat referring to the decline of the 
nicaraguan rebels called contras there are no more obstacles to 
reform and no more excuses 
at the same time nicaragua probably has most to gain from the 
conference which it hopes will help destroy the contras 
among the most important things that will be dealt with at the 
summit is the matter of verification and control of borders 
duarte told a news conference last week 
ortega said upon his arrival sunday that he believed the leaders 
are going to ratify a new plan to step up border controls to 
prevent the central american neighbors from supporting subversion 
against one another 
central american foreign ministers met un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar in new york last week and called for 
creation of an impartial mechanism to verify compliance along 
borders 
about 11000 contras remain in honduran camps near nicaraguas 
border but the bush administration has made no request for renewed 
military aid and senior us officials acknowledge the era of an 
antisandinista army as an arm of us policy has passed 
nicaragua has scheduled elections for 1990 and has met with 
opposition leaders to discuss its recent economic austerity 
measures but the opposition claims sandinista talk of democratic 
reform is window dressing 
a costa rican diplomat said that unless the sandinistas make 
precise commitments and agree to deadlines for democratization 
measures we will have to prepare for the peace plans funeral 
and the nicaraguans will have to accept responsibility for its 
demise 
arias won the nobel peace prize for writing the plan which is 
designed to bring peace and promote democracy in the turbulent 
region 
we go to the summit full of optimism despite the obstacles 
because reality demands the search for solutions to the problems we 
central americans have arias was quoted as saying by the costa 
rican newspaper el diario de la republica on sunday 
a summit in august was to mark the anniversary of the plans 
signing but the presidents who last met 13 months ago could not 
agree on an agenda the meeting has since been scheduled and 
postponed five times 
when the peace plan was signed stubborn civil wars plagued el 
salvador and guatemala and the contras were waging a fierce campaign 
against the sandinistas 
duartes usbacked government and the leftist guerrillas 
battling it were unable to negotiate a ceasefire guatemalas 
leftist rebels have been reduced to isolated zones but remain 
active and cerezos government has not sought negotiations 
the united states cut off military aid to the contras a year ago 
and the rebels signed a preliminary ceasefire with the sandinistas 
in march although some fighting continues it now is scattered and 
sporadic 
nicaragua however has been strongly criticized for failing to 
live up to the plans requirement to strengthen democratic 
institutions and practices 
besides that the plan calls for amnesties for political 
prisoners a halt to outside aid to insurgents and prohibits 
signatories from allowing their territory to be used as bases for 
attacks against anothers territory

boulder district attorney alex hunter says 
there has been no lack of volunteers since he asked attorneys to 
donate their time to defend rape victims sued by the men who 
allegedly attacked them 
we have already had two cases in the last several months in 
which the suspects have instituted civil suits against the victim 
he said i cant remember another situation like this involving 
rape victims in the 16 years i have been district attorney 
local rape crisis officials say the lawsuits against victims will 
deter even more women from reporting sex crimes such lawsuits 
which also have been filed elsewhere usually stem from rape cases 
in which the people involved either were dating or were acquainted 
officials say 
in one of the two boulder cases university of colorado football 
player george massucco filed a slander suit against a cu student 
after he was charged with firstdegree sexual assault 
his attorney patrick butler said his client only kissed the 
woman he said massucco is not going to sit idly by and let this 
happen massucco alleges the woman made wrongful careless and 
negligent allegations that humiliated him 
in the other case a woman filed a lawsuit against her alleged 
attacker after prosecutors refused to file criminal charges the man 
filed a countersuit after the woman refused to sign a statement 
absolving him of guilt 
dan caplis an attorney for that 18yearold man said his client 
didnt want to sue but felt he had no other way to clear his name 
the man accuses the woman of abuse of process malicious prosecution 
and outrageous conduct 
you have to take these cases individually caplis said my 
client is not guilty i understand the concern of the rape crisis 
personnel and i share that i might even volunteer to help on some 
of the cases myself but you have to consider it case by case 
laura sharpe a counselor for the rape crisis center in boulder 
said there is a concern that a legal precedent might be set if one 
of the women loses her case she said the fact that attorneys are 
willing to volunteer their time to defend such cases will help 
persuade women to come forward 
i think the fact that attorneys are volunteering their time 
sends a message that they believe in the victim there is always the 
possibility they could lose the case but having someone standing by 
your side is a powerful statement she said 
nancy biele president of the national coalition against sexual 
assaults in minneapolis said of the trend to lawsuits that many 
prosecutors are unwilling to take on date rape cases unless they 
have a good chance of winning 
some are poor cases and need to be turned down some of them 
are so awful it would be unethical to file charges but others could 
be prosecuted and they simply wont take them because theyre not 
sure of winning she said 
michael enwall a former boulder district court judge has 
offered his help to defend women but said civil court is not the 
place to fight such battles he said defendants in rape cases who 
believe they have been wrongly accused should seek redress in 
criminal court where perjury charges could be filed 
but he said that because of the different evidence requirements 
in civil and criminal courts the wrongly accused have a better 
chance of winning in civil court in criminal courts prosecutors 
must prove a defendants guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt 
sometimes difficult to do in rape cases especially those involving 
date rape in civil courts the only requirement is a 
preponderance of evidence

the energy department said monday it has no 
plans to stop selling tritium to private customers despite what it 
calls an approaching shortage of the radioactive gas which is used 
in manufacturing most us nuclear weapons 
the government has been selling tritium to private corporations 
and research groups both domestic and foreign for decades but the 
practice has come under review since the nations only maker of the 
gas was shut down last spring 
the energy department in charge of making all us nuclear 
warheads and their components has cited the risk of a tritium 
squeeze in urging congress to approve construction of two 
newgeneration tritiumproducing reactors to replace the aging and 
inefficient savannah river reactor complex near aiken sc 
the savannah river reactors were closed down last spring for 
safetyrelated reasons and no firm timetable for resuming operation 
has been set 
phil keif a department spokesman said officials decided to 
continue the tritium sales since the amounts involved are a small 
piece of total supplies and since the government expects at least 
one of the three savannah river reactors to be restarted by years 
end 
keif said the government expects to sell about 230 grams of 
tritium in the fiscal year ending sept 30 at the current sales 
prices of about 28000 per gram this years sales would be worth 
about 64 million the price was more than doubled last oct 1 
the amount of tritium in existing stockpiles and the 
governments annual requirements are classified alan kuperman 
issues director at the nuclear control institute a private policy 
group said it is generally believed that the pentagon uses between 
5000 and 8000 grams of tritium a year 
tritium is used in most nuclear weapons to increase the explosive 
power of the warhead the gas decays relatively quickly and so must 
be replenished periodically 
tritium is used commercially for a variety of research and 
medical purposes and for making selfluminous lights signs dials 
watches and gun sights 
last year the department through its oak ridge national 
laboratory in tennessee sold 247 grams of tritium to 24 customers 
said jim alexander a spokesman at oak ridge he said 94 grams were 
purchased by domestic organizations and 153 grams went to foreign 
buyers including japan atomic research institute 
oak ridge has received no information from headquarters that we 
should stop taking commercial orders alexander said 
keif said the situation was under regular review 
we looked it over its an option to stop commercial sales 
keif said but for the time being sales will continue he added 
since the squeeze on tritium supplies is not critical 
its serious but its not critical keif said 
earlier this month troy e wade iii the acting assistant 
secretary for defense programs told a senate panel the department 
hoped to get one of the three savannah river production reactors 
back in operation by the end of the year 
if a reactor is not restarted this year then the supply of 
tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear 
stockpile may be affected he said 
last fall the pentagon suggested a serious shortage would develop 
by this summer if production were not resumed 
some private analysts said the governments willingness to 
continue selling tritium could mean supplies are less limited than 
the energy department has suggested 
kuperman said his group believes the united states could maintain 
its current stockpile of nuclear weapons for three to six years 
without any additional tritium production the boston globe last 
month reported that an internal pentagon study said the halt to 
tritium production could continue for another 18 months to two years 
without affecting the readiness of the nuclear arsenal

secretary of state james a baker iii 
on his first diplomatic tour of west european capitals is finding 
it difficult to compete with the public relations blitz of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev a senior us official said monday 
baker also is having his problems with west german leaders and 
their reluctance to support the upgrading of natos tactical nuclear 
missiles the official said but after touching base in six of the 
15 allied capitals bakers biggest problem is gorbachev and the 
inroads he has made in western european public opinion 
there is just an attraction an intriguing quality to gorbachev 
that you have to answer somehow said the official who 
participated in most of the meetings baker has held on his trip 
we have no answer the official told reporters as baker flew 
back to west germany for talks with chancellor helmut kohl and 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
responding to strong disaramament trends among the german people 
kohl last week proposed a delay of two or three years in upgrading 
the shortrange lance missile deployed in the country 
the north atlantic treaty organization faces a decision in a few 
months on whether to double the range of the usbuilt rockets from 
70 miles to about 150 miles 
kohl told reporters he wants nato to build into its defense 
strategy a disarmament mandate if the allies go ahead with a plan 
after talking to the chancellor baker told reporters he hoped 
the issue could be settled at a nato summit meeting which is being 
planned for late may in brussels 
he said kohl gave assurances that he was not backing off west 
germanys approval of a nato declaration last year saying the 
allied defense should mix nuclear and conventional weapons that 
will continue to be kept up to date 
covering 15 capitals in eight days is testing bakers endurance 
monday for instance was a threecountry day with stops in denmark 
norway and west germany tuesday will be no easier with baker going 
to turkey greece and italy 
the conversations so far in canada iceland britain west 
germany denmark and norway have been warm personal and 
professional said the us official who requested anonymity 
its going very very well 
and yet the us official acknowledged baker is having a 
difficult time competing with gorbachevs highprofile diplomacy 
the soviet leader is withdrawing soviet troops from afghanistan and 
offered to remove six tank divisions and 50000 men from eastern 
europe 
baker pointed out to the western ministers that at home however 
gorbachev is faced with a failing economy and that the jury is 
still out on whether he will be successful in trying to revive it 
the us official said 
the challenge baker and the allies face is not a question of an 
initiative the official said people feel very comfortable that 
we have the initiative on substance but it is undeniable that as 
you go around people can see that when it comes to capturing public 
attention the western agenda has a hard time competing with 
gorbachevs own ability to attract attention

the body of cave explorer william floyd 
collins whose 1925 entrapment and death in a cave became national 
news will be laid to rest again spring perhaps for the last time 
after his death in sand cave collins body was recovered and 
buried exhumed for public display stolen and dumped along the 
banks of the green river and put back on display 
the time has come to let him rest in peace said donnie 
collins a horse cave resident and collins greatnephew he 
deserves it after all these years 
collins relatives and the national park service have worked out 
arrangements to reinter the body 
hell be buried in a cemetery on the mammoth cave national 
park grounds in late march donnie collins said were not sure 
exactly when it will be but theres no rush after all this time 
hes still dead 
the park now includes caves that collins discovered and died in 
collins was 37 when he entered sand cave on jan 30 1925 in 
hopes of finding a new entrance to crystal cave the cavern he 
discovered under his fathers edmonson county farm on jan 18 1917 
caves in the area were privately operated then and competition 
for tourists dollars was intense 
collins was on his way out of sand cave headfirst and on his 
back when he was trapped in a small passageway by rocks that fell 
onto his foot and ankle 
more than 30 news agencies sent reporters to the site and 
thousands of spectators watched while rescuers tried in vain to dig 
a shaft parallel to the cave to reach collins 
collins was pronounced dead feb 16 18 days after entering the 
cave 
his body was removed from the cave without fanfare and was buried 
near an entrance to crystal cave 
later the body was disinterred placed in a different casket and 
displayed in a large cavern in crystal cave 
it was stolen four years later the body was found at the edge of 
the green river but one of collins legs the one which had been 
trapped by the rocks had been sawed off 
eventually the body was redressed and returned to crystal cave 
where it remains today in a black casket chained securely to a 
concrete base 
that cave has been closed since 1961 when it was bought by the 
park service until then collins casket was the highlight of tours 
and until 1948 visitors could view the body through a window in 
the casket lid 
im tickled to death theyre finally going to bury him for 
good said pat thomas a bowling green police polygraph examiner 
during his college days he worked for oo burgess the funeral 
home director who embalmed collins 
after burgess died his daughter gave thomas a set of slides 
burgess had bought that photographically detailed the events 
surrounding collins death 
thats part of the commercialism of the whole deal thomas 
said i wouldnt trade those slides for anything but it shows you 
the way floyd was exploited after his death

abcs roseanne breaks ground this week with a 
girls comingofage story that gives series star roseanne barr a 
chance to show a softer side 
in tuesday nights episode of the hit bluecollar sitcom 
11yearold darlene portrayed by sara gilbert gets her period the 
episode written by grace mckeaney and directed by john pasquin 
handles the subject gently while still being funny 
coexecutive producer tom werner said monday he is unaware of any 
sitcom that has dealt with a girls puberty in such a way before 
i think its a terrific area to be doing he said 
obviously were doing a family show and were trying to do 
something that is not only entertaining but is informative 
and i think its an important story because i think its 
important for young women to know what menstruation is about before 
it begins so that perhaps they wont be as frightened and confused 
by it as certainly can happen he said 
werner and his partner marcy carsey also are executive 
producers of nbcs toprated the cosby show roseanne the 
biggest new hit of the season and abcs toprated show recently 
underwent a change in producers cocreator matt williams left 
citing creative differences with barr 
werner said the tuesday episode was written after williams left 
but doesnt necessarily reflect a change in the direction of the 
sitcom 
i think were always trying to make good episodes and i think 
its a chance to do a problem from a mothers point of view that is 
interesting and different he said 
the episode begins with the family gathering around the tv set to 
watch scary movies roseanne is not particularly thrilled since the 
kids tend to be up half the night with nightmares sure enough 
darlene cant sleep but she insists it isnt because of a dream 
by the next morning the irrepressible tomboy is moping around 
are you worried about your basketball game her parents ask 
no im not worried about the basketball game 
did you screw up in history again 
no i didnt screw up in history again i got my period ok 
darlene stomps out leaving roseanne and her husband dan john 
goodman to gape at each other 
later that day roseanne and her sister jackie laurie metcalf 
recall their mothers lessthanhelpful advice to feel free to ask 
the school nurse if they had any questions about the change of 
life 
in what werner describes aptly as a lovely scene darlene 
runs into dan in the garage he feels compelled to say something on 
this momentous occasion but all he can come up with is a punch in 
the arm and an awkward good goin 
when darlene starts throwing out her beloved sports 
paraphernalia roseanne gets the chance to dispense some motherly 
wisdom 
i thought there was a lovely scene from dans point of view in 
the show werner said i thought that the way roseanne 
connerslashroseanne barr handled it was terrific because i think 
she tried to discuss the problem with her which i think is 
important and she actually made her daughter feel like this was the 
beginning of a new and exciting phase in her life and welcome to 
being a woman 
werner said the episode was probably originally the idea of 
writer mckeaney though it would have been developed by the writers 
with barr and was a subject almost everyone on the show could relate 
to in some way 
im going through it as a father werner said roseanne 
obviously has gone through it as a mother jeff harris who is the 
head writer has gone through it as a father i think were excited 
about it because i think it was handled in a wellcrafted way and i 
think it made its point without being too heavyhanded

moslem fundamentalists around the 
world demand that salman rushdies novel the satanic verses be 
banned as blasphemy against islam and this weekend the campaign 
turned violent 
at least five people were killed and more than 80 injured sunday 
when police fired on a mob trying to storm the us information 
center in islamabad the protesters demanded the book be banned in 
the united states 
fundamentalists say the book does not recognize islam as the one 
true religion and ridicules the most precious moslem beliefs 
pakistan and other moslem nations banned the book after its 
publication last year 
rushdie 41 was born in india to moslem parents and educated in 
britain where he lives his other books include midnights 
children which won britains prestigious booker prize shame 
and the jaguar smile 
the literary success of the satanic verses a complex work 
that focuses on good and evil has been confined to a fairly small 
intellectual readership in western nations in november the book 
won the new novel category in the annual literary competition 
sponsored by the whitbread brewing giant but it did not win the 
overall whitbread prize 
leaders of the islamabad march said it was intended to be 
peaceful but police reacted improperly 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the protest apparently was inspired by reviews last week in 
international news magazines one official said the reviews had 
the first details anyone had about the book nobody here has read 
the book 
the satanic verses is a rambling fantasy on the birth of 
religion modern history and human relations it begins with two men 
tumbling skyward from a jumbo jet destroyed by a terrorist bomb and 
chronicles their adventures 
a part of the novel fictionalizes certain episodes from the 
koran the moslem holy book and the life of the prophet mohammed in 
what western book critics say is clearly satire they have praised 
the book for imaginative vision and depth 
the author says his book is a work of fiction that does not 
attack islam contains no blasphemy and is not intended to offend 
anyone 
it is not a source of satisfaction to me to be banned in the 
moslem world he said in a recent interview with the herald a 
pakistani magazine 
moslem leaders describe the novel as an attack on mohammed 
intended to insult moslems and lead them astray 
syed mohammed younus kazmi a pakistani moslem leader said 
the book has fictitious characters that carricature the holy 
prophet and his companions the book contains insulting and 
derogratory remarks 
kazmi and other islamic theologians say the book must be banned 
because it does not treat mohammed as the prophet of the worlds one 
true religion they believe mohammed and the koran must be portrayed 
only as representing divine truth 
rushdie has offended millions of moslems around the world 
kazmi said in an interview such a person cannot be allowed to do 
these things 
fundamentalist leaders claimed sundays march was not an 
antiamerican protest even though many of their followers see the 
united states as a corrupt secular culture and enemy of islam 
protesters chanted american dogs and other slogans against the 
united states 
it was not an attack on the united states we just hoped to 
create moral support for our cause to stop this unholy book being 
printed again kazmi said 
leaflets circulated by fundamentalist groups characterize the 
novel as a blasphemous semipornographic attack that says the 
prophet was inspired by the devil his wife was a prostitute and his 
companions were evil 
there are insulting remarks in this book said mohammed 
sadiq a theology student there are lies in this book we want 
this book banned in america and around the world 
according to the author his novel has been distorted by 
fundamentalists who have not read it and oppose any idea that does 
not reflect their fanatical literal faith he said he has received 
death threats 
rushdie has declared himself fascinated by religion and its 
development and role in history 
he has been quoted as saying religions are codes with which 
human beings have tried to understand their presence on the planet 
and discuss their moral behavior my point of view is that of a 
secular human being i do not believe in supernatural entities 
whether christian jewish moslem or hindu 
prime minister benazir bhutto and other government leaders called 
the protest at the american center an attack by fundamentalist 
parties trying to drive her from office by straining relations with 
pakistans ally the united states 
rushdie says he has every right to deal with islam in a creative 
fashion and i am not going to run away from the subject because 
it is my subject and it is my birthright and nobody can take that 
away from me

sardarchuk would not say how many soldiers remained in kabul 
after mondays ceremony which had been billed as the departure of 
the last red army troopers they could be seen in armored personnel 
carriers posted around the airports military section and along its 
perimeter 
its a deception of sorts a soviet diplomat said privately

un agencies had hoped to deliver another 360 tons of food 
medicine and blankets by wednesday for the poorest residents of 
kabul which has been swollen by refugees to twice its normal 
population of 1 million 
these people are not the ones who will carry the guns one 
source said of the women and children lining up for food these 
are people who are hungry and will suffer the most if the situation 
deteriorates 
un relief centers opened on monday to distribute food in some 
of kabuls poorest neighborhoods

communist party leader karoly grosz 
attacked the state media in a speech published monday and he ruled 
out cooperation with extremists outside the party 
the speech was delivered at a secretive twoday session of the 
partys central committee that for the first time endorsed the 
introduction of a multiparty system in hungary 
the body agreed to open talks with representatives of the many 
alternative movements that have sprung up recently but set no firm 
timetable for the first multiparty elections or other aspects of the 
new system saying a transition must be gradual 
groszs speech which opened the session friday wasnt published 
until monday when it appeared in the party daily nepszabadsag 
he attacked the unidentified extremist wing of the 
alternative organizations that were legalized last month a bill due 
to be passed by aug 1 in parliament is to legalize alternative 
political parties 
grosz made clear these parties would be expected not to reject 
socialism outright to accept hungarys membership of the warsaw 
pact military alliance and to prevent any deepening of 
hungarys current crisis 
there is increasing dissatisfaction over a range of austerity 
measures and price increases grosz and other leaders insist are 
essential to boost the economy and help repay the 17 billion 
foreign debt 
grosz said the partys support is narrowing and the alleged 
extremists outside the party try to undermine it further by talking 
of divisions between reform communists and stalinists preventing 
the creation of a viable center 
he also accused the more outspoken programs on state radio and tv 
and particularly the daily magyar nemzet which has published 
astonishing articles in recent months of undermining the system and 
spreading lies 
grosz seemed to be trying to carve out a middle ground making 
attacks that would please old guard communists but also praising 
what he called the more composed forces in the new alternative 
groups 
there is a realistic possibility to establish a lasting 
political alliance with these forces grosz said without 
identifying them 
a party sociologist interviewed in the trade union daily nepszava 
on monday singled out the social democractic party the hungarian 
democratic forum the smallholders party and another agrarianbased 
group as possible partners for the communist party 
the sociologist istvan stumpf said he thought the social 
democrats stood a very good chance of regaining credit for the 
idea of socialism 
his phrasing groszs statements and the central committee 
communique suggested the communists see a multiparty system as a 
vehicle for making socialism popular again rather than introducing 
westernstyle democracy 
stumpf said no one alternative group had worked out a fully 
viable economic and political program and called for the 
alternatives to be given full access to data needed to conceive such 
policies 
that would mean opening up government economic and other data to 
groups outside the party which dominates virtually the entire state 
and government apparatus 
neither grosz nor stumpf set any date for introducing a fully 
operational multiparty system or any possible coalition grosz said 
the transition would take a long time and that parliamentary 
elections next year would mark only the first stage 
representatives from five of the alternative groups met later 
monday and gave a guarded welcome to the central committees 
statement 
balint major of the alliance of free democrats said the central 
committee statement definitely means some progress but contains 
some bombshells that suggest the ruling party is still reluctant 
to share power

pressures to attract grants develop drugs and 
publish new findings create an environment that tolerates fraud and 
misconduct in medical research a study said monday 
although the study by the private institute of medicine said 
that instances of outright larboratory fraud remain rare its 
authors recommended that the medical research community overhaul the 
ways it polices itself to control such things as fabricated data 
plagarism and carelessness 
arthur h rubenstein chairman of medicine at the university of 
chicago said that in the last decade there has been a sharpened 
competition for shrinking research funds and a growing need to 
establish reputations through the publication of findings 
all of these create new stresses in which people would be 
forced to do this commit research misconduct more likely than they 
would have been 10 years ago he said 
to protect society from research flaws he said the science 
community needs to use new ways to encourage ethical research and to 
deal with cheaters past methods including peer review and 
duplication of test results are not enough now to prevent careless 
sloppy or fraudulent research he said 
generally the public has not been affected directly by research 
misconduct but fake research has caused lost time and effort by 
other scientists who trusted such findings the committee said 
a very small percentage of causes of outandout fraud have had 
a public impact said committee member paul j friedman of the 
university of california san diego school of medicine luckily 
most cases have not had an impact on how doctors treat patients 
he said however that one research finding later proven to be 
false was printed in 30 scientific journals before it was detected 
after the fraud was discovered said friedman the journals didnt 
know what to do and only now are trying to find a way to deal with 
phony published research 
the institute of medicine chartered by the quasigovernmental 
national academy of sciences organized the 17member committee in 
1987 after a series of fraudulent and careless laboratory reports 
had come to light the committee was charged with developing 
proposals to strengthen professional standards in the nations 
federal and academic laboratories 
the report said that few institutions have explicit research 
guidelines this allows the system to tolerate substandard 
activities by a small number of individual investigators who fail to 
observe generally accepted practices the report added 
at the news conference rubenstein said that the amount of fraud 
in university government and industry research cannot be estimated 
the committee report said that in the last decade there have been 
incidents of serious research misconduct at yale university cornell 
university harvard medical school massachusetts general hospital 
and boston university 
these incidents the study said raised new questions about the 
ability of academic institutions to conduct objective investigations 
of misconduct by their own faculty members or research staff 
a system of peer review and replication of research findings has 
been a standard way to guard against science errors the committee 
said but it said this system has failed because findings often 
arent checked by replication in other laboratories and the peer 
review system depends on trust 
the committee noted that researchers are pressured to build a 
list of publications to which they have contributed academic 
advancement and salary increases can depend on the number of 
publications 
as a result the committee said some authors credited with 
reports often participated only marginally the leaders of some 
laboratories put their names on all research from their labs and 
the names of prominent researchers were often added to those of the 
true authors in an effort to assure publication 
to correct the problems the committee made 16 recommendations 
these included 
that by 1992 all institutions conducting medical research for 
the national institutes of health be required to adopt specific 
policies to promote ethical research practices and to investigate 
misconduct 
that the nih limit the number of publications considered in a 
grant application so that evaluations of a researchers work are 
based on quality not quantity 
that academic departments should adopt new authorship policies 
not emphasizing quantity 
that whistleblowers those who report scientific misconduct 
be protected

lawyers for oliver north said in two court 
filings released today that they would be unable to defend him 
adequately under a proposed agreement to control the use of 
classified material north wants to use in his defense 
the proposed agreement would guarantee a cuckooclock trial 
that would make a mockery of the adversarial process said norths 
lawyer brendan sullivan he said that without the information he 
wants to present we cannot adequately defend this case 
part of the proposed agreement would bar north from offering 
evidence about central american countries support for the contras 
in exchange for favors by the reagan administration 
under the agreement a candid admission by the government of 
a quid pro quo arrangement would be sufficient said the court 
filing by independent counsel lawrence walsh 
sullivan said that a quid pro quo admission fails to 
acknowledge that president reagan and other top administration 
officials established a policy that the arrangements would not be 
disclosed outside the executive branch if imposed by the court 
said sullivan that part of the agreement would cripple the 
defense of this case 
the agreement was worked out between walshs office which is 
prosecuting north and the justice department which fears that 
north will spill classified material at his trial damaging to 
national security 
the proposed order sought under the agreement would gut the 
defense by barring north from using critical information about 
the reagan administrations thirdcountry arrangements for military 
support of the nicaraguan resistance and the official 
nondisclosure of those arrangements said one of the filings by 
sullivan 
in referring to a cuckooclock trial sullivan was quoting 
the judge in the irancontra case us district judge gerhard a 
gesell gesell has made it clear that he doesnt want constant 
interruptions at the trial to hear objections about national 
security concerns 
the governments proposed order would have nine categories of 
classified information that should not be revealed at trial before 
prosecutors have had an opportunity to contest its relevance 
they include information identifying undercover cia officers the 
locations of cia stations identities of foreign individuals who 
work for the cia and details about cia operations with foreign 
intelligence services 
also included would be material about american intelligence 
collection on terrorism and efforts to locate hostages and us 
covert activities other than military support for the contras and 
names of noncentral american countries that supported the contras 
unless gesell approves the agreement walsh and the justice 
department agree it will be impossible to protect against 
disclosure of classified information that is of vital importance to 
the national security and the foreign relations of the united states 
the trial could not go forward in this state of uncertainty 
walsh said in a motion that outlined the governments proposed order 
referring to the nine areas of material on which the proposal 
would impose tight controls sullivan said that these openended 
amorphous categories would guarantee that the trial would be a 
constant bench conference not a real trial 
if gesell rejects the governments proposed order attorney 
general dick thornburgh acting on concerns of the us intelligence 
community might file an affidavit with the court objecting to 
disclosure of classified material on grounds it would harm national 
security 
under the classified information procedures act the judge would 
then be required to bar disclosure which could lead to the 
dismissal of some or all charges in the case depending on the scope 
of the affidavit 
sullivan suggested that thornburgh is supporting the proposed 
order because he apparently does not want to take the political 
heat associated with filing an affidavit that could result in 
sanctions affecting the triability of the case 
sullivan said that it is understandable that if the case is 
untriable the attorney general would rather blame someone other 
than the administration 
the court filings by walsh and sullivan came hours after gesell 
sent the jury home and scheduled a hearing for tuesday on the 
proposed agreement for additional national security safeguards that 
could allow the case to go forward 
the proposed agreement ends a dispute between walsh and the 
justice department which began last wednesday when the department 
began seeking an order that would impose tight restrictions on 
classified material that north wanted to present at trial 
gesell rejected the proposal and accepted more moderate controls 
offered by walsh who said he wanted to proceed with the trial 
immediately on thursday the justice department went to court to 
try to delay the trial 
the department said it had concluded and that walsh concurred 
that the trial could not go forward without an additional 
protective order 
it wasnt known how quickly gesell who scheduled a hearing for 
tuesday would rule on the motion 
the justice department on sunday was granted an administrative 
stay of the trial by chief justice william rehnquist with the full 
supreme court to meet friday to consider the justice departments 
request to delay the trial 
hours later the department and walsh announced their proposed 
agreement saying that if gesell approves it the department will 
ask that rehnquists stay be vacated 
the justice department said that without an additional protective 
order it will be impossible during the defenses opening 
statement and presentation of evidence to protect against the 
unnecessary and uncontrolled disclosure of classified information 
the department said that an enormous number of the 300 
classified documents north may use at his trial are not yet 
clearly covered by a protective order of the court

the officer whose shooting of a black motorcyclist 
touched off three days of racial violence last month formally 
pleaded innocent monday while his attorney said evidence showed it 
was a case of self defense 
william lozano 29 is free on bond on two manslaughter counts in 
the jan 16 shooting death of the motorcycle driver clement lloyd 
23 and in the death of his passenger allan blanchard 24 who 
suffered severe head trauma in a crash following the shooting 
lozanos attorney roy black unsuccessfully sought a delay in 
the trial monday because of the racially charged atmosphere in 
miami and indicated he may seek to have the trial moved to another 
city the trial was set for june 19 
lozano accompanied by his wife refused to talk when he left the 
courthouse but black attacked the case 
the evidence shows lozano shot as the motorcycle was about to 
hit him that he only shot to use justifiable force in 
selfdefense the attorney said if this had been explained to 
people immediately that night i think there would have been a lot 
less disturbances here in miami 
the three nights of rioting that followed the shooting left one 
person dead 11 wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down 
black produced autopsy reports showing the bullet entered the 
front of lloyds head and said the medical examiner found that the 
victim had not only been drinking but had used cocaine shortly 
before his death 
quoting from a statement by lozanos partner officer dawn 
campbell black sought to show the colombianborn policeman had no 
choice but to shoot when lloyd raced his machine down the wrong side 
of the street 
the motorcycle was traveling at 70 miles an hour right at him 
by the time he looked up it was right in front of him this guy was 
coming directly at him he started on the line and then he comes 
over like that in the southbound lane if he would have moved the 
guy would have moved too in my opinion black read from ms 
campbells statement 
many in miamis colombian community have rallied in support of 
lozano and about 25 people picketed outside the courtroom monday 
demanding he be given a fair trial 
black questioned how he could investigate the case saying any 
effort to question witnesses in the overtown neighborhood where the 
shooting occurred could begin the disturbances all over again 
leaders in the black community disputed that view however 
i know there are ways they can get the information that they 
need to conduct the trial said raymond fauntroy head of the 
miami chapter of the southern christian leadership conference and 
we just want a speedy trial to get this behind us so we can go on 
and rebuild our community

britain this week will press the international 
civil aviation organization for bombdetection measures to be built 
into the design of aircraft according to transport secretary paul 
channon 
the meeting wednesday and thursday of the 33nation organization 
in montreal was called by the united states and britain after the 
dec 21 air disaster over lockerbie scotland when a bomb blew 
apart a pan am boeing 747 all 259 people aboard and 11 people on 
the ground were killed 
it still has not been established whether the bomb placed in 
luggage was put aboard at londons heathrow airport or in 
frankfurt west germany where the new yorkbound flight originated 
channon said he also planned to put forward proposals which he 
did not specify on better screening of baggage control of access 
to airport and detection of explosives 
he said he backed us resistance to publicizing anonymous 
warnings about sabotage attacks against a particular airline it 
emerged after the lockerbie disaster that the us government had 
received a warning of an attack against pan am 
if you were to announce every one warning you would be 
announcing them all the time and people would soon get totally 
inured to them said channon 
the international civil aviation organization includes western 
third world and east bloc countries 
we are faced with an international problem and we must find an 
international solution to it channon said

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will 
begin a fivenation tour of the middle east this week aimed at 
achieving a tangible breakthrough in settling the arabisraeli 
conflict an official said 
vadim perfiliev a soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
shevardnadze will visit syria on feb 1719 jordan on feb 19 
egypt on feb 2022 iraq on feb 2325 and iran on feb 2527 
shevardnadzes visit is evidence of an increasing soviet role in 
the middle east the last time a soviet foreign minister visited 
egypt was in 1975 when andrei a gromyko held the post 
according to perfiliev shevardnadzes trip will take place in 
the framework of the soviet unions consistent efforts to achieve a 
comprehensive and just settlement in the middle east taking into 
account the interests of all people involved 
we seek to attain a tangible breakthrough in settling this old 
conflict he said without elaborating 
the kremlin supports the idea of an international middle east 
peace conference to be attended by the parties to the conflict plus 
the united states soviet union and other permanent members of the 
un security council 
israel has made restoration of sovietisraeli relations severed 
by the soviet union in 1967 a precondition for a soviet role in 
middle east peace talks 
jordans king hussein said sunday he was quite optimistic an 
international conference on arabisraeli peace could take place soon 
in response to a reporters question perfiliev said he did not 
know whether shevardnadze would be meeting during his trip with

the soviet union said monday it is readying a 
series of laws in the human rights field including freedom of the 
press and the right to leave the country 
we are trying to implement fully our legislation in accordance 
with international standards said felix stanevski the soviet 
chief delegate to the un human rights commission 
we are well aware that only by guaranteeing human rights and 
freedoms can we open up the whole potential of our society he 
said in a speech in the 40nation commission 
only by such guarantees he said can the soviet union improve 
the standards of living and quality of life of the people solve the 
tasks of the environment and move science and technology forward 
he said measures already adopted over a short period of time 
shall improve the situation of the people in the soviet union in a 
broad range of areas 
among the measures he mentioned were new provisions ensuring 
the right of the mentally ill and the opening of new monasteries 
and churches 
soon there will be another series of laws he said these 
have to do with the areas of freedom of conscience of information 
and the press of social organizations and of entry and exit 
into and from the country 
reform of the soviet criminal code also is being prepared he 
said additional guarantees which will exclude the possibility of 
prosecution for political and religious convictions are also under 
way 
in a brief interview with the associated press stanevski said 
the soviet union probably would join a key human rights protocol 
that would allow its citizens to turn invidually to a un body if 
they feel wronged 
it would give the un human rights committee the right to 
examine the complaints and take the matter up with the soviet 
government 
only about one fourth of the un member nations have ratified 
that optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and 
political rights which is a binding instrument under 
international law most countries including the united states are 
reluctant to join the protocol which went into effect in 1976

representatives of the solidarity trade 
union and the government reported sharp differences monday after a 
meeting of a working group devoted to solving polands economic 
problems 
at issue was whether a government plan to attack the economic 
crisis would be adopted by the working group as the basis for its 
deliberations 
solidarity considers the plan drafted by the government of prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski a good declaration of 
intentions but short on specifics solidarity spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz said at a news conference 
the opposition has not offered a reasonable alternative to the 
plan said industry minister mieczyslaw wilczek speaking at a 
separate news conference 
the working group on the economy which includes representatives 
from the opposition the government and the official trade union 
alliance opzz is part a broad series of negotiations known as the 
round table that began feb 6 
other working groups are meeting on issues of political reforms 
and trade union freedoms and the whole series of negotiations is 
expected to last three to five more weeks 
solidarity activist mieczyslaw gil said deputy prime minister 
irenuesz sekula displayed a really worrying tone at the talks 
that indicates that the government still has a monopoly in 
implementing economic reforms 
a government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski characterized the talks 
monday as rather difficult and exchanges of monologues 
rather than a discussion 
the economic debate is so vast that so far it is hard to put 
some order into it he said 
onyszkiewicz expressed wariness but said that our hopes are 
not quite blown yet 
it seem that the authorities would like to obtain our stamp of 
approval under decisions that have already been made we have been 
and will be careful about it he said

the food and drug administration on monday 
issued final regulations for nonprescription sleepaid products 
that allow use of most of their active ingredients but bans other 
ingredients not proved safe and effective 
the major sleepaid products already meet the new standard and 
few changes will have to be made in product labeling fda officials 
said 
the regulations are not much different from the agencys 
tentative recommendations on sleepingaid ingredients issued in june 
1978 said mike benson a reviewing pharmacist with the fdas 
division of overthecounter drug evaluations 
the regulations to be published in tuesdays federal register 
will take effect in one year they were developed as part of the 
fdas review of all nonprescription drugs which began in 1972 
the fda standard allows use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and 
diphenhydramine citrate contained in the sleepaid products compoz 
nervine nytol sleepeze3 sleepinal sominex and sominex2 the 
fda said 
the agency also said approval of doxylamine succinate will remain 
in effect that ingredient is in unisom doxysom and ultra sleep 
not permitted are pyrilamine maleate potassium bromide sodium 
bromide and scopolamine hydrobromide products containing these 
ingredients must be reformulated the fda said 
the fda in its tentative finding 10 years ago had recommended 
banning these four ingredients unless they could be proved safe and 
effective and as a result many sleepingaid manufacturers stopped 
using them benson said 
claims on sleepingaid product labels substantially the same as 
those in the tentative recommendations may include helps you fall 
asleep if you have difficulty falling asleep for relief of 
occasional sleeplessness and helps to reduce difficulty falling 
asleep 
warning labels will have to be changed to add to the list of 
medical conditions that if present indicate the product should not 
be used the new labels must warn against taking the product if you 
have asthma glaucoma emphysema chronic pulmonary disease 
shortness of breath difficulty in breathing or difficulty in 
urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland unless directed 
by a doctor 
the new labels also strengthen the caution involving alcohol 
advising people to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking the 
product it also advises against taking the product if also taking 
sedatives or tranquilizers without consulting a doctor first

ptls assets 
the ptl ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in june 
1987 the nonprofit ministry arm that includes heritage church is 
separate from ptls assets which include two 500room hotels one 
unfinished a water park a television network and the heritage usa 
property 
the rev sam johnson pastor of the heritage church said the 
church submitted a proposal to mernick about 10 days ago offering to 
buy the television network other facilities and some undeveloped 
property 
johnson also said relocating the nonprofit ministry arm is 
under serious consideration and a move hinges on mernicks 
plans 
the lure of heritage usa is the christian theme johnson said 
and relocating heritage church would make the retreat less 
attractive 
the reason people come is of course the spritual reason 
theyve come to get their spiritual batteries recharged he said 
johnson would not say how much he offered mernick but he said 
the church is financially healthy with 5 million in the bank 
the joint management of heritage usa is the latest chapter in 
changes at ptls christian retreat since bakker resigned in march 
1987 amid revelations he had a sexual encounter with former church 
secretary jessica hahn and paid her hush money 
mernicks toronto spokesman tom reid said mernick sees ptl as a 
place he can turn around mernick bought the troubled firestone 
canada tire plant in hamilton ontario last year for the same 
reason reid said 
he looks at what he sees as a general malaise and he always 
looks for the potential reid said 
mernick 34 has a garbage disposal company landfill site waste 
water treatment business and travel company reid said

large or expensive valentines day gifts 
when someone is either falling out of love or already has done 
so and is feeling guilty sometimes they not only give a gift 
they go overboard said charles lowe a professor of psychology at 
the university of connecticut 
a 250 card from someone who customarily sends a more modest 
greeting can be a tipoff 
superficially gifts are always nice but gifts can be given 
for the wrong reason flattery ingratiation wanting to get 
something from you or guilt lowe said 
so how can one tell if a nice gift on valentines day is a sign 
cupid is on the mark or off target 
if this person has not done this in the past and comes up with 
a big gift thats something that needs to be thought about he 
said it could be either a sign of falling in love again or of

patricia barber who subscribes to the magazine 
she kept right on feeling good when the envelopes started pouring 
into the tiny upstate hamlet around midjanuary

to germany one to indonesia both of those had the right amount of 
postage on them 
many had little notes wishing me a happy valentines and hoping 
i was doing well two or three included an extra valentine 
especially for me 
normally barber forwards her mail to buffalo for machine 
canceling but for each piece of valentine mail she used her old

foreign minister moshe arens told a skeptical 
group of jews on monday that peace talks involving palestinians 
should be held with jordan not the plo 
an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile outlined a 
peace plan that calls for palestinians in the occupied lands to halt 
the 14month uprising in exchange for elections and negotiations 
but the aide yossi benaharon also ruled out talks with the plo 
a palestinian was killed and two others were wounded in the 
occupied west bank when an explosive device detonated after it was 
picked up the army said 
it said it was checking reports by hospitals and family members 
that two palestinian children were hurt in a blast in a nearby 
village 
in the occupied gaza strip troops opened fire on stonethrowing 
palestinians in the rafah refugee camp three palestinians were 
wounded including two teenagers struck in the head with 
rubbercoated metal bullets 
in a speech in jerusalem to the world sephardi federation arens 
argued that jordan was a predominantly palestinian state and that 
peace negotiations should be held with king hussein 
if you want to address the palestinian problem you have to 
talk to jordan he said 
arens said talking with the plo would only jeopardize peace 
efforts well simply strenghten extremism encourage violence 
and show that terrorism pays off he said 
but the sephardi federation a liberal organization of jews whose 
families came from arab countries issued a statement urging israel 
to take risks for peace that could include negotiations with the 
plo 
shamir is said to be developing a proposal to present when he 
visits the united states in march or april 
benaharon said it would not include talks with the plo with 
the plo there is nothing to talk about because we will not agree to 
the existence of a second arab state west of the jordan river 
he said 
he called for an end to the uprising secondly a formula for 
direct negotiations has to exist he said at a certain point 
free elections will have to be held in order to determine the 
representation that will decide the fate of our arab neighbors in 
the territories 
he said jordan should be a partner to the settlement 
since the palestinian uprising began at least 380 palestinians 
have been killed most as a result of army gunfire fifteen israelis 
also have died 
in a report released last week the us state department 
criticized israel for the way it had responded to the revolt saying 
many deaths could have been avoided 
defense minister yitzhak rabin made his first public comment on 
the report monday when he told the israeli parliament the army has 
behaved and continues to behave gritting its teeth against violence 
and provocations like the israel defense force 
we have nothing to hide because we are not embarrassed over 
what we are doing he said 
an army spokeswoman said a palestinian man was killed monday and 
two others wounded in a field near the west bank town of kabatiya 
when they found a suspicious object played with it and it 
exploded 
the spokeswoman who could not be identified under army 
regulations identified the dead man as amin mohammed amin of 
kabatiya she said there was no information on the inured 
doctors at nearby jenin hospital said they treated two kabatiya 
teenagers for shrapnel wounds from the blast 
soldiers cordoned off the site and investigators were trying to 
determine whether the explosive fell from an aircraft or was left 
after an army training exercise an arab reporter said 
in tayasir about 10 miles southeast of kabatiya two children 
were reported hurt in an explosion 
doctors and family members interviewed at alittihad hospital in 
nablus identified the children as iktimal abdullah 4 and her 
brother naim 10 family members said they heard an explosion and 
found the children on the ground 
iktimal abdullah later was transferred to mukassad hospital in 
east jerusalem where she was reported in critical condition with 
head wounds 
israel radio said it was not known what exploded but quoted 
family members as saying there were no israeli soldiers or civilians 
in the area at the time of the blast

angela lansbury whose highrated murder she 
wrote is one of the few bright spots on thirdplace cbs schedule 
has agreed to stay with the network for another year though not 
necessarily in the same show 
cbs announced monday that negotiations for another season of the 
top10 hour drama are continuing but that miss lansbury has agreed 
to star in at least 13 episodes of a new halfhour show on cbs the 
season after murder she wrote ends its run 
murder she wrote in which miss lansbury 63 plays a shrewd 
but grandmotherly mystery writer who gets involved in murder cases 
is in its fifth season after which miss lansbury had planned to 
quit under the new pact miss lansburys company corymore 
productions operated by her sons david and anthony shaw will 
produce the halfhour show and two madefortv movies for cbs over 
the next three years miss lansbury will star in at least one of the 
movies 
the wall street journal reported last week that miss lansbury and 
the rest of the murder she wrote crew had long grumbled about 
pennypinching by the network which had undertaken a lastditch 
campaign to keep the show for at least another year 
miss lansbury and crew celebrated the shows 100th episode in los 
angeles on sunday the day before the new cbs deal was announced 
im so proud of the show and i have so much a sense of 
accomplishment of having remained in the top 10 miss lansbury 
said at the bash 
miss lansbury said she was eager to continue with cbs if 
contractual hurdles could be cleared adding its awfully hard to 
walk away from success and leave an audience thats so dependent on 
the show 
murder she wrote draws an estimated 40 million viewers a 
week and is a linchpin in cbs successful sunday night lineup nbc 
is similarly dependent on the cosby show as an anchor for its 
top10 thursday night lineup and managed to eke another year out of 
star bill cosby who like miss lansbury had planned to quit his 
show after this season 
miss lansbury is a fourtime tony award winner for her roles in 
the broadway plays mame dear world gypsy and sweeney 
todd she has also appeared in such films as national velvet 
the long hot summer and the manchurian candidate

the federal trade commission said monday that a 
pittsburgh company will donate 600000 to three medical 
associations to settle complaints of false advertising 
the ftc said general nutrition corp signed a consent decree 
under which it pledged not to make false or unsubstantiated claims 
about its products 
signing the decree is not an admission of any violations 
violation of its terms can mean a fine of 10000 
the commission said the company made false and unsubstantiated 
claims that its healthy greens diet supplement was effective in 
reducing the risk of cancer 
also the commission said the company falsely claimed that six 
other supplements mainly sold to body builders promoted weight 
loss increased muscle growth and slowed aging 
the consent order was approved by a 31 vote commissioner margot 
machol did not participate the dissenter commissioner mary l 
azcuenaga said the order left the company free to sell products 
it knows are deceptively labeled 
the money will be split among the american heart association the 
american diabetes association and the american cancer society 
c stephen baker a lawyer handling the case in the commissions 
chicago office said such required donations were rare but had been 
used in the past 
such a remedy was chosen he said because it would be 
extraordinarily difficult or impossible to identify the people who 
had bought this stuff and should get refunds

all charges against a british tourist accused of 
setting a hotel fire that killed two people were dropped monday 
because the principal witness against her her boyfriend refused to 
testify 
tara jane terry 19 of camberley england faced a federal arson 
charge in the sept 17 blaze in miami beach at the nassau hotel 
which began in a room she shared with mark richardson 20 of 
sandhurst in surrey england 
us district judge kenneth l ryskamp ordered the indictment 
thrown out on the request of prosecutors who complained that 
richardson refused to return from england to testify 
its not unusual us attorney dexter lehtinen said 
witnesses frequently become recalcitrant later in the process but 
its very disappointing when the witness is a key one and theyre 
overseas 
while the federal decision did not rule out state charges against 
ms terry dade county assistant state attorney joseph rosenbaum 
said his office had no such plans 
if they cant get richardson back how are we going to he 
said 
initial police reports claimed miss terry set the blaze which 
killed an 82yearold man and a 76yearold woman after arguing 
with richardson 
richardson was detained briefly after the fire as a material 
witness but was then freed to go back to england 
lehtinen said prosecutors can ask the british government to make 
richardson available for depositions but added the process was long 
and complicated 
as soon as ryskamp dismissed the indictment monday miss terry 
sprang from her chair and pointed an accusing finger at her 
prosecutor assistant us attorney terry lindsey 
next time make sure you have proof she said angrily 
the judge discharged her 100000 bond and returned her passport 
and other documents 
all she wants to do is get on a plane to london and get back to 
her home in surrey said her attorney richard sharpstein 
he attacked the case as unfair from the outset 
this has been an irresponsible and embarrassing prosecution 
from day one sharpstein said however a possible result is 
that it shows that the american justice system works 
the government contention that richardsons refusal to testify 
prompted the dismissal was just a red herring sharpstein said 
miss terry was charged under an infrequently used federal arson 
statute making it illegal to set fires in establishments doing 
interstate business

state television showed the ceremonial departure 
from kabul of some of the last soviet soldiers monday and praised 
what the soldiers had done but it did not mention the misgivings 
some expressed 
it said they were the last red army soldiers in the afghan 
capital but others remained after the plane left and a colonel 
said they would be gone by wednesday the deadline for soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
the evening television news program vremya began its 
international segment with videotape from kabul and the border town 
of termez in what has become a nightly ritual as the pullout nears 
its end 
media reports generally praise the soldiers for fulfilling 
their internationalist duty in afghanistan and stress the themes 
of patriotism and heroism 
soviet soldiers were shown at the kabul airport monday standing 
in front of transport planes and a crowd of foreign reporters the 
troops the broadcast said had helped distribute food to the 
capital which has suffered shortages as antigovernment guerrillas 
enforce a blockade 
it occurs to me that this will not be forgotten by the 
thousands of women old women and children of kabul the 
vremya correspondent said 
the correspondent then interviewed vyacheslav ryabinin the last 
soldier at the airport to board a soviet plane for home he said he 
had served one year and four months and was looking forward to 
rejoining his relatives in the soviet union 
the soldiers then were shown boarding a transport plane and 
flying home 
after a command the last soviet soldiers of the kabul garrison 
scaled the ramp the official news agency tass said in an upbeat 
report ryabinin waved his hand and the metal door of the plane 
was closed the liner took off heading for the soviet union 
neither the tass nor vremya reports mentioned the misgivings 
some soldiers have expressed after the nineyear soviet 
intervention one 20yearold paratrooper told the associated press 
at the airport before departing i think it could have been done 
peacefully i think it was a big mistake he did not give his name 
wednesday is the deadline in a unmediated accord for the 
soviet union to have all its troops out of afghanistan the kremlin 
sent more than 100000 soldiers into the country in december 1979 
tass said monday that more than 3000 soldiers a day were streaming 
through the soviet border towns of termez and kushka 
vremya showed armored personnel carriers carrying red flags 
crossing into the soviet union at termez women carrying red roses 
and red carnations stood waiting for their loved ones the 
correspondent said world war ii veterans were among those welcoming 
the returning soldiers

a requirement that construction firms working for 
the city give some of their business to minority subcontractors was 
challenged in court monday in what may be the first test of a 
recent supreme court ruling on affirmative action 
fairview construction which lost a contract to build a police 
station due to the requirement has challenged the constitutionality 
of the plan based on the supreme courts ruling last month that 
struck down a similar set aside program in richmond va 
suffolk superior court judge albert tuttle on monday allowed 
lawyers for fairview to amend their previously filed lawsuit to 
include the constitutional question on the minority issue but city 
attorneys said they will try to get the affirmative action issue 
dismissed 
tuttle set another pretrial hearing for march 7 
there are very similar things in bostons program to what the 
supreme court held unconstitutional in the richmond decision said 
fairview attorney edward j quinlan before mondays hearing 
attorneys for the city argued that the fairview contract was 
rejected because of a bidding irregularity and did not hinge on the 
minority requirements but the lawsuits amendment did appear to 
open the door to the constitutional question said al wallis city 
assistant corporation counsel 
it seems to be that that issue is in the case how it gets 
resolved in the case remains to be seen wallis said 
in richmond minority firms were guaranteed 30 percent of city 
contracts in boston the requirement is 15 percent except in areas 
determined to have a high percentage of minorities where the 
requirement is 30 percent 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the majority in the jan 
23 decision said construction setasides can be enacted only with 
specific proof that there has been past race discrimination in the 
construction industry and if there is no other raceneutral 
remedy 
tuttles decision will be confined to massachusetts but the case 
has national implications as cities wait to see how the supreme 
court ruling will be interpreted attorneys said 
thirtysix states and nearly 200 local governments have programs 
that set quotas goals or require good faith efforts to enlist 
minority participation said benna solomon an attorney who 
represents the national governors association the us conference 
of mayors and five other organizations 
the significance of the massachusetts case is that it comes so 
soon after the high courts ruling solomon said 
whenever you have a major ruling like the supreme court 
decision in the richmond case it does not answer all of the 
questions solomon said that is why that process of evaluation 
of the decision by other courts in the context of reviewing other 
plans is so important 
boston officials say they believe their program will hold up 
the legal challenge stemmed from a dispute dating back to last 
fall when fairview came in with the low bid to building the police 
station but lost the contract after sciaba construction co of 
boston protested that sections of the fairview bid did not meet the 
citys minority business rules 
fairview filed suit in december 1988 charging they should not 
have been denied the contract which involves about 25 million 
wallis said 
last week fairview filed a motion asking that their case include 
the claim that the boston plan is unconstitutional 
the amendment is a last ditch effort to try to get this 
contract by fairview said sciaba attorney john spignesi 
city councillor bruce bolling author of the ordinance said he 
believes the plan would meet the supreme court test because it was 
based on the findings of a public hearing into discrimination in the 
construction business

the secondranking official of the laborers 
international union of north america identified by a presidential 
commission as having close ties to organized crime retired monday 
and was replaced by his son 
arthur e coia the unions secretary treasurer announced his 
retirement at the unions annual executive council session in bal 
harbour fla arthur a coia regional manager for the laborers in 
new england and eastern canada was immediately tapped to succeed 
his father 
both men were mentioned in the 1986 report of the presidents 
commission on organized crime which said the union had clear ties 
to organized crime 
the elder coia 75 once was indicted on racketeering charges for 
allegedly accepting payoffs in return for steering union insurance 
business to selected companies but the case was dismissed because 
the charges were filed after the statute of limitations had expired 
the report citing congressional investigations of organized 
crime influence on organized labor also accused coia and his son of 
involvement in schemes to bilk union health and welfare funds 
the younger coia in a telephone interview said both he and his 
father were unfairly characterized in the report and had no 
dealings with the mob 
the mention of me and my father in that presidential commission 
report is really not a detailed and fair representation he said 
the socalled link to organized crime does not exist 
the report also criticized internal union election policies 
including the provision that allowed the younger coia 45 to be 
tapped to succeed his father 
the laborers union holds its convention every five years when 
delegates elect candidates to the executive council on an atlarge 
basis if board vacancies occur between conventions the remaining 
board members choose a replacement a policy the report said 
leaves few offices contested 
when the use of violence and intimidation are added the 
membership has little opportunity to express itself dramatically 
the presidential report said 
the hearings on which the report was based included testimony 
that the elder coia also sought to convince robert powell a 
longtime vice president of the union and one of its few black 
leaders not to run for union president 
powell testified that coia told him the italians had 
organized the union and would always control it 
the report accused the elder coia and laborers president angelo 
fosco of abusive spending of union funds including 200000 
authorized by coia to pay for a private investigator to keep tabs on 
a longstanding federal investigation of the union 
coia also ordered the union to pay 40000 requested by his son 
to cover legal fees stemming from a government investigation of the 
union the report said 
there has been speculation that focso might step down from the 
union presidency this year but the younger coia discounted such 
talk i think the rumors are all false he said 
the coias both are rhode island natives the younger coia a 
labor attorney by trade has a law practice in providence ri

a private group of scholars and analysts said 
monday that president bushs proposal to bail out the savings and 
loan industry does not provide enough money or reforms 
the plan announced last week would provide 90 billion to close 
or sell 350 insolvent sampls and meet pledges made by regulators last 
year in cleaning up 223 institutions 
the shadow financial regulatory committee a group of 12 
financial experts from colleges and consulting and law firms 
praised bush for recognizing that the sampl problem is much more 
costly than previously acknowledged by the government 
but in a statement it said there is a strong possibility 
that additional thrifts which are now marginally solvent will become 
insolvent in the near future increases in interest rates may also 
lead to financial difficulties for many more thrift institutions 
meanwhile in a separate development the federal deposit 
insurance corp on monday took control of midwest federal savings amp 
loan association an insolvent sampl in minneapolis 
midwest was the 11th institution taken over under a program 
announced by bush last week the fdic plans to assume control of 
more than 200 sampls insolvent under regulatory accounting rules 
over the next four to six weeks 
although government regulators will be more strictly supervising 
the institutions the fdic is emphasizing that all insured deposits 
will continue to be fully protected 
arizona state university business professor edward j kane a 
member of the shadow regulatory committee estimated that 800 to 850 
institutions of the nations 3000 thrifts are economically 
insolvent even though regulatory accounting rules show a far 
smaller number 
any increase in interest rates is going to put a lot more 
institutions under water said franklin edwards a business 
professor at columbia university 
the group did not offer its own figure to counter the 
administrations 90 billion estimate but edwards said the red ink 
could total as much as 130 billion 
edwards said bush would be wise politically to deal with the full 
problem now early in his term he also criticized the proposal to 
raise 50 billion over the next three years by selling 
offbudget bonds the interest costs would be less expensive if 
the money were raised by borrowing directly through the treasury he 
said 
bushs plan also reorganizes the regulatory structure by giving 
the treasury department and the commercial bank insurance fund the 
fdic more authority over savings and loans 
but kenneth e scott of the stanford university school of law 
said the presidents plan seem more aimed at moving boxes than 
accomplishing real reforms 
the committee advocated a program of early intervention that 
would impose federal control when an institution weakened and force 
the institution to shut down before it actually became insolvent 
that way depositors would be protected and expenditures by the 
federal insurance funds would be rare

afghan guerrillas briefly resumed a 
council on monday and tried to choose a moslem government but two 
important leaders did not attend and rival factions continued 
wrangling over shares of power 
guerrilla sources said the seven groups in the pakistanbased 
guerrilla alliance were divided on who should lead an interim 
government in afghanistan and on apportioning the top positions 
differences also arose over including insurgent groups based in 
iran they said 
afghanistan is predominantly sunni moslem as are most guerrillas 
based in pakistan most of the insurgents in an eightfaction 
coalition that operates from iran are shiite moslem the sect of 
their host country 
some spokesmen said the council known as a shura would resume 
tuesday and would consider major issues for the first time others 
said there was little or no hope of progress 
the whole situation is such that nothing can come out of the 
council said a senior official who like the others spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
factionalism developed immediately friday at the inaugural 
session of the shura which has been seen as the last chance for 
feuding guerrilla groups to compromise and it was suspended 
insurgent leaders predict the marxist government in kabul will 
collapse soon after the last soviet soldiers withdraw on wednesday 
the councils job is to choose a government that would take over and 
arrange elections 
aides said sibghatullah mojaddidi and syed ahmed gailani who 
lead two of the seven parties did not attend the monday meeting and 
leaders of the five other other parties presided over the council 
which did not consider major issues 
mojaddidi did not attend because the other six parties rejected 
his proposal for bringing the iranianbased guerrillas in sources 
reported 
a spokesman for mojaddidi said the shura is not going to work 
out without the iranianbased mujahedeen using the word for the 
guerrillas that means islamic holy warriors 
gailani aides said he had a scheduling conflict monday but would 
attend the meeting tuesday but guerrilla sources said that he 
stayed away because of an argument about who would lead the interim 
government 
guerrilla groups summoned the council of insurgents moslem 
scholars and officials of past afghan governments mojaddidi who 
now holds the rotating chairmanship of the pakistanbased alliance 
has insisted the others honor his plan to give the shiite groups in 
iran 100 of the more than 500 council seats and seven interim 
government cabinet posts 
most sunni guerrilla leaders say the shiites an estimated 15 
percent of afghanistans population are too few to receive so many 
seats about 80 percent of afghans are sunni 
shiite representatives have said they will accept only the 
mojaddidi plan but have not carried out their threat to leave 
islamabad 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a communist 
coup in april 1968 and soviet soldiers entered the country in 
december 1979 reaching an estimated total of 115000 by may 15 
1988 when the red army began withdrawing under a unmediated 
agreement 
pakistan the united states iran and other countries have helped 
arm and finance the guerrillas

hearings opened monday at the world 
court in a dispute between the united states and italy over the 1968 
seizure of a usowned company a court spokesman said 
it is the first us case to be heard since the reagan 
administration rejected a 1986 world court ruling ordering it to 
stop arming the nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
bostonbased raytheon co an electronics company and defense 
contractor estimates it lost 6 million plus interest in the 
takeover of its subsidiary company elettronica sicula spa said 
abraham sofaer the legal advisor to the us state department 
raytheon wanted to liquidate the palermo sicilybased 
manufacturer of cathode ray and vacuum tubes but the italian 
government nationalized the company to save jobs on the island 
plagued by unemployment 
a fivejudge panel is hearing the case which is expected to 
continue at least until wednesday the court spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity the reagan administration filed the suit two 
years ago for raytheon but only written arguments had been made 
since then only governments can appear before the court 
formally known as the international court of justice the 
judicial branch of the united nations has no enforcement powers and 
depends on voluntary adherence to its rulings 
elettronica sicula also known as elsi was coowned by matchlett 
laboratories inc a us company not involved in the case 
the italian government said expropriation of the company in 1968 
was aimed at protecting the plants 900 jobs after raytheon and 
matchlett disclosed their intention to shut down the concern 
the judicial panel consists of the courts president judge 
josemaria ruda of argentina and judges shigeru oda of japan 
roberto ago of italy stephen m schwebel of the united states and 
sir robert jennings of britain 
the case was filed in february 1987 after the reagan 
administration rejected as invalid a world court ruling in july 1986 
ordering the united states to stop arming rebel forces attempting to 
overthrow nicaraguas leftist government 
in apparent anticipation of that adverse ruling the united 
states had withdrawn in march 1984 its recognition of the unlimited 
jurisdiction of the court but said it would continue to accept the 
courts authority in cases not connected with the central american 
issue 
the elsi case is the third one filed at the world court by the 
united states in a decade 
in 1979 the united states asked the court to order the release 
by iran of 52 american diplomats held hostage in the us embassy in 
tehran the court on an emergency basis ruled weeks later that the 
hostages should be released they were ultimately freed in 1981 
in the same year the us government and canada jointly asked 
the court to draw the boundary between the two nations in the gulf 
of maine off north americas east coast that dispute was decided in 
1984

america today bush said these problems require a compassionate 
strategy and thats the reason i thought of jack immediately and

moslem students marched in several 
cities monday against a book fundamentalists say blasphemes islam 
their rallies occurred the day after police fired on protesters in 
islamabad killing five and wounding 83 
prime minister benazir bhutto said the protest sunday may have 
been the work of politicians using moslem objections to salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verses as an excuse to press their 
opposition to her government and democracy 
in india on monday police fired into a crowd protesting the book 
in srinagar summer capital of northern jammukashmir state killing 
one person and wounding more than 60 news reports said 
united news of india said the mob forced shops and businesses in 
srinagar to close india which is overwhelmingly hindu banned the 
book in october 
in a letter soon after the banning published on front pages of 
major indian newspapers rushdie said the right to freedom of 
expression is at the very foundation of any democratic society 
when selfappointed guardians of muslim sensibilities say 
that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book 
like mine they have got things backwards the question raised by 
the books banning is precisely whether india by behaving in this 
somewhat south african fashion can any more lay claim to the title 
of civilized society 
rushdie was born in india to moslem parents and lives in britain 
in islamabad hundreds of riot police were stationed around the 
us information center scene of sundays confrontation but no 
trouble was reported monday 
nearly 3000 moslem fundamentalists assembled outside the center 
sunday to demand that rushdies novel be banned in the united 
states it has been published in britain the united states and 
other western countries and several islamic countries have banned 
it 
fundamentalists say the book does not recognize islam as the one 
true religion and ridicules the most precious moslem beliefs 
rushdie declares it to be a work of fiction in no way blasphemous 
and not intended to offend anyone 
ms bhutto said she did not see how sundays protest could have 
been against the book because it is banned and unavailable in 
pakistan and none of the protesters could have read it 
was the demonstration against salman rushdies book or a 
lawandorder situation she said at an airport news conference 
after returning monday from a state visit to china 
us diplomats closed the information center and us embassy at 
midday monday after reports that more violece might occur 
in adjacent rawalpindi where most shops were closed to mourn 
those killed the day before about 300 moslem theology students and 
opposition politicians chanted rushdie should hang and other 
slogans against ms bhutto 
witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops 
which that remained open there were no reports of injuries 
demonstrations were held at us consulates in lahore and 
karachi but reports said police were out in force and prevented 
violence 
at the american center in islamabad which houses a library and 
offices of the us information agency a diplomat said the staff 
is traumatized 
three americans and 15 pakistani employees were inside the 
building when a mob chanting american dogs and allah is 
great pelted the building with stones tore down the american 
flag and started several small fires 
police responded with tear gas first then fired rifles and 
shotguns all the dead suffered gunshot wounds hospital sources 
said 
ms bhutto was visiting china official pakistani media quoted 
her as blaming the bloodshed on a combination of a conspiracy 
against her government and improper police action 
the official englishlanguage newspaper pakistan times said in a 
frontpage editorial it is hard to see how the united states 
became the prime object of mob anger in the present case when both 
the author and the first publication of the book belonged 
elsewhere 
it suggested rightwing opponents of ms bhutto used the issue to 
embarrass her government 
a blasphemous book even if the government had nothing to do 
with it other than strongly denouncing it could have been seen by 
some as an opportunity for mounting a popular uproar that could also 
in some way be made to affect the government on the rebound the 
paper said 
american diplomats said they did not know why the united states 
became the target an embassy statement monday said the united 
states government in no way supports or associates itself with any 
activity that is in any sense offensive or insulting to islam or any 
other religion 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington 
the government and the people of the united states have full 
respect for the religious beliefs of the pakistani people based 
on constitutionally protected rights to freedom of worship and to 
freedom of speech which also guarantee the expression or 
publication of a wide range of works not all of which will be 
acceptable in every society 
we have full confidence in and satisfaction with the actions 
taken by pakistani authorities during this incident he said of 
sundays confrontation

tackiness a little longer because with old customers trooping in 
for a farewell drink business at trader vics has doubled

now trump said but since its the greatest location in the 
world anything would be successful there 
the bar also got help from stories in newspapers ranging from the 
wall street journal to the village voice and a new york times 
editorial pining over the passing of such trader vics specials as 
the mai tai or the scorpion with floating gardenia the samoan fog 
cutter or the dr funk of tahiti

plaza basement for 25 years closed a year ago but the bar stayed 
open

january that a classy oriental restaurant and a health club would 
replace trader vics beginning in april or may 
i now have no set timetable on this he says now i havent 
decided what to do with the space yet

iran says it will hang 70 drug traffickers 
tuesday the highest number to be executed in one day in that 
nations fierce antinarcotics crackdown aimed at stopping the flow 
to at least 1 million addicts 
hardline prosecutergeneral musavi khoeiniha said in a recent 
radio interview this is the end of the line if we do not destroy 
them drug smugglers they will destroy our youths 
khoeiniha first gained fame in 1979 as the guiding hand behind 
the militant extremists who stormed the us embassy holding 52 
hostages for 444 days 
iran instituted a new law on jan 21 that includes the death 
penalty for anyone found with 30 grams just over an ounce of 
heroin or five kilograms 11 pounds of opium or hashish addicting 
someone else carries a 20year sentence 
the law coincided with a crackdown that put helicopter gunships 
into the air along the borders with pakistan and afghanistan to 
track smugglers 
on jan 16 a record 56 drug smugglers were executed the 
official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia says 
105 smugglers have been executed since dec 31 
the iranian resistance group mujahedeen khalq accuses the iranian 
government of creating hysteria over the drug problem as a means of 
extending a siege mentality and eliminating its enemies following 
the 8year iraniraq war 
an irna report on tuesdays executions said 10 will be hanged in 
tehran and the rest in cities throughout iran 
executions were suspended during a 10day celebration that ended 
feb 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the revolution that toppled 
the late shah in 1979 
iranian police released statistics monday saying 3300 drug 
traffickers have been arrested in iran since 1987 and 11 metric tons 
of opium 1540 pounds of heroin and 23 metric tons of hashish 
seized 
drug addicts now have six months to kick the habit or face jail 
addiction is not considered a medical problem in iran 
the prosecutorgeneral said if an addicts decision to give up 
his habit is serious he needs nothing else they should not expect 
the government to treat them as patients 
iran has blamed everyone from underground opposition movements to 
the us central intelligence agency for trying to turn iranian 
youth into addicts 
iranians leaving the country said many youths turned to drugs to 
escape the intense pressure they faced to conform to islamic 
principals as iran was reborn as a fundamentalist state 
the draft in the holy war against iraq was another factor 
they said 
iranian press reports concentrate on ways of eliminating drug 
supplies rather than the cause of addiction 
khoeiniha said one way around the death penalty was to turn 
others in 
if they smugglers report themselves repent name old traders 
and cooperate with discovering the rings certainly we will request 
the great leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to grant them parole 
otherwise they will be punished according to the law 
in other developments in iran on monday 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani denied in an interview 
allegations of a power struggle within irans top leadership and 
dismissed reports in world media of mass executions of political 
opponents tehran radio reported 
the radio monitored in nicosia said rafsanjani responded to a 
question from a french tv journalist asking about reports from 
amnesty international that more than 1000 political foes were 
executed since summer 
iran announced it planned to free 260 disabled or ailing iraqi 
prisoners of war next week tehran radio said in another report 
in geneva president cornelio sommaruga of the international 
committee of the red cross expressed concern about the slow 
repatriation of prisoners and said iran and iraq were not fulfilling 
their international obligations un officials estimate the number 
of war prisoners in both countries at 100000

a federal judge on monday overrode 
local authorities and ordered the reopening of a refugee processing 
center that was padlocked last week as a health and fire hazard 
us district judge filemon vela set aside at least temporarily 
an order friday by a state district judge that had barred the us 
immigration and naturalization service from using the center in 
harlingen 
theres between 200 and 300 people outside there right now 
waiting to be processed omer g sewell ins director in 
harlingen 25 miles north of this border city said shortly after 
the court action 
later he said immigration officials regained access to the 
building and planned to begin seeing applicants again tuesday 
morning 
more than 2000 people a week most from central america have 
been applying for political asylum at the ins harlingen office many 
of the applicants have camped near the building while waiting for 
their paperwork to be processed 
city officials who had sued in state district court to be 
allowed to padlock the center said they would comply with velas 
order once theyve seen it 
as far as i am concerned it the center is still closed i 
have not been served with velas order said gavino sotelo 
harlingen city manager the conditions at the center remain the 
same as they were before there is trash there is human waste if 
this goes on we might have to close it all over again 
harlingen mayor bill card said once the center is open the city 
will regularly inspect it and will notify sewell of any violations 
found 
we just want to make sure that the facility is operated 
properly if it had been operated in a responsible way before it 
would have never been closed card said 
sewell said barring the ins from the building in harlingen would 
have created another crisis of homeless central americans in the rio 
grande valley 
the last such crisis led vela to issue an order jan 9 to force 
the ins to allow the applicants to pursue their cases at their 
intended us destination after checking in with the ins in 
harlingen 
huge crowds also gathered at the building when it was used for 
processing those who applied for amnesty under the immigration 
reform and control act of 1986 
the current backlog involves the immigration policy that calls 
for refugee status for those found to be fleeing for political 
reasons but deportation for undocumented aliens entering for 
economic reasons 
in overturning a friday order by state district judge robert 
garza vela said it prohibits the functions and operations of an 
agency of the federal government vela also barred harlingen 
officials from restricting ins access to the 9872squarefoot 
former furniture store and from interfering with ins business there 
in any manner whatsoever 
he said however that his order should not be interpreted to 
mean the ins does not have to comply with state or local laws or 
ordinances related to public health and fire safety

former president reagan participated 
personally and directly in giving favored treatment to countries 
that supported the contras in nicaragua lawyers for oliver north 
said in a court filing aimed at having charges against their client 
dropped 
north attorney brendan sullivan opposing a compromise between 
the independent counsel and the justice department said in court 
papers released monday that the proposed deal on keeping certain 
secrets out of the trial would prevent him from introducing this 
evidence which he said was central to norths defense 
he also criticized attorney general dick thornburgh for declining 
to take the political heat and make a separate 
secretsprotecting move that could lead to charges being thrown out 
sullivan said at the heart of this case are the quid pro quo 
and other thirdcountry arrangements with which the reagan 
administration obtained military support for the resistance during 
the socalled boland amendments and the policy that those 
thirdcountry arrangements would not be disclosed outside a limited 
group of executive branch officials 
the boland amendments passed by congress restricted and at 
times prohibited the spending of federal funds in support of the 
guerrilla war against the leftist government in nicaragua 
former national security adviser john poindexter testified at the 
congressional irancontra hearings in 1987 that reagan favored 
making up for that lack of official us support with money from 
other nations but the assertion that reagan was personally involved 
in arranging to return the favors is new 
theodore olson an attorney for reagan declined comment on 
sullivans filing after its contents were described to him 
sullivans statements were in a written response to us district 
judge gerhard a gesell objecting to a new plan for protecting 
national security secrets at norths trial 
the plan worked out by independent counsel lawrence walsh and 
the justice department would gut the defense and guarantee a 
cuckooclock trial sullivan said it would hide critical 
information about the reagan administrations thirdcountry 
arrangements for military support of the resistance and the official 
nondisclosure of those arrangements 
sullivan said that the way the government proposed to present 
this information to the jury through a general admission with 
no details allowed would leave out that president reagan and top 
executive branch officials participated personally and directly in 
those arrangements 
he said under the government proposal the jury would never hear 
about direct personal participation in the thirdcountry 
arrangements by reagan and these officials of his administration 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane poindexters 
predecessor secretary of state george shultz secretary of defense 
caspar weinberger chairman of the joint chiefs john vessey and the 
late cia director william casey 
most of the details of the proposed court agreement were kept 
secret but their intent was to establish nine specific categories 
of information that cannot be revealed by north in his defense 
sullivan urged that gesell reject the proposed rules out of hand 
the proposed agreement between thornburgh and walsh is a 
compromise to deal with justice department objections that rules 
under which the trial was to be conducted would allow north to 
disclose important national security information 
gesell is to conduct a hearing on the agreement tuesday 
the beginning of the trial was put on hold sunday when chief 
justice william rehnquist of the supreme court granted the justice 
departments request for a stay however the department has said it 
will ask rehnquist to lift the stay if gesell approves the agreement 
on testimony involving classified information 
sullivan said in his court filing if imposed by the court the 
stipulation could cripple the defense of this case we cannot 
adequately defend this case without this information 
he also attacked thornburgh for not using an avenue open to him 
for stopping classified information from coming out filing an 
affidavit under the classified information procedures act such an 
affidavit would force the judge to bar the information and could 
result in dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal charges 
against north 
the attorney general apparently does not want to take the 
political heat associated with filing an affidavit that could result 
in sanctions afffecting the triability of the case even though he 
has a clear duty to protect the national security sullivan said 
it is understandable that if the case is untriable the 
attorney general would rather blame someone other than the 
administration 
last month two major counts against north were dismissed after 
thornburgh refused on national security grounds to allow the use of 
classified material deemed essential in the case 
reacting to sullivans comments david runkel a thornburgh aide 
said the attorney general has been in public life more than 20 
years hes never been unwilling to take political heat if the cause 
is just 
sullivan said in his new filing that the proposed 
walshthornburgh agreement would guarantee a cuckooclock trial 
that would make a mockery of the adversarial process 
gesell has promised he wont hold a cuckooclock trial 
meaning he doesnt want constant interruptions at the trial for 
challenges on whether a document can be disclosed 
with the issue of national security disclosures still unsettled 
monday morning gesell sent the jurors home telling them to check 
by telephone for their next court date 
the nine proposed categories of secret material that cant be 
used include information that would identify undercover cia 
officers the locations of cia stations identities of foreign 
individuals who work for the spy agency and details about cia 
operations with foreign intelligence services 
also included would be material about american intelligence 
collection on terrorism and eforts to locate hostages us covert 
activities other than military support for the contras and names of 
noncentral american countries that supported the contras 
instances of quid pro quo efforts involving north surfaced in the 
irancontra congressional hearings 
for example on march 5 1985 he proposed that guatemala be 
rewarded for its assistance in providing false enduser certificates 
so that more than 98000 pounds of east european munitions could be 
delivered by chartered aircraft from a european arms dealer to a 
central american country for the contras 
in a memo to mcfarlane then the national security adviser north 
suggested that the secretaries of state and defense and vessey of 
the joint chiefs be asked to grant guatemala additional security 
assistance 
the purpose of the memo said north was to find a way by which 
we can compensate guatemala for the extraordinary assistance 
they are providing to the nicaraguan freedom fighters north said 
he was attaching enduser certificates which guatemala 
provided for the purchase of nearly 8m worth of munitions to be 
delivered to the contras 
there was no indication what became of norths request

cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk says peace talks opening feb 19 will fail because 
the provietnamese government in cambodia has imposed unacceptable 
conditions the resistance radio reported monday 
the voice of the khmer monitored in bangkok quoted sihanouk as 
saying government opposition to deploying an international 
peacekeeping force in cambodia would allow the return of the khmer 
rouge regime which killed hundreds of thousands of people in 
197578 
the phnom penh government which vietnam installed after invading 
the country in december 1978 also rejected sihanouks demand that 
it be dismantled and join a provisional government that would 
supervise a general election 
these issues are to be discussed at a second round of peace talks 
planned for indonesias capital jakarta starting sunday 
the talks will bring together communist vietnam the cambodian 
government of premier hun sen and the threeparty resistance 
coalition including sihanouks group the khmer rouge and the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front of former 
cambodian premier son sann other southeast asian nations also will 
take part 
according to the resistance radio sihanouk recently said in 
beijing that the talks would not be successful because the 
resistance forces cannot just submit themselves to the vietnamese 
colonialist regime as required by hun sens conditions 
sihanouk affirmed that more than anything else he wants peace 
for the cambodian people the broadcast said but peace without 
independence is worthless 
sihanouk has said he will not attend the jakarta talks because 
hun sen rejected his peace proposals but his son prince norodom 
ranariddh will represent him 
sihanouk widely expected to take a leading role in any future 
cambodian government is at his home in china the chinese arm the 
resistance against the sovietsupplied vietnamese 
the radio said the prince had no plans to meet president bush 
who visits beijing late this month or with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev who is due there in midmay but sihanouk said he was 
ready to meet them anytime if asked the broadcast said 
a thai army official meanwhile disclosed monday that more than 
7000 cambodian refugees who were evacuated from two khmer rougerun 
camps because of heavy shelling from across the cambodian border 
have returned to their camps at ta luan and borai just inside 
thailand 
much of the shelling that peaked in midnovember was directed at 
an area just inside eastern trat province where the khmer rouge had 
herded about 7000 refugees apparently to prepare to populate 
strategic areas of cambodia 
gunners in cambodia continued to pound khmer rouge positions near 
the thaicambodian border one month after the refugees all moved 
back said paynai sirirat chief coordinator of the displaced 
persons protection unit he said the khmer rouge sustained heavy 
casualties

florida should move ahead with plans 
to develop the nations first commercial spaceports on floridas 
space coast and in the panhandle gov bob martinez said monday 
martinez told a news conference he will recommend legislation 
creating a spaceport authority to oversee the project and will 
include 10 million in his budget proposal for the effort 
when america enters the space commerce industry it should be 
from florida the governor said adding the spaceport could make 
use of many existing facilities at cape canaveral and the kennedy 
space center 
here in florida we are uniquely positioned to serve as 
americas launching pad he said we have the time we have the 
place we have the talent and we have the resources 
us transportation secretary samuel skinner appeared with 
martinez and said the federal government fully supports the florida 
effort as well as similar efforts being pushed by hawaii and 
virginia 
florida is leading in many aspects of the competition 
skinner said the state that provides the money and effort to make 
this work will get the most government support 
a spaceport florida study says that a facility for launching 
small rockets that carry instruments to take various scientific 
soundings should be built at cape san blas near port st joe in the 
panhandles gulf county it also recommends two potential sites near 
the kennedy space center cape canaveral air force station using 
three inactive launch pads once used for atlas and titan missiles 
and the abandoned town of shiloh 
martinez said he is directing the florida department of commerce 
to take steps to develop the facility at cape san blas and to 
determine which of the two sites near the kennedy space center would 
be best for launching large payloads into orbit 
the study estimated the cape san blas site could be developed for 
about 200000 and could be open in nine to 12 weeks the air force 
once launched sounding rockets and many facilities are still 
available 
according to the study development of an orbital launch 
facilities on the east coast would require about three years 
ralph christi project leader for united engineers and 
construction the consultant that did the study for the state said 
a spaceport could be funded like an airport through revenue bonds 
or corporate debt

us district court judge alcee l hastings on 
monday asked the senate to dismiss 16 of the 17 articles of 
impeachment returned against him last august by the house of 
representatives 
the 52yearold florida jurist claimed in a 95page motion that 
15 of the 17 counts against him should be dismissed based on his 
acquittal in a 1983 trial and the length of time since then in 
bringing the impeachment proceedings against him 
in its bill of impeachment the house accused hastings of 
conspiring with a washington attorney to receive a 150000 payoff 
in exchange for a guarantee that two racketeers would not serve time 
in prison 
hastings the first black federal official ever to be impeached 
was acquitted in a 1983 trial on that charge but the articles of 
impeachment also accuse him of making false statements and 
fabricating evidence in that proceeding 
the only article of impeachment which hastings didnt seek to 
have dismissed is one which accuses him of disclosing secret wiretap 
information in an unrelated investigation to steve clark the mayor 
of dade county fla 
in his motion with the senate hastings contended through 
attorneys that an impeachment trial on 15 of the 17 motions 
constitutes double jeopardy in view of his acquittal by a criminal 
court jury and also denies him due process because witnesses have 
died and records have been lost since then 
the motion seeks dismissal of the final 17th article on grounds 
that it is a catchall count aimed at allowing the senate to 
remove hastings from the bench with a finding that he is unfit even 
if a majority finds him innocent on each of the 16 other articles 
the house has until march 3 to file a brief in reply to hastings 
motion monday no date for oral arguments on the motion has been set 
the senate rules committee earlier this month ordered that 
arguments on the anticipated motions be heard by the full senate 
even though only a 12member panel of senators will conduct the 
evidence hearings which are expected to take about six weeks

sen william armstrong a colorado republican who 
has served in congress since 1973 said monday that he will not seek 
reelection in 1990 
armstrong 51 told reporters at a news conference in his denver 
office that he was tempted to run but two terms is enough 
i have never believed the great opportunity or the greatness 
of this country is centered in the us senate he said 
i thought that 12 years was about the right length of time 
armstrong who served from 197378 as a congressman and at 
various times has been eyed as a candidate for president and vice 
president by fellow conservatives is colorados senior republican 
officeholder in congress 
i love to campaign so heading out on the campaign trail to 
meet people shake hands and make speeches would be great fun based 
on polling and the advice of friends who have offered to help i 
believe i would have a good chance to be reelected he said 
but armstrong added i have considered myself and have wanted 
others to think of me as a citizen legislator serving in congress 
for a time but always with a firm intention of returning to private 
life 
he said he would remain active in politics and did not close the 
door on a run for the governorship 
its conceivable he said i wont rule it out who knows 
armstrong said he will devote his time to unspecified business 
concerns he owns television stations in twin falls and pocatello 
idaho and is building one in jackson wyo 
for years armstrong owned and worked at kosi a major radio 
station in the denver market a bornagain evangelical christian he 
did several commercials for a bible study organization before his 
reelection in 1984 
he maintains an interest in evangelical religion he said but he 
does not plan to enter what he called the vocational ministry 
i dont see myself in that role 
armstrong said he also would consider establishing his own 
foundation or think tank 
his announcement means there will be a wideopen race for his 
seat in 1990 republicans mentioned as possible contenders include 
state sen terry considine state rep chris paulson and us reps 
hank brown and joel hefley armstrong would not say monday whether 
he planned to endorse anyone as a possible successor 
on the democratic side former gov richard lamm who had been 
considered a likely candidate announced recently he would not seek 
the seat but state democratic chairman buie seawell and us rep 
ben nighthorse campbell are believed to have a strong interest in 
running 
before being elected to the senate in 1978 armstrong represented 
colorados 5th congressional district which includes colorado 
springs before that he spent a decade in the colorado legislature 
serving as senate majority leader from 196972

the palestine liberation organization 
answered us criticism by saying monday it was not resorting to 
terrorism but was resisting israeli attacks 
the commentary carried by the palestinian news agency wafa 
responded to remarks by us secretary of states james baker to 
reporters over the weekend in iceland 
the remarks appeared to be a warning that attacks by palestinian 
guerrillas against israeli civilians or soldiers either inside or 
outside israel could threaten the newly established usplo 
dialogue 
israeli soldiers killed five plo guerrillas during a clash in 
south lebanon on feb 4 israel said the guerrillas were trying to 
infiltrate and that the plo had not abandoned attacks on israeli 
targets it urged the united states to break off its dialogue with 
the plo which opened in tunis on dec 16 after chairman yasser 
arafat renounced terrorism 
the wafa commentary accused baker of trying to impose a double 
standard prohibiting to the palestinian people what it allowed 
the afghan resistance 
the plo is not resorting to terrorism but resistance the 
commentary said it is israel that is practicing terrorism every 
day while the palestinian people are organizing legitimate 
resistance against the occupation thus exercising a right in 
conformance with international law and convention 
the commentator told baker not to try to get the plo to abandon 
the resistance in order to be able to continue the usplo 
dialogue 
we engaged in this dialogue with the aim of finding a just 
solution to the palestinian problem and to realize the inalienable 
rights of this people the commentary said 
the resistance and the uprising will stop only when it has 
achieved its legitimate rights including that of creating a 
palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital

independence from britain 
jamaica belongs to the commonweath the global association of 
former british coloniies and territories and manley swore 
allegiance to the queen and her heirs and successors

relations with the new administration which guides the affairs of 
our most powerful neighbor the united states of america he said 
to applause 
shes our biggest trading partner our largest source of 
tourists with the greatest potential for foreign investment

saying he wanted to pay tribute to him for his evenhandedness 
before the election and for his immensely energetic assistance once 
it became clear that the people of jamaica had made their choice 
on domestic matters manley repeated his pledge to work with 
seaga in clamping down on illegal guns and drugs and in fostering

the united states and foreign investors and plunging jamaica into 
economic chaos

debt but is seeking a new approach to reducing the burden of 
interest payments on developing countries 
although manleys term is five years he can call the next 
election earlier seaga 58 becomes leader of the official 
parliamentary opposition

vandals are believed to have punctured six rubber 
seals that shut off water running from a st lucie nuclear plant 
reactor to the steam generator authorities said monday 
the plant near fort pierce on floridas southeastern coast was 
inactivated for refueling at the time and the damage was caught 
before the seals were installed said stacey shaw spokeswoman for 
florida power amp light co 
damage to the seals which are intended to stop water flow to the 
generator during inspections were discovered feb 7 during a 
preinstallation check 
there is basically little safety significance attached but the 
fact that they were apparently vandalized is significant said ken 
clark spokesman for the us nuclear regulatory commissions 
regional office in atlanta 
he said although the water going to the generator might be 
radioactive any leak caused by the punctures would have been 
spotted immediately even if they had somehow been installed in 
addition ms shaw said the rubber seal must be inflated before 
installation and the punctures made that impossible 
the vandalism apparently occurred during the three days before 
the inspection during that time the seals were on a loading ramp 
one day and in the containment building for the next two days ms 
shaw said 
weve interviewed a couple of dozen people that were in the 
area over the threeday period and so far they have not uncovered 
anything she said 
she said the utility has written a letter to plant personnel 
asking for help in the investigation but so far has identified no 
suspects 
it was possible the seals had been damaged by accident she said 
but emphasized the company was proceeding on the assumption it was 
vandalism 
if a suspect is identified he or she would be subject to federal 
criminal charges ms shaw said 
the fbi was informed of the incident but was not actively 
involved in the case she said 
clark said the nrc sent an inspector to the plant after the 
discovery but was now monitoring the utilitys internal 
investigation 
ms shaw said she did not expect the incident to hold up the 
restart of the 850megawatt unit 2 which was shut down for 
refueling at the end of january and should be back on line after 12 
weeks 
she also said the incident was not considered serious enough to 
cause a change in safety procedures at the plant

gov gaston caperton on monday proposed 
a bold and agressive program of cuts and said the state still 
has to borrow as much as 765 million to pay its bills improve 
schools and develop economically 
caperton making his first state of the state address said he 
wants to abolish the jobs of agriculture commissioner secretary of 
state and treasurer the governor also asked for 5 percent pay 
raises for public school teachers and state workers 
the firstterm democrat presented lawmakers with a proposed 
1781 billion budget for 198990 with budget cuts averaging 45 
percent for all state agencies except education health and human 
services the current state budget is 1464 billion 
the program i have presented is bold and aggressive 
caperton said it will most assuredly bring out the critics but 
it will also bring out the best in west virginia and in us 
caperton defeated threeterm gov arch moore last year in a 
campaign that assailed moores financial management a special 
legislative session earlier this month approved 392 million in tax 
increases to help close a growing deficit and boost the states 
economy which has been hurt by a slump in its dominant industries 
especially coal caperton asked for no additional revenue other than 
the borrowing authority 
the current projected state deficit is 260 million by june 30 
the end of this fiscal year and 376 million by next year 
the borrowing would include 
up to 500 million for school construction including raising 
120 million in bonds reissued through the 1972 better schools 
amendment 
135 million to be obtained from private lenders possibly a 
consortium of west virginia banks 
130 million to be repaid through tolls as part of a plan to 
replace the west virginia turnpike with the west virginia parkway 
economic development and tourism authority 
caperton proposed two constitutional amendments one to eliminate 
the jobs of agriculture commissioner secretary of state and 
treasurer and one to allow cities and counties to decide on their 
own form of government including the possibility of forming joint 
municipalcounty governments or even merging two or more counties 
gubernatorial aide phil reale said the proposed amendments which 
must be approved by twothirds of both the house of delegates and 
senate probably would be placed on the ballot for voter 
ratification in a special election this fall 
the 5 percent pay raise for teachers and state employees would 
depend on whether the state can save 40 million to 45 million in 
the first six months of the 198990 fiscal year

palms together to greet ms bhutto in moslem fashion smiling 
broadly as he did so 
zaki said the talks covered a general survey of pakistanichinese 
relationship with some reminiscences by deng about ms bhuttos

your father was a friend of the late chairman mao tsetung your 
parents established a special relationship with the late premier 
chou enlai and his wife deng yingchao i personally have had 
contacts with your family for a long time 
the elder bhutto president from 197173 and prime minister from 
1973 until he was ousted in a 1976 coup and later executed made 
friendship with china a key element of his foreign policy 
by choosing china for her first official foreign trip since being 
elected last november benazir bhutto sought to emphasize this 
longstanding tie the two sides signed agreements to extend a trade 
protocol and encourage mutual investment but expressions of 
friendship dominated over substance 
the torch of pakistanchina friendship has been passed on to a 
new generation who will surely pass it on to the next 
generation xinhua quoted ms bhutto as telling deng 
it was a very successful visit zaki said as ms bhutto 
prepared to leave shanghai for home the meetings with all the

warrants for 150 employees of stock brokerage firms on charges of 
illegal trading related to the october 1987 stock market crash the

a summit of the five central 
american presidents bogged down on opening day monday in a dispute 
involving nicaragua and at least two other nations over how to 
appraise progress toward democracy 
an adviser to the sandinistas said earlier monday that nicaragua 
was making strong democratic commitments because it believes the 
rebel movement is dead 
with the contras military defeat and the passing of the reagan 
administration the external military threat to the nicaraguan 
government that impeded democratization is gone said paul 
reichler a us lawyer employed by nicaragua as an adviser and 
representative 
later however foreign ministers miguel descoto of nicaragua 
and ricardo acevedo of el salvador clashed publicly over whether 
commissions to monitor progress toward democracy should include 
central americans or foreign participants 
we have the moral authority to select a commission of central 
americans we should carry out our own verification acevedo told 
a news conference 
it seems to us somewhat antidemocratic that it should be we 
ourselves who appraise our own actions descoto told a separate 
news conference 
the two spoke as presidents daniel ortega of nicaragua jose 
napoleon duarte of el salvador jose azcona hoyo of honduras 
vinicio cerezo of guatemala and oscar arias of costa rica worked in 
closed session late into the first day of a twoday summit 
costa rica reportedly was siding with el salvador in the dispute 
theyre going at each other quite harshly said a member of 
the nicaraguan delegation commenting on condition of anonymity 
the meeting intends to breathe new life into the stalled 
esquipulas ii plan designed to promote peace and demcoracy in the 
region 
since the presidents signed the accord in august 1987 
nicaraguas regional partners especially el salvador costa rica 
and honduras have criticized nicaragua for what they alleged is an 
authoritarian sandinista regime 
the political problem in the region is one of democracy of 
totalitarianism versus liberty acevedo said 
officials with the nicaraguan delegation said ortega proposed a 
bilateral agreement with honduras that calls for the estimated 
11000strong contra force there to be disbanded the contras fled 
to honduras after us military aid expired last year 
under the proposal the contras could take advantage of an 
amnesty offered by the sandinistas or go to third countries under 
the supervision of international organizations the sandinistas 
would release the estimated 3500 contras and former nicaraguan 
national guardsmen now in sandinista prisons 
the officials said ortega presented the plan to azcona at the 
feb 2 inauguration of venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
the five presidents first appeared encouraged by the mere fact of 
being under the same roof after six months of delay the summit was 
rescheduled and postponed five times 
i am sure that we with optimism will analyze efforts weve 
made according to esquipulas ii and search for favorable solutions 
that will promote peace and progress in central america duarte 
said as the meeting began 
all the chief executives except ortega in a green army uniform 
wore casual attire fitting the climate of this seaside resort 40 
miles southeast of san salvador 
they had intended to mark the anniversary of the signing with a 
summit in august but could not agree on an agenda 
after some initial success the arias plan stalled last year 
officials said the summits principal subject would be enforcing 
compliance with the injunction against using one signatorys 
territory as a base for attacking another but the presidents 
disagree on verification mechanisms 
arias is said to favor a commission of central americans but 
nicaraguan officials said their government wants the united nations 
the organization of american states and human rights groups included 
on such a panel 
all the presidents expressed support for the framework 
constructed last week by their foreign ministers in talks with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the ministers want an impartial mechanism created for onsite 
verification of compliance the tentative idea is to form an 
observer group from canada spain and west germany 
arias the 1987 nobel peace laureate said the summit would 
reestablish our credibility with the central american people and 
the entire world 
a decade of civil conflict and economic depression have 
transformed the region of 25 million people into a zone of 
turbulence an estimated 160000 people have been killed in wars in 
a decade and most central americans live in extreme poverty 
civil wars still plague el salvador and guatemala but the scale 
has been reduced greatly in guatemala 
the contras signed a preliminary ceasefire with the sandinistas 
last march but ortegas government stands accused of failing to make 
good its pledge to strengthen democratic institutions and practices

an excessively permissive attitude by 
institutions tends to allow careless and sometimes even fraudulent 
medical research a national institute of medicine committee 
reported today 
the committee empaneled to study misconduct in biomedical 
research said better research standards and systematic ways of 
investigating laboratory irresponsibility are needed although the 
committee believes that serious misconduct in science is rare it 
concludes that institutions fail to detect and correct early deviant 
behavior primarily because of an excessively permissive research 
environment that tolerates careless practices the committee 
report said 
funding pressures and an overemphasis on publication of research 
in scientific journals also encourage what the committee called 
substandard practices

a questionnaire assessing beliefs about alcohol 
can identify adolescents who are likely to drink excessively within 
a year of taking the survey a study says 
the 90item test also may indicate what steps would best help 
each individual avoid problem drinking researchers said junior 
high school students who believed alcohol could help them think or 
improve their physical coordination tended to be at particular risk 
said mark goldman a psychology professor at the university of south 
florida in tampa 
his study in this months journal of consulting and clinical 
psychology is the first demonstration that a measure of 
psychological dependency can predict later alcohol use and 
tendencies toward problem drinking said g alan marlatt director

jerry anthony greene 
vincent volpi a columbus private investigator hired by farmers 
new world life turned up a von snowden connection after he took two 
bags of garbage from the curb in front of a columbus condominium 
hawkins shared with desando 
its a procedure that we use a lot more than id like to think 
about but its very successful people throw out a lot of evidence 
with the trash said volpi who found december 1987 telephone 
bills showing a call to miami 
he learned that the florida condo was being rented by a man who 
called himself wolfgang e von snowden desando remembered seeing a 
note written by hawkins that said distance myself from wolfgang 
von snowden named hawkins as an emergency contact and a reference 
on his rental application for the condo gave as a previous address 
hansons columbus apartment the california drivers license number 
he gave was hansons expired license and his listed employment was 
as an inactive partner in just sweats the columbus dispatch 
reported citing leasing records

farmers new world life police obtained a copy of hansons 
california drivers license and compared it with a photo of the dead 
man the license hadnt been on the body but credit cards and a 
birth certificate had the resemblance was strong but the mans 
thumbprint revealed him to be greene 
the los angeles county coroners office changed the official 
cause of death to undetermined and police began to investigate a 
homicide 
boggs was tricked and bamboozled by hanson and mr hawkins 
defense attorney sammy weiss said outside the neurologists 
arraignment theres a tremendous resemblance between mr hanson 
and mr greene weiss said 
boggs 55 told the journal that although he had seen hanson for 
annual checkups for seven years he was not in the business of 
ascertaining identifications i thought i was treating melvin

hundreds of thousands of third world immigrants 
struggling to make a living in italy have found a spokeswoman and 
role model in a 33yearold former maid from cape verde the island 
republic off northwest africa 
she is maria de lourdes jesus italys first black television 
anchorwoman host of a weekly program that highlights the problems 
of foreigners and tries to break down racist stereotypes 
without a doubt its a great responsibility said ms jesus 
whoever speaks out on these problems is seen as someone who can 
have some influence or can do something about them i just try to do 
my best within the limits of possibility 
her program on the staterun rai network is called non solo 
nero which literally means not just black and is derived from 
the name of another popular show non solo moda not just fashion 
the program has examined among other things the problems of 
immigrant families separated by their jobs foreigners in jail 
racially mixed marriages sexual harassment and housing 
discrimination 
to make its point the show recently had a woman call to ask 
about an apartment advertised as being for rent the telephone 
conversation was put on the air after inquiring about the rental 
the woman in the studio said by the way im somalian i hope 
that doesnt matter 
yes it does the woman on the other end said and hung up 
ms jesus said shes received compliments from strangers in the 
street and numerous letters praising the program marking what she 
hopes is the beginning in a change of attitudes toward immigrants 
this program shows that were beginning to see the fruits of 
the efforts of all the foreign communities in italy trying to make 
known their situation and the need to improve it she said in an 
interview sitting in her small office under an antiracism poster 
this is the first time a program of this type has been on the 
air its a very first step now people are beginning to talk about 
our problems and trying to confront them 
still ms jesus said she is not satisified with the time 
allotted to the program just 15 minutes on saturday afternoons and 
complains that rai devotes more time each week to pets 
more time to the problems of dogs than to foreigners she 
said its crazy 
since the program first went on the air in november ms jesus 
has also been a target of the same racism she is trying to eliminate 
leaving her home one night she was taunted and cursed by a young 
man who recognized her from television on another occasion she was 
riding in a car with several friends including three italian 
television technicians of dark complexion when they were stopped by 
police 
they made us get out of the car with machine guns drawn and 
the first thing they said was youre all foreigners right she 
said 
i consider these incidents as things that happen but ive had 
other positive experiences i have so many italian friends its a 
very nice atmosphere 
ms jesus called lou by her friends was born in cape verde a 
former portuguese colony she moved with her family to lisbon 
portugals capital at age 12 and three years later joined her 
sister in italy to work as a maid 
she worked her way through high school and won a scholarship to a 
university getting a degree in education she gradually became 
involved in defending the cause of immigrants and formed an 
association to represent the 8000 cape verdians living in italy 
when rai decided last fall to broadcast a program on the problems 
of immigrants she was a natural choice for host 
ms jesus speaks fluent italian with a slight portuguese accent 
the newsmagazine lespresso described her stylish look as that of a 
woman executive always elegant 
third world immigration is fairly new to italy there are an 
estimated 1 million immigrants mostly from africa and asia many 
without legal documents italians who long considered racism 
someone elses problem are now confronting the issue themselves 
generally italians are apparently open friendly and 
hospitable people ms jesus said but when it comes to personal 
and work relations they often manifest a racist attitude 
especially toward africans the stereotypes are amazing 
she said she didnt notice any racism in her early years in italy 
because her community was closed and isolated from the outside 
society but things changed when the immigrant community grew and 
decided to organize 
then you begin to realize what your concrete possibilities are 
the many difficulties and the resistance ms jesus said

when archaeologists dig up lisa harris sculptures 
centuries from now theyll find clues to yet another era that has 
gone down the drain 
in the past month the 35yearold artist has created some 20 
terra cotta water tanks ranging from 2 inches to 2 feet to harris 
its a way of commemorating the reallife rooftop towers which to 
her resemble monuments to the industrial age 
im a child of the city and think there is a lot of beauty to 
be found in the citys ugliness harris said 
but the artists models have been disappearing with demolition 
teams casting them them off the citys skyline faster than she can 
cast them in clay 
the rooftop tanks have been here since the late 1800s when the 
city was rebuilding from the great chicago fire of 1871 they were 
put on the highrises of the time buildings more than several 
stories high 
the filled tanks improved water pressure and served as resevoirs 
from which to draw during emergencies they were a craft in 
themselves at first made like wooden barrels with tongueandgroove 
seams so perfect that no extra seal was needed to hold the water 
harris found the models for her art in a changing industrial area 
on chicagos near north side she drove there on another errand late 
last year and decided to get out of her car and tour on foot 
there was a whole vista of them she said 
she photographed some sketched others she studied the tanks 
trying to decide what techniques and materials she could use to 
reproduce the ladders capture the colors and portray the peeling 
paint and weathered wood 
then in her studio she began constructing them throwing clay 
on a potters wheel and adding handbuilt parts for tops stilts and 
buildings she fired them in a kiln and chose 10 for the show 
naming some for streets where shed seen the real tanks 
but by the time the exhibit opened jan 20 three of the real 
tanks had been knocked down 
better water pumps have negated their use said lawrence 
acker president of the plumbing contractors association 
insurance companies still discount premiums for buildings with 
tanks because the reservoirs provide extra protection acker said 
but a wave of housing rehabilitation work in recent years is 
hastening the demise of the vessels old factories with tanks are 
being converted into town houses with more modern plumbing old 
schools are being gutted for lofts and old housing is being made to 
look newer 
progress harris said 
meanwhile her exhibit will continue this month at the lill 
street gallery a studio gallery and ceramics school housed in a 
building that was a horse barn when lill street was at the edge of 
the city and at the end of the trolley line 
harris a teacher at the school says so far people seem to be 
intrigued by the show 
it looks stark she said it looks like a chicago 
cityscape 
the way it used to be

kindly gently and it seems interminably the 
phrase that became a george bush cliche is being used for him 
against him and all around him 
the president spared it another repetition in what amounted to 
his state of the union address thursday night he spoke of decency 
compassion generosity government that helps people but he skipped 
kinder and gentler 
bush was one of the few orators who did 
a kinder gentler america house speaker jim wright said in 
the democratic response to the president thats the old time 
democratic religion we embrace it enthusiastically 
there is the matter of agreeing on what it means wright said 
words and gestures wont do it will cost money by democratic 
reckoning considerably more money than bush proposes to spend 
wright finds the phrase a handy one obviously this is not a 
kinder gentler budget the speaker said when president reagan 
sent congress his farewell spending proposal 
bush adjusted spending priorities notably by reducing the 
proposed pentagon budget but democrats still used the k word and 
the g word to criticize his proposal 
hes offering a minimum down payment on a kinder gentler 
america said sen james sasser of tennessee chairman of the 
budget committee but i cant see how hes proposing to meet the 
necessary installment payments they might have to repossess his 
kinder gentler america for failure to meet the payments 
but richard darman bushs budget director said the new 
administrations budget would too make the nation kinder and 
gentler although perhaps not as rapidly as everyone would like 
kinder and gentler than the reagan administration 
well im not saying that darman replied 
he said the bush budget seeks more money for education 
environmental cleanups aid to the homeless medicaid for the needy 
and like programs if they are marks of a kinder gentler 
society then it meets that test 
democratic national chairman ronald h brown quickly joined the 
oratorical game praising the achievements of democratic governors 
brown said for these leaders kinder and gentler doesnt come from 
the pen of some ghost writer it comes from the heart 
brown installed last friday said the next time the 
administration says we need leadership thats kinder and gentler 
im going to ask kinder and gentler than whom the republican 
party 
in 1992 chimed in willie brown speaker of the california house 
we will capture the white house and give this nation a kinder and 
gentler leader 
that crop of ks and gs represents only the tip of the cliche it 
covers usage by a handful of political spokesmen since last 
thursday a check of associated press files turned up 140 stories 
using the phrase since the nov 8 election 
it has become fodder for tv comics promising kinder and gentler 
oneliners on groundhog day forecasts were for another six weeks 
of a kinder and gentler winter 
bush used his own line repeatedly during the presidential 
campaign startling his strategists one night when he said hed be 
kinder and gentler and would stop negative campaigning against gov 
michael dukakis by morning he had decided otherwise 
in conversation trying to remember a mans name bush described 
him as a kinder and gentler looking fellow 
in the inaugural address he declared a mission to make kinder 
the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world 
all of this flowed from a passage in his acceptance speech last 
aug 18 at the republican national convention crafted by campaign 
speechwriter peggy noonan who should have signed up for royalties 
on use of the line 
the fact is prosperity has a purpose bush said it is to 
allow us to pursue the better angels to give us time to think and 
grow prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and 
making it concrete by certain acts of goodness it means helping a 
child from an unhappy home learn how to read it means teaching 
troubled children through your presence that theres such a thing as 
reliable love some would say its soft and insufficiently tough to 
care about these things but where is it written that we must act as 
if we do not care as if we are not moved 
well i am moved he said i want a kinder gentler nation 
thats the line that stuck outlasting the cryptic thousand 
points of light turned on in the same speech 
but after six months it might be kinder and gentler to dream up 
a new catch phrase

the teeming streets and apartment blocks jammed 
one against the other suggest the last thing hong kong needs is more 
people 
but employers insist they have tens of thousands of jobs 
available with no one to fill them they want the government to 
relax strict immigration laws so that foreign laborers can help fuel 
the robust economy 
there just arent enough people to go around said ian wade 
chairman of the 78member retail management association of the 
british colonys 57 million population 
hong kongs economy expanded 135 percent in 1987 and an 
estimated 8 percent last year sending the unemployment rate 
tumbling to a negligible 13 percent for the three months ending in 
november jimmy mcgregor who represents business interests in the 
local legislature estimates that at least 100000 more workers are 
needed 
business leaders say the shortage endangers future growth and 
forces up wages fueling inflation which neared 8 percent last 
year the government however says bringing in foreigners who do 
not have special skills would deprive local workers of their fair 
share of hong kongs economic success and could create numerous 
social problems 
the shortage is felt in virtually every industry from gritty 
construction sites to the plush corridors of the fivestar tourist 
hotels 
employers are taking a wide variety of measures to cope 
the hong kong and shanghai bank short nearly 300 tellers as the 
hectic lunar new year holiday approached in early february 
attempted to relieve the strain on its employees by giving away two 
porsche cars in a contest open only to customers who used automatic 
banking machines spokeswoman fionajane kennedy said 
the new marriott hotel angered competitors by instituting a 
48hour fiveday work week instead of the industry standard of six 
days 
kent maury the marriott marketing director said the fiveday 
week was designed to give his hotel a competitive edge in 
attracting staff its done exactly what we wanted he said 
adding that 3800 people applied for 1100 openings 
meanwhile hundreds of hong kong manufacturers have established 
plants across the border in chinas guangdong province where wages 
are relatively cheap land is available and labor is abundant 
the critical construction industry has been particularly hard hit 
by the scarcity of labor with the vast majority of projects failing 
to make completion deadlines according to gerrit j de nys chief 
executive of shui on contractors ltd 
the situation is exacerbated by laborers who are not working as 
hard aware of how valuable a commodity they have become de nys 
said 
if you yell and shout at them they wont even say goodbye 
theyll just walk off the job 
shui on now tends to focus more on public sector projects because 
the government seems less likely to demand penalty payments for the 
inevitable delays de nys said 
compounding the personnel headache faced by de nys and others is 
the loss of thousands of key professionals who are emigrating before 
china takes over the colony in 1997 
while there appears to be no quick fix to stem the emigration 
flow businessmen believe the labor shortage could be relieved if 
the government relaxed immigration restrictions that generally allow 
the entry of only specially skilled workers and maids 
nine major business associations have joined forces and are 
preparing a report on their labor needs in hopes of persuading the 
government to ease up on immigration 
mcgregor who is involved in the project said the government 
could tap china for labor to do shortterm contractual work 
englishspeaking workers needed in service industries could be 
brought in from the philippines malaysia and possibly thailand he 
said 
so far the government has refused to budge 
secretary for education and manpower ron bridge said in a 
november speech that importing workers who do not have special 
skills would be extremely damaging to our labor relations and 
reduce the incentive for employers to upgrade technology management 
and productivity 
further he said the supply of housing medical and social 
services and our transport facilities would be stretched even 
tighter and hong kong could face international accusations of 
exploiting cheap labor

after years of delay the greek cypriot 
community is founding a university in an effort to halt an exodus of 
talented students and help reunify the wardivided mediterranean 
island 
but when the cyprus university opens next year it will be 
competing for international recognition with a 3yearold turkish 
cypriot university also seeking to become a prestigious higher 
education center 
although greek and turkish cypriot educators say they want 
students from both communities the islands longrunning political 
problems make that unlikely 
our university will teach in both greek and turkish and 
therell be a department of turkish studies the greek cypriot 
education minister andreas philippou said in an interview 
we want it to contribute to reuniting cyprus we hope turkish 
cypriots will attend but it depends on the political situation 
professor okan tarhan head of the east mediterranean university 
at famagusta in the turkish cypriot republic in northern cyprus 
said we have students from 17 countries but no greek cypriots 
cyprus was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when the turkish army 
invaded after an athensinspired coup intended to unite the island 
with greece 
the breakaway turkish cypriot statelet was proclaimed in 1983 in 
the northern onethird of the island occupied by the turkish forces 
reunification talks between greek and turkish cypriot leaders on 
a united nationproposed bizonal federation resumed last fall after 
a threeyear break but have bogged down amid traditional differences 
some greek cypriot officials fear that the de facto partition of 
the island will harden as time goes by with new generations growing 
up on both sides with no contact with each other 
cyprus is a tiny place but theres a great hunger for higher 
education said margit schatzman an american educational 
consultant preparing a study on the cyprus universities 
both the greek and turkish cypriot institutions are structuring 
their programs along mainstream western university lines its clear 
theyre both looking for international status she said in a 
telephone interview from milwaukee wis 
education minister philippou a former mathematics professor at 
patras university in greece said the university plan was drawn up 
in three months last summer by a group of politicians and cypriot 
academics including professors at us and british universities 
the decision to have a university was taken almost 20 years ago 
but never implemented he said now it must happen if were to 
stop losing good people who go abroad to study 
the greek cypriot university is due to open in 1990 in temporary 
premises with 400 students and 30 faculty and eventually grow to 
4000 students and 330 faculty members it is budgeted to cost 42 
million 
the planners say that having a local university will save a large 
chunk of an estimated 24 million spent every year on sending 10000 
cypriots to greek british and american universities 
many start careers overseas because with more than 50000 
graduates among the 480000 greek cypriots jobs at home are hard to 
find at home 
the government offers free business courses to recent graduates 
to make them employable in cyprus booming service economy but 
with our own university we can channel people where theyre needed 
by offering developmentrelated courses philippou said 
young greek cypriots say they welcome a university because it 
will make nicosia livelier as well as saving family funds 
the university will bring lots of activities therell be more 
music and cultural activities im looking forward to it said 
eleanor palaiologou who wants to study management 
the greek cypriot parliament will decide whether some courses 
should be taught in english but with a business school planned 
that may be essential to attract firstrate staff and students 
several educators said 
the east mediterranean university where courses are taught in 
english has a problem because it is in the turkish cypriot 
republic which is recognized only by turkey 
were an international university but we dont qualify for aid 
from any international organization said tarhan the universitys 
head 
i think thats unfair since were an educational institution 
and not involved in politics 
foreigners from arab countries iran and pakistan make up around 
10 percent of its 2300 students the rest are turks and turkish 
cypriots but they also may spend a year taking intensive english 
classes before starting as freshmen 
east mediterranean a former junior technical college upgraded to 
a university in 1986 focuses on engineering and economics tarhan 
said a business school will open and more humanities courses will be 
offered in the next two years

rafik helou a retired schoolteacher 
hasnt received his state pension for nearly five months thats 
because hes a christian and lives in east beirut and the social 
security office is in west beirut the moslem sector 
he is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in longsuffering 
lebanon in which government institutions including the army have 
been split in two by rival christian and moslem cabinets vying for 
power 
the 64yearold helou who has a heart ailment has to rely on 
his sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife who suffers 
from diabetes 
the power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition of 
lebanon 
many of the countrys estimated 4 million people hardened by 14 
years of civil war have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in their 
stride despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival shiite 
moslem factions in southern lebanon 
but for thousands of people like helou it has made the daily 
struggle for survival even more difficult 
state employees are still getting paid 
lebanon still has gold reserves worth an estimated 25 billion 
stored at fort knox in kentucky but with foreign currency earnings 
dwindling the central bank has turned to internal borrowing from 
commercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collect 
in taxes customs duties and other levies 
but pensioners like helou have suffered the social security 
departments board of directors has not been able to meet to endorse 
pension payments because christian officials are afraid to cross the 
dividing green line into west beirut 
helou said in an interview we need 30000 lebanese pounds 
60 a month for medicines i relied on my annual pension of 6 
million pounds 12000 but with two governments i cant get it 
fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications for 
the time being but how long can this go on 
the crisis began sept 22 when president amin gemayels 6year 
term ended without a successor being named 
minutes before he stepped down gemayel named the commander of 
the christian army gen michel aoun as the head of an interim 
military cabinet until a new president was elected 
acting prime minister salim hoss a syrianbacked sunni moslem 
and other moslem leaders refused to acknowledge aoun 
the government lost its authority long ago and real political 
power has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides and 
their foreign allies such as syria and israel 
yet government departments handling social and economic matters 
continued to function after a fashion just enough to maintain a 
semblance of normality now even that slender thread is in jeopardy 
ghassan bitar a christian municipal employee said he and his 
colleagues have not been paid since september 
bitar 32 who has two children and a wife five months pregnant 
said he had to turn his family mercedesbenz into a taxi to make 
ends meet 
i cant leave my family hungry he said 
rana shehabs dreams of going to london to study medicine were 
shattered when the education ministry refused to issue her high 
school graduation certificate 
going to londons impossible now said ms shehab an 
18yearold moslem the only alternative was to enroll in the 
american university of beirut 
the university which once was the most prestigious education 
center in the middle east is now a shadow of that since its foreign 
professors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of its 
american and british lecturers and administrators 
but ms shehab noted its better than nothing 
an education ministry official sami hamadi said the authorities 
decided not to issue certificates for students in either west or 
east beirut until the government is reunited 
even getting in and out of lebanon has become a problem for some 
people 
airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport was 
renewed in east beirut said anis saeed a christian when he 
tried to leave through the airport in west beirut 
i got my ticket refunded and now im going to take the ferry to 
cyprus from the christian port of jounieh said saeed 24 
the lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduous 
conditions during the civil war israels invasion in 1982 and 
endless factional feuding but the cloning of what had passed for 
their government has exasperated many 
were fed up said amal hamdi 28 a secretary in west 
beirut we want this chaos to end however if formal partitioning 
would lead to security stability and better living conditions let 
it be 
lets either have formal partition or elect a new president 
but lets finish and know where we stand said pierre ayyoub 36 
who works at an east beirut trading company 
every government ministry now has two competing heads the 
40000man army the police and municipal departments are similarly 
split in two 
the only institution that has remained intact is the central 
bank which is financing both governments it is in west beirut 
mohammed hout economic adviser to bank governor edmond naim 
said the banks main objectivick pay 
a recent study by the swedish employers association said the 
average swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illness 
in 1987 compared with 18 days in west germany 16 in france and 11 
in britain 
a recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of those 
questioned suspected their colleagues of cheating official 
statistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percent 
over the past three years 
swedens sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honor 
system under a 1987 reform bluecollar workers joined other wage 
earners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they are 
off sick starting from the first day they stay home 
the government handles the payments but most of the money comes 
from taxes paid by employers 
in the swedish system an employee who is ill calls his social 
insurance office and later signs a form stating the nature of the 
illness a doctors certificate is required only if the worker is 
home for a week or more 
one form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick when 
hes not however authorities say its even more common for workers 
to file for sick pay and go to work anyway getting sick pay in 
addition to regular pay its difficult to check 
if i knock on the door and nobody opens what is my proof 
yvonne stroberg a local official said recently on swedish 
television she suggested more telephone checks with employers 
rather than home visits by inspectors 
the national accounting board described another scheme in a 
report late last year it said some people collect payments for sick 
leave parental leave and student grants for the same period 
karl gustaf scherer director of the national social insurance 
board said on television his organization would increase its 
supervision 
in bandhagen south of stockholm the local office started a 
threeweek campaign to check all claims on certain days 
sick leave pensions and various other social benefits are 
expected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year 
illness benefits last year amounted to 5 billion 120 million 
more than sweden paid for defense 
one option under study is to let employers take over sick 
payments for those absent from work up to two weeks saving the 
government money and paperwork the employer would then claim a 
refund from the authorities 
unions have opposed the plan margareta svensson at the 
bluecollar general confederation of unions said it would permit 
employers to put pressure on employees 
there would be people who would not dare to be off ill if 
their employer controlled sick payments she said 
since benefits are administered locally there is no official 
overall picture of cheating nationwide 
a random check by insurance offices in the west coast town of 
halmstad indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false and the 
figure was 15 percent in neighboring varberg svenska dagbladet said 
another study reported by the dagens nyheter newspaper said a 
threeday check of claimants in the northern province of jamtland 
showed all 180 cases were valid 
the national accounting boards report said illness claims valid 
or not varied strongly by location the 10 districts with the 
highest absenteeism were lowincome suburbs of swedens three 
largest cities 
the head of the social insurance office in rinkeby a stockholm 
suburb inhabited mostly by immigrants topped the list with an 
absentee rate almost twice as high as the national average 
people out here have heavy monotonous dangerous and boring 
jobs said gun britt johansson head of rinkebys social insurance 
office

one day last year state government was within 
an hour of not making the payroll one day in the future economists 
warn this city could be knocking on bankruptcys door bond ratings 
are just one notch above junk bonds 
times are hard in louisiana 
charity hospital clinics overflow because the state cant afford 
enough doctors to go around windows in city hall remain cracked and 
unrepaired children go to school in packed classrooms without 
modern teaching aids such as computers one town has to turn off 
street lights to save money 
we have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of 
excellence said commissioner of administration dennis stine 
weve become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state 
times are hard in louisiana 
an estimated 30000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed some 
have been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago many 
of the states skilled workers have fled to healthier regions in 
all close to 100000 jobs have been lost 
even worse antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff public 
officials efforts to attract new business and raise the money 
needed to improve education health care and the economy 
frenchcajun optimism the letthegoodtimesroll attitude that 
drank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts 
seems to be fading people have been packing up and moving out no 
hope of another oil boom they say no hope 
we seem to find people with short fuses lately said hubert 
chiasson the manager of new orleans largest unemployment office 
do i really see any signs of improvement no i really dont 
times are hard in louisiana 
the state was forced to borrow 13 billion to cover its debt 
and another 12 billion to bail out its insolvent unemployment 
insurance fund about 10 percent of the state tax collections now go 
to pay interest on debt 
sales taxes are already highest in the nation 9 percent in new 
orleans businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the state 
out 
its a spiral you cant get new business so you cant employ 
all the people who need jobs said tim ryan director of business 
and economic research at the university of new orleans that 
doesnt mean we will spiral down any further but there will be no 
new growth 
in fact there are indicators that the economy has bottomed out 
after two years of depression there are no signs of improvement 
however 
the price of oil began its crash in 1984 and two years later a 
leading state business organization proclaimed that louisianas 
recession had become a depression unemployment reached 145 percent 
in january 1987 the latest figure is about 10 percent twice the 
national average 
despite its abundance of resources waterway location and 
reputation for good food and good times the state proved to be 
illprepared for the day when the oil gravy train stopped 
economists said 
the taxing structure dates back to the days of populist huey 
long who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the 
expense of business most homes are exempt from property taxes many 
state services are offered at unusually low rates such as 3 a year 
for an automobile license plate 
gov buddy roemer tried to rearrange the fiscal structure but 
his first attempt failed in the legislature last fall he says hell 
try again and win because the future of the state depends on it 
we had a state where big money beat big ideas and thats a 
loser were trying to reverse it roemer said 
the state has a huge group estimated at 30000 of outofwork 
oil workers with no employable skills most dropped out of school 
for the lure of big money on oil rigs many dont even have the 
money now to pack up and move out 
how are we going to get our present work force into jobs 
asks eugene schreiber director of new orleans world trade center 
and chairman of a governors task force on labor we have to train 
and develop our workers 
new orleans has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that the 
mayor said the only services left to cut were courts and school 
crossing guards the city has lost 100 million in revenue a full 
onethird of its entire budget since oil prices crashed 
the current budget is in a crisis mayor sidney barthelemy 
said in an interview before opting for an 8perhousehold public 
safety fee and slashing court funding from 25 million to 15 
million with layoffs in the district attorneys office 
but louisiana law says the city council cant raise property 
taxes without a general election and besides only 15 percent of 
the homeowners in new orleans pay property taxes by law 
the city council cant raise the sales tax by law it cant 
create an income tax by law 
all barthelemy says he can do is raise fees such as slapping a 
surcharge on water bills for public safety 
the city of shreveport in the northern part of the state 
balanced its budget by laying off 115 sanitation department workers 
abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewer 
rates 25 percent 
houma an oil town near the gulf of mexico found times were so 
hard that 3000 street lights had to be turned off to save money 
business has never been as bad said dan catlett owner of 
the houma pawn shop i cant see any improvement and im usually 
the first to tell 
new orleans school supt everett williams has had to cope with 
all the problems of a large urban school system while his budget 
has been slashed the state cut back on its funding so did the 
federal government and the city hes laid off 300 employees his 
teacherpupil ratio has climbed to 29to1 in elementary schools 
his counselortopupil ratio is 450to1 
voters approved a bond package to help the schools but its not 
enough this year the schools are operating with 30 million in 
bridge funding from the state williams is worried hell lose 
that money next year 
that could mean more layoffs a shorter school year and a budget 
so poor i really couldnt operate the school district 
williams like mayor barthelemy gov roemer economists and 
business leaders says the key to the future will be reshaping the 
tax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs from 
local governments despite the element of futility they see good 
times ahead 
i am optimistic and i guess thats how we survive williams 
said 
the governor added we are going to turn this state around

for one week this jazz n roll city put 
aside its problems polished away its tarnish set aside its 
bickering dug deep into its threadbare pockets and put on a party 
for the republican national convention 
it was a celebration amidst a depression a 150 million economic 
surge in the middle of a financial crisis 
it was also a symbolic move for the big easy which now more 
than ever sees its future in tourism rather than oil 
we saw what happened during the republican convention new 
orleans was by far one of the premier cities in america said 
mayor sidney barthelemy that gave me a little glimmer of what the 
future of new orleans could be 
but the present is one of crisis the city budget is in such 
shambles barthelemy said he had to cut city funding for the courts 
by 40 percent this year unemployment remains at nearly 9 percent a 
real estate group labeled new orleans a place to avoid because of 
falling home values 
and finances at city hall are so bleak that some worry that new 
orleans may be headed for a crisis similar to new york citys 
several years ago knocking on bankruptcys door 
the more likely situation is a default by the city said 
economist tim ryan of the university of new orleans but i dont 
think thats going to happen theres a lot of work going on to 
avoid that 
part of that effort is a move to overhaul the tax structure for 
all of louisiana including new orleans and part of it is 
barthelemys push for tourism development 
new orleans draws 5 million visitors a year and that number is 
climbing according to the tourist bureau tourismgenerated jobs 
have grown 38 percent over the last four years from 37000 to 
51000 
the city is doubling the size of its convention center building 
a new aquarium and looking at developing a europeanstyle botanical 
garden family attractions are needed to offset the adultsonly 
image of the french quarter the mayor said 
and if it all works there will be more than enough business to 
offset the collapse of the highflying oil industry 
if you ever doubt that go to orlando and see what the tourism 
has done for that city basically disney world has attracted 
tourists and money from tourism has developed orlando that was 
basically the only industry they had barthelemy said 
the mayor says the citys financial survival will be on the line 
in the state legislature in 1989 when plans to rewrite the states 
tax structure are debated 
when times were good it was a good system because you basically 
had oil pay the freight barthelemy said now thats changed 
its got to be solved he said if its not solved then 
the city may slip beyond recognition its got to be solved there 
is no choice

such as baileys are teaching unemployed oil workers the ways of 
the sea city employees got back 9 percent of a 15 percent wage cut 
sales tax collections are 680000 over projections 
weve had to make do with different things said mayor cedric 
lafleur who has used a 3 million rainy day fund and profits 
from the cityowned utility to spark new businesses 
for bailey the city built a new road so he could build his plant 
on a waterway 
at the conrad industries shipyard employment has increased 100 
percent over the last year said general manager ronald chiasson 
the firm which used to build nothing but oil field boats has 
survived by switching to construction barges floating dry docks for 
south america and even an excursion boat for the bahamas 
we just werent willing to give up chiasson said you have 
to go with the flow 
at the wheel house lounge on what was once a roughandtumble 
waterfront area patrons talk of surviving not partying 
theres been almost a 100 percent change in character in two 
years said john e roe the owner 
if youre going to live down here youre going to have to know 
how to be a survivor this town survives because these people know 
how to survive said patron peggy sue miller 
at the morgan city bank the marquee recently invoked a popular 
song to express the communitys sentiment dont worry be 
happy the sign said 
but despite the hopeful signs morgan city is still wrestling 
with the same problems as much of louisiana 
unemployment still runs between 10 and 11 percent but hell 
lafleur said it used to be 27 percent the city has lost 1500 
people but recently gained about 500 lafleur said 
that population loss is felt in the citys two major catholic 
churches which have lost onesixth of their families the rev john 
gallen of sacred heart church said 
most of our young people have gone to atlanta jacksonville 
fla and places like that where there is employment gallen said 
the church has started a thrift store and runs seminars on 
business and financial affairs and depression 
people seem to be cautiously optimistic gallen said 
remember there are still a lot of people in business just hanging 
on 
survivors like bailey who now ships louisiana crabs to maryland 
say they dont miss the wild days at all 
ive got mixed emotions about what im doing i feel bitter 
about how much money i lost and how i had to start over again he 
said 
and if the price of oil should skyrocket again bailey will 
resist temptation and stick with fish 
if this business goes and i think it will i just dont feel 
confident enough in the oil industry to invest any money in it he 
said

when the oil and the good times were flowing 
louisianas populist system of government seemed to make sense give 
the people a free ride and let the businesses pay now oil has 
crashed louisiana has suffered through four years of economic 
depression and economists say recovery isnt possible without a new 
system a reformist governor is trying to do just that but breaking 
with the populist past doesnt come easy this second of two parts 
of bad times on the bayou explores this louisiana revolution

the 34story louisiana state capitol 
casts a long shadow over the white marble statue of huey long but 
these days it seems the statue is casting the longer shadow 
an unconquered friend of the poor the inscription on longs 
adjacent tomb says who dreamed of the day when the wealth of the 
land would be spread among the people 
the populist ideas of the kingfish who governed from 
19281932 still influence the fiscal structure of the state 
spread the wealth protect the poor 
homeowners receive a 75000 property tax exemption making the 
average home tax free automobile license plates cost only 3 a 
year city councils cant raise taxes without a vote of the people 
businesses bear much of the burden through taxes and fees 
but the way of doing business that huey long helped build is 
crippling the state now economists say without the oil windfall 
state and local budgets cant be balanced schools and hospitals are 
suffering unemployment has soared and new businesses are scared 
away by the tax structure 
its ironic what is supposed to be good for the people now 
acts to their detriment said university of new orleans economist 
tim ryan 
added business leader eugene schreiber director of new orleans 
world trade center weve got to change we cannot do business in 
the old ways painful as it is its forced us to wake up 
but waking up isnt easy in the land of the big easy as new 
orleans is called 
after a string of legislative victories and a fierce round of 
budget cutting and borrowing gov buddy roemers initial attempt at 
overhauling the tax structure failed in the state house 
the harvardeducated conservative democrat has in his own words 
poked every bear in the forest while inciting a revolution in 
louisiana 
he won education reform campaign finance reform tort reform 
workers compensation reform even unemployment insurance reform 
but when it came to fiscal reform when it came to dismantling the 
last vestiges of the populist past roemer lost 
cant a familys home be the one thing thats not taxed roemers 
opponents asked 
i believe in paying our own way that is a break from louisiana 
tradition roemer said it doesnt come easy 
along the way roemer is also compiling a spectrum of political 
enemies ranging from populists to labor unions to teachers public 
opinion polls are divided on the maverick reformer 
the question remains what happens if he cant complete the 
revolution 
it would be more of the same wed be a slave to saudi arabia 
a wasteland a welfare state roemer said adding that people 
with the means to move away would do so 
politicians he said are beginning to realize that 
fiscal reform has become the vortex of louisianas struggle to 
climb out of a depression that began when the price of oil fell by 
more than half in 198485 tens of thousands lost jobs and both 
businesses and workers left the state 
and taxes on oil which used to account for 40 percent of the 
louisiana state budget plummeted the state long known for its 
big spending ways hadnt put anything aside for dry years it 
hadnt spent much on developing a strong economic base outside of 
oil in fact it hadnt even had a balanced budget in the 1980s 
until roemer took office 10 months ago even though it has a 
balanced budget law 
its debt reached 2 billion 
we could not make the payroll the week after i took office 
roemer said 
now state promoters planners and business leaders all buzz with 
talk about louisianas recovery if there is fiscal reform 
when the price of oil was 40 a barrel hardly anybody 
worried said schreiber the businessman who chaired a governors 
task force on labor 
having all these advantages made everyone in the state very 
lazy louisiana has not been competitive in business schreiber 
said its only really now that the state is pulling its act 
together 
the day after reform failed last october two companies 
considering louisiana announced plans to build in texas other 
businesses considering a relocation or expansion in the bayou state 
are holding off until they see if reform passes said louisianas 
chief of economic development connie lewis 
wall street bond brokers set out informal guidelines for what 
would be necessary to raise the states bond rating currently just 
one notch above junk bonds low bond ratings means the state must 
pay higher interest on its debt roemer has accomplished all but one 
item fiscal reform said his chief of staff steve cochran 
they watch us very closely he said 
the battle will probably be waged this spring when roemer comes 
back to the legislature with a plan last time his package passed 
the state senate but came up 10 votes short of the necessary 
twothirds margin in the house 
the opposition focused on roemers plan to cut by twothirds the 
75000 homestead exemption the nations highest it was led by a 
county tax assessor lawrence chehardy who saw reform as an attempt 
to raise taxes and cripple the average homeowner 
people in louisiana read horror stories in other states where 
property taxes did go wild said chehardy government taxes 
everything cant there be one thing in life a person can have 
without being taxed 
chehardy says lawmakers should cut the budget and if there are 
any tax increases taxpayers should get a chance to vote 
but roemer and his top aides insist the budget has been cut so 
much more than 500 million that further reductions could 
cripple the state already they worry about the declining quality 
of care at statefinanced charity hospitals and the ability of 
cities like new orleans to get by without the traditional state 
support 
and the next fiscal year budget has a projected deficit of 734 
million the total budget is 42 billion but only 22 billion is 
discretionary spending money that isnt tied to court orders or 
debt payments 
cutting that much 734 million would shut more and more 
hospitals cut transportation money and higher education said 
commissioner of administration dennis stine that is in my mind 
shutting down government 
still the early talk of next junes budget is a revolutionary 
concept by itself in louisiana a state that at times balanced its 
budget for only threequarters of the year and hoped oil prices 
would go up

since taking office in may gov buddy roemer has balanced a 
state budget for the first time in the 1980s hes steered a package 
of reforms through the legislature including political campaign 
reform and education reform yet he lost his most important battle 
overhauling the states populist taxing structure 
here in excerpts from an interview with associated press 
regional reporter scott mccartney roemer discusses his goals and 
concerns for louisiana from his baton rouge la office

question what are you trying to do to this state it seems like 
theres a revolution going on 
answer it really is we inherited the highest unemployment 
rate in america and a budget that was in shambles for a variety of 
reasons for example the price of oil in last years budget was 21 
a barrel oil never saw 21 it was a phony figure which exasperated 
the deficit weve got it oil which is currently around 17 a 
barrel at 1380 thats how tough we are 
as a result i think the business community in the state and 
outside of the state knows that somethings happening in louisiana 
our unemployment rate is beginning to go down it was above 12 
percent when i took office its now about 95 
q is it the attitudes in the state that youre bumping up 
against 
a we had a state and i love louisiana but we had a state where 
big money beat big ideas and thats a loser were trying to 
reverse it its not done weve got a ways to go we need to 
rewrite our tax code to give businesses incentives to grow jobs i 
tried i failed by a close margin well try it again and win it 
when we do that all of the ingredients will be in place 
watch us i want to warn texas and the other states of the 
southwest watch us 
q is it fair to say what youre really doing is throwing out the 
past throwing out the populist government throwing out the legacy 
of huey long 
a right in part i want to be fair to huey because he had many 
great points huey built the roads in this state to tie farms to 
market he gave children free textbooks so when we say were 
breaking with the past i really dont think of huey long i do 
think of the populist strain where theres something for nothing and 
everybody else pays the bill we are trying to break from that 
i believe in paying our own way that is a break from louisiana 
tradition it doesnt come easy 
q what would happen if tax reform doesnt pass 
a it would be more of the same wed be a slave to saudi arabia 
wed be a slave to how many times opec can get together and jack the 
price around wed be a wasteland a welfare state those who are 
without hope those who are without means wont move they cant 
theyre stuck those with an education with financial mobility are 
going to vote with their feet theyre going to leave and for the 
first time the politicians are beginning to realize that 
every bear in the forest ive poked now is the time to do it 
there are some who think that if i do my job right i could never 
get elected to another public office 
q do you believe it 
a might be true 
q do you care 
a i dont i would be totally satisfied four years from now 
to prop my feet up on the desk and say well done 
q do you think things can turn around that quickly 
a yes in terms of public perception and attitude thats the 
real fight the fight is not the unemployment rate that goes up and 
down with national trends and a lot of things out of our control 
youll see an improvement over four years and fairly dramatic but 
what needs to turn around is attitude 
i found many people in this state who had given up who felt 
louisiana could not change who felt that we were a slave to our 
past who felt that the populist politicians owned louisiana 
theyre beginning to realize now that we are winners not me we 
this states a winner

when the brothers appeared in hollywood movies in the 40s 
choreographer nick castle thought up mad tricks for the pair to 
do harold said nick castle jr wrote and directed tap 
most of the tappers had to take other jobs during the lean years 
said henry le tang 73 who choreographed tap and most of 
black and blue honi coles weathered those years working at the 
apollo theater harold nicholas spent the 50s working in europe le 
tang who always loved to teach opened a tap school when he was 20 
tap was my love le tang said when its popularity waned he 
choreographed nightclub acts and for seven years tvs the gary 
moore show 
fifteenyearold savion glover a tap prodigy as were the 
nicholas brothers donald oconnor and mickey rooney absorbs every 
style of tap le tang said 
the older dancers call him the little sponge hs said as 
he keeps getting more spectacular his own style will start to come 
out it is beginning to happen and will continue to happen 
all the older tappers seem to have nicknames i havent heard 
my real name in i dont know when sims said jimmy slyde whos 
in both tap and black and blue specialized in sliding 
bunny briggs 66 with his saucer eyes and bambilike lashes dances 
in both tap and black and blue he got his nickname from his 
grandmother because when shed come home from work bunny would 
quickly scoot to get her slippers 
i danced as soon as i was born he said when i saw bill 
robinson dance i knew i wanted to be a dancer he sanctioned it 
briggs tapped with big bands as a visual addition and an added 
rhythm instrument 
the earliest forms of tap dancing can be found centuries ago in 
parts of africa and ireland it was further distilled in the united 
states by african slaves and the immigrants who brought their clog 
dancing with them to the new world 
tap started its current escalation on broadway in 1971 when 
no no nanette was revived eubie came to broadway and 
eubie blake whose music it comprised wanted gregory and maurice 
hines in it recalling them from the act they had with their father 
called hines hines and dad the brothers went on to do duke 
ellingtons sophisticated ladies 
alfonso riberio originated the title role in the tap dance 
kid and the names of tappers such as hinton battle and gregg burge 
got known around broadway for that show and sophisticated 
ladies lee roy reams brought astairestyle tapping to 42nd 
street honi coles won a tony as best supporting actor in a 
musical in my one and only patti lupone taps today in the 
revival of anything goes 
upcoming are broadway musicals in which tommy tune works with the 
manhattan rhythm kings and one in which gregory hines plays 
choreographs and dances as pianistcomposer jelly roll morton 
allowing tap to signify music 
le tang is confident that tap will resume its proper position in 
the arts 
in the meantime the international tap association is underway in 
boulder colo giving the dance form an even greater credibility a 
project of the colorado dance festival the association has started 
receiving inquiries from producers looking for tappers

editors note mitch snyder walked away from middleclass 
america in 1969 leaving behind a job as a madison avenue headhunter 
and a wife and two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps he 
wound up in prison for a while but for the past 15 years he has 
been chipping away at the countrys indifference to the plight of 
the homeless indeed he has become this countrys most influential 
champion of the destitute 
</TEXT>

mitch snyder remembers cruising up the bowery 
in new york as a boy car windows tightly closed per his fathers 
instructions to keep out the bums 
robert snyder abandoned the family when his son was 9 hurt and 
angry mitch vowed never to do to his kids what his father had done 
to him a year or so later his teacher asked him in front of his 
flatbush classmates why his toes poked out the ends of his shoes 
at that moment mitch snyder divined his future i vowed to be 
another imelda marcos i decided then and there i would push real 
hard not to have holes in my shoes ever again 
americas most influential champion of the homeless has a past 
rife with cosmic irony 
sixteen years after his father walked out snyder quit a 
lucrative job as a madison avenue headhunter and left his own wife 
and two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps twenty years 
later he has just the one pair of boots like the jeans he wears 
and the food he eats when hes not on one of his wellpublicized 
hunger strikes the tan boots are donations 
so too are the cars he occasionally drives through neighborhoods 
most people avoid the men and women he finds there sleeping on 
heating grates and harvesting meals out of trash cans often greet 
him by name 
mitch snyder never did learn to roll up his windows 
for the past 15 years he has dedicated himself to liberating 
people who are destitute to that end no one has garnered more 
newsprint forced more hands or coaxed more cash but anyone 
tempted to pin any medals on him should take heed snyder is a 
reluctant hero 
i was called by some force outside myself says snyder who 
has since been forgiven by his family im convinced that if i had 
a choice i wouldnt be doing this 
its hard to argue all told he has spent two of his 45 years 
fasting and another year sleeping on sidewalks 
now he is embued with new optimism after 15 years of chipping 
away at the national indifference to the homeless snyder and others 
at the forefront of the struggle may finally be gaining ground 
recent polls indicate a greater desire to help others a new 
president has arrived a new decade is coming 
i honestly believe george bush is a nicer person says 
snyder i believe ronald reagan was nice personally but his 
politics were mean spirited he was an almost impossible adversary 
not only was he made of teflon but he was made of magic and 
charisma bush doesnt have that magic and he has less power to 
oppose changes 
snyders convinced things are changing listen to the music of 
tracy chapman of u2 they are harbingers of a shift in mood 
theres a 30year cycle the 30s the 60s the 90s weve just 
come through the me decade i think people have gotten sick of 
living only for themselves 
these days snyder makes his home in the 1400bed shelter on 
second street once a university of the district of columbia 
building that the reagan administration agreed to renovate only 
after snyder embarked on a 51day hunger strike that melted away 60 
pounds in 1984 
the shelter also is home to other members of the community for 
creative nonviolence a former antiwar group turned advocates for 
the homeless there is no payroll everyone volunteers 
commitment runs high but this is hardly utopia next to sharing 
living space with ones compatriots snyder says starvation is easy 
but like most ccnv acts erecting reaganville a tent city 
across from the white house or releasing a hundred cockroaches in 
the state dining room its communal lifestyle is fraught with 
symbolism 
individualism is pathological snyder says our 
separateness is whats killing us ignorance and fear are products 
of distance thats what enables us to spend a trillion dollars a 
year on arms while people sleep in the street 
the issue is how to reduce that distance once humanity is seen 
and felt the ability to do damage is reduced 
the nations apathy toward the homeless stems largely from fear 
snyder thinks theyre a reflection of us were all vulnerable 
we have to keep the messenger at bay 
that isnt to say americans are uncharitable he says but given 
a choice most people are more apt to help victims of earthquakes in 
other countries than victims of federal housing policies in their 
own 
natural disasters snyder says do not call into question our 
values and our lifestyle homelessness does the obvious answer 
especially in cities teeming with street people is to render the 
homeless invisible

two urges are at odds the urge to create a democracy the 
urge that made people live in communities and rebuild barns and 
economics the urge toward competition and individualism and greed 
one implies charity and generosity the other says to hell with the 
community create your own niche 
the negative side has become dominant but the other side nags 
at us were such a sophisticated fastpaced society just getting 
through the day is task enough we have become a frightened 
neurotic people we drug ourselves to make reality a little softer 
our families are falling apart our schools are breaking down 
we have createdrld 
snyder walked away from middleclass america in 1969 after 
waking up one night literally in a cold sweat a high school 
dropo an unnatural wout who sold washing machines before talking his way 
into a 
highpaying job as an executive recruiter snyder got married and 
had two children before he realized he wasnt cut out to be a family 
man 
he set out to find himself and wound up in federal prison on an 
autotheft charge while serving time at danbury conn he got to 
know daniel and patrick berrigan in prison for destroying draft 
records snyder joined the two priests antiwar group made up of 
prisoneviolent protest and read a 
book a day for 2 years after his release in 1972 snyder joined an 
antiwar group in new york then moved to washington a year later to 
join ccnv 
in time he says homelessness became the domestic counterpart 
to what was happening in southeast asia in 1975 the war had ended 
in the house i was living in we were dealing with evictions of 
families we opened up our living room to people 
over the years the seam between snyders life and his work has 
disappeared the deeper you go in the more you understand the 
symbols he says identifying and exploiting those symbols 
tearing down fences both literally and figuratively is the key to 
ccnvs agenda of civil disobedience 
our acts are very old testament he says were dealing 
with symbols and images fasting reminds people that real lives are 
at stake symbols like fences are very emotionally charged property 
that exists only to hurt others has no right to exist 
snyders adversaries have found the hunger strikes particularly 
antagonizing such as his 1978 fast in an attempt to force a wealthy 
catholic church in washington to contribute to the ccnv shelter 
fund it was like having a gun pointed at my head recalls the 
rev james english 
english refused and eventually close to death snyder abandoned 
the fast i dont do these things to get people upset but i have 
no qualms about upsetting people snyder says when people begin 
to feel they begin to think 
within the homeless movement where nothing remotely approaching 
consensus has emerged snyder is not without critics detractors 
have portrayed him as selfserving and publicityhungry some call 
him hollywood mitch 
the 5 million it took to renovate the washington shelter upset 
some advocates including chris sprowal a former hospital workers 
union organizer how many houses could you build for that kind of 
money how many people could you put to work with that kind of 
money 
snyder acknowledges that overnight shelter is a temporary answer 
the longterm is adequate housing the real solution is a society 
thats not built on neverending consumption but no more shelters 
is a barbaric thought 
the hollywood reference sprung from a madefortv movie that 
glossed over snyders abandonment of his family and zeroed in on his 
good deeds that martin sheen who played mitch called him a 
saint didnt help 
snyder steadfastly refuses to watch the film and squirms when 
asked about it a softspoken man who professes to be uncomfortable 
in the spotlight he also has a talent for making the most of it 
the movie samaritan the mitch snyder story added 150000 to 
the movements war chest 
besides snyder discovered hollywood long ago it was only a 
matter of time before hollywood discovered him 
the three biggest influences on my life were all movies mr 
smith goes to washington its a wonderful life and a christmas 
carol 
they taught me the lessons of my life that good will always 
overcome evil and that the most insignificant person can make a 
difference provided what hes doing is right

editors note an atlanta research center has made significant 
contributions to the treatment of disease over the years but those 
breakthroughs have come though experimentation with monkeys and 
apes and that has incensed animal rights activists who frequently 
stage protest demonstrations at the center the director of the 
center has received death threats and other staff members say they 
fear for their personal safety

tucked into a wooded corner of emory universitys 
suburban campus the yerkes regional primate research center has 
long exuded an air of mystery 
security fences and private property signs greet those who 
find their way down a winding twolane road behind emory dorms and 
offices through the woods past a secluded lake 
here for years whitecoated scientists have labored quietly to 
find through study and experimentation with monkeys and apes 
answers to health problems that plague humans 
but now theres an usagainstthem feeling at yerkes the 
researchers pride in their accomplishments is tempered by 
frustration anger and even fear a growing band of crusaders would 
like nothing more than to shut the center down 
i wasnt hired to do this you know grumbles dr frederick 
a king jr having to explain to yet another reporter the steps 
yerkes takes to conduct its research as humanely as possible 
king an outspoken advocate of animal research and the director 
of yerkes for a decade has been the target of death threats his 
center an arm of emory university and one of seven regional primate 
research centers sponsored by the national institutes of health has 
been the site of numerous protests by animal rights activists 
last december 12 people were arrested on the emory campus in a 
demonstration against the use of animals in scientific research the 
second such protest in a month three of those arrested lowered 
themselves on ropes down the front of a sixstory building and 
unfurled a huge banner reading save the yerkes chimps the other 
nine tried to block the universitys main gate members of the 
californiabased group in defense of animals said the protest marked 
the beginning of a twoyear campaign against centers like yerkes 
elsewhere in the nation buildings have been burned and animal 
rights activists have been arrested with bombs yerkes staffers say 
they sometimes wonder about their personal safety 
king says he has good reason to believe that virtually every 
institution like his has been infiltrated by animalrights activists 
but his chief worry king says is that the animal rights 
movement could diminish the effectiveness of the center a place 
where new techniques for treating parkinsons disease were found 
where ape communication studies led to new ways of teaching retarded 
children 
what i am afraid of he says is that these people may get 
bills passed in congress regulations passed through federal 
agencies that could be terribly terribly injurious to research 
terribly restrictive and costly beyond belief 
thats my fear that they will whittle us down not that they 
will knock us out of the box by their acts of violence and 
terrorism breaking entering bomb threats destroying property 
stealing animals falsifying photographs of this and that they cost 
us a hell of a lot of money 
the center named for its founder dr robert m yerkes a 
primate research pioneer has three locations the main station 
with labs and offices a southeast atlanta language lab and the 
field station a spartan 117 acres in suburban gwinnett county where 
1500 primates from 1000 rhesus monkeys to a small family of 
pygmy chimpanzees live in two dozen separately housed groups 
add to that 13 gorillas and a dozen orangutans at zoo atlanta 
under an unusual and popular arrangement 
the zoo atlanta project in which primates roam in openair 
approximations of their original habitats has spurred an ambitious 
renovation plan that has brought the oncebeleaguered zoo newfound 
respect and thousands of new visitors 
its also good public relations for yerkes as it presents the 
centers name to happy zoo visitors gazing at cuddly looking 
creatures 
its also an ongoing research effort yerkes scientists continue 
to study the behavior and reproduction of the gorillas and 
orangutans at the zoo in particular yerkes staffers and atlantans 
in general hope that zoo atlanta mainstay willie b a gorilla who 
spent nearly three decades in a cage will settle down with a yerkes 
female in his new outdoor playground and have little willies 
but most of the yerkes animals are at the field station a large 
site once out in the country but now rapidly being surrounded by 
subdivisions 
it is there amid heated concrete shelters and fencedin pens 
that some 30 research scientists and animal care technicians work 
with sooty mangabeys squirrel monkeys chimps and that staple of 
research labs rhesus monkeys 
on a recent winters day field station coordinator and research 
professor tom gordon strolled up to a gymnasiumsize pen housing 
hundreds of rhesus monkeys and started calling them by name 
you get to know them after a while he says 
yerkes scientists continually observe the monkeys looking for 
new behavioral characteristics even in the largest colonies one 
monkey is king and a social hierarchy flows downward from him his 
mate and her offspring with other families acting subservient 
while some of the rhesus colony are taken from time to time for 
lab experiments at the main station others live on at the field 
station for generations in an ongoing behavioral study 
another primate group getting a great deal of attention at the 
field station these days is a collection of sooty mangabeys who as 
it turns out are almost universally infected with siv simian 
immunodeficiency virus a close cousin of hiv or human 
immunodeficiency virus the killer virus that causes aids 
most primates infected with siv will become ill as do humans 
infected with hiv but for some reason the sooty mangabeys for the 
most part never become clinically ill

protection we can contract a vaccine that provides protection 
gordon says 
around the corner from the mangabeys is a family of pygmy 
chimpanzees part of an ambitious breeding program the animals 
sometimes dont breed easily in captivity and yerkes researchers 
are proud of their eight pygmy births 
across the grounds is a group of fullsize chimpanzees being 
watched in a foodandbehavior study and also part of the national 
institutes of healths fiveinstitution national chimpanzee breeding 
and research program researchers figure the animals so closely 
related to man may be needed someday for aids research 
in the laboratories at the main yerkes station in atlanta 
scientists are studying various primates in efforts to combat 
parkinsons disease eye disorders and even tooth decay 
the parkinsons research king says is one of the centers 
crowning achievements since he arrived as director in 1978 yerkes 
scientists were the first to demonstrate the feasibility of 
implanting fetal brain tissue that produces dopamine a compound 
which acts as a transmitter in the nervous system into the brain 
of parkinsons patients as a treatment for the debilitating nerve 
disease now doctors in several countries are trying the same 
technique in humans 
i consider this one of our major advancements king says 
we were the first its a big step in the right direction 
other achievements at yerkes in the past 10 years 
an antiinflammatory drug effective in rhesus monkeys in 
stopping the progression of periodontal disease is now being tested 
in human patients at emorys dental school 
yerkes scientists and emory ophthalmologists using primates 
are studying methods of postsurgery treatment for children born 
with cataracts their work has shown that a traditional technique of 
patching the normal eye forcing the child to use the operatedupon 
eye may be detrimental 
researchers using monkeys chimps and human volunteers have 
found structural and chemical changes in cervical secretions during 
the menstrual cycle which could someday lead to new methods of 
birth control or promoting fertility 
language studies in chimpanzees yielded a language system with 
visual symbols a computeroperated keyboard and stepbystep 
teaching strategies that is now being used by cooperating georgia 
state university experts to teach severely retarded children to 
communicate the work was spearheaded by two psychologists from 
yerkes and georgia state university dr duane rumbaugh and his 
wife dr sue savagerumbaugh 
the work of the rumbaughs must stand very high in the 
achievements of this center king says 
king a neuroscientist and psychologist enjoys explaining that 
the rumbaughs were not at first looking for a way to help retarded 
kids they were looking at apes 
that began as an attempt to explore some fundamental questions 
about the use and capability of great apes to use symbols he 
says the important thing is that it started out as a fundamental 
scientific project with nothing in sight in terms of application 
he compares the accomplishment to alexander flemings accidental 
discovery of penicillins properties during routine mold studies 
it is that kind of science that has brought us out of medieval 
fear and superstition into enlightenment and our ability to deal 
more effectively with the world around us king saysd 
king acknowledges that animals die at yerkes but he maintains 
they die in the pursuit of what researchers believe is a greater 
good most people king says believe that way too 
i believe in the sanity of the people of this country he 
says this is a utilitarian nation that utilitarian sense and 
the recognition of what animal contributions have been and the 
recognition that scientists are not ogres but care for living 
beings other than humans i think will lead the nation to recognize 
eventually the benefits of science 
this nation will support and continue to support life 
sciences in general and medical and behavioral sciences in specific 
with primates or whatever other species i have that confidence 
king bristles when asked whether in retrospect some experiments 
have proven to be unnecessary killing of animals 
do we have experiments that fail of course we do he says 
its part of science 
if we knew what was going to happen for sure we wouldnt do 
the experiment nobody wants to do stupid meaningless work 
kings stresses in his lectures that animal researchers are not 
extremists the extremists he insists are those who would 
needlessly butcher and torture animals or those who would ban any 
scientific use of animals at all 
in all sincerity he says scientists occupy the middle 
road of compassion and humane treatmenti dont know any scientist 
or institution that doesnt want to reduce that discomfort or pain 
to a minimum but at the same time recognizes that human priorities 
with regard to using animals in research must come first 
king envisions a day when he and yerkes can put the debate behind 
them and get on with their work and his goals go beyond behavioral 
and medical research 
without prodding a discussion of yerkes quickly turns to kings 
two passions the endangered south american rain forests without 
those neither the primates nor other species will survive long 
and global population control as mans increasing presence taxes 
his planets resources 
i would like to see us move into the area of population 
concerns he says conceding that for a traditional primate 
research center such work poses a difficult question 
primate center doesnt just mean monkeys and apes he said 
it means humans too

women theyre lucky to make the obit pages at all because all 
they ever did was to raise three children wash the dog after it

no offense will but the good stuff is always interred with 
their bones 
take the late col fraser moffat the alumni magazine of his alma 
mater paid due respect to his business and military career but 
nowhere did it mention that well into life he could still balance a 
dozen empty beer bottles end on end 
the father of a colleague gave his own father last rites three 
times unnecessarily as it turned out being about 10 he didnt 
exactly know procedure so he tried three different versions to

was publicly remembered albeit justly for managing restaurants 
obits will list survivors but rarely unless youre a ruling 
monarch ancestors theres a happy housewife i met in california 
who has survived descent from jesse and frank james the youngers 
and the daltons without robbing nary a bank not obit material in 
spite of what it may tell us about the sins of the father or even 
dead cousins 
in life we are surrounded by what ifs and other narrow 
escapes not in death i had an uncle whose father promised to take 
him to the new nickelodeon for his 10th birthday the morning of the 
great event he had sniffles his mother a nononsense 
exschoolteacher wouldnt let him out of the house thats why he 
wasnt sitting in a reserved front row seat when the iroquois 
theater burned down in chicago in 1903 killing 602 people his 
escape never made the prints until now 
so how come obits never say what made us cry at the funeral and 
laugh at the wake 
alumni magazines are particularly remiss most of em just say 
deceased but part of the news is how our old pals departed this 
realm and what theyd done since we last saw them pouring milk punch 
over their heads at senior houseparties did they make a 
holeinone win a lottery scale k2 
did they die in a bar fight in the klondike lose a duel to a 
jealous husband did their parachutes fail to open dont ask the

also found out where they hid all the spare clappers and pinched 
them too obit matter you kidding 
last words get dropped from our lives as well when henrik ibsen 
the norwegian playwright lay dying his night nurse told the day 
nurse the patient seemed to be slightly better 
tvertimod gasped the failing ibsen in english that says 
on the contrary obits never give us a chance to say so 
long 
to clinch my case i give you jack bainton and the cow business 
who 
john william bainton friend dead the other day age 63 at 
his death mr bainton was thats what the obit said in two 
grafs of a large metropolitan daily ok that papers obit page is 
harder to get into than heaven so they may be forgiven for not 
getting the rest of the story but theres no sense waiting around 
for paul harvey to come up with it 
john william bainton was born in brooklyn if brooklyn were an 
oriental bazaar mr bainton would have ended up selling flying 
carpets that turned into 747s maybe your sister married the type a 
visionary early on 
right after world war ii there was a restriction on exporting 
nonessential vehicles to a warimpoverished world so mr bainton 
whitewashed some station wagons painted red crosses on them and 
shipped them to brazil as ambulances until one day there was a 
cloudburst in recife he assured authorities he would never do it 
again and didnt but they never found out about the ambulances 
that had gone to turkey where it never rains 
after selling the idea of centrifuging to the peruvians to help 
make them one of the worlds leading fishmeal producers mr 
bainton settled in the bahamas helping advise one of canadas 
richest men what to do with 3000 acres he owned since you can 
build just so many resorts and golf courses 
build a dairy said mr bainton while everyone else laughed 
because the land was coral and prickly bushes based on his own 
research plus a hunch that defied conventional geology he claimed 
there would be soil underneath the coral he was right so what to 
do with the coral build a rockcrushing plant to extract the lime 
to build the cinderblock houses bahamians live in then find cows 
that prosper in the semitropics plant crops and start milking 
the bahamas at the time imported 95 percent of its milk from 
miami so by the time it arrived in the islands it was already a 
day toward sour mr baintons dairy eventually was producing almost 
as much milk as the bahamians could drink 
he later had a business that made bricks out of garbage 
pioneered in embryo implants to improve cattle breeds and proposed 
making a massive banana plantation in oyster bay ny under the 
worlds largest greenhouse heated by a refuse incinerator he never 
got around to building the power plant he figured would have lit up 
all nassau by producing electricity from the upwelling thermal 
currents in the ocean 
full many a flower is born to blush unseen wrote the poet 
thomas gray after ruminating in a country graveyard 
gray really sounds like he just finished reading an obit page

editors note chicagoans go to the polls this week in a special 
mayoral election to decide who will serve the last two years of the 
second term of the late harold washington the citys first black 
mayor the leading candidates are two blacks hoping to win over 
washingtons supporters and the son of the longtime political boss 
richard j daley 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the ghosts of two former mayors are hovering over 
the campaign trail as voters in the nations thirdlargest city 
decide who will lead them into the 1990s 
long gone is the late mayor richard j daley a boss of the old 
school who used concentrated political muscle to run chicago for 21 
years before his death in 1976 
but the frontrunner in the special democratic mayoral primary is 
one of his sons richard m daley the 46yearold cook county 
states attorney whose blood ties to city hall legend sometimes seem 
to transcend his own record 
gone as well is harold washington the citys first black mayor 
whose death on nov 25 1987 set the stage for this years special 
election 
but his legacy of leadership is a key issue for black voters 
being wooed by mayor eugene sawyer 54 daleys chief primary rival 
and alderman timothy evans 45 who is running a thirdparty 
campaign on the harold washington ticket 
at stake in the special mayoral contest are the last two years of 
washingtons second term 
in the democratic primary sawyer and daley also face lawrence 
bloom a white alderman who supported washington and two lagging 
candidates three republicans none well known in this democratic 
stronghold were on the gop ballot 
after the feb 28 primary elections evans will take on the 
winners in the april 4 general election 
this campaign season in a city known for its deep racial 
divisions black voters who united behind washington are being 
ardently courted by sawyer and evans 
neither can supplant the affable streetwise washington who has 
become a symbol of change and unity for many chicagoans 
harold washingtonembodied all of the hopes and aspirations 
of a generation of people who genuinely believed that chicago was 
ready for reform said cook county recorder of deeds carol moseley 
braun who last fall became the first black to win a major county 
office 
five weeks before the primary sawyer elected by the city 
council to succeed washington finally won the endorsement of civil 
rights leader and presidential contender jesse jackson 
he has done more than any of his primary opponents to sustain 
the harold washington coalition jackson said 
but the delay in that longawaited endorsement underscores the 
discord in the black community since washingtons death 
and jackson declined to say where he would stand if sawyer faced 
evans in the general election 
evans who served as washingtons floor leader in the city 
council is campaigning as the late mayors heir apparent his 
withdrawal from the democratic primary prevented a split in the 
black vote that would have virtually guaranteed daley the nomination 
jacksons endorsement was a matter of great concern to both black 
candidates but some observers say it wont help sawyer 
a massive black turnout is sawyers only chance in the primary 
said paul kleppner author of chicago divided the making of a 
black mayor and director of the social science research institute 
at northern illinois university in de kalb 
my suspicion is that he sawyer is going to get the 
overwhelming bulk of the black vote with moderate turnout and 
that wont be enough he said 
sawyer still has the image that he was put in there by the 
white aldermen kleppner said referring to the role of longtime 
washington foes in engineering sawyers election over evans as 
acting mayor in december 1987 
time heals a lot of wounds counters joseph gardner 
washingtons former political office director who endorsed sawyer 
and predicts a strong black turnout for him 
the racial breakdown of chicagos votingage population on july 1 
was about 468 percent white 383 percent black and 149 percent 
hispanic said marie bousfield chicagos city demographer

in 1983 black voters turned out in force to support washington 
in the primary giving him 36 percent of the vote and a stunning 
victory over thenmayor jane yrne and daley who divided the white 
vote washington went on to a narrow victory in a racially charged 
generalelection fight against littleknown republican bernard epton 
kleppner said he believes the racism that marked the 1983 mayoral 
contest remains but its under the rug 
racism was tempered when the city actually had a black mayor he 
said and many white voters feel daley is a shooin 
daleys status as frontrunner has not been hurt by virtually 
citywide recognition of the family name 
bring back the daley dynasty supporters cheer at some 
campaign stops 
sawyer and evans and washington came up through the ranks of 
the machine the patronagerich political organization daleys 
father built 
daley says little about his father whose last years in office 
were marred by the riots at the 1968 democratic national convention 
and other controversies 
he cites his own record as county prosecutor and a state senator 
the politics and namecalling are tearing chicago apart when we 
need to work together daley told a civic club meeting 
im not interested in being the white candidate or in 
serving as mayor for half the people 
kleppner says daley will win the primary if he avoids the kind of 
slip that could provide a focal point for black opposition he adds 
that such a slip is unlikely since daley has been very well 
scripted 
daley kept to that script in a television debate earlier this 
month with sawyer and bloom repeatedly baited by bloom who at one 
point said his supporters thought daley was the great white hope 
daley refused to spar 
city jobs and minority hiring are hot topics and sawyer boasting 
that a quarter of city contracts are going to minorities contends 
daleys election would mean moving backward 
aides say daley has a good affirmative action record in his 
office more than doubling the number of black lawyers there in 
eight years 
activist lu palmer said hes not convinced 
no white mayor has ever been sensitive to the needs of our 
people he said 
daley may benefit from blackjewish tension lingering after the 
furor last spring over taperecorded lectures by sawyer aide steve 
cokely that contained antisemitic remarks sawyer waited five days 
to fire cokely a few hours before the announcement evans denounced 
cokelys remarks as inappropriate 
there are many jews among the white lakefront liberals who 
helped elect washington 
i dont think that either black mayoral candidate played an 
exemplary role in the cokely affair said barry morrison of the 
local antidefamation league of bnai brith 
there have been other tussles 
days after becoming mayor sawyer faced the disclosure that as an 
alderman years before he accepted what he called a finders fee of 
30000 for helping a lawyer obtain a bank loan in another case he 
admitted filing income tax returns late though no money was owed 
the government 
daley meanwhile was questioned about a report that petitions 
circulated for a failed 1986 referendum to make the mayors race 
nonpartisan may have included fraudulent signatures linked to 
workers in his office he cooled the issue by calling for 
appointment of a special prosecutor 
sawyer says the winner of the democratic primary is sure to be 
mayor but evans demonstrated considerable strength when he 
submitted more than 100000 signatures in filing for his thirdparty 
bid four times the required number 
kleppner suggests it doesnt much matter who wins 
with the 1991 regularly scheduled mayoral race coming up soon 
after this springs special election the winner will begin 
campaigning immediately he said 
what this city needs its not going to get from any of the 
candidates kleppner said and thats longrange planning

editors note at age 81 george romney is a man of remarkable 
achievement in both government and business but hes not done yet 
hes still at work on what he considers his most important 
accomplishment the promotion of volunteer community service and he 
has the ear of president bush 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
the dean of michigans republicans 
skipped the inaugural ceremony but his influence was felt as the 
presidential mantle was passed from ronald reagan to george bush 
george romney the former governor former cabinet member and 
onetime auto executive who made an abortive run for the white house 
himself two decades ago decided he didnt want to fight the crowds 
ive been going to inaugurals since franklin delano roosevelt 
was inaugurated ive been to so many the 81yearold romney was 
saying the other day as he relaxed at his home looking fit and trim 
despite his snowwhite hair 
romney worked with the bush transition team to help initiate 
bushs thousand points of light program and to shape three 
volunteer programs which romney wants to see headed by peace corps 
director loret ruppe 
at romneys urging bush announced the three programs during the 
campaign 
romney puts encouraging volunteer work at the top of his list of 
accomplishments 
as a result of my experiences ive concluded that the most 
important thing i can do is to strengthen the whole volunteer aspect 
of american life he says 
more important than reviving the fortunes of american motors 
corp in the 1960s 
more important that spearheading a citizens effort to streamline 
the state constitution in 1961 
more important than becoming the first republican to capture the 
michigan governors chair in 14 years 
yes because to romney government no longer is the solution to 
americas problems 
the most powerful problemsolving force on earth is the 
organized voluntary cooperation of a free people he says 
since 1974 romney has been founding chairman of volunteer the 
national center an organization based in arlington va that is 
dedicated to encouraging volunteerism 
his goal is to create a volunteer center in every community that 
has a united way the centers recruit and place volunteers in local 
organizations 
i concluded some years ago we had barely tapped the 
problemsolving potential of people helping people as volunteers 
says romney who created the nations first united way in detroit in 
1948 i concluded we had organized the money part of volunteering 
better than we had organized the people part 
nearly every week finds romney on the road somewhere trying to 
add to the 350 volunteer centers already established 
on this winters day romney had just returned from an eightmile 
walk a regimen he follows even on michigans coldest days in the 
summer he adds a round of golf at nearby bloomfield hills country 
club to his exercise routine 
i dont even have arthritis in my little finger he says 
ive been fortunate knock on wood 
his modern secluded home is on the edge of a private pond that 
is stocked with goldfish and fringed with pine trees in his study 
he is surrounded by a wall of books a signed photograph of former 
president gerald ford and time magazine covers bearing his own 
picture 
romney was born july 8 1907 in chihuahua mexico where his 
parents and other mormons had moved to avoid us laws restricting 
the practice of polygamy 
he grew up in idaho and salt lake city where he met his future 
wife lenore while in high school he was 17 and she was 15 they 
were married seven years later 
their 57year marriage has produced four children 22 
grandchildren and eight greatgrandchildren

romney attended four colleges but never graduated he spent two 
years as a mormon missionary in england and scotland giving 
speeches in trafalgar square and hyde park 
romneys first exposure to politics was in 1929 as an aide to 
sen david i walsh of massachusetts in washington 
after that were stints at alcoa and the aluminum wares 
association 
his first job in detroit came in 1939 when he was local manager 
of the automobile manufacturers association he later became general 
manager but left in 1948 to join amc where he eventually became 
chairman 
at amc he oversaw the marketing of the first successful compact 
economy car on the american market the rambler 
we forced the big three into small car production he says 
the companys stock went from 5 a share to 90 a share with him 
at the helm amc was purchased by chrysler corp in august 1987 
lee iacocca has had to close down plants i used to make 
successful romney says 
romney used to rent milwaukee county stadium to gather amc 
employees and their families for a meeting 
wed talk to them about what we were confronted with romney 
recalls adding that modern corporations and labor unions are guilty 
of thinking only of wages and profits 
romneys first public service came in 1957 when he headed a 
panel to study problems in the detroit schools 
in 1959 he created citizens for michigan a bipartisan group 
that later spearheaded the drive for a constitutional convention to 
rewrite the states constitution because of a deadlock between the 
governor and legislature 
romneys first candidacy was in 1961 when he ran successfully as 
a delegate to the constitutional convention 
we were the first state since world war i to rewrite a whole 
constitution and have it adopted by a vote of the people he says 
a year later he was elected as michigans first republican 
governor since 1948 
romneys political stock rose rapidly after he won his third term 
in 1966 he began to eye a run at the presidency 
on a september 1967 television interview show romney startled 
the nation by saying he had originally supported the war in vietnam 
because he had been brainwashed by the military during a tour of the 
southeast asian country 
five months later shortly before the new hampshire primary 
romney withdrew from the race 
it wasnt because of my position on vietnam or anything i said 
about vietnam he says it was because nelson rockefeller became 
a candidate and there was no way i could get the nomination fighting 
both rockefeller and richard nixon 
nixon later picked romney to be secretary of housing and urban 
development a post he held from 1969 to 1972 when he resigned to 
return to the private sector 
he returned to politics during the last presidential campaign 
when it appeared strife between the forces of bush former 
television evangelist pat robertson and rep jack kemp of new york 
would rip the michigan gop party apart 
he was quick to stand up and remind people publicly and 
privately that there was a bigger fight ahead of us in the fall 
says michigan republican party chairman spencer abraham 
romney found the campaign disappointing with the candidates 
afraid to discuss issues for fear of losing votes 
we no longer have a republic he says we have a special 
interest porkbarrel democracy and we havent adjusted our 
institutions to that fact

editors note once banned by the russian czars the balalaika 
is the most beloved musical instrument in the soviet union now a 
soviet orchestra on a tour of 40 us cities is introducing 
americans to the sound produced by an instrument which is something 
like a guitar but with some big differences 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there may be some scots who cant bear the 
bagpipe but its a rare russian who badmouths the balalaika 
the balalaika is the instrument most close to the russian 
soul says sergei lukin one of the 82 members of the osipov 
balalaika orchestra which is on a tour of 40 american cities 
through march 9 it is very tender very touching it starts 
singing in the hands of a real master 
whats a balalaika well its a stringed instrument somewhat 
like a guiter but is triangular shaped usually has only three 
strings and comes in a variety of sizes 
americans may remember the sound from laras theme on the 
sound track of the film dr zhivago 
lukin plays the domra which looks like a roundbodied banjo its 
flat front the size of a dinner plate many balalaikas sound best 
apparently mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra 
lukin and other members of the osipov the soviet unions top 
balalaika orchestra were interviewed through an interpreter 
were doing all kinds of songs sad and merry they all depict 
the state of a soul says nikolai kalinin the orchestras 
conductor and artistic director 
there are really rhythmic energetic songs you want to dance 
when you hear them adds singer nadja babkina founder of the 
babkina folk ensemble which is on tour with the orchestra 
miss babkina who wears her long hair dramatically forward over 
one shoulder says that in the 16th century balalaika players were 
dispersed and their instruments were burned because they were 
thought to be diverting peoples attention from the church 
thats why a law was signed by our czar that all these groups 
of amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also 
she says russian people tried to hide these instruments in the 
18th century someone said it was time to renew them 
why dont you ask how to play it asks alexander gorbachev 
41 holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a man 
named nalimov the stradivarius of balalaika makers 
then he demonstrates drawing his right index finger across the 
strings like a violin bow 
it is such a strong finger he can even open a bottle says 
sergei butushin who plays an array of horns that he has made some 
with bells made of cows horns 
i go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly their 
horns butushin says we have several such places in moscow 
the balalaika used mainly for playing folk music is more 
popular in rural areas but it is not unknown in the cities 
vladimir byeloblotsky 38 playing some jazz riffs on his bass 
balalaika says he was born in moscow and heard the balalaika as a 
child 
i started playing contrabass like in the symphony orchestra 
he says then i was very fond of jazz and i played in a jazz 
orchestra which went away from the soviet union and now is in the 
united states now im playing this bass balalaika and im really 
very happy i think that is the thing i wanted to do 
gorbachev who plays prima balalaika the main one of the 
five sizes of balalaikas in the osipov orchestra started on the 
accordion like his father 
i joined music school when i was 15 years old gorbachev 
says i heard balalaika and i liked very much the sound and i 
started seriously studying this instrument i was born in moscow but 
my relatives came from villages 
conductor kalinin explains that orchestra members and aspiring 
members alike must audition each year seniority doesnt count if 
somebody proves not so good he retires he says 
accordion player igor konovalov says i was born in 1941 when 
the germans were very close to moscow in the second world war my 
mother went to a village and i was born with an accordion in my 
hands at that time in villages it was the most popular 
instrument at night people came out of their homes and sat on 
benches and started playing 
i started playing the gormoyan which is a purely russian 
accordion when i was 12 
kalinin 45 the orchestra conductor for 10 years was once a 
professional singer his wife plays domra in the orchestra the 
youngest of their three children now 5 waved his hands like a 
conductor by a kind of inheritance his father says before 
he could talk 
butushin whose interest in horns crowded out his earlier 
balalaika playing has been in the orchestra for 20 years since he 
was 15 and has been on all its american tours in 1969 71 and 
77 
lukin 31 started out playing the cello as a boy in music school 
i was so small and the cello was so big and heavy i thought it 
was better if i played this domra he says since then i deeply

when yuriko a japaneseamerican dancer and 
choreographer and her daughter susan kikuchi met with jerome 
robbins in january 1988 they didnt realize their conversation 
would be the beginning of a yearlong project 
for mother and daughter it meant a return to the king and i 
a musical both have been associated with much of their professional 
lives for robbins it involved the chance to rework and refine one 
of his most famous creations the small house of uncle thomas a 
production number in the king and i 
this ballet opens the second act of jerome robbins broadway 
a new 7 million musical featuring numbers by the famed director 
and choreographer the show spans 20 years beginning with robbins 
first show on the town in 1944 and ending with his last 
musical fiddler on the roof in 1964 
jerome robbins broadway required meticulous preparation 
months of research and reconstruction of musical numbers an 
unprecedented 22 weeks of rehearsal for its cast of more than 60 
dancers and singers and seven weeks of preview performances before 
the opening 
the musical also includes such famous robbins creations as the 
frantic mack sennett ballet from high button shoes im 
flying from peter pan a suite of dances from west side 
story and a trio of strippers proclaiming you gotta have a 
gimmick from gypsy 
some musical numbers had to be recreated from scratch and the 
collective memories of their original dancers that wasnt the case 
with the small house of uncle thomas which is from one of 
rodgers and hammersteins bestknown musicals 
yuriko a onetime member of the martha graham dance company 
performed in the original 1951 cast of the king and i which 
starred gertrude lawrence and yul brynner 
in the show she played eliza in the small house of uncle 
thomas the number is a siamese dance retelling of harriet 
beecher stowes uncle toms cabin now she has helped robbins 
recreate it and miss kikuchi plays the role her mother originated 
38 years ago 
the ballet apparently was hammersteins idea its mentioned in 
an early version of the the king and i script the general story 
line for the ballet is in the script as well as some narration and 
specific ideas for the dance hammerstein even had the idea of using 
real dogs poodles in fact to chase the ballets heroine they 
never made it to robbins final version 
instead robbins created six distinct separate dance segments to 
tell the story of eliza crossing the ice her pursuit by simon 
legree legrees drowning and the death of little eva 
at first the choreographer strove for a correct oriental style 
he was into authenticity trying to choreograph through that 
said yuriko recalling the intense fourweek rehearsal period before 
the show went out of town in 1951 the dance style was modified as 
rehearsals went on to accommodate rodgers music which was more 
broadway than far eastern 
in rehearsal robbins worked closely with trude rittman who 
arranged the dance music incorporating some of rodgers melodies as 
well as her own work the music wasnt completed until feb 15 
1951 11 days before the show began its prebroadway tryout in new 
haven conn 
the music and the choreography went along side by side 
yuriko says they were created together 
yuriko remembers the choreography so well because she was the 
dance captain for the original production of the king and i 
i had to know all the parts she says in my original music 
score i have notes and have tried to preserve it as much as i can 
yuriko has directed or choreographed many revivals of the king 
and i including the 1977 brynner production that ran for more 
than a year on broadway it was in that revival that miss kikuchi 
danced the role of eliza 
miss kikuchi is a veteran of the king and i as a child she 
watched her mother in the original production and joined various 
revivals of the show herself eventually playing most of the roles 
in the small house of uncle thomas 
my mother would take me into a room and just teach it to me 
miss kikuchi recalls 
auditions for the new show began in february of last year yuriko 
and later miss kikuchi attended them and conferred with robbins 
on his choices 
jerry took his time picking people dancers he thought he could 
work with says miss kikuchi he likes giving new unexpected 
directions and having things accomplished right away 
robbins kept refining the choreography at one point taking out 
a major sequence or experimenting with various ideas on how to make 
it snow on stage that effect used in the original was finally 
dropped 
robbins has a reputation as a perfectionist 
you have to be able to have stamina yuriko says you have 
to be absolutely quick in changing from one minute to the next if 
he likes a dancer he will start to needle a little bit to see how 
quickly they can react to change 
the long rehearsal process for the show hasnt been easy robbins 
quickly replaced dancers if he found they were not working in a 
particular number the show is the bottom line 
hes looking for an intelligence and capability not just to be 
able to do one step polish it and get stuck there yuriko says 
he loves to change until it is right and only he knows what is 
right

on a continent where kings were once 
revered as gods asias halfdozen surviving monarchies include a 
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute 
power 
king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand the worlds longest reigning 
monarch following the death jan 7 of japans emperor hirohito has 
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each 
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design 
irrigation canals improve crops and combat disease 
aside from thailand and japan monarchs also reign in nepal and 
bhutan in the himalayias brunei on borneo and malaysia in 
southeast asia 
unlike his remote predecessors in nepal harvardeducated king 
birendra crisscrosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of 
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year 
2000 
in the kingdom of bhutan king jigme singye wangchuk pores over 
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions 
submitted by subjects 
hirohito whose funeral will be held feb 24 is widely credited 
with having helped japans postwar economic miracle by preserving 
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role 
but the late emperor who renounced his divinity after japans 
defeat in world war ii spent most of his 62 years on the 
chrysanthemum throne behind the walls of tokyos imperial palace 
his son and successor emperor akihito 55 broke with tradition 
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train 
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his 
fellow japanese at numerous public functions 
though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between 
emperor and subjects akihito is unlikely to interact as intimately 
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other asian 
royals nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power 
the most powerful and richest of the continents five remaining 
hereditary monarchs is bruneis sultan hassanal bolkiah an absolute 
ruler who resides in a 1788room palace and keeps some of his 200 
horses in airconditioned stables fortune magazine in the united 
states last year named him the worlds richest man with assets 
estimated at 25 billion 
besides being head of state he is also prime minister and 
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the cabinet 
to help rule over the oilrich nation about the size of maryland on 
the north coast of borneo island 
bruneis sultan harkens back to days when the pomp pageantry and 
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods kings princes sultans 
maharajahs newabs and nizams were as vital a part of asia as its 
rice fields 
but by midcentury royal ranks had been thinned by communist 
revolutions independence struggles and the spread of western 
democracy other crowns have toppled in more recent times 
the last emperor of china abdicated in 1912 communists ended 
imperial rule in vietnam at the end of world war ii indias 
independence from great britain in 1947 sounded the knell for 
myriads of royals cambodias kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in 
1970 though prince norodom sihanouk formerly the king is still 
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader the last king of 
afghanistan mohammad zaher shah was toppled in 1973 and is exiled 
in italy but recently offered to help in a transitional government 
in his country 
today there remain but five asian hereditary kingdoms and 
malaysia where every five years one of the countrys sultans is 
elected a constitutional monarch 
nine of malaysias 13 states have sultans who are constitutional 
heads of the state governments they have no political power every 
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of 
themselves to be the national king by tacit agreement each state 
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later at the 
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but 
political power rests with prime minister 
the present king of malaysia is sultan mahmood iskandar from 
jahore state his term expires this year 
todays asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable 
futures appear secure 
akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2600 
years in japan though historians regard the first 14 emperors as 
figures of myth the japanese imperial line is still the worlds 
oldest hereditary monarchy and current public opinion polls favor 
its continuation 
bhumibol probably the most respected man in thailand is heir to 
750 years of monarchy 
bolkiah is bruneis 29th ruler while nepal and bhutan both have 
centuriesold royal traditions 
although a constitutional monarch the 61yearold thai king is 
regarded as semidivine by some and widely viewed as having held the 
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that 
have marked recent decades he openly intervened to stop a serious 
studentled uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of national 
crisis played a decisive behindthescenes role 
named king in 1946 and crowned four years later when he was a 
jazzloving teenager bhumibol was initially viewed as someone to 
be used by military strongmen instead he gradually reversed the 
decline in prestige of the throne largely by bypassing the elite 
to work for the mass of havenots in the countryside 
nepals birendra 43 likewise has sought links with the rural 
poor making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief 
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers but knowledgable 
sources in nepal and neighboring india say much of the effort is 
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers an 
open secret in katmandu the capital 
birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16year 
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited 
democratic rights the king himself seen as a reincarnation of the 
hindu god vishnu by law cannot be criticized 
in bhutan the publicityshy 33yearold king jigme singye 
wangchuk has continued his fathers attempts at political evolution 
and improvement in the lives of his 14 million largely illiterate 
people 
development is important but preserving our culture and our 
values is equally important jigme singye has said 
bhutan was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his 
reformminded father 
international aid agencies have been welcomed to bhutan but mass 
tourism has not tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways 
upheld by the king who always wears the traditional robelike 
kho even while playing basketball and is married to four 
sisters of noble line another timehonored custom 
bruneis politics are said to be among the most sterile in asia 
but the tiny states 227000 people have yet to show significant 
signs of discontent under the 42yearold sultan the country 
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves medical 
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of 
21000 is among the highest in the world 
the sultan who has snapped up hotels companies and other 
investments around the world moves freely among his subjects and is 
credited with a number of civic improvements

long the butt of jokes as the nations 
federal village bonn is suffering further indignities and more 
ribbing this year its city fathers doggedly insist that this is its 
2000th birthday and others insist its not 
bonn is 2000 declare banners hanging from every light 
standard flanking the b9 highway a flat and colorless corridor 
that is the closest thing to a main street in this stepsister 
capital destined to be provisional forever 
local historians concede that bonns founding date of 11 bc is 
at bestan educated guess on literary grounds and probably a half 
century too late if one is talking about when it was settled 
the first written reference to bonna was found in roman 
chronicles of the rhineland war campaign carried out by nero 
claudius drusus germanicus between 13 bc and 9 bc unsure of the 
point when bonn was founded historians split the difference and 
came up with 11 bc says manfred van rey the municipal historian 
this is in no way an archeological determination he said in 
an interview there is clear evidence that a village of bonn 
existed for several decades before the drusus reference 
undaunted by details and determined to host a good party city 
officials have embarked on an ambitious yearlong spree of concerts 
exhibits renovations and a massive fireworks display donated by 
china for the occasion 
the 54million extravaganza however has done more to 
stimulate the local penchant for selfdeprecation than any sense of 
historical importance 
die welt the citys conservative daily newspaper poked fun at 
the historical oversight and questioned the need to lavish public 
funds on the belated observance 
batches of souvenir mugs cigarette lighters and other plastic 
baubles crowd the checkout counters of newsstands gathering dust 
amid public apathy toward memorabilia attesting 1989 i was 
there and bonn spelled with a red lipstick kiss in place of 
the vowel 
an unassuming hamlet on the rhine river before its designation 40 
years ago as seat of the new postwar government in germanys western 
sector bonn has endured decades of ribbing as europes cinderella 
capital 
it is easy to make fun of bonn the british ambassador sir 
julian l bullard wrote in a collection of essays about the 2000th 
or so anniversary no one would award it the prize for best 
theatre best opera best restaurant or best newspaper best 
intentions perhaps 
indeed bonn has little fame to claim aside from being the 
birthplace in 1770 of composer ludwig von beethoven who left in his 
teenage years 
bonn has little business aside from the federal government a 
licorice factory a pipeorgan works and a familyowned venture that 
stitches european flags are the citys most prominent industries 
with fewer than 300000 residents including the nearby towns it 
has swallowed over the past few years bonn is too small to rate a 
store that stays open later than 630 pm under the governments 
complicated commerce rules 
the smalltown atmosphere of europes youngest capital has earned 
it the nickname bundesdorf or federal village a play on its 
designation as bundeshauptstadt federal capital 
it was bonns very obscurity that earned it the dubious role of 
provisional capital in 1949 a verifiable anniversary that will be 
celebrated nationwide this spring 
following four years of allied control after world war ii the 
west german government created in 1949 was intent on eventual 
reunification with the sovietcontrolled east german sector and did 
not want a prominent capital in an established city like frankfurt 
hamburg or munich 
a picturesque village just south of cologne and a favorite summer 
stopover for the man who was to become the first chancellor konrad 
adenauer bonn was tabbed as a sufficiently lowprofile spot from 
which to tide over affairs of state until berlin the real capital 
could be reclaimed by a unified germany 
despite 40 years and allbutextinguished hopes for 
reunification bonn has failed to take on a capital image 
reflecting official insistence that life here is temporary 
government ministries occupy boxlike concrete quarters that could 
easily be converted to private use hotel space is scarce 
embassies though maintained in the tidy rhineland tradition tend 
toward the austere and outmoded 
more renowned for its dreary weather than its political role 
bonn endures a number of physical oddities that aggravate its 
smalltime profile 
the city is shaped something like a qtip with the university 
and a pedestrian shopping area forming the northern puff and a 
collage of diplomatic missions and housing compounds clustered at 
the south 
spanning the threemile distance in between are the parallel b9 
highway and the railroad tracks both flanked by a narrow stretch of 
federal buildings the arrangement makes it difficult to walk or 
drive more than a city block east or west without encountering a 
barrier 
theres something wrong with a capital that has to come to a 
halt every six minutes to let the trains roar through joked one 
american resident 
newcomers to bonn often complain they feel depressed and groggy 
a condition some psychologists here have termed the rhine 
syndrome and attributed to unusually low air pressure along the 
river 
the spy novelist john lecarre captured bonns incongruous mix of 
scandal and boredom in his 1968 book a small town in germany 
the tale of international intrigue set at the british embassy 
sometimes the fog is a little colder then we call it winter 
quipped lecarres fictional diplomat peter de lisle sometimes 
its warmer and thats summer you know what they say about bonn 
either it rains or the level crossings are down

fatuma issa bore her eighth child in a 
concrete shelter on the edge of the desert accompanied only by a 
teenage midwife she had never met 
mrs issa 36 years old strong and lucky survived the delivery 
but thousands of other women around the world in circumstances 
similar to hers die each day in childbirths or from complications 
related to pregnancy 
the worlds poorest nations account for about 90 percent of the 
halfmillion women who die each year in childbirth from 
complications during pregnancy or from illegal abortions 
international efforts are under way to save womens lives but 
changes are slow 
in northern europe 9 or 10 women die out of every 100000 who 
give birth compared with niger and other parts of west africa where 
the figure is 700 out of 100000 according to united nations 
studies 
and for every woman who dies at least 10 are permanently 
handicapped by a complication during pregnancy or delivery a united 
nations childrens fund unicef study reports 
for each of the 500000 women who die at least two children are 
left orphans says unicef calling the figures the statistics of 
shame 
unicef the world health organization the world bank and others 
have taken steps in the last few years aimed at reducing maternal 
mortality rate by half in the next 25 years 
the problem was forcefully illustrated in 1987 at a conference on 
maternal mortality in nairobi kenya by dr attiya inayatulla of 
pakistan when he told other delegates it is intolerable that 
thousands of women die alone in suffering when they are in the 
process of giving life and that we should do so little to help 
them 
the day mrs issa gave birth a second international meeting was 
taking place about 50 miles down the road in nigers capital 
niamey the meeting under the auspices of the world bank and un 
groups was designed to raise awareness of the problem among 
officials in 22 frenchspeaking african countries and to encourage 
them to help women and increase family planning 
health ministers were hammered with evidence that women hold the 
key to helping african nations struggle out of poverty 
at the close of the meeting delegates issued a declaration 
calling on african nations to do more to save the lives that are 
being squandered 
women the declaration said are not dying from the natural 
dangers of childbirth but from bad health ignorance poverty and 
an inferior social status that is beyond the imagination of most 
women in the west 
every morning for most of the last 19 years mrs issa has risen 
before dawn to walk an hour for a bucket of water for cooking and 
washing there is no water source in her village of helmutshaped 
straw huts after being fed a meager meal her children scour for 
firewood in the vast expanse of dusty scrubland that supports few 
trees 
standing before a hiphigh trough she begins pounding millet 
the staple of nigers diet in blazing heat and dusty wind she 
pounds the grain for eight hours first in the morning and again in 
the afternoon she then walks another hour for more water 
she also plants and maintains a garden feeds the livestock 
cares for her eight children and elderly family members cleans the 
hut and does what is demanded by her husband he grows millet a few 
months of the year when it rains and spends hours talking with other 
men in the village 
how can we ease the burdens that rest on the shoulders of 
african mothers edward jaycox world bank vice president for 
africa said at the niamey conferenceit is a question at the very 
heart of the development of africa 
african women work 12 to 16 hours a day account for an average 
of 60 percent of what many nations produce and furnish 80 percent of 
what their families eat 
the african mother is the foundation of african society 
jaycox said yet she is also the most vulnerable member of that 
society when food is in short supply she is the one who goes 
without when there is no doctor she is the one who must deal with 
the risks associated with frequent pregnancies and when the 
national quality of life plummets she is the first to face the 
consequences 
mrs issa has experienced some of that throughout her childhood 
when food was short in the decades of recurring drought her nine 
brothers and her father got first choice she was lucky to have 
grown up at all given the rate of child deaths in poor countries 
the death rate for third world children in their first year of 
life is 21 percent higher for girls than boys fourteen percent of 
girls suffer serious malnutrition while only 5 percent of the boys 
do a world health organization study reports 
malnourished girls grow into undernourished women twothirds of 
pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia and many 
more suffer vitamin deficiencies related to poor diet

bad health leads to problem pregnancies but few women have 
access to medical care only 44 percent of third world women in 
labor receive medical care in many countries about 80 percent of 
all births take place at home about half the time these women are 
alone national studies report 
niger like several african countries has taken preliminary 
steps to improve health services for expectant mothers the aging 
concrete shelter where mrs issa had her baby is one of about 80 
maternity centers set up by the government around the nation 
but in a poor country like niger where per capita income hovers 
around 260 a year medical service is rudimentary at best and the 
standards of service differ widely 
even in the capital where six multipurpose complexes offer 
prenatal obstetric and early pediatric care by trained midwives and 
health workers the centers often lack sufficient antibiotics pain 
killers and plasma 
rural facilities frequently lack electricity and running water 
and are often more like the center here two crude rooms with a few 
yellowed cots and an inexperienced midwife the expectant mothers 
have never seen before 
despite the lack of health care and many dangers african women 
continue to give birth too often too early and too late 
mrs issa got married in her teens like 70 percent of the women 
in west africa but only 7 percent in europe she had her first child 
at 17 
african women often produce their first baby around the age of 15 
and continue having children every year or two until menopause mrs 
issa says she has had enough 
im tired really tired she said sitting on a dirty foam 
mattress without sheets the day after she gave birth 
i want to take something to stop having babies my husband may 
not want to accept it but hes not the one whos tired she added 
in the tribal language djerma speaking through a midwife who 
translated 
in rural areas unicef reports 50 percent of the women who had 
their first child before 15 were dead by the age of 50 from causes 
linked to the trauma of frequent pregnancies 
but only about 2 percent of african women have access to modern 
birth control or information on family planning laws customs and 
religious beliefs stand in the way 
until niger adopted a new birth control law last april women 
needed written permission from their husbands even to visit a family 
planning center in some countries women need permission from their 
spouses to leave a village 
they cannot vote they can neither own property nor inherit it 
they cannot decide whom to marry or divorce and they are prohibited 
from seeking an education 
female literacy in west africa hovers around 6 percent compared 
to 20 percent for african men and 99 percent for women and men in 
north america 
women have no options said perdita huston spokeswoman for 
the londonbased international planned parenthood she may be 
desperately tired and not want another child but she doesnt want 
to disappoint her husband she has to go on pleasing him 
you can talk about safe motherhood until you are blue in the 
face and accomplish nothing until you convince the men 
ms huston added however that attitudes gradually are changing 
recurring drought and famine in african countries bordering the 
sahara produced a psychological shock to african governments 
forcing them to reconsider limiting population growth 
chiefs of states and heads of families are realizing they dont 
need any more mouths to feed 
world bank lending for programs related to womens health and 
birth control will triple over the next five to eight years 
we need to put our money where our mouth is said mj 
gillette the world banks director of the africa country department 
but there is hope since the late 1970s there has been a 
tremendous reversal of spirit in africa and a real intellectual 
grasp of the situation gillette said women are organizing and 
they are going to take care of this problem governments are 
recognizing the link between development and population control and 
they are changing policies 
the last obstacle to family planning is the african man and he 
is waking up there are forces loose in african society that he 
cant control anymore

the stars we are capitol marc almond 
 
when was the last time you heard lyrics like these 
ill be a dragonfly a butterfly a secret or a little lie to 
test you a song a verse a lullaby a symphony 
in my hands the grains of sand a thousand million moments of 
emotion oh these my dreams are yours 
im a teardrop in a storm a storm at the end of the world 
set words like these to a rock beat and add strings trumpets and 
other lush instrumentation backing vocals with plenty of 
atmospheric reverb and an occasional spokenword passage what do 
you have donovan the moody blues king crimson 
no this is not a lost 1967 recording of early art rock but marc 
almond and his group la magia exhibit a youthful romanticism that 
has been missing from rock since the flower power days 
thats refreshing as a break from the current formulas a 
revitalization of an almost extinct style and its reassuring to 
know that even in the late 80s a songwriter can refer to himself as 
someone who is afraid of getting jaded 
but youthful romanticism and idealism can lead to youthful 
excess and this record is often both trite and overwrought in its 
efforts to achieve poetry in a song called the very last pearl 
almond aptly sings call me romantic call me deluded he 
concludes another song by drawing out the phrase and i a fool 
for love really now 
amid such excess however there are some good songs on this 
album only the moment and tears run rings in particular 
stand out as wellrealized pop songs that manage to escape being 
overdone all it takes is a little restraint

wall of pride columbia omar and the howlers 
 
omar and the howlers play the kind of loud rowdy rock n roll 
that sounds best late at night in a noisy crowded bar 
that doesnt mean you have to invite a bunch of strangers over to 
your apartment and throw beer bottles against the wall to enjoy 
wall of pride the texas bands second album but make no 
mistake its party music all the way 
transferring such barband energy to a record is no easy task but 
producer terry manning who has worked with bluesrockers zz top 
and george thorogood has a way with this sort of thing 
the focus is not on the songs which are good if not overly 
distinctive as much as the sound itself especially the sandpaper 
growl of lead singer omar who also plays a raw scraping guitar 
hes helped by a strong rhythm section and keyboard player eric 
scortia who apparently isnt afraid to occasionally use his elbows 
instead of his fingers to pound the piano 
the albums two cover songs are interesting a remake of the 
animals we gotta get out of this place which abandons any 
pretense to the subtlety of the original and a version of jimmy 
reeds down in mississippi recorded in an odd muffled sound 
that recalls the great bluesmans loping style 
the originals most of which are written or cowritten by an 
otherwise unidentified k dykes range from the allout boogie of 
rattlesnake shake to the rhythm and bluesflavored kings 
ransom 
thats not a very far range but these guys dont claim to be 
renaissance men theyre howlers

rick dankos life has been a musical 
carnival since the band played its last waltz at san franciscos 
winterland in 1976 and the bass player wants all to know that hes 
alive and well and has no intention of quitting the business 
danko took the low road after the group known loosely as bob 
dylans backup band and sometimes called by a myriad of other 
names levon and the hawks the crackers and the canadian squires 
decided that 16 years on the road was enough they retired as a 
group but not as individuals 
the last 10 years ive been documenting my shows every night 
that i play said danko who recently appeared with exband 
keyboardist garth hudson on mountain stage national public 
radios upbeat and eclectic music show broadcast from charleston 
theres paul butterfield richard manuel levon helm robbie 
robertson ive made some of these tapes available he said 
i have a mailorder company 
i hope people dont think i was retired im too young to 
retire im 45 
danko who lives in woodstock ny where the bands legendary 
house and recording studio big pink was located has concentrated 
on raising three children ages 18 through 21 and playing small clubs 
musics been good to me hopefully ive been good to it 
danko said in an interview before leaving for charleston i felt 
good about it yesterday ill likely feel good about it tomorrow it 
beats working 
danko and hudson who have played together several times over the 
past few months have not had as high a visibility as robertson the 
bands guitarist and helm the groups drummer danko also has 
performed with helm and robertson over the years he also sang on 
robertsons eponymous lp 
robertson released his first solo album last year and had a hit 
helm has carved out a career in films appearing in such movies as 
coal miners daughter and the right stuff 
the band had a brief reunion tour two years ago it was cut short 
by pianist richard manuels suicide danko said not to rule out 
another reunion attempt despite differences between helm and 
robertson both of whom viewed themselves as the groups leader 
never say never danko said i didnt speak to robbie for 
while but it wasnt because of a conflict we just never ran into 
one another 
the band began as rockabilly singer ronnie hawkins backup crew 
in the early 1960s and eventually got the name the hawks from 
touring with him hawkins moved to canada with his drummer helm 
where rockabilly was just beginning but his band soon took flight 
with its own distinctive style a blend of motown folk rock and 
country 
they caught the eye of the folk singer john hammond who brought 
the group to new yorks greenwich village where dylan started 
playing with them the hawks without helm toured with dylan in 
196566 with mickey jones on drums when they returned they rented 
a house in upstate new york got helm to come up from the south and 
wrote some songs they collaborated with dylan on tears of rage 
but saved some tunes for their classic first lp music from big 
pink 
they later recorded such albums as the band and stage 
fright and such songs as the night they drove old dixie down 
the weight up on cripple creek and life is a carnival 
when the band decided to retire they did so with a splash their 
final concert on thanksgiving day in 1976 at winterland called 
the last waltz featured appearances by dylan joni mitchell 
van morrison dr john neil young eric clapton muddy waters and 
emmylou harris and others connected with the bands career it 
resulted in a documentary directed by martin scorcese and a 
legendary live album of the same name 
the band will be installed in the canadian music hall of fame on 
march 12 aside from the arkansasborn helm the others were natives 
of canada 
its a pretty big deal with the canadians danko said

michael oakeshott is 87 years old lives in a 
stone cottage in dorset england and is in the minds of many one 
of the centurys great philosophers 
a bartlett giamatti a teacher of italian english and 
comparative literature was president of yale university and is 
about to become the commissioner of baseball in april 
the two men seemingly so distant in place and circumstance are 
actually close intellectual neighbors by happy coincidence each 
has just published collections of essays describing their views on 
education and the idea of the university 
both have fashioned elegantly written defenses of liberal 
education and the ideal of the university as a place of civil 
conversation a place where as oakeshott puts it a student may 
come to seek his intellectual fortune undistracted by the press 
of time or outside worries 
the voice of liberal learning michael oakeshott on education 
yale university press 20 was edited by timothy fuller head of 
the political science department at colorado college and a friend 
and unabashed admirer of the british philosopher who is professor 
emeritus at the london school of economics 
giamattis a free and ordered space the real world of the 
university ww norton 1995 consists of 23 essays many of 
them originally delivered as speeches at commencements or 
convocations 
the oakeshott collection in particular represents a welcome 
rescue operation an opportunity for americans to discover a major 
british philosopher and teacher of enormous wit charm and modesty 
his essays add a civilizing voice to the current school reform 
debate 
for universities and their supporters the two collections 
couldnt be more timely taken together they represent a forceful 
rebuttal to the closing of the american mind the curmudgeonly 
best seller by university of chicago political scientist allan bloom 
which charged american higher education with selling out its 
intellectual responsibilities to 1960s hooliganism 
the introductions in both collections leave no doubt that 
oakeshott and giamatti are aiming straight at such 
bloomanddoomsayers giamatti for one blames his academic 
colleagues for their silence under siege and urges them to make 
their mission better understood to an increasingly impatient public 
a parent who hungers to know for instance why a childs 
college experience costs so much or worse has seemed so 
unsatisfactory or lacking in connectedness with anything in the past 
will have heard very little from higher education about its issues 
or its problems giamatti writes 
small wonder that allan blooms book is a best seller 
oakeshotts essays are more difficult both intellectually and 
for their use of british idiom the collection includes some of 
oakeshotts leastknown works some of which appeared as much as 40 
years ago only in outofprint journals 
over the years oakeshott has acquired a small but devoted army 
of academtic adherents he is perhaps best known for his definitive 
introduction to thomas hobbes leviathan but his other works 
notably experience and its modes and rationalism in 
politics have become bibles for those who have watched with 
horror the rise of social science and technocracy on us campuses 
at the expense of history and the humanities 
oakeshott describes the university as an idea more than a place 
a community where scholars teachers and pupils engage each other 
in ceaseless skepticism universities are and must remain 
blessedly useless beyond the enjoyment of learning they offer 
participants 
his essays including several in the present collection also 
constitute a powerful defense of political conservatism and have 
thus been quoted regularly by columnists such as william f buckley 
yet oakeshott himself has always been far more goodnatured in 
his views than those who have most often invoked his name still 
practicalminded americans often find a number of his beliefs 
difficult to swallow 
for example he describes the undergraduate as not a child not 
a beginner he has already had his schooling elsewhere and has 
learned enough morally and intellectually to take a chance with 
himself upon the open sea that description might seem a bit 
elitist to some leaving little room in the modern university for 
remediation 
further oakeshott completely and defiantly rejects utilitarian 
justifications for higher education 
the current talk about the mission and the function of a 
university goes rather over my head he writes it assumes that 
there is something called a university a contrivance of some 
sort something you could make another of tomorrow if you had enough 
money of which it is sensible to ask what is it for 
or again a university has a place in the society to which 
it belongs but that place is not the function of contributing to 
some other kind of activity in the society but of being itself and 
not another thing 
the historian of oakeshottian bent for example practices 
history for its own sake not for its supposed lessons or other 
real or imagined uses viewed in purely practical terms oakeshotts 
scholar doesnt give a hoot about whether his activity is of use 
except insofar as it is interesting to him he wants to understand 
for understandings sake 
giamatti as a former university president is far more willing 
to explore scholarships connections with other segments of society 
but his central view of the university as a free and open space 
is remarkably compatible with the oakeshott ideal 
its essence giamatti writes is that giveandtake that 
civil conversation in its innumerable forms when that conversation 
the toandfro of ideas is stymied or foreclosed or frozen when 
the questing for truth is told that it must cease because there is 
only one truth and it is complete then the institution in its 
essence is chilled and its life threatened 
in an essay titled the earthly use of a liberal education 
giamatti confronts an alltooamerican challenge to higher learning 
liberal education is all very well but how does someone make a 
living with this joy of learning and pleasure in the pursuit of 
learning what is the earthly use of all this kind of education 
later on in the practical real world 
these are not trivial questions though the presuppositions 
behind them puzzle me somewhat i am puzzled for instance by the 
unexamined assumption that the real world is always thought to lie 
outside or beyond the realm of education i am puzzled by those who 
think that ideas do not have reality or that knowledge is irrelevant 
to the workings of daily life 
its comforting to know that such thoughts still occupy the man 
who might adjudicate baseballs balk rule come next spring

it may seem like just a day off but next monday 
marks a key ritual for affirming the nations identity by linking up 
to a legend 
with its ancestor worship and retelling of myths washingtons 
birthday serves the cultural purpose of instructing the young and 
reminding grownups about what it is to be an american social 
science experts say 
he was in a way an ideal american and so in celebrating his 
birthday the society celebrates itself it is important for society 
to do that because in this way it reinforces its values said liah 
greenfeld an assistant professor of sociology and social studies at 
harvard university 
american identity for the most part begins with washington 
said david kertzer an anthropology professor at bowdoin college in 
brunswick maine he is the point of reference for what it means 
to be an american 
george washington was born feb 22 1732 but the federal 
observance falls on feb 20 this year some states combine the 
holiday with abraham lincolns feb 12 birthday and call it 
presidents day 
ancestor worship is common in the worlds cultures the experts 
said 
enshrining heroes in myths is a way of really providing our own 
identity by attaching ourselves to a past that is larger than 
life to do that we have to regularly have some ritual observances 
to keep those myths and those heroes alive said kertzer author 
of the recent ritual politics and power 
even if many americans see washingtons birthday as just a chance 
for a threeday weekend it still does its cultural job said martha 
ward professor of anthropology and urban studies at the university 
of new orleans 
a good ritual does not have to have many participants to work 
and they dont have to be enthusiastic she said have you ever 
been to a funeral in which you were secretly cheering 
the important thing is that somebody observes the ritual ward 
said our personal feelings about this are totally immaterial 
these structures existed before we were born and they will continue 
after we are dead 
the holiday is observed more directly in schools where it 
instructs the young said richard peterson sociology professor at 
vanderbilt university 
so what does george washington represent 
theres honesty as in the cherry tree confession and strength 
as in flinging the silver dollar across the potomac river 
he also is portrayed as a loving and caring father of the country 
people need fathers this is a myth about how fathers should 
act said ward adding that the valley forge legend provides a 
classic hero myth 
heroes must go through a time of testing in which they must 
triumph they have to have followers and they have to have a sort of 
vision even if its not shared at the time with other people of 
what theyre doing 
people want to know george washington couldnt get supplies 
from the continental congress and isnt that typical the vision of 
great leaders is not shared by the legislature this is sort of a 
basic american myth about what kind of society do we have and how 
did it come into being 
yet washington is the statesman with the formal wig as well as 
the revolutionary leader said kertzer you dont think of a 
heated personality sort of a rabble rouser like lenin by 
remembering washington as a statesmanrevolutionary we deal with 
the ambiguity of our notion of a nation that was born with 
revolution and yet a nation that is very conservative 
for that purpose he said washingtons perfect

weeks before colombias nevado del ruiz 
volcano erupted melting glaciers and unleashing torrents of mud 
that buried 25000 people geologists drafted a map showing exactly 
where the muck would flow 
the 17700foot volcano started spewing ash sept 11 1985 
scientists gave the map to officials oct 7 and urged them to start 
emergency preparations a newspaper published the map a couple days 
later but survivors of the deadly nov 13 eruption complained they 
werent warned 
there were no evacuations ordered as a result of the map 
which also may not have been understood by residents who saw it 
said us geological survey volcanologist robert tilling that 
shouldnt have happened the whole emergency response network failed 
and as a result thousands died 
time and again geologists have warned of impending disasters or 
urged that steps be taken to reduce the death toll in future 
catastrophes many of these efforts have been ignored because of 
politics economic concerns uncertainty in their predictions 
communications failures and the very human tendency to avoid 
unpleasant realities 
geophysicists more than once warned builders of the high 
seismic activity in northwest armenia the communist party 
newspaper pravda said after the dec 7 earthquake that rocked a part 
of soviet armenia known for centuries for deadly quakes at least 
24000 people died entombed in collapsed adobe huts stone homes 
and inadequately reinforced concreteslab buildings 
its not enough to assess hazards something has to be done 
with this information geological survey scientist c dan miller 
told 200 officials in november when the agency held a geohazards 
88 symposium in menlo park on how science can save lives from 
quakes volcanoes and landslides 
earthquakes landslides tidal waves hurricanes tornadoes 
floods volcanic eruptions and wildfires killed more than 28 
million people worldwide in the past 20 years and caused up to 100 
billion in property damage said a 1987 national research council 
report 
the impacts of natural hazards are increasing and will continue 
to do so unless the world community takes concerted action the 
report said urging a worldwide scientific effort in the 1990s to 
reduce the natural disaster toll 
many nations lack the money or political and social institutions 
capable of acting said julia taft of the office of us foreign 
disaster assistance the greatest human burden from natural 
catastrophes falls on the poor powerless and helpless victims in 
the third world

schoolteachers have scolded children for 
counting with their fingers for decades but some researchers say 
fingercounting can keep good students good and help notsogood 
students become better 
robert siegler and dennis kerkman carnegie mellon university 
psychology professors say their studies show theres nothing wrong 
with fingercounting and teachers probably should show their 
students how to do it correctly 
theyre going to do it anyway every teacher weve talked about 
this with has told us that telling children not to use their fingers 
doesnt work we think children are right to do this because if 
you dont know the answer very well then its better to be right 
than to be wrong siegler said 
good students rely on their memories more than notsogood 
students or perfectionists to solve mathh and reading problems 
according to a study of 80 children at an elementary school in 
suburban monroeville 
when they couldnt remember an answer good students turn to 
backup methods including sounding out words using a dictionary 
counting up from a number to add or down from a number to subtract 
or using their fingers perfectionists used backup methods even when 
they could remember the answer frequently taking longer to solve 
problems as a result siegler and kerkman discovered 
notsogood students gave the most incorrect answers as 
expected but also displayed poor fingercounting skills poor 
students may do poor work because they are bad at backup strategies 
including fingercounting siegler said 
its inefficient to be wrong because you dont learn from it 
if you do a problem and generate a wrong answer in arithmetic 
theres nothing much to be learned all that can happen is that 
youre going to connect that wrong answer to a problem and that 
will harm the process of learning the right ones

nasa scientists have created an animated 
threedimensional movie of mars seen from the view of an astronaut 
flying at 160000 mph through the planets canyons and above its 
volcanoes 
mars the movie lasts about two minutes and its simulated 
flight ranges from three miles to 500 miles above the surface of the 
red planet 
the film takes the viewer on a tour through valles marineris a 
canyon system near the martian equator that stretches farther than 
the distance from los angeles to new york and over tharsis montes 
a series of giant volcanoes more than twice the size of mount 
everest the space agency said 
the movie was made by imageprocessing scientists at jet 
propulsion laboratory which runs americas unmanned space 
exploration program for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
it uses computerenhanced images taken by the viking orbiter 
spacecraft and was designed to give scientists a more complete view 
of earths neighbor and to demonstrate improvements in the labs 
ability to render 3d images 
production required 37 days of uninterrupted computer time or 15 
minutes for each of the films more than 3500 frames

a drug used to combat high blood pressure 
shows promise as an alternative to surgery for treating prostate 
enlargement that afflicts up to 4 million american men a scientist 
says 
the prostate gland surrounds the neck of the bladder and the 
urethra in men and manufactures part of the fluid in semen 
for unknown reasons it gradually enlarges after age 35 most men 
develop symptoms if they live long enough said dr perinchery 
narayan chief of urology at the san francisco veterans 
administration medical center 
two million to 4 million men suffer prostate enlargement to the 
point that the gland squeezes the urethra to impede urine flow from 
the bladder narayan said symptoms range from frequent urination 
and burning sensations to infections urine retention and 
lifethreatening kidney failure 
a preliminary study of 22 men found that four weeks of treatment 
with the drug terazosin provided 30 percent to 50 percent 
improvement in urine flow he said it looks like theres enough 
relief that our patients can avoid surgery whether this is 
permanent remains to be seen 
terazosin is used to treat high blood pressure because it relaxes 
smooth muscle in blood vessels researchers believe it has the same 
effect on smooth muscle in the urinary tract opening the urethra 
despite the enlarged prostate the drug doesnt appear to reduce the 
size of the enlarged gland 
the va and university of california san francisco plan to try 
terazosin on more 50 to 75yearold men with enlarged prostates 
other scientists in the nationwide study are at washington 
university medical center in st louis the university of 
wisconsinmadison hospital tulane university medical center in new 
orleans and the university of california san diego medical

dairy cows are getting prepaid medical 
care under a university of illinois program modeled on health 
maintenance organizations 
in the past veterinarians have been thought of as people who 
provide individual animal medicine or emergency care said howard 
whitmore head of food animal medicine and surgery at the 
universitys college of veterinary medicine but this is a new 
program to broaden the use and role of the veterinarian in the 
animal industry 
for a fixed monthly fee based on herd size the college provides 
all medical services including hospitalization when needed and 
routine biweekly visits university spokesman larry bernard called 
wellcow care 
the program helps owners keep medical costs under control allows 
the veterinarians to influence cattle management and use a variety 
of skills and also provides veterinary students with valuable 
experience 
we study them as they grow and monitor them all the way through 
so we raise these animals efficiently grow them at the right rate 
breed them at the right time calve them at the right time and 
manage for maximum milk production and profit whitmore said 
the veterinarian wants to be viewed as a herd health consultant 
not just a person who delivers emergency care

a month in the absence of any timepieces 
has altered the waking and sleep patterns of an italian woman whos 
spending five months in a cave to simulate the experiences of 
astronauts on long voyages 
stefania follini who entered a 100squarefoot plexiglas cubicle 
in lost cave on jan 13 has been sleeping 10 hours and staying 
awake 20 said maurizio montalbini leader of the usitalian 
research team those cycles likely will lengthen more said 
montalbini who once spent seven months in a cave 
since jan 13 the ancona italy interior designers only 
contact with the outside world has been through a personal computer 
on which she relays results of tests of concentration and brainwave 
activity 
her concentration also seems to have sharpened during her first 
weeks of isolation said montalbini who chose a cave in the united 
states for the tests because he wanted to be close to researchers 
from the national aeronautics and space administration and 
universities 
dr jon defrance of the university of texas medical school in 
houston said the follini experiment will help researchers design a 
study in which astronauts will go on a mock space voyage to mars 
nasa is particularly interested in the italian study because 
previous experiments have suggested prolonged isolation weakens the 
bodys resistance to disease 
defrances specific interest is in attention disorders ms 
follini periodically attaches electrodes to her head for brain 
scans and she takes tests on a computer that gauge her attention 
span 
attention span may be disrupted in a number of different 
ways defrance said each disruption may have its own pattern or 
signature the disruption may be unique it may be able to pinpoint 
what brain pathways are weakened 
we may be able to develop methods for refreshing attention so 
that astronauts can conduct their activities at a high level and 
very competently

perfect she says

after a few seasons of flamboyance french high 
fashion designers are back to basics with softly stated summer and 
spring clothes 
the mood was breezy and feminine in the lines of 20 designers who 
unveiled thousands of original outfits in winter previews for 
audiences that included movie stars and vips 
the dresses each costing 10000 or more are custommade for a 
mere 3000 women yet they set trends for much of the fashion 
industry worldwide 
there were airy chiffons and silks in a myriad of pastels and 
gentle prints bias cuts bodyhugging sheaths and bustiers 
oversized pants and pleats evening wear looked regal with generous 
use of embroidery lace jewels and gold and silver applique 
italian couture king valentino made his paris debut ruffling 
feathers in rome and dazzling the french couture crowd with a 
stunning look that was sweet and sexy even in prim navy and white 
indian themes were dominant valentino decorated his evening 
jackets with gold and silver elephants and per spook and christian 
lacroix served up palettes of subtle beiges and creams marc bohans 
new designs included a sari effect done with feathery light silk 
draped around the bodice and over the shoulder 
yves saintlaurents collection featured slits cut high above the 
thigh deepcut necklines and his signature feminized tailoring 
except for saintlaurent it was adieu to oversized shoulders 
miniskirts and pouffy ball gowns the lines were fluid and graceful 
with wispy chiffons and soft crepes for both daytime and after dark 
hems for the most part skimmed the knee though many designers 
showed the leg with asymmetrical wraparounds and skirts long and 
short slit from hem to waist 
chanel however opted for calflength pleated skirts for daytime 
wear especially good in navy and cream worn under long tunic 
jackets and with twotone flats they had a schoolgirl charm 
reminiscent of the 1930s 
the latest evolution of the classic chanel jacket showed a longer 
cut fastening with a single button just above the waist the newest 
chanel buttons were pearl a major switch was a smooth leather 
purse superseding the chainhandled quilted bag as a chanel status 
symbol 
for most designers it was the year of the dress givenchy took 
the simple shirtwaist classic and dressed it up or down depending 
on the time of day pleated or belted cinched or cravated dresses 
were aimed to appeal to those with conservative tastes who still 
like a touch of glamor 
pant lovers thin and notsothin will be comfortable in spooks 
pajama pants worn under layers of vests for day or under colorful 
embroidered tunics for after dark 
saintlaurent showed an array of menswearstyled trousers for day 
and evening wear cut to just above the ankle they created a long 
slimming line flowing down through high heeled pumps they were 
shown with suit jackets that dipped dramatically or with with 
ultrasheer chiffon blouses 
guy laroche was this years winner of the golden thimble award 
for the most beautiful collection with his classy designs in 
brilliant colors sunbursts of yellow juicy reds and bright oranges 
melting into the palest of springy pastels 
one of his designs was an elegantly simple black sheath that was 
highnecked in the front but backless to the waist and circled by 
whiteedged ruffling 
lacroix abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections 
and came up with feminine pastels draping chiffon in flowing 
pantskirts and embroidered and bejeweled raw silk he used lace and 
gathered organza for a dreamy cloudlike effect 
lacroixs palette was strong with sandy beiges evoking the 
desert mixing melon and pistachio pastels poppy reds and persian 
blue black white and navy 
in most of the collections curves and busts were emphasized with 
drapery belts and buttons the exception was lacroix who covered 
them with trapeze and triangular shapes 
torrente maintained parisian chic with daytime dresses of polka 
dot pastels with kick pleats topped with bows striking tiered 
dresses and widebrimmed hats for after dark there were draped 
chiffons and crepes held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or 
bows 
hanae mori also toasted femininity with her floorlength yellow 
draped sheath set off by a line of ruffles running from shoulder to 
toe 
nina ricci produced a large collection of simple but beautiful 
clothes in rich fabrics for all times of day there were wide soft 
pants pleated and swirling skirts and cinched waists creating a 
nostalgic prettiness 
for after hours ricci served up an understated but elegant long 
sleeveless evening gown in peach crepe satin with pleated bodice and 
back

emanuel ungaro has presented a sumptuous collection 
for spring and summer softening his structured look in defiance of 
the sweet and pretty trend dominating french haute couture 
ungaro all but ignored pleats and wide breezy pants and 
minimized the draping he has used lavishly in earlier shows he 
showed welldefined lines bold colors and lots of glitter 
ungaro also had a bold approach to the flowers that have sprung 
up everywhere for spring and summer 
mixing colors generously he played dramatic floral prints on 
jackets and tops against small flower prints on the dresses or pants 
underneath in one outfit a black checked jacket was paired with a 
floralprint dress 
soft notes included petticoats under flouncy skirts and cinched 
waists and lots of silky fabric 
there were a few examples of what is becoming the classic soft 
look for summer including a gauzy white floorlength dress with 
halter top and draped bodice set off with a gold medallion and gold 
lame at the midriff 
jackets long or short but all with tightly cinched waists often 
were ruffled at the shouldertop for a sweptup wing effect 
reminiscent of royalty the softness came when the jacket was 
removed to reveal a pretty strapless flowery dress 
ungaro used gold and silver extensively in brocade or weaved 
into the fabric 
pants were soft and most were tailored with thin legs and worn 
under jackets or in pants suits 
hemlines were above the knee but jacket lengths varied from just 
below the waist to dress length and beyond

barbara bushs fashion style is the perfect 
match for a nononsense yankee patrician who favors the quiet 
elegance of a strand of pearls over eyepopping rhinestones and 
sequins 
im not going to turn into a glamorous princess mrs bush 
remarked last summer and after eight years of nancy reagans 
highgloss look conservative new york fashion designers are 
breathing a sigh of relief 
she brings a new england classic tradition to the white house 
instead of hollywood glitz said gerald brenner a vice president 
of adele simpsons salon on seventh avenue where mrs bush has 
shopped for years 
she likes simple uncluttered clothes brenner said in a 
telephone interview i think shes sensational theres nothing 
phony about her shes a very nice downtoearth lady who happens 
to be very bright she always looks good 
canadianborn couturier arnold scaasi who designed most of mrs 
bushs wardrobe for inauguration week says the new first lady 
dresses to please herself 
i dont think shes ever going to follow the fad scaasi said 
in a telephone interview from new york shes going to wear what 
looks well on her what suits her 
the designers say mrs bush prefers classical traditional 
clothing shirtwaist dresses threepiece suits and the like and 
likes all bright colors especially blue her dresses cover the 
knee no matter whether hemlines are rising or falling 
her trademark is a triple strand of pearls theyre fake and 
shell be the first to tell you that said brenner 
i think she has very good taste said scaasi she knows 
very much what she likes and what she doesnt like she feels good 
about herself shes a very warm very open and very intelligent 
woman with a great sense of humor she approaches dressing that way 
too 
the first ladys press secretary anna perez said mrs bush 
declined to discuss her fashion preferences with a reporter 
she likes to look attractive like most other women but its 
not a consuming passion in her life ms perez said shed 
rather talk about other things 
bill blass another of the first ladys favorite designers 
agrees 
i dont think clothes will be her preoccupation he said 
recently blass designed the simple tealblue wool coat and 
collarless creamcolored wool dress that mrs bush wore to her 
husbands swearingin as president 
mrs bush 63 wears a size 12 and laughingly calls herself a 
fullfigured woman she wears the lightest of makeup eats 
heartily laughs boisterously and enjoys a good joke often at her 
own expense 
what you see with me is what you get she says 
she recently told reporters that her style is getting some public 
applause 
my mail tells me a lot of fat whitehaired wrinkled ladies 
are tickled pink she said theyre very sweet i think it makes 
them feel better about themselves i mean look at me if i can be 
a success so can they 
she poked fun at her appearance again during a preinaugural 
salute to the first lady at the kennedy center 
speaking of glamor i want you to look at me very carefully 
she told her audience as she opened the jacket of her 
scaasidesigned blue suit 
please notice the hair the makeup designer clothes she 
said i want you to watch me all week and remember you may never 
see it again

barbara bush may be deliberately unfashion conscious but among 
women in her age group thats fashionable 
fashion experts say that women in the 3565 age range are 
independent in choosing their clothing and they have a lot of 
economic clout to exercise that independence quality and classic 
styles are the common denominators in otherwise diverse choices 
mrs bush isnt necessarily a trend setter but she is an 
example of what the trend is now says lucille klein womens 
fashion director at the jc penney department stores this kind 
of woman feels secure and selfconfident she knows shes arrived 
professionally or otherwise shes not struggling not striving to 
impress people 
barbara mackoff a seattlebased psychologist agrees success in 
business and community life have relaxed the hold of the dress for 
success dictum it was professional success achievement and the 
security and confidence that follow that did it smart women 
have stopped trying to hide their own distinctive attributes 
their attitudes toward fashion are much like those of mrs bush 
mrs klein says the typical american woman is not hung up on 
fashion what she wants is to look nice to look pretty and she 
wants to be comfortable with the way she looks 
she says that these older women are among the biggest customers 
in the stores these days and what theyre buying reflects their 
concern with details quality and classic styles that can be worn 
for years were experiencing a return to taste she says 
the majority are not looking for oneyear fixes she adds 
the classics include suits but not what i call the wall street 
banker suits of a few years ago the new ones are beautifully cut 
with details like buttons and linings of good quality 
other favorites are updated shirtwaist dresses with attention to 
detail cut and colors they also like separates in street and 
sportswear that center around basic jackets 
they like their jewelry to look like the real thing what is 
real or at least what looks real mrs klein says the pieces 
are not necessarily smaller but they are more refined

that the small woman wants more than revised versions of her 
taller sisters clothes is attested by her open checkbook at cash 
registers 
the petite lines whether dresses suits or sportswear has 
outpaced all other categories of readytowear in sales industry 
figures for a sixyear period show a growth rate of almost twice for 
that for the overall misses and sportswear lines 
despite estimates that nearly 55 percent of all adult us women 
are 5feet3 or under there was a time was the smaller woman was 
left with a choice of paying for alterations or just rolling up her 
sleeves 
that has changed now nearly all major apparel manufacturers 
have petite lines and most large stores have departments or 
boutiques devoted to the small woman 
typically petitesize styling differs from regular misses sizes 
in shorter sleeves hems and waist lengths details are to scale 
too there will be one or two buttons on a suit jacket instead of 
two or three and the shoulder pads will be lighter and less bulky 
little girl touches such as ruffles bows and puffy sleeves 
are avoided 
the petite woman is looking for excellent design and quality 
and she wants it in the proportion and fit that is right for her 
said bernard olsoff president of frederick atkins inc a 
merchandising and marketing firm that has been tracking sales for 
about 30 department store chains he said there has been a 143 
percent compounded growth rate over six years for petite dresses and 
350 percent for petite sportswear this contrasts with 77 percent 
and 82 percent in those categories of misses sizes 
when youre on the small side you look for tailored wellmade 
fashions that dont overwhelm you said gretchen elizabeth 
carlson the current miss america i like clothing that fits well 
at the waist such as shorter jackets and belted styles 
ms carlson who stands 5feet3 is celebrity representative

here are some shopping pointers to keep in mind if youre 
5feet4 or less and prefer not to dress like someones little girl 
study your proportions if you have a long torso and short legs 
choose long skirts and shoes with heels if you have a short torso 
and long legs then pick something like a long tunic to make the 
waist appear longer the idea is to visually soften and blend the 
proportions 
a key fitting point is at the shoulders collars and necklines 
shouldnt bunch up alterations are simpler for other parts of the 
garment if you start with a proportional shoulder fit 
choose softer versions of classically tailored suits the details 
should be scaled down with narrowed lapels and onebutton closures 
jackets cut at hipbone length will look most natural with a smaller 
frame 
shoulder pads make the waist look smaller by extending the line 
of the shoulders but make sure theyre not too big and bulky 
horizontal lines will make you look chunky so avoid square 
necklines or horizontal stripes or seams by contrast verticals 
vnecks vertical stripes and seams will smooth and narrow your 
lines 
let color help too monochromatic colors will help you maintain 
an unbroken visual line you could match hosiery and pumps to solid 
colors in pants or skirts 
keep your accessories in proportion pass up wide belts and 
overlarge handbags use your briefcase to transport extra items 
shoes with medium heels will look best avoid the extremes of 
stilletos or flats 
avoid fussy or cute touches like peter pan collars puffed 
sleeves big bows or ruffles or extravagant costume jewelry 
stand up and be confident good posture and selfassurance has a 
lot to do with how well you look in your clothes 
the tips come from the crafted with pride in usa council 
inc which represents about 400 manufacturers

the sun may be great for tomatoes but it could be tough on your 
face 
even the most skilled makeup job cant rescue a complexion dulled 
and damaged by overexposure 
anyone who spends a good deal of time outdoors whether in 
recreation or work should be vigilant the american cancer society 
says that no one is really free from risk most at risk are 
fairskinned people who burn easily but anyone can be affected 
especially during warm weather months making under is as 
important as making up for both beauty and safety it will help you 
look cool fashionable and healthy 
making under can mean two things use protective sunscreens and 
lubricants before applying foundation and apply your makeup with a 
light hand choosing soft colors and textures 
the type of sunscreen you use depends on your preference but you 
may find a moisturizerbased cream most convenient in making up 
most of these products contain paba paraaminobenzoic acid and are 
labeled with spf sun protection formula ratings choose one that 
has a rating of 15 spf or higher dont forget to use a sunscreen on 
your arms legs neck or any other skin area bared during the 
summer especially if youre outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm 
from a fashion point of view the nomakeup look is the best 
makeup this seasons cosmetics lines feature light colors and 
textures designed to blend with the fluid feminine clothing women 
are finding in stores 
matte foundations in sheer delicate shades ranging from 
pinktinged pastels to soft tawnies have been designed to play up 
rather than hide natural coloring unless your skin is very dry 
finish the base with a light dusting of translucent powder 
choose similar light shades for eyes single eyeshadow colors can 
be found in muted heather and floral shades finish with a light 
brushing of blush colors in soft matte colors coupled with frosted 
highlight shades blended at the tops of your cheekbones compacts 
with both base and highlight blushes can be found to make this 
combination easy 
even lip colors come muted and in matte finishes frosted 
pearlized colors can be added for evening wear or can be used alone 
for a fresh natural effect during the day

times and designs have changed since dorothy parker warned 
that men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses 
the optical manufacturers association says there were 63 million 
pair of eyeglasses sold in the united states in 1987 
nowadays the hotter the sunglasses the cooler the look 
clothes designer giorgio armani for example now markets some 40 
models of mens and womens prescription eyewear and sunglasses 
under the giorgio armani occhiali label 
his glasses compete with those carrying the names of other 
clothes designers halston givenchy ralph lauren anne klein and 
perry ellis as well as celebrities from actress sophia loren to 
model cheryl tiegs 
though fashion and design are important eye protection should 
also be considered when shopping for sunglasses says the american 
optometric association 
when buying sunglasses the association says make sure theyre 
impactresistant even industrial strength for the active wearer 
dark lenses are recommended by the group which says sunglasses 
should screen out 75 to 90 percent of the sunlight if the eyes can 
be seen clearly through the lenses theyre probably not dark enough 
the eyeglass frames should be large enough to keep sunlight from 
reaching the eyes but the temple pieces should not block side 
vision the association advises

it is possible that the madras shirt or silk

threedimensional graphics processor reports a computer industry 
journal 
although 3d computer workstations are usually used for molecular 
modeling seismic analysis and other scientific projects notes mis 
week several clothing manufacturers in the united states and europe 
have adopted computeraided workstations for their designers 
the workstations permit designers to scan fabrics patterns and 
models and then integrate the three in myriad combinations to 
eliminate much of the guesswork inherent in clothing design the 
publication explains 
it adds that additional software in tandem with the workstation 
permits the designer to manipulate existing fabrics or simulate 
woven fabrics to create a new texture or pattern

when the temperature drops in this 
southwest michigan town townsfolk see red red flannel that is 
this is the home of those 1880sstyle fireenginered long johns 
with the button drop seats as well as red flannel granny gowns with 
matching dust caps and hardy red flannel lumberjack shirts 
and residents arent shy about their colorful claim to fame 
signs along the highway leading to this former logging town 
population 2615 proclaim cedar springs red flannel capital of 
the world 
red plywood long johns hang from the lampposts on main street 
theres the red flannel insurance center the red flannel car wash 
and at the neighborhood tavern you can get a red flannel cocktail 
vodka and cranberry juice up until a few weeks ago you could play 
a game of billiards there on a red flanneltopped pool table 
in a warehouse a few blocks away seamstresses piece together 
bolts of red flannel and the polyestercotton knit blend of which 
the long johns are made 
we think were selling warmth across the board not just the 
warmth of the garments but the warmth of the company of the town 
says charles foley president of the red flannel factory 
red flannel is to this towns heritage what automobiles are to 
detroit 
in school the kids do cutouts of red flannels said vice 
president mike huckleberry a cedar springs native almost 
everyone in town feels a part of the red flannel factory 
it began in 1936 when during a brutal blizzard a new york 
feature writer wrote a piece complaining that there were no red 
flannels to be found 
the cedar springs newspaper responded with a tart editorial 
just because saks fifth avenue or bergdorf goodman do not carry 
red flannels it doesnt follow that no one in the country does 
weve got red flannels in cedar springs 
the associated press ran the newspapers reply on its wire and 
in a few days orders began pouring in from around the country to 
cedar springs merchants ironically those merchants were getting 
their red flannels at the time from a connecticut company 
when the connecticut manufacturer discontinued the items a cedar 
springs housewife began making red flannels in her home that was in 
1949 three years later the red flannel factory was established by 
sally wall who converted a barn to meet the growing demand 
when wall retired in 1971 a group of about 10 area residents 
formed a corporation in 1986 a grand rapids holding company led by 
foley acquired a majority interest in the company with plans to 
expand it nationally on a wholesale basis 
since then foley said company sales have tripled and the number 
of employees has doubled he wont reveal sales but says the 
company brings in several million dollars a year about 100 
employees work for the company during peak production periods 
usually between june and the day before christmas foley hopes there 
will be enough work soon to keep the plant running at capacity 
yearround 
long johns are the factorys biggest seller with about 20000 
pairs sold each year this year the company is branching out with a 
line of childrens active wear and will introduce a redbased plaid 
among other items produced are night shirts robes childrens 
sleepers and pajamas most of which are available in white 
naturalfiber muslin as well as the famous scarlet long johns 
retail from 19 for childrens sizes to 39 for adults 
among the celebrities with the companys long johns in their 
closets are ronald reagan gerald ford sammy davis jr kenny 
rogers and andy williams huckleberry says 
while some large department stores carry the companys items 
foley is targeting country stores lingerie shops college 
bookstores and tourist spots in addition to the factorys mailorder 
business 
the common thread woven through the towns fabric is celebrated 
each october with the red flannel festival complete with a red 
flannel queen the 50th annual event this year will make it among 
the oldest in michigan 
anyone failing to wear red during the festival is arrested by 
police and has to make a donation to charity to get out of jail 
doug stein owner of der bier stein tavern doesnt have to 
worry he wears a pair of long johns to work every day 
we had to get air conditioning in here just because of that 
he said with a chuckle 
foley hopes george bushs election to the presidency of a 
kinder gentler nation will help sales 
its like buying tradition a piece of americana its like 
buying an american flag foley said stopping to reflect on his 
last words maybe thats pushing it

the number of working oil and gas rigs continued 
its recent decline plunging by 34 to total 746 this week baker 
hughes inc reported monday 
this weeks drop was largely caused by decreases in oklahoma 
which lost 17 rigs and louisiana which lost nine rigs 
a year ago the count totaled 968 last week the count dropped 
by 17 to total 780 
two weeks ago the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797 
while plummeting by 51 the week before in the three weeks before 
that the count declined twice by 32 and once by 36 all following a 
twoweek increase of 25 rigs 
baker hughes economist ike kerridge said the count usually drops 
off during late december through late march or early april 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among other major oil producing states wyoming lost four rigs 
texas lost two and kansas and north dakota were each down by one 
california and michigan each gained four rigs and new mexico got 
three more colorado and ohio each got one more rig

texas air chairman frank lorenzo has told eastern 
airlines officials to allow copies of the feb 27 fortune magazine 
on the airlines fleet even though that issue carries a 
lessthanflattering profile of lorenzo eastern officials said 
today 
the airline had ordered the biweekly business magazine pulled 
from its fleet of more than 200 aircraft because it contains a cover 
story calling lorenzo chairman of easterns parent company one of 
americas toughest bosses 
lorenzo personally instructed that fortune be put back on the 
planes said eastern spokesman robin matell he knew nothing 
about the original decision to remove it he said we had no business 
taking it off in the first place lorenzo is saying were not in the 
business of censorship 
the earlier order had come from middle managers in easterns 
aircraft services support department matell said 
in a brief directive to aircraft service managers around the 
country eastern had said its imperative that the current issue 
of fortune magazine be removed immediately from all eastern aircraft 
dispose of all copies locally said the directive have a 
member of management audit all aircraft to ensure compliance report 
accomplishment by tail number to miami 
lorenzos picture appears on the issues cover a caption states 
that lorenzo likes managers to work 14 hours a day six days a 
week 
the brief profile calls lorenzo a loose cannon and quotes 
past and present executives of houstonbased texas air as saying 
lorenzo is a highly impulsive manager 
he is a visionary a dealmaker a union buster and a 
showboater says the profile part of a larger article on other 
tough corporate chieftans 
the story also talks of intrigue and backbiting among texas airs 
executives 
art kent a texas air spokesman in houston concurred that 
lorenzo did not issue the directive 
if frank had made such an order i would know about it and he 
has not kent said sunday 
continental airlines doesnt normally stock the magazine on its 
flights he said 
matell said eastern which faces a march 4 strike threat by the 
international association of machinists had nothing to gain by 
leaving the magazine on its planes 
the profile of texas airs chairman was unflattering and 
would be viewed in that vein by our passengers matell told the 
miami herald earlier considering the current environment we 
decided to remove the issue

the same people who eagerly seek rebates of a few 
hundred dollars on newcar purchases or wait in line at appliance 
store sales could be tossing away tens of thousands of dollars on 
their ira accounts 
it is being done every day casually and indifferently by 
thousands of individuals who 1 fail to shop for the best rates 
which now vary widely and 2 fail to comprehend the impact of 
compounding over extended time periods 
adding to the waste and confusion is institutional ignorance of 
their own products according to joe a mintz an analyst and critic 
of insurance and financial practices 
in a check of 13 institutions in the first week of february he 
found only a couple that could even estimate the total a certain 
deposit amount would become over a specific time period three 
branches of the same bank gave different figures 
after 34 years of dealing with the sale of insurance annuities 
certificates of deposit medicare retirement plans and the like 
the softspoken intense mintz believes consumers need factual 
pointofsale information 
in pursuit of his goal he has testified before committees of 
congress offered his somewhat testy and often unwelcome views at 
insurance industry meetings and aided government agencies in studies 
of iras and insurance 
he publishes the nroca acorn backwards newsletter 
department c nroca press box 12066 dallas texas 75225 it seeks 
to give one or two ideas a year to retirees and preretirees that 
will be worth hundreds if not multithousands of dollars 
nrocas most recent offering at 875 a copy is a consumers 
guide to compound interest providing 1600 yields arranged to 
allow even financially unsophisticated individuals to analyze iras 
insurance cds and savings 
though a thorn to financial and insurance institutions mintz 
remains in the mainstream if barely his views are heard if not 
welcomed he authored a study course presented by the american 
institute of cpas he is on the editorial board of a professional 
financiallyoriented national magazine 
working with telephone and computer from his home mintz found 
published certificate of deposit yields ranging from 833 percent to 
98 percent at institutions throughout the country during the first 
week of february 
that difference in yields could mean that a 10000 investment 
after 30 years might be worth 110271 or 165223 it would mean 
that a 2000 deposit each year for 30 years could be worth 260800 
or 347826 
to his dismay he found that while financial institutions quote 
precise interest rates almost none can state accurately how much a 
deposit will total over a specific time period that is what the 
annual yield would be 
interest rates and yields differ mainly because of compounding 
which can be daily monthly quarterly semiannually or annually 
the differences seem small but time magnifies them compounding 
therefore can be magic or tragic magic if you utilize it tragic 
if you dont 
at an interest rate of 10 percent compounded annually for 
example 10000 becomes 67275 in 20 years if compounded daily 
the 10 percent rate totals 75962 a yield of 1067 percent a year 
mintz bases his conclusion that institutions cannot calculate 
yields on the responses to his request for information on the 
placement with them of 87000 in a rollover ira for three or five 
years 
his question how much in cash can i withdraw without penalty 
at the end of the period also give me the rate and yield 
it was then he says that three branches of one bank gave 
answers ranging from 118000 to 133000 for the fiveyear period 
and a bank that advertised quarterly compounding he says based 
calculations on 360 rather than 365 days

mexicos foreign reserves plummeted by 50 
percent to around 8 billion last year one of the most severe costs 
of an otherwise successful antiinflation program according to a 
private think tank 
investor disbelief that the government would maintain the 
programs freeze on the pesodollar exchange rate was a leading 
cause of capital flight the center for private sector economic 
studies said in a review of the mexican antiinflation program 
investors fearing a sudden peso devaluation made advance 
purchases of capital goods from abroad sustaining economic activity 
and increasing imports of items such as machinery despite the 
governments efforts to slow it the report said 
however some 700 million in capital returned to mexico in 
january even after the government instituted a gradual peso 
devaluation the central bank announced last week 
the centers report based on government and central bank data 
was released over the weekend 
the government did surpass its chief economic policy goal last 
year by halving an inflation rate that reached a record 1592 
percent in 1987 consumer prices rose by 517 percent in 1988 under 
the program that froze the dollarpeso exchange rate the minimum 
wage and prices for governmentregulated goods and services 
but despite its initial success in curbing inflation the 
government failed to overcome general skepticism towards the 
programs viability said the centers report 
the result was a wave of speculation by nervous investors 
that prompted capital flight it said 
prepayments of private sector foreign debts and depressed export 
revenues from oil also contributed to the run on reserves it said 
in addition the programs wage and price freezes cut workers 
real purchasing power by 15 percent last year and created price 
distortions for regulated goods and services the center said 
shortages developed for some basics including meats milk and 
certain vegetables as producers withheld their product from the 
market to protest official prices they considered too low 
the plunge in reserves prompted president carlos salinas de 
gortari to adopt the gradual currency devaluation jan 1 that is 
averaging one peso per day 
the private sector financed imports through nonoil export 
revenue and with credits from outside the nationalized banking 
system representing 90 percent of total mexican imports capital 
goods imports between january and october 1988 surged by 554 
percent over the same period in 1987 
consequently the economy actually registered 05 percent growth 
in 1988 although the hopedfor recessiononly began to develop 
towards the end of the year the report said

growing regions of argentina and brazil

more than a dozen years after rising from the 
ashes of six bankrupt northeast railroads conrail must replace its 
top executive at a time when it had just made a transition aimed at 
continuity 
richard d sanborn 52 died sunday of an apparent heart attack 
just six weeks after becoming chairman and chief executive officer 
of the philadelphiabased freight carrier 
speculation by some analysts focused monday on h william brown 
senior vice president for finance and charles n marshall senior 
vice president for marketing and sales as two candidates to take 
sanborns place 
others suggested l stanley crane 73 who retired as chairman 
and ceo on jan 1 could return for an interim period while a search 
was made for someone from outside the company 
conrail said it would make no announcement before a board of 
directors meeting wednesday 
sanborn a 27year railroad veteran joined conrail last march as 
president and chief operating officer 
tony hatch an analyst with painewebber inc said he considered 
it likely that crane would be asked to return on a temporary basis 
crane who led the company for eight years is credited with 
setting the direction that made conrail profitable and enabled it to 
be returned to the private sector through a public stock offering in 
march 1987 
despite sanborns death analysts said the railroads future 
appears bright 
there is no single person who is indispensible to a company 
said an analyst who asked not to be identified this is not a 
major disaster for conrail though its certainly tough in the short 
run 
conrail was formed by congress in 1976 to reorganize six bankrupt 
northeast railroads the penn central erie lackawanna reading 
central of new jersey lehigh valley and lehigh amp hudson river 
after 11 years of government ownership conrail was sold march 26 
1987 for 16 billion in the largest public stock offering in us 
history 
conrail has been trying to build its traffic in such areas as 
automobile shipping after concentrating on rebuilding track gaining 
clearance for doublestacked container cars and other equipment 
needs 
under sanborn conrail had been expected to try to expand into 
such areas as hauling waste and already is carrying compacted refuse 
from northern new jersey and the new york city area to eastern ohio 
company executives said recently they might seek to acquire some 
smaller rail lines including the monongahela and the pittsburgh and 
lake erie railroads

american consumers accustomed to finding 
made in japan stamped on cameras and radios increasingly can 
find those words on packages of a more intimate product condoms 
okamoto industries inc japans leading condom maker with a 63 
percent market share last year launched a us subsidiary and plans 
to have its product on store shelves in the northeast in a couple of 
months 
other japanese companies also have entered the us market in 
recent years 
while some industry analysts say high consumer brand loyalty 
makes it difficult for the japanese to grab market share hisayuki 
naito general manager of okamoto usa inc predicts okamoto will 
capture 10 percent of the american condom market in two years and up 
to 25 percent within seven 
the japanese philosphy is that once we have committed 
ourselves we will do it said naito who sees a vast untapped 
market in america because of health concerns about aids and the 
birth control pill 
us retail condom sales increased 62 percent to 292 million 
between 1985 and 1987 according to salomon brothers inc 
but only 16 percent of americans use condoms as the primary form 
of birth control compared with 76 percent in japan where the birth 
control pill is illegal analysts say 
in this country the condom is a very hidden product naito 
said during a recent interview a display rack with packages of 
okamotos american competitors decorates one wall of a conference 
room at the company headquarters 
this is more healthy no question about it naiko said 
unfurling a pink crown condom one of four okamoto brands to be 
marketed in the united states 
the company plans a 2 million ad campaign stressing the quality 
of its condoms including print ads in vogue playboy and the 
advocate a magazine aimed at gays 
one ad features a photo of a condom stretched by two fingers a 
frankness that okamoto hopes will help americans overcome their 
shyness about the product naito said 
the other okamoto lines are harmony regal and beyond which is 
packaged in a plastic compact case and is aimed at women who 
account for 25 to 40 percent of all us condom purchasers 
okamoto is an 800 millionayear company that also sells tires 
distributes reebok keds and rockport shoes in japan and makes the 
plastic interiors for honda general motors and ford cars 
condoms which okamoto also sells in europe and canada account 
for about 10 percent of the companys business 
okamoto has six employees in stratford and marketing deals with 
eight independent wholesalers it will continue shipping condoms 
from japan but may eventually build a us plant naito said 
other japanese companies long have been trying to crack the us 
market 
fugi latex co the no 2 japanese condom maker and nisshoiwa 
corp of america a japanese trading company own 60 percent of 
safetex corp of lyndhurst nj under a joint venture begun in 
1987 fuji has made condoms in the united states since buying the 
newark plant of circle rubber co about 15 years ago which it since 
has closed 
sagami rubber industries incs kimono condom has been imported 
by mayer laboratories inc of oakland calif since april 1987 
industry analysts warn that the japanese may have difficulty in 
the us condom market because americans remain somewhat embarrassed 
by the subject they therefore are likely to stay with brands they 
recognize and can grab quickly from store shelves 
new yorkbased carterwallace inc maker of the trojans brand of 
condoms now controls about 53 percent of the market schmid 
laboratories inc based in little falls nj controls about 27 
percent of the market with such brands as ramses sheik and excita 
salomon brothers predicts condom sales will continue growing at 
15 percent annually in the foreseeable future but some observers 
predict growth will slow with the calming of fears about 
heterosexual transmission of aids

european community countries disagreed 
monday on a proposed witholding tax of 15 percent on interest income 
from bonds and bank savings and sent the plan to a highlevel study 
group 
at a meeting of the eec economics and finance ministers britain 
and luxembourg completely opposed the commissions proposal while 
west germany sought a reduction in toward the level of its own tax 
of 10 percent 
of the other member states france italy spain denmark 
portugal ireland and belgium broadly supported the proposal 
the proposal was made last week by the european commission in an 
effort to harmonize the widely different taxes on interest income in 
the 12 member states from zero in luxembourg to 35 percent in 
ireland 
because eec laws on taxation need to be approved unanimously 
diplomats said that it was difficult to see how the proposals could 
be adopted unless radical changes were made 
luxembourgs finance minister jacques poos said luxembourg would 
block the commissions plan luxembourg which has banking secrecy 
laws and is considered the eecs tax haven fears its economy will 
suffer if a tax is imposed 
the highlevel study group is expected to complete its report in 
four to six weeks the ministers will discuss its conclusions at 
their regular monthly meeting in april the group is composed of the 
chief tax authorities of the twelve eec member states

prosecutors on monday made the first arrests 
directly involving the stock transactions that have scandalized the 
government of prime minister noboru takeshita 
japanese waited to see what prosecutors would do next since 
dozens of politicians businessmen and journalists were among those 
who bought bargainpriced stock unavailable to the public and then 
profited handsomely when public sales began and prices soared 
among the four arrested was hiromasa ezoe founder and former 
chairman of recruit co the information conglomerate at the center 
of the scandal 
ezoe and hiroshi kobayashi vice president of first finance a 
recruit subsidiary that financed the stock sales were held on 
suspicion of offering bribes in return for favors related to 
recruits business activities 
also arrested were ei shikiba and hisahiko hasegawa former 
directors of nippon telegraph and telephone japans largest 
company for altegedly receiving bribes from recruit in tnypcorm of 
bargain shares both have said they did not provide any favors for 
recruit 
recruit and ntt said in statements that they regretted the 
prosecutors actions 
takeshita told reporters monday he hoped for a full investigation 
into the scandal but refused to comment further a takeshita aide 
and relative have been linked to the stock purchases 
the japan socialist party credited public disgust with the 
scandal for its victory in a special parliamentary election sunday 
and it demanded that takeshita resign or call new general elections 
replying in parliament takeshita dismissed the demands he said 
he humbly accepted the election results and that his governing 
liberal democratic party will work for reforms to restore public 
trust in politics 
in making the arrests prosecutors said the supreme court ruled 
in july that the sale of stock whose price was sure to rise and 
which could not be easily purchased by the general public amounted 
to bribery 
japanese law provides for up to five years in prison for 
receivers of bribes and up to three years for those who offer 
bribes 
the scandal surfaced last summer raising questions of ethics and 
money links between business and politicians 
the only previous arrest had been of a recruit official accused 
of trying to bribe an opposition member of parliament to softpedal 
an investigation into the affair 
takeshita formed a new cabinet last december to put the scandal 
behind him but two ministers soon were forced to resign after it 
was disclosed they had continued receiving political donations from 
recruit 
in all three cabinet ministers and more than a dozen politicians 
and businessmen have resigned because of the scandal 
in sundays special election the japan socialist party won the 
upper house seat of a liberal democrat who died in december the 
election in fukuoka in southern japan was the first for a national 
office since the scandal surfaced 
takako doi the socialists chairwoman said in parliament monday 
that takeshita should resign 
either the entire cabinet must resign or the prime minister 
must dissolve parliament so the people can express their will ms 
doi said 
a dissolution of parliament would force elections in the powerful 
lower house where the liberal democrats have more than 300 of the 
512 seats 
takeshita told japanese reporters the special election was a 
complete defeat i never anticipated it 
i will stake everything on political reform he told 
parliament on monday 
an election is scheduled in july for half the seats in 
parliaments upper house a severe setback then could threaten 
takeshitas chances to win another twoyear term as party leader and 
prime minister in october 
the tokyo stock exchanges leading index fell monday for the 
first time in eight sessions market analysts blamed the governing 
partys defeat in the special election and eroding confidence in the 
takeshita administration

champion products inc a maker of 
athletic and leisure clothing successfully fought off a hostile 
takeover and agreed monday to be sold to sara lee corp of chicago 
for 3209 million 
the announcement that the food and apparel giant would buy 
champion for 77 a share followed champions request for bids to 
fend off a takeover by a new york investment group 
our shareholders are receiving full value and this transaction 
is the best possible outcome for our employees customers and the 
communities in which we operate champion president roger holland 
said 
champion wellknown in college bookstores around the country for 
sweatshirts and tshirts had been a takeover target of the 
investment group walsh greenwood amp co 
acting through phonicam inc a company created to attempt the 
takeover the investment group had offered 51 a share 55 a share 
and last month upped its offer to 61 a share 
i think the 61 figure was getting into an area that 
shareholders may have started thinking they were getting fair value 
and thats why management went looking for buyers said patricia 
ryan an analyst for rayomnd james amp associates a st petersburg 
flabased borkerage firm 
sara lee officials said they would begin a tender offer this week 
for the 416 million outstanding shares of fully diluted champion 
stock and various convertible stock options 
champion stock climbed 12125 to close at 7575 in american 
stock exchange trading monday 
after the deal was announced a spokesman for phonicam said the 
company couldnt justify spending that much money for champion 
ryan said she thought the sale to sara lee might help champion 
continue its fastpaced growth because the company might receive 
more capital investment from its new parent 
champion has enjoyed 14 straight quarters of increased sales and 
profits and last year boosted earnings 114 percent to 1489 
million or 434 a share on sales of 219 million 
although the company is best known for uniforms and athletic 
clothes much of champions recent growth has come by adding leisure 
wear and branching out into department and specialty stores 
sara lee one of the nations 50 largest companies sells 
packaged food and various consumer products and operates a food 
service business the company reported 104 billion in sales in its 
last fiscal year 
one of our missions is to grow all of our businesses and 
strategic acquisition is one way of doing that sara lee spokesman 
ron culp said this was just one of those good opportunities that 
come along 
culp said the company had not been interested in buying champion 
until it was asked to make a bid for the suburban rochesterbased 
firm 
champion will join sara lees other apparel companies including 
hanes underwear leggs hosiery isotoner gloves and bali bras

michigan in 1991

production of at least one new truck line in its flint mich 
plant which has about 3800 workers to compensate for the switch to 
a plant in janesville 
gm said production of its chevrolet suburban and blazer trucks 
and the gmc jimmy utility vehicles would be moved from flint to 
janesville in 1991 for the 1992 model year 
gov tommy g thompson announced the move in milwaukee 
the janesville plant which employs about 5700 people currently 
produces the buick skylark and the chevrolet cavalier compact 
models gm said those lines would be phased out to make room for the 
new truck lines 
klipstine said decisions on employment production speeds and the 
length of retooling time for both plants is unknown it is likely 
that both plants will be shut down to refit machines to make the new 
products

it would be announced

barbie and gi joe had birthday parties this 
week mr game show couldnt make it 
he died said walter kirchberger a toy company analyst 
weep not though for mr show of the estimated 5000 games and 
toys being introduced at the toy industrys annual comingout party 
in manhattan this week the vast majority will join him in that big 
toybox in the sky 
youll see a lot of products at the toy fair this week that you 
wont see next year said harold vogel another industry analyst 
most toys do not make it into a second season 
one reason theres lots of junk 
but quality isnt the only criterion some entries are undone 
only by outrageous circumstance the evel knievel doll did very 
well when it came out then it just fell apart said vogel of 
merrill lynch amp co he guessed that knievels 1977 guilty plea in a 
baseballbat assault didnt help the toy 
plain poor judgment kills other entries consider the illstarred 
golden girl and the guardian of the gemstones one of the biggest 
stiffs in the history of the business its manufacturer david 
galoob said monday 
the concept was action figures for little girls said galoob 
chief of lewis galoob toys inc there were 12 beautiful female 
warriors with shields and swords the trade bought in very very 
heavily 
and what we discovered was that little girls didnt want to 
play with warrior figurines 
other casualties of the toy wars are harder to explain barbie 
turns 30 years old this week dancing on the grave of a pretender 
named gem while gi joe marches on at 25 the inhumanoids a 
toady group from the center of the earth withered in the light of 
day 
why 
nobody knows 
that is the 64 million question in the toy industry and in 
most other industries said kirchberger of paine webber group 
inc nobody sets out to make a bad movie it just happens its 
the same thing with toys 
manufacturers are willing to enter the fray in hopes of capturing 
a chunk of the 128 billion annual toy business they trim losses 
by making models of most new toys holding back on fullscale 
production until orders come in 
still there have been some epic bombs viewmaster ideal group 
inc is still scratching its head over michael jacksons zoo a 
menagerie of stuffed animals inspired by the rock stars 
predilection for offbeat pets 
he even went on tour with his chimp so we tried said 
viewmasters jeremy jacobs we had the chimp appearing in stores 
in southern california we had quite a few good promotions but we 
just couldnt move the product 
then there was mr game show a big hit at last years toy fair 
a goner now kirchberger gave the eulogy 
it was modeled after a tv game show there was a figure of a 
host he spoke hed ask you questions youd push buttons to 
indicate your answer hed tell you if you were right or wrong and 
how much you won 
very clever wrong price point wrong idontknowwhat mr

traders had anticipated 
on other markets crude oil futures climbed higher despite 
rumblings of increased production by both iran and the united arab

on the new york commodity exchange with the contract for delivery

pound nearly four weeks ago and has declined steadily since as 
supply tightness has eased and labor problems in the key producing 
nations of chile and peru have been resolved 
any time inventories rise its bad news but the trade was 
looking for a rise in stocks of between 1000 and 3000 tons at the 
lme and what they saw was somewhere in the neighborhood of 7300 
instead said john oconnell of refco inc that put some 
downside pressure on the market 
crude oil futures rose in the wake of a big decline late last 
week but traders said there was little news to explain the runup 
theres really no news and the vague blurbs we did here that 
iran was increasing production that the uae would be above quota 
next month both were actually bearish said jim ritterbusch 
vice presidenttrading and research for carson petroleum co in 
chicago 
i think most of the buying today might have come because the 
market didnt break he said and it points up that were in a 
choppy sideways market casting around for some real news

rain in south america helped depress prices 
without any significant export business announcements prices in 
the wheat and corn pits slid lower in sympathy 
wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 425 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents

president bush opened a campaign for his 
sensible ideas federal budget monday in new hampshire the state 
that revived his flagging campaign for the presidency one year 
earlier 
although bushs fiscal 1990 budget is under attack among 
congressional democrats for lacking specifics on spending cuts bush 
gave no hint in his speech to the business and industry association 
of new hampshire that the plan might be in trouble 
sensible ideas work the president told a manchester nh 
audience of about 1200 people we can do the job without taxes 
added bush who has repeatedly promised to fight any new taxes 
however sen warren rudman rnh who hitched a ride back to 
washington with bush on air force one told reporters a tax increase 
of some form might be needed next year 
no promise is forever rudman said he predicted a good 
three months of heavy slugging on the budget 
the president said his appearance was only the first in a series 
of stops around the country on behalf of his 116 trillion spending 
plan which calls for restraints on defense spending but more money 
for education environmental cleanup the homeless and other 
domestic programs 
on wednesday bush will fly to columbia sc to address a joint 
session of the state legislature on friday he is expected to speak 
in st louis 
on monday bush attended the swearing in of his housing and urban 
development secretary former rep jack kemp 
bush told a roomful of hud employees he is committed to equal 
housing opportunity for all our citizens and strong enforcement 
of laws to end discrimination 
he said he wanted to change the misguided policies that had 
seen whole neighborhoods boarded up and reiterated his support 
for full funding of the socalled mckinney bill to help combat 
homelessness 
kemp who said home ownership is the most vivid symbol of the 
american dream pledged to help lead an all out public and 
private effort to help end the appalling tragedy of homelessness 
kemp said there will be two touchstones of hud the first 
to adhere to the very highest standards of integrity ethics and 
the law 
second we all must keep our minds our work and our hearts 
focused on those we are meant to serve not just the home builder 
but the home buyer not only public housing authorities but the 
public housing resident not just mayors and city managers but the 
poor and those who live temporarily on the streets or in shelters 
meantime on capitol hill bushs budget director richard darman 
met for nearly two hours with the chairman of the house and senate 
budget committees he rejected criticism of the bush budget by those 
complaining it didnt spell out every detail of where cuts might be 
made 
we recognize in the end we have to negotiate with the 
congress he said details left unspecified were those not as 
important to the president and the new administration wants to 
demonstrate were not rigid he said 
i think the white house is being more conciliatory compared 
to the reagan white house said sen jim sasser dtenn chairman 
of the senate budget committee 
about 96 billion in domestic spending cuts were not specified 
in the bush budget darman said last week 
asked about taxes after mondays meeting he said the subject 
didnt come up at our meeting 
sasser said darman will meet again tuesday with him and reps 
leon panetta dcalif and thomas s foley dwash panetta is 
chairman of the house budget committee and foley the house majority 
leader 
the participants all said the meetings are akin to briefings and 
not negotiations something the congressional leadership has not 
yet agreed to begin 
bush stopped in manchester nh on the way back to washington 
from a vacation weekend at his seaside retreat in kennebunkport 
maine 
he had grateful words for new hampshire and its voters saying 
his victory in the states republican primary on feb 16 1988 
gave me the chance to pick myself up off of that canvas 
reminiscing about the campaign bush said a year ago about 
this time i came to new hampshire under quite different 
circumstances i had just lost in iowa i was up at 650 am my 
first morning here holding my coffee in one hand and shaking the 
hands of some of the guys at the factory with the other 
the columnists had begun to write my political obituary he 
added 
new hampshire gov judd gregg joked that he wanted to extend to 
bush a welcome back on his regular february visit former new 
hampshire gov john sununu now bushs chief of staff was seated 
behind bush on the stage 
turning to his budget proposal bush said our plan is a 
realistic one it is a budget plan that will work but not with 
business as usual it will require a partnership with congress 
bushs speech highlighted most major features of his budget plan 
however he did not mention one of its more controversial components 
a reduction of the tax on capital gains which include profits 
from the sale of stock homes real estate and other assets 
he contends such a tax break would actually raise revenues by 
spurring business investment however democratic critics have called 
it a tax benefit mostly for the rich and have disputed the claim of 
increased revenues 
as he had in his first major policy speech to congress last 
thursday night bush promised to work day and night with 
congress in coming to agreement on a plan that meets budget targets 
there are some areas in which we would all like to spend more 
but we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order and bring the 
deficit down bush said

federal regulators took control of midwest 
federal savings amp loan association on monday amid an fbi 
investigation of two of the executives of the thrift minnesotas 
secondlargest 
the federal home loan bank of des moines declared midwest federal 
insolvent and appointed the federal deposit insurance corp as its 
conservator under an interagency program announced by president bush 
last week 
it was the 11th savings and loan in the country to fall under the 
intervention program aimed at stemming the tide of losses in the 
nations thrift industry 
midwest federal chairman harold greenwood jr and its managing 
officer charlotte massica were named last week by us attorney 
jerome arnold of minneapolis as among the targets of an fbi 
investigation into possible fraud at midwest federal 
greenwood massica and two other midwest federal officials 
resigned monday federal officials said 
asked if the four executives had been fired spokesman hassan 
honarmand of the des moines homeloan bank said you draw your own 
conclusions the new management team wanted to make a fresh start 
honarmand did say however that auditors for the des moines bank 
had not uncovered any illegalities at midwest federal 
honarmand said greenwood and other midwest federal executives 
were cooperative greenwood who has an unlisted home telephone 
number could not be reached for comment 
greenwood in the past has denied any wrongdoing by himself or any 
other any officer or employee of midwest federal 
thurman c connell president of the des moines bank said 
midwest federal will continue to operate normally while federal 
regulators determine the extent of its financial difficulties and 
devise a plan to solve them 
martha gravlee deputy director of communications for the federal 
home loan bank board said the most likely scenario for rescuing 
the thrift would include the use of federal funds 
minneapolis banker carl pohlad has proposed acquiring midwest 
federal with federal assistance while others also have expressed 
interest in bidding for the thrift 
midwest federal has 34 billion in assets and 23 billion in 
deposits 
according to the des moines bank mondays action was 
precipitated by a report from auditors that in the fourth quarter of 
1988 midwest federal lost about 200 million from loans it 
purchased from green tree acceptance corp a former midwest federal 
subsidiary 
green trees chief financial officer john brink said in an 
interview monday that he didnt understand how midwest federal could 
lose that amount on the loan package 
it certainly isnt fair to blame all of midwest federals 
problems on green tree acceptance brink said 
honarmand said the full amount of red ink at midwest federal will 
not be known until an audit of 1988s books is complete in a few 
weeks

the chicago mercantile exchange charged monday 
that journalists covering a federal tradingfraud investigation had 
trampled upon and smeared the integrity of the worlds two 
largest futures exchanges 
the mercs board of governors said in a statement that the 
disclosure of the probe on jan 19 had sparked a media frenzy 
that had inflicted possibly irreversible damage on the futures 
industry 
the unbridled race by some in the media to print and broadcast 
the most sensational and outlandish scrap of information has 
resulted in a denigration of all traders regardless of guilt or 
innocence the exchange said 
most importantly it has viciously trampled upon and smeared 
the integrity of two chicago institutionstheir officials and 
their members in a manner that is unconscionable the exchange 
said 
the statement was signed by merc chairman john geldermann and 
merc executive committee chairman leo melamed 
the merc said neither it nor the rival chicago board of trade 
were targets of the investigation 
the probe is believed to be focused on allegations that as many 
as 100 traders and brokers at the two exchanges systematically 
cheated customers out of millions of dollars in profits on contracts 
for future deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeans to 
treasury bonds 
federal authorities in chicago have refused to comment on the 
investigation no indictments have yet been issued 
the merc said it would hold meetings this week to update members 
on its comprehensive review of the exchanges trading rules and 
practices the review launched in reaction to news of the 
investigation is not slated for completion until at least late 
march

an increase in us semiconductor orders caused a rise in the 
closely watched booktobill ratio for january which reached 
10 according to figures released by the semiconductor industry 
association the figure was 93 in december

reality and makebelieve mingled monday at the 
annual american international toy fair as hundreds of toymakers 
touted their 1989 offerings to buyers from stores around the country 
as usual many manufacturers recruited colorful characters to 
catch the eyes of buyers and grab some free publicity 
a rifletoting george bush lookalike hawking a new board game was 
only a few feet from authentic protesters airing gripes against war 
toys while reallife olympic star florence griffith joyner pitched 
a new flo jo doll and developer donald trump made a 
publicityseeking appearance on behalf of a new board game bearing 
his name 
nearby on the fifth avenue sidewalk a unicycleriding clown and 
a lifesized green turtle thats human life not amphibian life 
were among the crowd patrolled by police 
the doyen of fashion dolls had a gala all her own monday night a 
shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front of lincoln center for 
1200 guests attending barbies pink jubilee 
several stage and television celebrities paid tribute to barbie 
during a show commemorating her 30 years as a successful doll new 
york mayor edward koch sent her some fan mail 
barbies appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes 
her a great toy for new york a city which draws unique energy from 
its unparalleled ethnic diversity koch wrote in his letter 
elaborate promotions have become a tradition at toy fair where 
each year an estimated 5000 new toys debut countless items on 
display here will never make it to store shelves and many 
muchtouted toys of 1988 were absent as the 10day trade show opened 
its doors monday 
amid all the hoopla the industry reported business improved 
modestly in 1988 after several disappointing years 
i believe i speak for many in the industry who feel encouraged 
by the performance of manufacturers in the past 12 months and are 
optimistic about prospects for the future said thomas j 
kalinske chairman of the toy manufacturers of america inc 
one of the best omens is that publiclyheld toy companies seem to 
have reversed their bad fortunes of 1987 kalinske said at a news 
conference 
together those companies lost about 120 million in 1987 last 
year the same companies probably earned profits of around 120 
million according to the trade association 
retail toy sales rose to an estimated 1275 billion in 1988 from 
125 billion in 1987 the associations figures dont include the 
roughly 23 billion in revenue for video games last year most of 
which are foreign made 
although retail toy sales were virtually flat the industry 
reported a 39 percent pickup in sales at the wholesale level 
manufacturers shipments rose to 855 billion from 823 billion 
another good sign is that retailers are finding more customers 
shopping for toys all year instead of only during the prechristmas 
buying binge kalinske said 
a perennial problem for toymakers has been the reliance of their 
balance sheets on seasonal shopping if economic activity 
temporarily falls off ahead of christmas and causes consumers to 
spend cautiously toy makers revenues are endangered 
in an effort to coax customers into buying toys throughout the 
year manufacturers have emphasized items that appeal to adults as 
well as children sociologists say this an astute marketing strategy 
because families increasingly seemed to be staying home and engaging 
in group activities 
last years popular games such as pictionary or previous 
successes such as trivial pursuit benefited from this trend 
manufacturers also have had to account for the aging of the us 
population which is shrinking the market for childrenonly toys 
but among the biggest challenge for the us toy industry is 
competition from video games by far the biggest selling items over 
the past two years 
while stores have reaped handsome returns from video games such 
as the nintendo game system the sales steered money away from other 
toys mostly boys items 
but some observers think that will change 
i think the fad is concentrated with boys ages 6 to 15 and 
its my belief that segment is saturated said toy analyst paul 
valentine of standard amp poors corp
